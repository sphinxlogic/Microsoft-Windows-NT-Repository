1  Online Disk Space Monitor (ODSM) Description

	______________________________________________________________________
1.1	Overview

	The main function of the ODSM is to generate warnings when disks have
	exceeded a pre-defined usage limit, thereby enabling timely
	investigation of the event to determine if the growth in usage is
	likely to be a problem and possibly cause production tasks to abort
	due to a lack of disk space.

	For situations where disks are dual-ported, the ODSM also has the
	ability to detect disks that are found on the wrong host (HSC) and
	can attempt to force the disk back to its preferred host.

	The ODSM will also report on any disks that exist in its database but
	do not exist on the system, possibly due to a disk failure, or a disk
	incorrectly being dismounted.

	The ODSM can also verify the labels on the disks against those in its
	database.

	In a VAXcluster environment, the ODSM should only be run on one node.

	______________________________________________________________________
1.2	ODSM Components

	The ODSM consists of two programs: a monitor, which runs as a detached
	process; and a maintenance program, to maintain the database.

	The programs reside in the ODSM_EXE area and the database can be found
	in the ODSM_DATA area:

		Monitor		ODSM_EXE:ODSM_MONITOR.EXE

		Maintenance	ODSM_EXE:ODSM_MAINTAIN.EXE

		Database	ODSM_DATA:ODSM_DISKS.DATA
	
	Communication with the detached monitor process is achieved by using
	the INTERRUPT program.  See Chapter 2 for details of how to
	communicate with the monitor process.

	The location of the database file can be changed by using the logical
	ODSM_DISKS which should be defined system wide before invoking the
	monitor and maintenance programs.

2  The Monitor Program

	______________________________________________________________________
2.1	Overview

	The monitor program runs as a detached process and is usually started
	during normal system startup.  This process checks the usage on each
	of the disks in its database every 5 minutes and broadcasts a message
	to the operator console (OPA0:) if it detects any event that requires
	action.  Currently the events that will generate a message are:

	    o	a disk has exceeded the maximum threshold set for the disk

	    o	a disk is below the minimum threshold set for the disk

	    o	a disk exists in the database but was not found on the system

	    o	a disk exists in the database but is not mounted

	    o	a disk was found on a host other than that defined in the
		database

	    o	a disk has a label different to that defined in the database

	______________________________________________________________________
2.2	Communicating with the Monitor

	Communicating with the detached process is via a permanent mailbox
	which has the logical ODSM_MAILBOX assigned.  The INTERRUPT program
	should be used to send messages to the mailbox.  Attempting to use any
	other means to write messages to the mailbox will simply mean that the
	messages are ignored.  The following discussion assumes that the
	symbol TELL has been defined to be "$wherever:INTERRUPT".

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3	Monitor interrupt commands

	The general format of the commands is:

	    $ TELL ODSM <command>

	All commands sent to the ODSM will result in a response being sent to
	the originator of the command, if done from an interactive session, or
	to the operator console (OPA0:) if the command was generated by a
	non-interactive process.

	Commands are parsed from left to right until the end of the command is
	reached or an error occurs.  If an error is found, all commands prior
	to the error can be assumed to have been processed and acted upon.

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.1	SHOW STATUS

	The SHOW STATUS command will result in a message being displayed on
	the terminal of the sender showing the current status of the action
	flags.

	Format:

	    $ TELL ODSM SHOW STATUS


______________________________________________________________________________

2  The Monitor Program (cont.)

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.1	SHOW STATUS (cont.)

	Example:

	$ TELL ODSM SHOW STATUS
	%INTERRUPT-S-SUCCESS, message delivered to ODSM_MAILBOX
	##########  ODSM_Monitor X2-006  23-FEB-1994 13:08:37.11  ##########
	  Maximum checking is ENABLED, Minimum checking is ENABLED
	  Missing checking is ENABLED, Host checking is ENABLED
	  Path forcing is ENABLED, Label checking is ENABLED

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.2	ENABLE

	The ENABLE (and DISABLE) commands determine what action, if any, the
	monitor process takes when it encounters an event as described
	earlier.  Regardless of the settings of the flags, the monitor will
	always check for events.  For all events except path forcing, the flag
	setting simply determines whether or not a message is broadcast.  The
	state of the path forcing flag will determine whether the monitor
	actually attempts to force a disk to a preferred path.  Multiple flags
	can be enabled or disabled in the one command, and on the completion
	of command processing a SHOW STATUS is executed to show you the
	current flag settings.

	Valid action keywords are:

	    MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MISSING, HOST, PATH and LABEL

	Format:

	    $ TELL ODSM ENABLE action [ action ... ]

	Examples:

	$TELL ODSM ENABLE ALL DISABLE PATH
	%INTERRUPT-S-SUCCESS, message delivered to ODSM_MAILBOX
	##########  ODSM_Monitor X2-006  23-FEB-1994 13:08:37.11  ##########
	  Maximum checking is ENABLED, Minimum checking is ENABLED
	  Missing checking is ENABLED, Host checking is ENABLED
	  Path forcing is DISABLED, Label checking is ENABLED

	The same result could have been achieved by the following command;

	$TELL ODSM ENABLE MINIMUM MAXIMUM MISSING HOST LABEL DISABLE PATH

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.3	DISABLE

	See the discussion on the ENABLE command for details of what can be
	disabled.

	Format:

	    $ TELL ODSM DISABLE action [ action ... ]

2  The Monitor Program (cont.)

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.4	STOP

	The STOP command is equivalent to performing a DISABLE ALL command.

	Format:

	    $ TELL ODSM STOP

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.5	START

	The START command is equivalent to performing an ENABLE ALL command.

	Format:

	    $ TELL ODSM START

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.6	RESTART

	The RESTART command is used to tell the monitor process to exit and
	re-run the monitor program.  This would normally only be used to start
	a new version of the monitor process without having to exit the
	current process and then execute the startup procedure again.
	A message is broadcast to the originator of the request, and also to
	the operator console, advising that the command has been received and
	that the monitor is restarting.  This will also reset all action flags
	to the default setting i.e. ENABLE ALL.

	Format:

	    $ TELL ODSM RESTART

	Example:

	$ TELL ODSM RESTART
	%INTERRUPT-S-SUCCESS, message delivered to ODSM_MAILBOX
	##########  ODSM_Monitor X2-006  23-FEB-1994 13:08:47.72  ##########
	  Restarting, as requested by SNEDDON_D [DBS_00CF1, pid=20E099CF]

	______________________________________________________________________
2.3.7	EXIT

	The EXIT command is used to tell the monitor process to terminate and
	is normally only used during system shutdown.  A message is broadcast
	to the originator of the request, and also to the operator console,
	advising that the command has been received and that the monitor is
	exiting.

	Format:

	    $ TELL ODSM EXIT

	Example:

	$ TELL ODSM EXIT
	%INTERRUPT-S-SUCCESS, message delivered to ODSM_MAILBOX
	##########  ODSM_Monitor X2-006  23-FEB-1994 13:08:47.72  ##########
	  Exiting, as requested by SNEDDON_D [DBS_00CF1, pid=20E099CF]

3  The Maintenance Program

	______________________________________________________________________
3.1	Overview

	The maintenance program is used to add disks to, and delete disks from
	the database used by the monitor, and to change threshold values and
	host information as usage patterns change or load balancing requires
	disks to be moved from one host to another.  All changes take effect
	immediately and are used the next time the monitor process scans the
	database.

	The following discussion assumes that the symbol ODSM has been defined
	to be "$ODSM_EXE:ODSM_MAINTAIN".

	Whenever the maintenance program is run, it displays a header which
	includes the program version, and the name of the file being updated.

	______________________________________________________________________
3.2	Maintenance Commands

	                           ____________________________	In the following examples, all user input is underlined.  The word
	DEVICE can be used as a synonym for the word DISK, and the words
	LABEL, NAME and VOLUME are synonymous.  The commands ADD and SET
	perform the same function i.e. if the disk named does not exist, then
	a new recorded is added to the database, if it does exist, then it
	will be modified.  In all cases except when specifying the device, the
	keyword NONE can be used to remove any existing value.  Note that
	specifying NONE for a minimum is the same as specifying 0, and that
	specifying NONE for a maximum is the same as specifying 100.

	Consult the section on Shadow Sets for recommendations on settings for
	shadow set virtual units and physical members.

	______________________________________________________________________
3.2.1	ADD DISK

	The ADD DISK command is used to include new disks in the database. See
	the description of SET DISK for a full explanation.

	Format:

	    ADD DISK device[:] [LABEL volumename] [HOST hostname]
				[MINIMUM min] [MAXIMUM max]

	______________________________________________________________________
3.2.2	SET DISK

	The SET DISK command is used to change the current information defined
	for a disk.  This command will also ADD a disk if the disk you have
	specified does not already exist in the database.  If you specify one
	of the keywords shown below, you must also supply a value or an error
	message will be generated.  If you omit all the optional keywords, the
	program will display the current settings for that device.
	No checking is performed at this stage to determine if "device:" is
	valid, any problems will be picked up the next time the monitor runs.

	Format:

	    SET DISK device[:] [LABEL volumename] [HOST hostname]
				[MINIMUM min] [MAXIMUM max]

	         ____	Maintain exit

	______________________________________________________________________
3.2.3	DELETE DISK

	The DELETE DISK command is used to remove disks from the database.

	Format:

	   DELETE DISK device[:]

	Example:

	  ____	$ odsm
	ODSM_Maintain X2-005
	Updating SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS.STARTUP.WEST]ODSM_DISKS.DATA;
	         ____________________	Maintain delete disk $1$dua28
	Deleted   $1$DUA28:          DISK_28      HSC002       0% - 60%
	         ____	Maintain exit

	______________________________________________________________________
3.2.4	SHOW DISK

	The SHOW DISK command will produce a display of ALL disks in the
	database, showing device, disk label, host name, minimum and maximum
	threshold values.  To see an individual disk, use the SET DISK command
	and omit all the optional keywords.

	Format:

	    SHOW DISK

	Example:

	  ____	$ odsm
	ODSM_Maintain X2-005
	Updating SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYS.STARTUP.WEST]ODSM_DISKS.DATA;
	         _________	Maintain show disk
	  $1$DUA0:              SYSTEM        HSC001    50% - 60%
	  $1$DUA14:             NOVEL         HSC004   100% - 100%
	  $1$DUA17:             PROSYS        HSC001     0% - 35%
	  $1$DUA2:              ALLIN1        HSC003     0% - 50%

3.2.5	SHOW BY DEVICE | VOLUME

	The SHOW command will display the disks using the device name as the
	sort key by default.  By using the SHOW BY VOLUME command, the disks
	will be displayed using the volume name as the sort key.  A SHOW
	command without specifying the sort key will use the last choice as
	the default until a new sort key is chosen.

4  Guidelines for Shadow Sets

	______________________________________________________________________
4.1	Overview

	Shadow sets consist of a virtual unit (a $alloc$DUS device for Phase I
	shadow sets or a DSA device for Phase II shadow sets) and one or more
	physical devices.  Information such as the number of free blocks is
	only maintained for the virtual unit and is not available for the
	physical units.  Other information such as the host name is not
	available for Phase II shadow set virtual units but is available for
	the physical units.  On encountering a shadow set virtual unit, the
	monitor program will not attempt to use any host information in the
	database and will therefore not attempt to perform any path forcing.
	Path forcing is not supported for shadow set virtual units.  When a
	shadow set member is encountered, the monitor program will always set
	the preferred path for the disk but will only perform path forcing on
	Phase II shadow set members since this function is not supported for
	Phase I shadow set members.

	______________________________________________________________________
4.2	Recommendations

	When setting up shadow set virtual units in the ODSM database, you
	should specify the volume label, minimum and maximum values.  Either
	use HOST NONE or omit it from the command.

	When setting up shadow set members in the ODSM database, you should
	specify the volume label (for ease of maintenance, it lets you see
	which physical devices belong to which virtual units), the host name
	and either MINIMUM NONE MAXIMUM NONE or omit these from the command.
