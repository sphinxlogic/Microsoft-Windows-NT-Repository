<a name="index_x_25"></a> 
    Using the items in this menu, an overview of the various networks  
    can be obtained. This section is under construction (hard hats must  
    be worn at all times and is closed to the public).

<a name="heading_3.3.8"><h2>3.3.8 System menu</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_26"></a> 
    This section is used to monitor and debug the system. Each menu  
    item in the system menu shows a specific aspect of the system.  
    Most of these tools will not be useful to a normal user but may be  
    helpful to the system manager should problems occur on your  
    system. Many of the tools presented here were used as  
    development tools and remain useful in quickly isolating problems  
    either within EMU or demonstrating that problems are external.

<a name="heading_3.3.8.1"><h3>3.3.8.1 Monitor Listener</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_27"></a> 
     The main Listener and PSR interface is presented  
    as a continuously updated real-time monitor. The display appears  
    as follows:

</pre> 

<br> 
<br> 
The display is interpreted as follows:  

<ul> 
  <li> 
    Event flags are flags used throughout the system to signal events.  
    Normal operation has only the top flag permanently set and on  
    occasion you will notice some flags changing rapidly. If any flag  
    other than the highest on remains set (not 0) it usually indicates  
    the process associated with this flag is no longer responding.  
    Report this to software support.  
  <li>Queued is the number of buffers queued to Ethernet. As long as  
    this remains above 0 all is well. If it reaches 0 and remains  
    there there is a serious problem with the system. Report this to  
    software support.  
  <li>Lowest is the lowest number of buffers queued at any 1 time. This  
    will normally start at the number queued and progress towards 0 as  
    the system uses resources.  
  <li>Error. The number of Ethernet read errors. This should always be  
a  
    very low number (less than .001% of completions. Note there is a  
    bugette here - the count regularly goes up for unknown reasons and  
    there is no other known impact.  
  <li>Cmplt - Completions. The number of Ethernet reads. The Listener  
is  
    reading every frame on the Ethernet and the display updates 1 per  
    second so the rate this number rises at is the number of frames  
    per second currently on the segment EMU is attached to.  
  <li>IOSB error. The number of times the Listener successfully  
received  
    a frame but the frame was in error. This should always be 0. If  
    this number rises there is either a fault on the local LAN (most  
    likely) or serious EMU system fault (Less likely) or an operating  
    system fault (Least likely).  
  <li>Processed. The listener discards most frames read as being not  
    useful to EMU purposes. This includes any frame containing user  
    data. The remaining frames are processed for network management  
    information. This count is the number of frames processed and this  
    number, expressed as a ratio of Completions gives a rough picture  
    of the efficiency of the attached LAN.  
  <li> 
    Frame errors. Each Ethernet frame is validated and any errors  
    found are recorded here. They are: Multicast source. A frame was  
    received with a multicast source address. This is not allowed by  
    Ethernet rules and can trigger a broadcast storm. It cannot be  
    determined who sent the frame. Zero Source. A frame was received  
    with the top 3 bytes of the address set to 0. This is not a valid  
    Ethernet address. Zero Destination. Same as in Zero Source. Zero  
    PTY. The protocol type in the frame was 0. This is meaningless as  
    this type is not defined. No station acting in accordance with  
    Ethernet rules will receive this frame.  
  <li>The remainder of the display shows the processors that are  
active.  
    Each processor has it's own set of counters and are interpreted as  
    follows:  
<br>    

  <ul> 
    <li>Name.   Is simply the name this processor is known by.  
    <li>Status. A bit pattern showing the current processing status.  
    Only the bottom 3 bits are used:

    Notes:  

  <ol> 
    <li> Type checked. This processor receives frames  
                    only of the type specified in PSRTBL  
    <li>All traffic. Most processors receive only  
                    multicast traffic. If this bit it is set it  
                    receives all traffic on that protocol type.

<a name="heading_3.3.8.2"><h3>3.3.8.2 Monitor PSRs</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_28"></a> 
    PSRs are the Protocol Specific Routines. There is 1 for each  
    protocol EMU processes. The display appears as follows:

</pre> 

<br> 
<br> 
    The display has been compressed in this example to fit on the  
    page. It is interpreted as follows:  

<ul> 
  <li>Name. The Name (Usually the protocol name) the routine is known  
by.  
  <li>Rec. The number of frames the PSR received from the Listener.  
  <li>Ret. The Number of frames processed and returned to the Listener.  
    This should always be equal to Rec.  
  <li>Fmterr. Format error. A fame with unexpected format. Usually this  
    is cause by a device sending a faulty frame. If the number rises  
    dramatically, it can indicate the processor is faulty. Report this  
    to software support. Not in the above display the high number  
    being reported by IPX. This is being investigated.  
  <li>Comm. The number of command buffers received. Internal processes  
    can send commands to PSRs to affect their processing.  
  <li>Err. The number of error messages this processor has written to  
    the error log. If this number rises quickly, a review the error  
    log should indicate the problem. If the problem cannot be        
    understood or rectified, please contact software support.  
  <li>NoIPC. No Inter Process Communication Buffer. EMU processes  
    communicate using a common buffer pool. If a process requests a  
    buffer and none are available this event is counted. A small (Less  
    than 5 per hr) number is expected. These counts are used in the  
    auto tuning process and often a restart of EMU will retune the  
    system and alleviate this problem.  
  <li>Alt. The number of Alerts this processor has raised.  
  <li>Rlt. The number of relater frames this processor has sent.  
Relater  
    frames carry information that one processor determines is 'of  
    interest' to another. This information is relayed in Relater  
    frames.  
  <li>Name. No longer used.  
</ul> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.8.3"><h3>3.3.8.3 Monitor Probes</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_29"></a> 
    Probes are the  
    processes that interrogate cooperating nodes on the network for  
    configuration and performance data. Currently EMU supports SNMP  
    for IP addresses, CMIP for OSI addresses, NICE for DECnet, MOP,  
    LAT and Ethernet protocols. This display charts the amount of data  
    EMU is adding to the network and is displayed as follows:  

<p><pre> 
    Probe                 Sent     Receive       Error    NoRespose  
  
 SNMP                     10424        9215         472        1250  
 CMIP                      1364        2301         742          82  
 NICE                        95         539           0          20  
 MOP                        139         139           0           0

</pre> 

Note the LAT processor reads only from the local node - it does not  
send  
any data across the network. The same is true of the Ethernet probe.  
<br> 
<br> 
    The display is interpreted as follows:  

<ul> 
  <li>Name. The name the probe is known by.  
  <li>Sent. The number of queries sent by the probe  
  <li>Receive. The number of good responses received  
  <li>Error. The number of responses received indicating an error in  
    either the request or the response. Each response of this type is  
    logged in the error log.  
  <li>NoResponse. The number of frames sent that received no response.  
</ul> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.8.4"><h3>3.3.8.4 View Sections</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_30"></a> 
    EMU builds a number of internal databases in memory sections.  
    Selecting this item displays a further menu of sections that can  
    be viewed directly.  
    For most sections there is a standard format displayed. The  
    display is split into 3 parts:  

<ul> 
  <li>Top level. Gives information about the section being viewed  
<br>    
            Entries: The number of physical entries in the section  
<br>    
            Recsize: The size of each entry  
<br>    
    Max Entries: The maximum number of entries the section will  
    currently contain. If this number of entries is reached, the  
    controlling process gains exclusive access to the section, writes  
    it out to a file, deletes the section, creates a larger section  
    and restores the data. It then releases access to the system.  
  <li>PID: This is the internal identifier EMU uses to target a  
particular  
    process, and therefore it's section. This PID relates to the Event  
    Flags in the Listener display.  
  <li>Middle Level: Not currently used.  
  <li>Main Level. Each PSR section displays the standard header and  
then  
    the PSR specific data. The common part is documented here.  
  <li>Common Header:  

  <ul> 
    <li>Flags: This is the PID of this process  
<a name="index_x_31"></a> 
    <li>Boxid:This is a number generated internally and used to relate  
the  
    various protocols found on the network to the various devices  
    detected. Throughout this system a BOX is synonymous with a  
    single physical device. Thus a router, PC or VAX are all BOXes  
    with a single BOXID associated  
    <li>Ptypbits. A bit pattern indicating the protocols  
    detected on this device. A bit set in this field corresponds to  
    the PID of a protocol this device is running. That is to say, if  
    bit 12 is sent in this field, EMU has determined that protocol 12  
    (Ethernet) is running on this device.  
    <li> Control. A bit pattern  
    indicating the status of this record. Currently 3 bits are used to  
    indicate:  

    <ul> 
      <li>Record is deleted. This area may be overwritten at any  
    time.  
      <li>Update. This record has been changed since list time the  
    corresponding probe updated the record. It will be updated in the  
    next cycle.  
      <li>NoPoll. Do not poll this device on this protocol. May  
    be set by the user or the system. The system will set this  
 bit if the device responds with any indication that  
       it does not allow logins.  
    </ul> 
    <li>Last. The last time EMU detected a frame from this address on  
this  
       protocol. If the last time recorded exceeds the Ageout for  
          this protocol, the record will be deleted.  
    <li>FST.  The first time EMU detected a frame from this address on  
       this protocol. Helpful when trying to determine events  
          around a particular incident. This event is always alerted.  
    <li>ALT.  Time last alert was sent for this device on this  
protocol.  
    <li>Status. Not currently implemented  
    <li>Accesses. The number of times this record was looked up. The  
     search is always done sequentially and during section build,  
     the records are sorted such that records accessed most often  
     are nearer the top of the section. This speeds up searching  
     dramatically. Note: Not really true. This was (and remains) the  
 intention but in fact, it is not implemented.  
    <li>Len. The length of the main lookup key in this section. The  
         location of the key is constant in all sections and combined  
      with this field, allows a single common search routine to  
         operate.  
    <li>    HowSet. How this device was found and the process that  
caused it  
     to be created. Changed as a result of other problems. This field  
 is now always set to the 'parent' protocol regardless of who  
 actually set it. Makes it a bit useless.  
    <li>    Current Readers. The number of process currently reading  
this  
     record. Combined with Current Writers, these fields are used  
     to organise access to the record so that any retrieval is  
     valid. That is a reader will not retrieve a half written  
     record and writers do not overwrite each other's data.  
    <li>    Updt. Time this device was last updated on this protocol.  
    <li>    Lpol. Last time this device was polled on this protocol.  
    <li>    Polls. The number of times this device was polled on this  
     protocol. This field along with Responses allows EMU to  
     determine if it should continue polling a device that is  
     unlikely to respond.  
    <li>    Interval. The number of seconds (Default = 3 days) between  
updates  
    <li>    Support. A bit pattern showing the various management  
functions  
     this device supports on this protocol. The pattern is  
     specific to the protocol.  
  </ul> 
</ul> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.8.5"><h3>3.3.8.5 Dump_Database</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_32"></a> 
     The database can be formatted and dumped.  
    Selecting this item displays a prompt for file name. If a file  
    name is entered, the dump is sent to both screen and file. If the  
    prompt is not answered, the dump is to screen only. Be careful  
    here - the database is usually quite long - 15,000+ lines will  
    normally be printed.  
<a name="index_x_33"></a> 
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.8.6"><h3>3.3.8.6 Trace</h3></a> 
    This is a debugging tool used to see in real time the  
    frames passed between EMU processes. Currently 2 processes support  
    the trace facility:  

<ul> 
  <li>EBUFFS. These are the buffers passed from the listener to the  
    PSRs. The trace shows these buffers as they are send from the  
    listener to the PSRs and the PSRs returning them to the listener.  
  <li>Relater. These buffers are passed from the PSRs to the relater  
    and are the controlling inputs to that process. Should any node  
    display incorrect relationships (like an address that it does not  
    have or the reverse), this trace can be used to find out why.  
</ul> 

<a name="index_x_34"></a> 
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.8.7"><h3>3.3.8.7 Scanner</h3></a> 
 The scanner process scans the database for parameters  
    collected from the network via polling that should appear in the  
    PSR level databases. A small database detailing which parameters  
    to search for and where to send them is controlled by this  
    interface. If you value your life, do not change these fields.  
    Incorrect entries in this database cause immediate and  
    irreparable brain damage to the system.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.8.8"><h3>3.3.8.8 Translate Tables</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_35"></a> 
    The network is parameter driven and the value of those parameters  
    is what EMU collects, analyses, stores and displays. Most  
    parameters are not in any form suitable for human consumption and  
    therefore must be translated. Most of the parameters in this area  
    are not documented in any central location nor is there any  
    definitive list. The tables provided are the best known to the  
    developers but cannot be guaranteed to be either complete or  
    correct. In this subsystem you can edit the source tables and  
    compile them into the system for use by the parameter translation  
    mechanism. There are currently 4 tables provided:  
<a name="index_x_36"></a> 

<ul> 
  <li>Netware SAP. This is a code showing the service(es) any Netware  
    node broadcasts and the correct translation of this is very useful  
    as it describes in a few words the major use of this device.  
<a name="index_x_37"></a> 
  <li>MOP Device. Any node supporting Digital's MOP protocol broadcasts  
a  
    frame describing itself on a regular basis. One of the parameters  
    is it's device type - again very useful in describing in a word or  
    two what this node is.  
<a name="index_x_38"></a> 
  <li>Ethernet type. Any protocol on the Ethernet must send it's frames  
    in Ethernet format. In the Ethernet format is a field describing  
    the protocol the application is using. One of the simple tricks  
    EMU pulls is simply reading that field for each frame and therefore  
    is able to list all the protocols any device runs. This table  
    translates the codes into meaningful words.  
+ 
<a name="index_x_39"></a> 
  <li>Ethernet UOI (Universal Organisation Identifier).  
    In simpler times, this field was known as the  
    manufacturer's code. Even more simply: The top 3 bytes of any  
    hardware address is a code showing the manufacturer of the

<h4><strong>+ </strong> Ethernet types are actually in 2 formats: Type  
II (a 2     byte type field) or IEEE (a 2 byte SSAP/DSAP).If DSAP/SSAP  
is     'AAAA' then it is extended Ethernet(a 3rd type!) and a 5 byte  
field is used.     The 5 byte field is in fact the 2 byte type coded  
with the UOI     prepended. If you find this confusing do not panic -  
it is not a     test of networking skills so much as a test of  
patience.</h4>

<a name="heading_3.4"><h1>3.4 Alert</h1></a> 
<a name="index_x_40"></a> 
    For a number of reasons (mostly performance and laziness) the user  
    interface to the ALERT subsystem is not implemented under the main  
    EMU menu system but is carried separately. This interface allows  
    you to monitor real time alerts and browse through previous alerts  
    conveniently. To start the alert interface:  
<br> 
$ ALERT  
<br> 
    This brings up a screen with a 3 item menu.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.4.1"><h2>3.4.1 Main Menu</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_41"></a> 
    The main menu in the alert system allows you to:  

<ol> 
  <li>Monitor. Selecting this item clears the screen and waits for  
    alerts from the system. As each alert is received, it is formatted  
    and displayed here. To return to the main menu, press Ctrl Z.  
  <li>Review. Selecting this item allows you to browse through the  
    alerts previously generated and logged. All alerts are logged to  
    the file EMU5_DAT:ALERT.DAT. It is advised to check the size of  
    this file on occasion as there is no mechanism to control it's  
    size and on an active (some say flaky) network many alerts can be  
    generated over a short time. Selecting this item brings up another  
    menu:  

  <ul> 
    <li>Since. Allows you to set the time from which previously logged  
    alerts are re-displayed. The format is in VMS standard absolute  
    time (DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS.CC) and any part missing from the input  
    will default to current time (though you MUST include the  
    separating characters. For example if you input '-- 13' you will  
    get all alerts since 13:00 (1 PM) from today. No input will  
    display all alerts from the time the alert logging file was  
    created - usually system start time.  
    <li>NodeName. Displays alerts only for the node specified.  
Wildcards  
    will be allowed once this section is finished - that is it is not  
    yet implemented.  
    <li>Class. Alerts are divided into classes: FAULT, CONFIGURATION,  
    ACCOUNTING, PERFORMANCE, SECURITY. This is the OSI standard  
    (FCAPS) arrangement and seemed such a good idea, we stole it.  
    In addition, EMU defines a SYSTEM category to allow the system  
    itself to report problems it believes need operator assistance.  
    In the current version, only CONFIGURATION alerts are generated.  
    Note this function is not yet implemented.  
    <li>Execute. Once the selection criteria has been set up (Currently  
    once time has been established) selecting this item causes the  
    selected alerts to be displayed 1 at a time in the screen. The  
    display screen allows 'next' and 'previous' alerts to be  
    displayed.  
  </ul> 
</ul>

<a name="heading_3.4.2"><h2>3.4.2 Alert Format</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_42"></a> 
<a name="index_x_43"></a> 
    All alerts are displayed in a standard format:  

<ul> 
  <li>Line 1 Shows the class of the alert and the device the alert is  
    for. If the system knows the name of the device it is used,  
    otherwise the address of the device is displayed.  
  <li>Line 2 shows the date and time the alert was received and the  
    subsystem that sent it. This will usually be a PSR(Protocol  
    Specific Routine)  
  <li>Line 3 will usually be the subclass. In the case of configuration  
    alerts there are 3 subclasses: ADD, DELETE or MODIFY.  
  <li>If there is additional information this follows and will normally  
    be a list of parameters that were added, deleted or modified.  
</ul>

<a name="heading_3.5"><h1>3.5 Utilities</h1></a> 
<a name="index_x_44"></a> 
    Utilities are those routines that are little used, not to be used  
    by the uninitiated or otherwise inappropriate to be included in  
    the main user interface. It is firmly advised that these routines  
    be well understood before use. The effect of misuse can be  
    anything from nothing to death by brain removal. In the  
    later case, the effect may be quite subtle with death taking a  
    long time and inflicting pain and frustration on all affected.

<a name="heading_3.5.1"><h2>3.5.1 Error Log</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_45"></a> 
<a name="index_x_46"></a> 
    The error log file EMU5_LOG:EMU_LOG.ERR is a typeable file (that  
    is you can type/print/edit it) that the system writes errors and  
    other significant information to. An extract of the file and  
    interpretation follow:  
<br> 

<p><pre> 
    %RELATR-W-VERADDR, 22-JUN-1998 11:50:00.08 RELATER Invalid Target  
    addr 002A54F4 For PID 0000000C From 00000006      
      -----------------------------------------------------------  
    %CFGMON-E-SNDALT, 22-JUN-1998 11:51:40.21 NETMON SEND_ALERT Error  
    00000601  
      -----------------------------------------------------------  
    %NODSCN-I-ADDIP, 23-JUN-1998 12:23:05.07 CFGMON Added node  
    171.144.141.128  
      -----------------------------------------------------------  
</pre> 

<br> 
    Notes:  

<ol> 
  <li>The first section is the facility(RELATR), message level (I =  
    Information, W = warning, E = Error) and short form of the error  
    message (VERADDR).  
  <li>The second part is the time and date the message was logged.  
  <li>The remainder is variable and is intended to provide a complete  
    picture of the problem (or not). The messages above mean:  

  <ol> 
    <li>    The relater received a frame containing an invalid address.  
The  
    MOP module (00000006) sent address 002a54f4 specifying it as an  
    Ethernet address. This is not a valid Ethernet address.  
    <li>The Network Monitor process sent an alert message that was too  
    large for the alert buffer. In EMU error messages, any time a  
    message contains the keyword 'Error', it is always followed by a  
    VMS standard error code. To translate this code type at DCL:  
<br>       
$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$MESSAGE("%X601")  
<br>       
    In this case, code 601 is buffer overflow.  
    <li>The NodScn process found another IP address and added it to the  
    database.
