    EMU (Ethernet Monitoring Utility) is a system that listens to the  
    attached Ethernet and records all addresses appearing on the  
    cable. For each address found it also records the protocols  
    enabled on that address and for selected protocols it can extract  
    information useful for network management purposes.  
    It then uses this database to locate other nodes in the wide area  
    network and initiate monitoring functions.  

<p> 
    Some of the basic features of the system follow:  
<a name="index_x_1"></a> 

<ul> 
  <li>The system is fully automatic. The system builds and formats the  
    database without operator assistance or intervention.  
    All monitoring and control subfunctions start and run without  
    intervention and in fact, no operator assistance is ever required  
    for normal operation.  
  <li>An alert screen provides the operator with timely reports on new  
    addresses appearing and for selected protocols, changes to  
    configuration parameters, fault reports and performance reports.  
  <li>A number of system management utilities are provided. These  
    utilities are all menu driven and self explanatory.  
  <li>A versatile reporting command allows the operator to extract  
    selected information to a user defined and formatted file.This may  
    be useful for input into other management tools and/or reports.  
  <li>A comprehensive query facility allows operators to view the  
    database contents.  Nodes can be selected by many criteria.  
</ul> 

    For details on what data is available and instructions on how to  
    extract it see the user guide section.

<a name="index_x_2"></a> 
   This is the 5th version of EMU and it's 3rd major rewrite.  
    While all the original goals and much of the code was retained,  
    both the architecture and the engineering have been greatly  
    expanded to reflect the ongoing changes in the networking world.  
    Most importantly, the principles that drove the design remained:  

<ol> 
  <li>Full automation. The system is designed to assist the user in  
    monitoring and managing the network, not the reverse as in many  
    current systems. All data in the database is derived from the  
    network; there is no user input possible at this level. This  
    ensures data integrity and eliminates the burden on the user.  
  <li>Full integration. The system maintains full cross referencing of  
    all addresses where there is sufficient information. While it is  
    necessary to implement each network as a separate entity, the user  
    sees only single devices attached to many networks, or many  
    networks with devices attached. This arrangement allows the system  
    to more effectively monitor any single device using the multiple  
    protocols it supports and allows more accurate and complete  
    reporting of any device.  
  <li>The system itself should require no maintenance. All processes  
are  
    self configuring, self monitoring and self tuning.  
  <li>The complexity of the network itself should be hidden. The system  
    should be fully usable by non-network personnel to extract useful  
    information; The simple question "How is the network performing?"  
    should be answered simply, completely and with qualification.  
  <li>The system will acquire and store sensitive information. It is  
    essential that this system incorporates controls that protect  
    this information, or even the fact of it's existence from  
unauthorised  
    disclosure.  
</ol> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_1.2"><h1>1.2 A Brief History of EMU</h1></a> 
<a name="index_x_3"></a> 
    EMU started life as a project to automate an early DECnet  
    management system provided by Digital. Once this was completed, it  
    was expanded out to include some of the other Digital tools then  
    available and the result was an unwieldy mass of DCL procedures  
    that none the less proved the possibility of unburdening the  
    network manager from the task of managing the system that was  
    intended to save time and effort. This set the first principle of  
    design: A network management system should tell the network  
    manager about the network, not the reverse.  
    One of the early problems found on all systems, including EMU was  
    the need to poll the managed devices constantly in order to  
    acquire the information necessary to manage it. In extreme cases  
    substantial resources are used just to manage and often the tool  
    intended to solve problems became the problem. In order to  
    alleviate this the concept of listening was developed. All major  
    network schemes implement a protocol that is used to maintain the  
    integrity of the network. In most cases they pass information  
    about nodes or networks that can be reached, nodes that have  
    stopped responding and in some cases, service names and other  
    useful information. By listening to this conversation, a fairly  
    complete picture of any network can be gained without adding data  
    to the network. This, though much more difficult to implement  
    became the second principle: A network management system should  
    be part of the solution, not part of the problem.  

<p> 
    The next stage was to recode the logic into programmes and it was  
    about that time that the major systems that we use today came  
    out (SunNet manager, HP Openview, Netview and DECMCC) and the EMU  
    effort would have ended there had any of these systems adhered to  
    these (to us!) most basic of principles. The time saving achieved  
by  
    using the system to monitor the network was used up by having to  
    monitor the system itself. A further problem was that while all the  
    manufacturers claimed multivendor capability the claims in some  
    cases were a bit thin and in no case was integration achieved. For  
    example DECMCC had a DECnet module, a TSM (Terminal Servers) and  
    an SNMP module all which worked but internally did not  
    intercommunicate. Thus should a node fail all the individual  
    modules reacted independently without regard for each other. It  
    was apparent at the time that this failure not only complicated  
    the interface and the network manager's task but had this  
    integration been included, the system could then use it's  
    understanding of the various protocols present to enhance it's  
    usefulness. For example, should the DECnet module report a failure  
    on a node, the first action the manager would normally take is to  
    access the node on an alternate protocol to determine if the node  
    is down or if DECnet has failed. As this is a routine effort, this  
    routine should be built into the system so that failures can be  
    reported more completely and in context. This became the third  
    design principle: EMU would take 2 views of the network equally.  
The  
    network as a collection of devices cooperating on 1 or more  
    networks and as a protocol in which many devices cooperate. It  
    is a subtle but essential distinction.  

<p> 
    The first 3 versions became experimental and proof of concept and  
    for version 4 an architecture was drawn up to guide a more formal  
    effort at implementing what was learned so far.  Version 4 was  
    successful in that it ran without major change for about 3 years  
    and it even managed some commercial success but changes in the  
    networking world began to overtake it. The most basic flaw was  
    that EMU assumed (accurately at the time) that each device on the  
    network had exactly 1 LAN address and this was used as the key in  
    all databases. As this became less and less true and EMU changed  
    to accommodate, it was clear that the original design was  
    inadequate. A decision to re-engineer the system became an  
    opportunity to re-architect it and remove some of the built in  
    restrictions. Most notable among these restrictions was the over  
    adherence to listening and not talking on the network. It was  
    clear that listening was a good mechanism to build the initial  
    picture but that polling was needed to complete it.  

<p> 
    To shorten this narrative to it's essentials, suffice to say that  
    in the 3 years since this decision was taken, 18 months was spend  
    exclusively on the architecture document with the remaining time  
    spend on coding and testing the implementation. The current  
    version implements about 60% of the architecture.  
<a name="instal"></a> 

<p><hr size=5> 
<a name="chapter_2"><h1>Chapter 2<br>Installation</h1></a> 

<p> 
<a name="index_x_4"></a> 

<ol> 
  <li>Create the root directory for the EMU system. This can be on any  
    disk at any level. The system resides in various directories under  
    this to a level of 3 max so make sure you do not create the root  
    at a depth greater than 4.  
<br>    
$CREATE/DIR disk:[emu]  
  <li>The files created in the next section will consume about 75,000  
blocks of  
disk space. The running system will (very dependant on the size of your  
network)  
will consume a further 50,000 - 100,000 blocks.  
  <li>Set default to this directory and backup the saveset:  
<br>    
$BACKUP/LO Tape:[...]*.*;*  
  <li>Edit [.SRC]EMU_LOGICALS.COM  and replace the first executable  
line  
    with the device and directory you created in step 1. Remember to  
    include the final '.' in the directory spec as this will become a  
    rooted logical.  
  <li>Execute EMU_LOGICALS.COM:  
<a name="index_x_5"></a> 
<br>    
$ @[.SRC]EMU_LOGICALS  
  <li>Ensure you got the expected effect:  
<br>    
$SHO LOG EMU*  
<br>    
    You should see a list of directories under the directory you  
created  
    in step 1.  
<br>    
$DIR EMU5_SRC:  
<br>    
    You should see a list of .MAR files  
  <li>All being well set default to EMU5_SRC: and execute BUILD:  
<a name="index_x_6"></a> 
<br>    
@BUILD  
<br>    
    Answer 'YES' to the question 'Compile all subroutines (YES/n)'  
  <li>The system will then build the necessary libraries  
  <li>A number of warning messages will be displayed during  
compilation.  
    These can be ignored as long as the process continues to  
completion.  
  <li>When finished (Maybe 20 min or so) answer 'YES' to the question  
<br>    
    Compile all programs? (YES/n)  
<br>    
    This will build the system on the current version of VMS on the  
    current architecture.  
  <li>A number of warning messages will be displayed during  
compilation.  
    These can be ignored as long as the process continues.  
  <li>All EMU processes run under the system account. Ensure this  
    account has the required quotas. A copy of one that works appears  
    at the end of this list.  
  <li>Ensure LAT, DECnet and UCX are all started.  
  <li>Ensure LATCP can see all services:  
<br>    
$MCR LATCP SET NODE/USER=ENA=0-255  
<br>    
    The LAT processor will see all LAT devices on the net but updates  
    from the local (VMS created) database. If the above is not done,  
    EMU will likely find LAT nodes that VMS knows nothing about.  
  <li>Finally, start the system:  
<br>    
<a name="index_x_7"></a> 
@EMU_SRC:START_EMU  
<br>    
    You may clear the databases and start fresh each time you start  
    the system by answering 'y' and confirming this to the prompts.  
    For excessive safety, on the first startup, do this.  
<br>    
    You may clear the log files on each startup. Generally a good idea  
    (after review). There is no mechanism to control the size of these  
    files automatically and while generally well behaved can, on  
    occasion become churlish.  
</ol> 

    Following is a snapshot for a system account that EMU works with.  
    The most important quota is BYTLM. The listener enables  
    promiscuous mode and saves as many frames as possible in the  
    driver. This requires a LOT of BYTLM. There are undoutably more  
    optimum settings for the others.

    Note: EMU enables promiscuous mode on the local Ethernet device  
    and attempts to read every packet on the cable. In most  
    environments this causes very high I/O on the system and often  
    results in significant impact on the node. It is strongly  
    advised to run it on a standalone, dedicated VMS system.  
    Any valid VMS system with a working copy of UCX is adequate.

<a name="chapter_3"><h1>Chapter 3<br>User Guide</h1></a> 
    This chapter describes in detail how to start and stop the system,  
    monitor it's progress and the various utilities used to extract  
    information.  

<a name="heading_3.1"><h1>3.1 Starting the system</h1></a> 
<a name="index_x_9"></a> 
    To start the system issue the command:  
<br> 
$@EMU5_SRC:START_EMU    
<br> 
    The procedure provides an option to restore all saved files or  
    clear them and build a new database. The default is to reload  
    all saved files.  
<br> 
    EMU will then start all the processes required and after a few  
    seconds it will exit back to DCL.  

<a name="heading_3.2"><h1>3.2 Stopping the system</h1></a> 
<a name="index_x_10"></a> 
    To stop the system:  
<br> 
$ @EMU5_SRC:STOP_EMU  
<br> 
    This deletes the EMU_CONTROL process which in turn triggers all  
    other EMU process to shutdown. All database files and sections are  
    saved to disk files in EMU5_DAT:

<a name="heading_3.3"><h1>3.3 User Interface</h1></a> 
<a name="index_x_11"></a> 
  The user interface is entirely menu driven - there are no  
    commands to learn. The menus provide comprehensive access to all  
    EMU facilities and data. In addition to the menus there are a  
    number of utilities (described in the Utilities section) that are  
    run as separate procedures. Each menu item is described in the  
    following sections.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.1"><h2>3.3.1 Menu system overview</h2></a> 
    To start the user interface type EMU at the DCL prompt. The main  
    menu then appears.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.1.1"><h3>3.3.1.1 Menu Security</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_12"></a> 
    The menu items are controlled by the security system - that is if  
    appropriate privileges are not owned by the user, some items do not  
    appear. Note that the default privileges are used - the privileges  
    the user has currently  enabled are ignored, the system only  
    checks the privileges owned. The required privileges are  
    detailed in the menu description sections.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.1.2"><h3>3.3.1.2 Getting help</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_13"></a> 
    The system supplies a comprehensive help facility and can be  
    accessed by pressing the help key (on a Digital Keyboard or the  
    equivalent on others) in any menu. Simply select the menu item  
    help is required on and press the help key.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.2"><h2>3.3.2 Main menu</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_14"></a> 
    The network can be seen as a collection of devices on 1 or more  
    networks or a network and it's collection of devices. EMU supports  
    both views.  
<br> 
    There are 3 items in the main menu. In all cases, selecting an item  
    from this menu displays a further menu.  

<ol> 
  <li>Device. This items allows querying and reporting on devices.  
    There are no privileges required to display this item.  
  <li>Network. This items allows querying and reporting on networks.  
    There are no privileges required to display this item. This is  
    not yet implemented.  
  <li>System. This item allows access to the system  
    management/monitoring facilities. If the user does not have OPER  
    privilege, this item is not displayed and access to the underlying  
    facilities is barred.  
</ol> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.3"><h2>3.3.3 Device menu</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_15"></a> 
    There are no special privileges need to access these menu items.  
    From this menu, the user may select:  

<ol> 
  <li>Query. Allows access to the live database. Using a further menu  
    the user selects individual devices to display.  
  <li>Report. Allows access to the reporting subsystem. Here the user  
    may create, define and view device reports. See reporting menu for  
    details.  
</ol> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.4"><h2>3.3.4 Device Query menu</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_16"></a> 
    In this menu, the user selects devices to display. Regardless of  
    how the device is found, the display is always the same: all data  
    for the device become accessible. For each of the following items,  
    selection issues a prompt asking for appropriate input. Standard  
VMS  
    Wildcards are allowed. The appropriate  
    database is searched for matches. Any found are displayed one at a  
    time until no more match. Within the display, menus allowing  
    control of direction and content are presented.  
    There are no special privileges need to access these menu items.  

<ol> 
  <li>Name. A nodename or any part of a nodename with Wildcards is  
    input. A nodename may be up to 400 printable characters in length.  
  <li>LAN. Either an address or protocol type can be input. In the case  
    of an address the user must input in form:  
<br>    
      xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx      
<br>    
     where x is either a hexadecimal digit or wildcard.  
<br>    
        The protocol type query is not yet implemented.  
  <li>IP. An IP address, or any part is input in form:  
<br>    
     ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd  
<br>    
     where ddd is a decimal digit in range 0-255  
  <li>DECnet. A DECnet address or any part is input in form:  
<br>    
     aa.nnnn  
<br>    
    where aa is a decimal number in range 1-63 and nnnn is a decimal  
    number in range 1-1023.  
</ol>

<a name="index_x_17"></a> 
    Each device found (if any) are displayed in common format. The  
    screen is split into 3 parts:  

<ol> 
  <li>Top section displays the device. If a name is known the name is  
    displayed, if not, the address is used.  
<br>    
    The class and device are also displayed. These fields are not yet  
    implemented but in the released version, these will correspond to  
    a user settable field showing relative importance and generic  
    device type such as bridge, host, router etc.  
<br>    
    Once a particular protocol is selected, the time the device was  
last  
    heard and the time the device was last updated on the selected  
protocol  
    are displayed.  
  <li>Control menu. 2 fixed items are followed by the list of supported  
    protocols this device runs. The two fixed items are:  
<br>    
    Next. Display the next device matching the search string.  
<br>    
    Previous. Display the previous device matching the search string.  
<br>    
    Protocol list. For each EMU supported protocol this device runs, a  
    menu item is displayed. Selecting any protocol item displays  
    either the parameters for this protocol or a further  
    menu of the tables in this protocol. The number of parameters in  
    some protocols can be quite large so EMU defines each parameter as  
    belonging to a table. Selecting any table displays the parameters  
    associated with it.  
  <li>Main Section. The parameters are formatted and displayed here in  
    standard format:  
    Parameter name    : Parameter value  
</ol> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.5.1"><h3>3.3.5.1 Parameter Display</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_18"></a> 
    The display of any parameter is controlled by:  
<a name="index_x_19"></a> 

<ul> 
  <li>Security. Each parameter has associated with it the VMS privilege  
    required to view it. If the user does not have the requires  
    privilege, the parameter is not displayed.  
  <li>Level. Each parameter is defined as a 'level of interest' in  
range  
    0-5 (0 being most interesting and 5 being least). A hidden menu  
    (described in next section) controls the level of reporting. Any  
    parameter below the current 'level of interest' is not displayed.  
  <li>Parameter name and formatting are predefined but you are free to  
    change this with the PARAMTBL utility. (which see)  
</ul> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.5.2"><h3>3.3.5.2 Hidden Menu</h3></a> 
<a name="index_x_20"></a> 
    While in the query display, if you press CTRL / a menu appears  
    allowing:  

<ul> 
  <li>Logging. A prompt for file name appears at the bottom of the  
    screen and all further data to screen is also written to this  
    file. This is a 'flip-flop' selection; If logging is on and this  
    is selected it is turned off, if it is off and then selected, it  
    is turned on. Note that each time it is turned on, a new file is  
    created.  
  <li>Report level. You can set the 'level of interest' described above  
    here. Selecting the 2nd item displays a further menu used to set  
    the level:  

  <ol> 
    <li>Summary. The lowest level. Only those parameters defined as  
'most  
    interesting' are displayed. Generally this would include only names  
    and addresses.  
    <li>Brief. Names, addresses and those considered major parameters  
are  
    displayed.  
    <li>Normal. All but the most obscure parameters are displayed.  
    <li>Full. All parameter that can be formatted are displayed.  
    <li>Verbose. All parameters are displayed. If there is no  
formatting  
    available for a parameter, a default translation is applied.  
    Note that the level any parameter is defined in can be changed  
    with the PARAMTBL utility.  
  </ol> 
<a name="index_x_21"></a> 
<a name="index_x_22"></a> 
  <li> 
    Update. Normally whenever a node is updated, it is then set to  
    update again in 3 days. Once a display is started, selecting this  
    forces this node to be updated on this protocol on the next cycle.  
    In the case of LAN  (MOP, LAT, SCS, IPX) protocols this will most  
    likely happen within 10 - 15  seconds. In the case of WAN  
    protocols (IP, DECnet, OSI) this may take as long as 30 - 45  
    minutes.  
</ol> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.3.6"><h2>3.3.6 Reporting menu</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_23"></a> 
    The reporting menu allows the user to define, create and display  
    reports. Reports are generated from report parameter files created  
    by the user and formatted as a 'spreadsheet' where all matching  
    parameters are in columns. For example:  
    A parameter file specifying IP address and DECnet address finds 3  
    nodes and would format as follows:  
<a name="rptoutp"></a> 
<p><a name="table_3-1"></a> 
<table border> 
  <caption><strong>Table 3-1 Report Output</strong></caption> 
  <tr> 
    <th align=center>IP Address </th> 
    <th align=center>Decnet Address </th> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>1.2.3.4 </td> 
    <td>50.1&#185;</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>1.2.3.5 </td> 
    <td> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>1.2.3.6 </td> 
    <td> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td> </td> 
    <td> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>1.4.5.6 </td> 
    <td>50.3&#178;</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td> </td> 
    <td> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>1.4.5.7 </td> 
    <td>50.2&#179;</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
    <td>1.4.5.8 </td> 
    <td> </td> 
  </tr> 
</table> 

<ol> 
  <li>This node 1 has 3 IP addresses and 1 Decnet address  
  <li>This node 2 has 1 IP addresses and 1 Decnet address  
  <li>This node 3 has 2 IP addresses and 1 Decnet address  
</ol> 

<a name="index_x_24"></a> 
    The items in the reporting menu are as follows:  

<ol> 
  <li>Display Reports. Displays a menu of previously created reports.  
    Selecting any item causes the selected report to be displayed in  
    the TPU editor. The report may be edited using all standard TPU  
    features. A new version is always created. Upon exit from TPU, the  
    user may elect any combination of keeping or discarding the new  
    version and purging or not all old versions.  
<br>    
<strong>Note: The call to TPU always creates a new file unless the user  
explicitly 'quits' out of the editor. For this reason the system  
assumes a new version is always created. If you quit out of an editing  
session be very careful how you answer the delete and purge  
questions!</strong> 
  <li>Load Saved List. Displays a menu of all previously created report  
    parameter files. These files define the contents of any report.  
  <li>Create new list. Created report parameter files. Menus of EMU  
    supported protocols, their tables and parameters are displayed.  
    Selecting a parameter adds it to the list. Selecting a parameter  
    already in the list removes it from the list.  
  <li>Save Current. Saves the currently loaded report parameter list to  
    a file. The user is asked for a report name. Enter ONLY a file name  
    (no type or extension). These files can then be LOADed.  
  <li>Create Report. A report is created using the currently LOADed  
    parameter file. A parameter file must have been previously created  
    or loaded.
