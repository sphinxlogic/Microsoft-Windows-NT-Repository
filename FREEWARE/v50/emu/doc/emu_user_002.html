<a name="index_x_47"></a> 
     Each parameter in the EMU database has an associated record  
    describing how to format it, the privileges needed to view it and  
    how the alert mechanism reacts if it is added, deleted or  
    modified.  

<p> 
    Each parameter is associated with a protocol and a table. In some  
    cases where there are multiple tables within a protocol, the table  
    names are also in this file and can be modified similarly to  
    parameter names.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.5.3"><h2>3.5.3 Operations</h2></a> 
    The start the program:  
<br> 
$ PARAMTBL  
<br> 
    A menu appears with 2 items:  

<ul> 
  <li>Parameters. Selecting this item allows you to view, change or  
    delete the characteristics of parameters.  
  <li>Tables. Selecting this item allows you to view, change or  
    delete the characteristics of tables. In the case of tables there  
    is only 1 characteristic - it's name. Note that changing the name  
    will prevent the help entry on this table name from working unless  
    the corresponding entry in the help library is also changed.  
</ul> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.5.3.1"><h3>3.5.3.1 Parameters</h3></a> 
    You may list, add modify or delete parameters. In all cases  
    selecting an item takes you through a menu structure of the  
    protocols and tables to find a particular parameter.  

<ul> 
  <li>List. This will list all that parameters in a particular table.  
    There are 5 columns displayed:  

  <ol> 
    <li>PRM. The parameter number.   
    <li>Keyword. This is the name that will be used when displaying  
this  
    parameter.  
    <li>Ctl/Rtn. This is the formatting indicator used to format the  
    parameter value for display. It is either an FAO directive or a  
    routine number.  
    <li>Flg. This is a bit pattern that controls whether the parameter  
should  
    be polled for and included in the database and if so, what the  
    alert mechanism should do when it is created, modified or deleted.  
    <li>LvL. The level this parameter is displayed at. In the user  
    interface the user may select displays from Brief to Verbose  
    displays. This number corresponds to the level.  
  </ol> 
  <li>Add. Adds a parameter to the file. <strong>This function  
should     only be used by developers. It is included here only for      
completeness.</strong> To add a parameter you need to  
    know:  

  <ul> 
    <li>The Table the parameter is in. Tables are either assigned  
    internally by the system or calculated from data received from the  
    network. Tables are found via menus that appear on the left of the  
    screen.  
    <li>The parameter number. Usually this is assigned by the protocol  
but  
    in cases where the protocol does not assign this, the system does.  
    All parameters have an assigned number and belong to exactly 1  
    table.  
    <li>Formatting. How this parameter is formatted. It is either by  
FAO  
    directive or routine. If the parameter cannot be formatted by a  
    simple FAO string (usual case) a routine is supplied. A menu of  
    available routines is presented on the left of the screen.  
  </ul> 
  <li>Modify. You may change any aspect of a parameter entry.  
<strong>Be careful and sure of what you are doing here -     changes  
here can have very subtle and undesired effects.</strong> If  
    Modify is selected a menu of protocols appears. Using this menu  
    will take you down through the table hierarchy to arrive at a  
    particular table. Once a table is arrived at you will be asked for  
    a parameter number. This parameter must already exist. To find  
    parameter numbers use the list function.  
    A brief explanation of each field you can change follows:  

  <ul> 
    <li>Security. A menu listing all VMS privileges is displayed.  
    Selecting any item causes the selected parameter to require the  
    user to have that privilege in order to view it's presence. That  
    is to say, if you select CMKRNL, the next time you view the  
    parameter list and you do not have the CMKRNL privilege, the  
    parameter will not be seen. Selecting an enabled privilege,  
    disables it.  
    <li>Keyword. This is the word or phrase this parameter is known by.  
    Any printable string up to 64 characters is allowed. If you change  
    the name of a parameter, the help entry will cease to work until  
    you also change the help entry in the help library. Instructions  
    on how to do this are provided in the Hints section.  
    <li>Formatting. Do not change this. If you do, software support  
will  
    yell at you when you tell them the system is broken. If you change  
    this, you will break the system.  
    <li> 
    Report Level. All parameters belong to a level in range 1-5.  The  
    level is used in displaying lists. In general the most  
    interesting parameters are 1 and the least interesting parameters  
    are 5. The display is controlled by the hidden menu on the query  
    display and correspond as:  

    <ol> 
      <li>Summary. The lowest level. Only those parameters defined as  
'most  
    interesting' are displayed. Generally this would include only names  
    and addresses.  
      <li>Brief. Names, addresses and those considered major parameters  
are  
    displayed.  
      <li>Normal. All but the most obscure parameters are displayed.  
      <li>Full. All parameter that can be formatted are displayed.  
      <li>Verbose. All parameters are displayed. If there is no  
formatting  
    available for a parameter, a default translation is applied.  
    </ol> 
    <li>Include in database. Whether or not to include this parameter,  
    when received in the database. If not included, it will not be  
    monitored or processed in any manner. Normally, most parameters are  
    included except for those which are very dynamic and are not  
    useful at this level. Examples of these are:  

    <ul> 
      <li>TCP connections in MIB-II. The list of addresses and ports  
currently  
    connected to this host.  
      <li>Bridge FDB tables. The list of MAC addresses and destinations  
in a  
    bridge.  
    </ul> 
      <br>    Both of these examples, are (in most cases) very long  
lists that  
    change rapidly. The result of putting them in the database is to  
    use a LOT of space up with data that is obsolete in minutes and  
    depending on how other parameters are set, will cause excessive  
    alerts. <strong>Be sure you understand the impact and use of      
any parameter before changing this field.</strong>Default is yes.  
    <li>Include in monitors. Essentially the opposite of include in  
    database. Monitors are intended to retrieve and display the  
    rapidly changing parameters. Monitors are not yet implemented.  
    Default is no.    
    <li>Alert on Create. Exactly that. When this parameter is created,  
    send an alert to that effect. Default is no.    
    <li>Alert on Modify. Exactly that. When this parameter is modified,  
    send an alert to that effect. Default is no.    
    <li>Alert on Delete. Exactly that. When this parameter is deleted,  
    send an alert to that effect. Default is no.    
  </ul> 
</ul> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.5.3.2"><h3>3.5.3.2 PARAMTBL Summary</h3></a> 
    This utility is very useful for customising your system at low  
    levels. With a few keystrokes you can change the way data is  
    displayed across the system and using the security facility, limit  
    access to a very fine degree. With power comes responsibility; Be  
    sure of what you are doing before you do it. As a safety, backup  
    the file EMU5_DAT:MAPPER.DAT before you make changes. If it all  
    goes horribly wrong, restore your backup.

<a name="heading_3.5.4"><h2>3.5.4 MIB compiling and Registration</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_48"></a> 
<a name="index_x_49"></a> 
<a name="index_x_50"></a> 
    MIBs (Management Information Base) are readable files produced by  
    the manufacturer of a device that supports SNMP (Simple Network  
    Management Protocol). At this writing SNMP is supported only in  
    the IP world. The MIB defines the parameters that the device  
    supports, how to access them, the format of the parameters and  
    (often) a short explanation of what it means.  

<p> 
    MIBS must be compiled before they are usable by the system. EMU  
    provides a compiler in 2 parts for a number of reasons:  

<ul> 
  <li>It is never advisable to edit a MIB although it is not unknown  
for  
    errors to be present in the MIB itself. Using the EMU MIB  
    compiler, you can edit the output of the 1st pass to correct any  
    errors of this kind.  
  <li> Simple is a relative term. At the protocol level SNMP is not  
    simple to implement although it is much simpler than many. At  
    parameter (MIB) level it is often too simple. A prime example of  
    this is how a MAC (Ethernet) address is specified; it is always  
    shown as an Octet String  - that is a string of bytes. Octet  
    strings are generally printable characters but in the case of a MAC  
    address this formatting does not work. EMU therefore redefines  
these  
    parameters using private definitions and therefore maintaining  
    correct output. Again, output from the 1st part of the compile can  
    be edited to correct these problems.  
</ul> 

<a name="index_x_51"></a> 
    The private definitions EMU defines are as follows. Note that they  
    are defined using the ASN.1 tags reserved for private data types  
    and therefore will not interfere with any existing or future  
    definitions contained in a valid implementation of SNMP.  
<a name="privdt"></a> 
<p><a name="table_3-3"></a> 
<table border> 
  <caption><strong>Table 3-3 EMU ASN.1 Private DataTypes</strong></caption> 
  <tr> 
    <th align=center>EMU Symbol </th> 
    <th align=center>Tag Value </th>

    <td>SNMP_ASN1E_BRIDID </td> 
    <td>197 </td> 
    <td> Bridge ID</td> 
  </tr> 
</table> 
    Note 1: These 2 types are used internally only. They should never  
    be edited into a MIB at any stage.  

<p> 
    There are a number of enhancements included in this compiler that  
    are not present in industry standard ones:  

<ul> 
  <li>The 1st pass extracts all the description fields and builds a VMS  
    standard help library. After registration this help library is  
    available to the user interface providing the user with access to  
    all parameter definitions in readable format. Because MIB  
    parameters are many and often have cryptic or obscure names, this  
    is seen as an essential service.  
  <li>The private definitions allow more precise and clearer display of  
    values than those that simply following the protocol.  
</ul> 

<br> 

<a name="heading_3.5.4.1"><h3>3.5.4.1 Usage Instructions</h3></a> 
    To compile a MIB and make it available for use follow these  
    instructions:  
<a name="index_x_52"></a> 
<a name="index_x_53"></a> 
<a name="index_x_54"></a> 

<ol> 
  <li>Ensure the MIB you want to compile is in EMU5_MIB: directory.  
MIBs  
    can normally be obtained by contacting the manufacturer of the  
    device via either the Web or FTP. EMU supplies many of the more  
    common MIBs precompiled and registered. To find which MIBs are  
    already available run PARAMTBL, Select Internet and the resulting  
    menu will display all registered MIBs. Other MIBs are simply  
    supplied and are located in EMU5_MIB:.  
  <li>Run EMU5_EXE:MIB_COMPILE1.The program will ask for the MIB name.  
    Enter it. This compile phase:  

  <ul> 
    <li>Opens the input file and creates the Help and output files  
    with the same name as the MIB and with extensions .HLP and MC1  
    respectively.  
    <li>IMPORTS all files specified in the IMPORT statements in the  
MIB.  
    These must exist and have been previously complied by this  
    routine. If any do not exist you are given the choice to continue  
    or exit. It is often a good idea to continue as much of the  
    IMPORTED information is not used. If at a later stage the program  
    is unable to define a parameter, exit the program, compile the  
    offending MIBs and start again.  
    <li>Extracts all definition statements and writes then out the the  
HLP  
    file.  
    <li>Builds the schema internally. See the hints section for a brief  
    description of the schema.  
    <li> Once the MIB is entirely read in, and if there were no errors  
    detected, the schema is written out to the .MC1 file, The Help  
    library is created and the help file just created is inserted into  
    the help library.  
  </ul> 
  <li>Run EMU5_EXE:MIB_COMPILE2.The program will ask for the MIB name.  
    Enter it. This compile phase:  

  <ul> 
    <li>Takes the MC1 file previously created and converts it to a form  
    usable by the system. It creates a file with the same name as the  
    MIB and extension .MC2. This is the file that the rest of the  
    system searches for when listing out available MIBs.  
    <li>The program displays it's progress by showing the number of  
lines  
    read/ written on the screen. If the program exits without error,  
    creation has been successful.  
  </ul> 
<a name="index_x_55"></a> 
  <li>Run EMU5_EXE:MIB_REGISTER.The program will ask for the MIB name.  
    Enter it. The program will determine if the MIB is already  
    registered and if so, you may replace it with the new definitions.  
    Otherwise it advises the number assigned to this MIB and includes  
    all definitions in EMU5_DAT:MAPPER.DAT. The MIB is now available  
    for the system to use on any device that supports it.  
  <li>After making any required adjustments to the system' usage of the  
    parameters just registered (see below for a hint), you then tell  
    the system which nodes to use this MIB on by:  

  <ul> 
    <li>In the main EMU user interface select a node supporting this  
MIB.  
    <li>Select IP protocol. If the device does not support IP, it does  
not  
    support any MIBs.  
    <li>The menu of available MIBs is displayed along with Set MIB  
Params.  
    Select 'Set MIB Params'  
    <li>A further menu appears. Select 'Set MIB'  
    <li>A menu of available MIBs appears. Each item is a toggle;  
    Selecting an already selected MIB deselects it and selecting an  
    unset MIB sets it. The Selected MIBs are shown in a bit pattern at  
    the top of the screen - each MIB has a corresponding bit in the  
    pattern that when set (to 1) indicates to the system to use this  
    MIB when updating this address.  
  </ul> 
</ul> 

    You can test this MIB with another utility that is also useful in  
    browsing the network: MIBWALKER.  

<p> 
    Note that by default all IP addresses are assumed to support MIB-II  
-  
    the basic MIB that most SNMP devices support - at least in part.  
    Internally to the system this is MIB number 1. DO NOT CHANGE THIS  
    DEFINITION. If this is the only MIB a device supports or the only  
    MIB you want to act upon a device then no action is necessary.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.5.5"><h2>3.5.5 MIBWALKER</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_56"></a> 
    A MIBWALKER is a generic program that allows you to retrieve and  
    display the results of data from a node supporting SNMP. A  
    number of conditions must be met before this will work:  

<ul> 
  <li>The device you are targeting must be running, attached to the  
    network and be prepared to respond to SNMP requests.  
  <li>You must use the correct MIB to talk to it.  
  <li>If the Device does not allow public access you must know the  
    community string it supports.  
</ul> 

    To run the MIB walker type 'MIBWALKER' at the DCL prompt. This  
    system wide symbol is set up at EMU start time. Note that EMU is  
    not required to be running in order to execute this routine.  
<br> 
    Running the program displays a menu on the screen:  

<ul> 
  <li>Set IP address. Select this item and enter the IP address you  
wish  
    to talk to. Wildcards or names are not allowed. In future, this  
    routine may be integrated with EMU to allow more friendly searches.  
  <li>Set MIB. Set the MIB you want to use on this device. A menu of  
    available MIBs is presented. Select one.  
  <li>Set Community String. By default the transactions will use the  
    public string. If the device does not accept this, select this  
    item and enter the community string the device uses. Selecting  
    this item and providing no input causes the public string to be  
    used. Note the string is case sensitive.  
  <li>Walk the MIB. This MIB walker is a bit unusual in that it does  
not  
    actually 'walk' the MIB. Selecting this item (after setting at  
least  
    the IP address and MIB) presents a menu of tables and items this  
    MIB supports. Selecting any item sends the appropriate request to  
    the device and if an answer is received, displays the results.  
    Pressing the HELP key anywhere in this menu invokes the help  
    system and displays and explanations of the associated parameters  
    available. Exit this menu with CTRL Z.  
  <li>Toggle Log file. Selecting this item turns logging on or off. If  
    logging is off it turns it on, if off, it turns it on. When on all  
    displays to the screen are also written to the file MIBWALKER2.LOG  
    in the default directory.  
</ul> 

    All the functions are independent. That is you can set the MIB and  
    switch between addresses or vice versa. It is often a good idea to  
    run this program after compiling and registering a MIB and noting  
    which parameters should be adjusted using PARAMTBL. For many MIBS  
    you may not want all the parameters (by default all will be  
    collected) or you may want to alert when additions, deletions or  
    modifications are detected on some parameters. By default no  
    alerts are generated.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.6"><h1>3.6 Errors and Omissions</h1></a> 
    This is the beta release of software. Some functions described in  
    the user guide are not implemented and others may not perform  
    exactly as expected. It is the purpose of this release to find  
    these errors, note the usefulness of the system as it stands and  
    to collect feedback for it's further development. This section  
    describes the known errors and some possible workarounds. These  
    are given in no particular order:  

<ul> 
  <li>Monitor Listen Display. The error count increments regularly. No  
    other symptoms found (that is there are no known errors).  
    Probable coding issue. No effect on system.  
  <li>On rare occasions the system does not shutdown fully. Before  
    starting the system it is a good idea to start the user interface  
    by typing EMU and the DCL prompt. If the error 'fatal controller  
    error' is returned, the system is fully shutdown. If not, wait a  
    few minutes and try again. If still not shutdown, locate the EMU  
    processes (all EMU processes have 'EMU_' as the 1st 4 characters  
    of their names) and 'STOP/ID' them. Note if this action is  
    necessary it is imperative that on next startup the databases are  
    cleared.      
  <li>DECnet IV PSR does not display on the MONITOR PSR display. Reason  
    unknown. No other known effect.  
  <li>User interface often hangs upon exit from trace facility. Control  
    Y the process and restart the interface. Will be fixed in full  
    release.  
  <li>Bridge Ids in the FDDI display are not translated correctly. The  
    selector wrongly assumes a specific table this is in. Will be  
    repaired in full release.  
  <li>System is prone to slowdown after running for about 10 days.  
    Cause is fragmentation of the database file which is in turn is  
caused  
    by excessive read/writes to it. A fix has been engineered and can  
    be expected in the full release. In the meantime, the file can be  
    reorganised using CONVERT on occasion. Note that the system must be  
    shutdown to do this.  
<a name="index_x_57"></a> 
  <li>Not all parameters are translated. The two main reasons for this  
are:  

  <ol> 
    <li>The parameter is not documented and requires reverse  
engineering  
    to determine what it is and how to translate it.  
    <li>The parameter is complex and requires special routines to  
format it.  
  </ol> 
    This is an ongoing exercise  
  <li>The hidden menu function that filters parameter display based on  
    'importance' is not effective largely because the parameters are  
all  
     set to the default of 0 (with the exception of MIB generated  
parameters  
     which are set to 3). The mechanism also needs some adjustment to  
filter  
     out untranslatable parameters. The task of revaluing the  
individual  
     parameters is left to the user at this point although the system  
may  
     provide more convenient templates in future.  
  <li>MOP sends too many relater frames. The MOP module acquires both  
the MAC  
    in use and the burned in MAC address on the card. There is no way  
for MOP  
    to determine if the hardware address has been passed to other  
databases  
    therefore always sends this information on each cycle. There is no  
    effect other than uselessly using a small resource. A fix is in  
progress.  
</ol> 

    A file EMU5_DAT:EMUBUG.DAT contains all known errors and fixes at  
    release time.

<a name="heading_3.7"><h1>3.7 Hints</h1></a> 
    This section is included to impart some uses of the system that may  
not be  
    immediately obvious.  
<br> 

<a name="heading_3.7.1"><h2>3.7.1 Further processing of Reports</h2></a> 
<a name="index_x_58"></a> 
    Reports are always generated as flat files and can be easily  
    formatted and manipulated using simple DCL procedures. Some useful  
    things to note:  

<ul> 
  <li>All data is presented as list with each parameter separated by a  
    vertical slash (|). The number of slashes present is always the  
    number of parameters less 1 - if a parameter does not exist there  
    is nothing between the slashes where it would be if it did. This  
    allows for very easy detection and extraction using the F$ELEMENT  
    lexical function in VMS and easy importing to Excel.  
  <li>The first parameter is always a number. The number itself has  
    little meaning but note that all parameters associated with a  
    single box always have the same number. Put more simply: When the  
    number changes, it is a different device. A number of example  
    report formatting procedures are in EMU5_RPT:.  
</ul> 

    EMU does not currently provide an interface capable of extracting  
    data conditionally. That is there is no way to say "Get all nodes  
    with names beginning with "TST" and having at least 1 IP address  
    that does not begin with "171". This is  however easily  
    accomplished by generating a report with all occurrences of the  
    parameters and writing a simple procedure (about 10 lines) to  
    apply the logic.

<a name="index_x_59"></a>

    There is no direct way to add an address to EMU but in the IP  
    section this can be done indirectly by 'pinging' the address. If  
    the node answers, it will be added to the database as the IP  
    module listens for and receives all ICMP frames (A 'ping' uses an  
    ICMP echo request and response sequence). It may be useful to keep  
    a procedure containing ping commands to important IP addresses and  
    run it at system startup as this will speed up finding further IP  
    addresses.

<a name="index_x_61"></a> 
    If, when using TSM to access a server and the connection fails, it  
    is often because another system is using the console port. The  
    message returned does not help to make this obvious. Within EMU,  
    find the server you are trying to connect to and force an update  
    using the hidden menu. Wait about 30 seconds and redisplay.  
    Assuming the update has been successful, (note the last update  
    time at screen top), the MAC address of the system connected to it  
    will be displayed as 'Console User'. Find this MAC address to  
    identify the system that 'owns' the console.
