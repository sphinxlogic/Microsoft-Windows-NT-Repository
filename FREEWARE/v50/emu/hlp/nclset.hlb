   Selection Weight

   The number of sequential incoming connects to
   be passed to this member node in the
   round-robin sequence before proceeding to the
   next member node in the sequence. A value of
   zero means this node is not eligible to receive
   incoming connections to this alias address.
   Selection Weight is used to apportion incoming
   alias connections according to the capacity of
   each alias member. Nodes with greater capacity
   should have larger values of Selection Weight,
   while local area VMScluster satellities should
   generally have a value of zero. Values between
   0 and 10 are suggested.

           NOTE

   The nsp maximum transport connection value
   determines the number of connections on an
   alias member. If the Alias Port is enabled,
   changing the nsp maximum transport connection
   value has no effect.

   communications mode is asynchronous, the
   default value of this characteristic is
   internal. Otherwise, the default value is
   external.

   The value of this attribute has no effect when
   the communications line is in loopback mode. In
   this case, the type of loopback determines the
   type of clock. You can modify this

   named software from unknown clients. Set this
   attribute to true if you wish MOP to ignore
   such requests.

  addresses

   Default: Empty set     Value: Set of LAN addresses

   Set of LAN addresses for this client on the

   For OpenVMS, Phase IV nodes can use an extended

   these addresses in the addresses set. To
   calculate the extended DECnet address, express
   the Phase IV node address as a four-digit hex
   integer, then add the prefix AA-00-04-00.

   For example, if the Phase IV node address is 4.260:

            4.260
    =>      4 * 1024 + 260
    =>      4356 (decimal)

   conforms. You cannot modify this
   characteristic.

    Default:  Segment flow control      Value:  Segment flow control

   Determines NSP flow control policy used. This
   attribute may not be changed when NSP state is
   "on."

   Flow control is the mechanism that determines
   when to send a Data or expedited messages. Flow
   control is performed separately for normal and
   expedited data. During transport connection
   formation, each end of the connection
   determines the kind of flow control policy it
   expects when acting as a data receiver. It is
   not required that both end operate with the
   same flow control policy.
    

   keepalive time

   Default for OpenVMS: 60	Value: 1-65535

   Time, in seconds, that NSP waits for data to be
   transmitted or  received before testing a
   transport connection. When this timer  expires,
   NSP sends a data request PDU to the remote NSP.
   This  PDU does not change the flow control
   parameters, but does require  acknowledgment. 
   For Digital UNIX, You can modify this
   characteristic to a lower value only when the
   entity is disabled.

   maximum receive buffers (OpenVMS)

   maximum transport connections. You can modify
   this characteristic to a lower value only when
   the entity is disabled.

   maximum transport connections

   Default for OpenVMS: 200	Value: 0-65535

   Maximum number of active transport connections
   allowed at one time. Must not be less than the
   current value of maximum remote  NSAPs. You may
   not decrease the value while NSP is enabled.

   maximum_window

   Default for OpenVMS: 8	Value: 1-2047
   
   Maximum credit window that can be granted on a
   transport connection.   This is used for
   control of the number of data segments (PDUs) 
   allowed to be transmitted over a particular
   transport connection  before at least one
   acknowledgment must be returned from the 
   destination system. If the number of PDUs
   already transmitted equals  the maximum window
   and no corresponding acknowledgments have been 
   received, transport stops sending PDUs over the
   transport connection  and waits for an
   acknowledgment message. You cannot modify this 
   characteristic.
    
    nsap selector 

    Default: 32		Value: 0-255

   NSAP selector used by the nsp entity when
   opening a port to a  network service.  You

1  OSAK

  disconnect timer

   Default: 30 seconds    Value: Time in seconds

   Length of time that the OSAK software waits
   when it expects the remote peer to disconnect a

   NSAP is shared between the Connection- Oriented
   Transport Service (COTS), and the
   connectionless transport protocol according to
   the osi transport attribute nsap selector. If
   both nsap selectors are 0 or 1, then COTS and
   CLTS over CLNS are disabled.

   This attribute cannot be set either to 32,
   which is the value of the NSP NSAP selector, or
   to the current setting of the osi transport
   attribute, nsap selector, if the attribute has
   a value other than 0 or 1.

   This attribute cannot be modified when
   transport is enabled.

   When operating over the Connection-Oriented
   Network Service (CONS), the maximum number of
   transport connections that can be multiplexed
   on any single network connection. This
   characteristic can be increased only when the
   transport entity is enabled. You can modify
   this characteristic to a lower value only when
   the entity is disabled. See X.25/CONS
   Configuration for more information.
 
   maximum network connections

                             
   Default for OpenVMS: (2 raised to the                                 
                          power of 32 -1)

   network service to cons or any (allowed for
   incoming connections only).

   o  In the new OSI transport template, check the

   Set of protocol classes that can be negotiated
   for use on a transport connection. If the value
   of the network service attribute is CLNS, the
   class must be a subset of the classes supported
   by the OSI transport attribute clns classes
   supported. If the value is CONS, the classes
   must be a subset of the classes supported by
   the OSI transport attribute cons classes

   attribute is ANY, the classes must be a subset
   of the combined classes in the clns classes
   supported and cons classes supported
   attributes.

   transport connection is made. If an inbound
   template cannot be found for an inbound
   transport connection, then the template called
   DEFAULT will be selected as the default. For
   the CLNS network service, the inbound template
   selected is the first template found that has
   the Inbound attribute set to true , the Network
   Service attribute set to CLNS, and the CLNS
   Inactive Area Address attribute set to empty
   set.

   For the CLNS network service (using the
   inactive subset, that is, null internet), the
   incoming template selected is the first
   template found that has the Inbound attribute
   set to True, the Network Service attribute set
   to CLNS and the CLNS Inactive Area Address
   attribute matches the Inactive Area Address
   attribute of the Routing Circuit entity that
   the transport connection is using. For the CONS
   network service, the inbound template selected
   is the first template found that has the
   inbound attribute set to true , the network
   service attribute set to CONS and the CONS
   template attribute (that is, an X.25 Access
   template name) matches the name of the X.25
   Access filter that was used to accept the
   inbound network connection.

   Value for OpenVMS: 1-(2 raised to the
   power of 32 -1)

   Amount of time, in seconds, to wait for an
   acknowledgment before retransmitting the first
   TPDU over the transport connection.
 

   keepalive time

   Default: 60            Value: 1-16383

   Time (in seconds) to be used for the window
   timer. When the transport service provider has
   no TPDUs to send over a transport connection,
   it retransmits the last AK TPDU at the
   specified frequency to prevent expiration of
   the remote NSAP's inactivity timer. This
   attribute is valid for protocol class 4 only.
 
   local nsap

   Default: System        Value: NSAP address
   dependent, determined
   at run-time

   A local NSAP address to be used by default if
   one is not supplied across the service
   interface.

   Default:  0            Value:  0-255

   When operating over CLNS, indicates network
   priority encoded in NPDU header for all
   transmitted packets. It may be used by
   intermediate  systems to assign the packets to
   queues of appropriate priority.


   network service

   Default: clns          Value: Any, clns, cons, or RFC1006
                                                    (OpenVMS)

   Type of network service. On Digital UNIX, the
   default template network service cannot be set

   is sent to Phase V (OSI) router adjacencies in
   CLNP packets, if possible.
