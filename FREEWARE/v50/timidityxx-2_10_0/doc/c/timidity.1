.SH NAME
TiMidity++ \- MIDI to WAV converter and player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timidity
[\-options] filename [filenames ...]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
TiMidity++ is a converter that converts some of MIDI files
( formats : Standard MIDI file (*.MID), Recomposer files (*.RCP, *.R36,
*.G18, *.G36) and Module file (*.mod) ) into formatted audio file
(ex. RIFF WAVE ).
TiMidity uses Gravis Ultrasound\-compatible patch files or 
Soundfonts( *.sfx, *.sf2 ) to generate digital audio data from MIDI files.
The digital audio data generated by TiMidity can be stored in a file for
processing, or played in real time through an audio device.
.br
In real time playing, TiMidity if able to show the lylic contained
in KAR file or WRD file.

.P
.SH FILENAME
You can use the following expressions in \fBfilename\fP fields
to specify the location of the file:
.TP
.B \-
Read a MIDI file from standard input.
.TP
.B /path/filename
Read a MIDI file on filesystems.
.TP
.BI dir: "directory"
.br
.ns
.TP
.B directory/
Read and play all MIDI files in specified directory.
.TP
.B Archive File
Extracts and play the file(s) in the archive.
If you want to specify a certain MIDI file in the archive,
describe the \fI#<MIDI\-filename>\fP expression following to the archive name.
The expressions after the \fI#\fP is allowed to use regular expressions
(case insensitive).

.RS
For Examples:
.TP
.B timidity "'file.zip#file.mid'"
Plays file.mid in file.zip
.TP
.B timidity "'file.lzh#*.mid'"
Plays any files that match the regular expression '*.mid' in file.zip
.TP
.B timidity "'file.tgz#*'"
This expression is same as
.br
\fBtimidity 'file.tgz'\fP
.PP
Since these mechanism are contained in TiMidity itself,
you can use it even if on MS Windows environment.

.sp
If these expression are applied to the *.cfg files, you can use
patch\-files or else on the remote machines.

.P
.SH INPUT FILE
Timidity can handle the following file formats:
.TP
\fB .MID\fP ( Format 0, 1, 2 )
Standard MIDI File
.TP
\fB .RCP, .R36, .G18, .G36\fP ( formats of Recomposer (products of COME ON MUSIC co.) )
Windows version converts these with \fIrcpcv.dll\fP.
.TP
\fB .KAR\fP ( Karaoke format )
Displays lylics same as Lylic Meta Event message.
.TP
\fB .MOD, MOD.*\fP ( module file )
.TP
\fB .WRD\fP ( WRD format )

.P
.SH OPTIONS
The following command line optinos are accepted by TiMidity:

.TP
.B \-A \fIamplification\fP
Multiplies the master volume by \fIamplification\fP %.
Default value is 70%.
The grater number of amplification makes louder sounds. 
Range of the amplification is from 0 to 800%.

.TP
.B \-a
Turns on antialiasing. Samples are  run  through  a
lowpass filter before playing, which reduces aliasing
noise at low resampling frequencies.

.TP
.B \-B \fIfragments\fP[,\fIbuffer-bits\fP]
For the Linux / FreeBSD / OSS / ALSA / Windows sound driver,
selects the number  of
buffer  fragments  in interactive mode.  Increasing
the number of fragments may reduce choppiness  when
many  processes are running.  It will make TiMidity
seem to respond sluggishly to fast forward, rewind,
and  volume  controls, and it will throw the status
display off sync.  Specify a fragments of 0 to  use
the maximum number of fragments available.

.TP
.B \-b \fImode\fP
(obsoleted)
.RE

.TP
.BI \-C " ratio"

Sets the ratio of sampling and control frequencies.
This determines how often  envelopes  are  recalculated 
-- small ratios yield better quality but use
more CPU time.

.TP
.BI \-c " filename"
Reads an extra configuration file.

.TP
.BI \-D " channel"
Marks channel as a drum  channel.   If  channel  is
negative,  channel -channel is marked as an instru-
mental channel.  If channel is 0, all channels  are
marked as instrumental.

.TP
.BI \-d " dir"
Specifies the directory contains installed dynamic-link interface modules.

.TP
.B \-e
Make   TiMidity   evil.   On  Win32  version,  this
increases the task priority by  one.  It  can  give
better  playback  when  you  switch  tasks  at  the
expense of slowing all other tasks down.

.TP
.BI \-E " mode"
Set TiMidity extend modes. The following modes are available
(capitalized switch means disable this feature):
.RS
.TP
.B w/W
Enables/disables modulation controlling.
.TP
.B p/P
Enables/disables portamento controlling.
.TP
.B v/V
Enables/disables NRPM vibration.
.TP
.B r/R
Enables/disables reverb effect controlling.
.TP
.B c/C
Enables/disables chorus effect controlling.
.TP
.BI c " ratio"
Sets the chorus effect value of all channels to \fIratio\fP.
.TP
.B s/S
Enables/disables channel pressure controlling.
.TP
.B t/T
Enables/disables tracing all Text Meta Events.
.TP
.B o/O
Accepts/rejects pronouncing multiple same notes.
.TP
.BI m " HH"
Sets the manufacture ID to \fIHH\fP ( \fIHH\fP is the two hex-digits ).
.br
In addition if \fIHH\fP is \fIGM/gm\fP , \fIGS/gs\fP or  \fIXG/xg\fP
that are same as to \fI41\fP , \fI43\fP and \fI7e\fP.
.TP
.BI B " bank"
Sets the bank number of all channels to \fIbank\fP.
.RE

.TP
.B \-F
Turns  on  fast  panning to accommodate MIDI pieces
that expect panning  adjustments  to  affect  notes
that  are  already  playing.  Some files that don't
expect  this  have  a  habit  of  flipping  balance
rapidly  between  left  and  right, which can cause
severe popping when the -F flag is used.
.br
In current versions of TiMidity this option are toggled.

.TP
.B \-f
Toggles fast envelopes. This option makes TiMidity do fast
but the release time of the notes are shorten.

.TP
.BI \-g " sec"
Open the Sound-Spectrogram window. This option is activated if
the system has support for X Window System.

.TP
.B \-h
Show this help message.

.TP
.BI \-I " voice" [/c]
Uses the program number as the default  instrument.
Any  Program Change events in MIDI files will override
this option.
.br
If the \fIvoice\fP followed by \fI/c\fP the default program number
of the channel \fIc\fP is specified by the \fIvoice\fP.

.TP
.BI \-i " interface"
Selects the user interfaces from the compiled\-in
alternatives. \fIinterface\fP must be begun with one of the 
supported interface identifiers.  Run TiMidity with
the \-h option to see a list.  The following identifiers
may be available: 
.RS
.TP

.PP
.TP
.B v
Increases verbosity level.  This option is cumulative.
.TP
.B q
Decreases verbosity level.  This option is cumulative.
.TP
.B t
Toggles trace mode.  In trace  mode,
TiMidity attempts  to  display  its
current state in real time.  For the
Linux  sound  driver, this is accomplished
through the use of short DMA
buffer fragments, which can be tuned
via the -B option.
.TP
.B l
Loop playing (some interface ignore this option)
.TP
.B r
Randomize file list arguments before playing
.TP
.B s
Sorting file list arguments before playing
.RE

.TP
.B \-j
This option enables to load the patch file while playing.

.TP
.B \-L " directory"
Adds \fIdirectory\fP to the library path.  Patch, configuration,
and  MIDI  files  are searched along this
path.  Directories  added  last  will  be  searched
first.   Note  that the current directory is always
searched first before the library path.

.TP
.BI \-n " degree"
Enables Noise Shaping Filter. \fIdegree\fP is from
\fI0\fP(min) to \fI4\fP(max).

.TP
.BI \-O " mode"
Selects the output mode from the compiled-in alternatives. 
mode must begin with one of the supported

Generate RIFF WAVE format output.  If output
is  directed  to  a non-seekable file, or if
TiMidity is interrupted before closing the
file, the file header will contain 0xFFFFFFFF in the RIFF and data
block length fields.  The popular sound conversion utility \fIsox\fP
is able to read such malformed files, so you can pipe data directly to
sox for on\-the\-fly conversion to other formats.

(like csh syntax) is not available.
.TP
.BI f="filename"
Uses \fIfilername\fP as WRD file.
.RE

.TP
.BI \-x " string"
Configure TiMidity by the \fIstring\fP. The format of \fIstring\fP
is the same as timidity.cfg.
.br

For example:
.br
\fB\-x'bank 0\\n0 violin.pat'\fP
.br
Sets the instrument number 0 to violin.

Character \fB\\\fP(Ascii 0x5c) in the \fIstring\fP is treated 
as escape character like C literal. For example \fB\\n\fP is treated
as carridge return.
.RE

.TP
.BI \-Z " file"
Causes the table of frequencies to be read from \fIfile\fP. This is
useful to define a tuning different from the occidental temperate scale.
