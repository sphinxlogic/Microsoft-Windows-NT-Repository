Knowledge Representation and Working Memory</P></B></I>
</FONT>


<P>Working memory is the dynamic, global database which encodes the problem a RuleWorks program is to solve and the current state of the solution. Different aspects of the problem are organized into different classes of information in working memory. Classes which store related information can be grouped into an inheritance hierarchy.</P>

<P>Each class contains a set of named attributes with their associated attribute structure and default values. Attribute structure is scalar (atomic) or multi-valued (compound).  Each instance of a class is called a working-memory object (WMO).  </P>

<P>As a RuleWorks program runs, WMOs are continually created, changed, and deleted.  In OPS5, every rule in a program could "see" (potentially match, change, or delete) every object in working memory. The advantage with RuleWorks is that when a given entry block is executing, the rules in that block are only able to see working memory which is in scope.</P>

<P><B>
<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=6><P>Object Class Hierarchy</B></P></FONT>

<P>RuleWorks allows classes directly to represent hierarchical categories of data. Object classes can inherit attribute names, attribute structure, and default values from a parent class. A parent class can have many subclasses, but each subclass can have only one immediate parent. This is called single inheritance as opposed to multiple. You can think of this graphically as a tree with branches and leaves.  The figure shows the inheritance tree of the object class PART in the sample program KIWI.</P>

<P>Inheritance from a parent class is declared in the INHERITS-FROM clause of the OBJECT-CLASS declaration of the subclass: </P>

<P> (OBJECT-CLASS <I>subclass-name</I> <BR>
(INHERITS-FROM <I>parent-class-name))</P>
</I>
<P>Because objects inherit membership in the parent class, objects match condition elements not only of their own class, but also of their <B>ancestor</B> object classes (their parents, and their parents' parents, and so on).  Thus, a condition element can ask for an object of a high-level class (such as OPTION), and be matched by instances of low-level subclasses (such as KIWICALC, BW-MONITOR, or MOUSE).</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><IMG SRC="../images/f2-1.gif" WIDTH=700 HEIGHT=600></font>

<P>Table 2-1 lists all the characteristics of object classes and attributes that can be inherited by a subclass. Default values can be <B>redefined</B> by a subclass; the declaration in the subclass overrides the declaration in the parent class for that subclass and for all classes inheriting from it. Attribute structure cannot be redefined; it is a compile-time error to try to redefine a scalar attribute to be compound, or vice-versa.</P>

<P>RuleWorks provides an implicit top-level object class called $ROOT.  Any object class that you declare without an explicit INHERITS-FROM clause is treated as though you declared the parent class $ROOT.  Figure 2-2 shows the implied hierarchy for the top-level user-declared object classes in the sample program KIWI.RUL.</P>

<P>The specificity of a class is measured by its distance from $ROOT in the inheritance hierarchy. Any top-level user-declared object class, such as those shown in figure 2-2 has class specificity of one.  Object classes SOFTWARE-OPTION and HARDWARE-OPTION, shown in figure 2-1 have class specificity of three.  Object classes HD-30 and HD-200 have class specificity of six.</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=5><P><B>Working Memory Objects</B></P></FONT>

<P>A working-memory object (WMO), sometimes called simply an object, is a collection of attributes each with some value (one or more atoms, or units of data) that represents a thing or concept and its associated characteristics. In addition to attributes with values, each object has a class name, an identifier, and a time-tag.  Figure 2-3 illustrates how objects are stored in working memory.</P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk" SIZE=2><P><B>Note:</B> The left-to-right order of the attributes shown in The figures do not necessarily reflect the actual internal representation. In RuleWorks you cannot depend upon the position of attributes in a WMO.</P></FONT>

<P>All WMOs inherit two read-only attributes from the built-in top-level class $ROOT: ^$ID and ^$INSTANCE-OF. These attributes store the instance identifier and class name of the WMO (see Object Identifiers and Class Name)</P>

<P>RuleWorks displays WMOs in the following format: </P>

<P><I>#id time-tag</I><B>( class-name [rule-name] [ {^attribute-name attribute-value} ...])</B></I></P>

<P>For example:</P>

</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>#297 2529 (PERSON [INIT-DB] ^GIVEN-NAME LARRY ^LAST-NAME KIRK ^CHILDREN (COMPOUND ALEXANDER ALICIA ANDREW) ^SPOUSE NINA)</P>
</FONT>

<P>RuleWorks does not include the names ^$ID and ^$INSTANCE-OF when it displays a WMO, but it does include the values of these attributes. RuleWorks does not display scalar attributes whose value  is NIL, nor compound attributes that have no elements, unless you have declared a default value for the attribute (see Default Value Declarations for more on default values).</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P><B>Object Identifiers</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>RuleWorks associates a unique identifier with each object when it is created.  This object identifier has the data type INSTANCE-ID.  Unlike the time-tag, which is updated each time the object is modified, the object identifier is guaranteed to remain unchanged during the life of the object.  Object identifiers are stored in a built-in, read-only attribute called ^$ID.  It is an error to attempt to modify ^$ID.</P>

<P>A variable bound to an INSTANCE-ID value is called an <B>ID variable</B>.</P>
<P>ID variables can be compared for identity or non-indentity, as in the following rule, but nothing else:</P>

</FONT>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P></B>Class Name</B></P></FONT>
<P>A <B>class name</B> is a symbol that identifies the class of which the object is an instance. Objects that are instances of the same class always have the same attributes, but the values of the attributes can be different.  The INSTANCE-ID and time-tag of each object are unique to that object.</P>

<P>Figure 2-4 shows seven different objects with the class name CONTEXT. Each of the seven has the same attribute, ^NAME, but each has a different value for that attribute.</P>

</FONT>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/f2-4.gif" WIDTH=397 HEIGHT=388></P>

<P>The class name of an object is stored in a built-in, read-only attribute named  ^$INSTANCE-OF. You can use this attribute on the LHS of a rule, but you cannot modify it.</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P><B>Time-Tags</B></P></FONT>

<P><B>Time-tags</B> are integers that the run-time system uses to determine recency during conflict resolution. You cannot match or modify time-tags. The run-time system assigns a unique time-tag to each object in working memory. The time-tag is automatically updated whenever the object is modified. Therefore, the object with the largest time-tag is the most recently created or changed.</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=6><P><B>Attributes</B></P></FONT>
<P>An attribute consists of the attribute operator (^) followed by an attribute name that describes a characteristic of the object class. Attribute names are symbols and are declared in the OBJECT-CLASS declaration.</P>

<P>Attributes can be declared in a parent class or in any inheriting subclass. For example, all components of the Kiwi-9200 share some attributes by virtue of  being a PART. These attributes (^PART-NUMBER, ^NAME, ^PRICE, and ^IS-EXPANDED) are specified in the OBJECT-CLASS declaration of PART and propagated down from PART to OPTION, to HARDWARE-OPTION and SOFTWARE-OPTION, and so on, by inheritance. The attributes that distinguish hardware from software are specified in separate OBJECT-CLASS declarations. (See Example 2-2)</P>

<P>Suppose you want to specify an object that has the class name KIWICALC, is distributed on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, has part number S-CA-9200, name KiwiCalc Spreadsheet Software, price $29.95, and a status flag whose value is YES. You can specify this object as shown in the example.</P>

<P>)</P>
</FONT>

<P>You can declare this object class as follows:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>(OBJECT-CLASS KiwiCalc</P>
<P>        (inherits-from KIWOS-APPLICATION))</P>
</FONT>

<P>In this example, all the attributes are inherited. For a detailed description of the <B>OBJECT-CLASS </B>declaration, see Chapter 3 of this manual.</P>

<P>Attributes are local to an object class and its descendants; you can use the same attribute name in unrelated object classes. For example, the attribute ^NAME is used in both of the following objects:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1>
<P>(CONTEXT ^NAME INPUT-ORDER)</P>
<P>(KIWICALC ^MEDIA-TYPE FD-35 ^NAME KIWICALC)</P>
</FONT>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4>
<P><B>Scalar Attributes</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>The value of a scalar attribute is a single atom (see the section Atoms). For example:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>^NAME |KiwiCalc Spreadsheet Software|</P>
<P>^PRICE 29.95</P>
</FONT>

<P>The values of these attributes are the symbolic atom <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>|KiwiCalc Spreadsheet Software| </FONT>and the floating-point atom 29.95.  The figure shows how the run-time system stores the scalar attribute values for a KIWICALC object.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/f2-5.gif" WIDTH=574 HEIGHT=106></P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P><B>Compound Attributes</B></P></FONT>
<P>A <B>compound attribute</B> contains a dynamically-sized, ordered collection of scalar values.  Such a collection is called a <B>compound value</B>. When a compound attribute is bound to a variable, the variable is called a <B>compound variable</B> and has a compound value. The individual scalar atoms are called <B>elements</B> of the compound value.  </P>

<P>Compound values are created (and displayed) with the COMPOUND function. For example:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>(COMPOUND MEMORY MEMORY KEYBOARD FD-35)</P>
</FONT>

<P>RuleWorks does not have multilevel lists like LISP; the result of concatenating the compound value  <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>(COMPOUND A B C)</FONT>, the atom <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>D</FONT>, and the compound value <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>(COMPOUND E F)</FONT> is the compound value  <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>(COMPOUND A B C D E F)</FONT>, not the multilevel list  <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>((A B C) D (E F))</FONT>.</P>

<P>Figure 2-6 shows a conceptual model of an object class that has  two compound attributes.</P>

</FONT>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/f2-6.gif" WIDTH=572 HEIGHT=299></P>

<P>The object in figure 2-6 has the class name BOX; the scalar attributes ^PART-NUMBER, ^NAME, ^PRICE, and ^IS-EXPANDED; and the compound attributes ^CARD-IN-SLOT and ^CARD-IN-SLOT-OBJ-ID. Note that the left-to-right order of the attributes in the figure does not necessarily reflect the actual internal representation of an object. The top-down order of the values in the compound attributes, however, does match the actual representation. Compound attributes are indexed starting at 1 (not 0).  The first element of ^CARD-IN-SLOT has the value MEMORY; the fourth and last has the value FD-35.</P>

<P>There is no preset limit on the number of atoms allowed in compound attributes; their size is limited only by memory available. You do not need to allocate memory for them. The size of a compound value varies during a program's execution. See Chapter 3 for information on matching compound attributes; see Chapter 4 for information on creating and changing compound values.</P>

<P>Use the COMPOUND keyword in an OBJECT-CLASS declaration to define the name of a compound attribute.</P>

</FONT>

<P>The compound attribute declaration is local to the object class (and its inheriting subclasses), so it is possible for an attribute name to be compound in one object class and scalar in another. It is <I>not</I> possible for an attribute to be compound in the parent class but scalar in a subclass, or vice-versa.</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P><B>Data Type Declarations</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>By default, the value of a scalar attribute can have any valid atomic data type, and the value of a compound attribute can be a mixture of data types.  RuleWorks uses a weak typing system for attribute values. That is, data type declarations are not required but if you provide one, RuleWorks enforces it.</P>

<P>Data types can be added to the OBJECT-CLASS declaration after the attribute name whose type you want to specify as shown in example 2-5.</P>

<P>RuleWorks does not perform automatic coercion on values assigned to typed attributes, not even between integers and floats. To ensure that a value has the correct type, use one of the built-in coercion functions: FLOAT, INTEGER, or SYMBOL.</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P><B>Default Value Declarations</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>When you create an object, you do not need to specify a value for each attribute. RuleWorks supplies a default value for attributes whose values were not specified. You can specify the default value for each attribute, or use RuleWorks's default.</P>

<P>If an attribute does not have a data-type declaration, the default value is the NIL for scalar attributes and the empty list (<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>(COMPOUND)</FONT>) for compound attributes.  If an attribute has a data type declaration but does not have default value declaration, its default value depends on its data type (see Table 2-2).</P>

<P>You specify a default value for an attribute with the DEFAULT keyword in the OBJECT-CLASS declaration. The following example shows the declaration of the PART class from the sample configuration program.</P>

<P><B>Fill Value Declarations</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>You can modify a compound attribute by specifying a new value for any element.  Thus, it is possible to modify a compound attribute "beyond" the last assigned element. The question arises, what value do elements between the former end and the new end of the compound now have? To answer this question, RuleWorks allows you to declare a <B>fill</B>, or placeholder, value for the compound attribute.</P>

<P>RuleWorks' default fill value depends on the data type of the compound attribute, if any. You specify a different fill value in the OBJECT-CLASS declaration, after the COMPOUND keyword. For example, consider the declaration shown below:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1>
<P>(OBJECT-CLASS AGENDA</P>
<P>^TASKS COMPOUND</P>
<P>(DEFAULT (COMPOUND INPUT VERIFY OUTPUT))</P>
<P>(FILL NO-OP))</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> RuleWorks does not support null characters in any symbol, quoted or not.</P>

<P>To include special characters or white space in an atom, quote the atom by enclosing it in vertical bars ( |  | ). The text between the two vertical bars is considered to be one symbolic atom. For example, the compiler and run-time system recognize  <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>THIS IS AN ATOM; THIS IS NOT</FONT> to be four symbolic atoms followed by a comment, which they ignore. However, they recognize  <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2> | THIS IS AN ATOM; THIS IS NOT | </FONT>to be a single symbolic atom.</P>

<P>Quoted atoms are symbolic atoms; therefore,<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>| 1.2 | </FONT>is a symbol, not a floating-point number, and arithmetic operations cannot be performed on it.   The opening and closing vertical bars, which can enclose as many as 256 characters, must appear on the same line in the code. The empty symbol are vertical bars enclosing nothing  (<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>||</FONT>).</P>

<P>To quote a vertical bar itself, double it. For example:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1>

<P>When reading unquoted symbols, RuleWorks automatically turns lowercase characters into uppercase. An unquoted symbol printed by RuleWorks may appear to be different from the symbol read by RuleWorks. If you want the print form to be the same as the read form, you must use quoted symbols.

<P>A floating-point atom is composed of the following:</P>


<UL>
<LI>An optional plus or minus sign</LI>
<LI>Zero or more decimal digits</LI>
<LI>A decimal point</LI>
<LI>Either one or both of these:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>One or more decimal digits after the decimal point</LI>
<LI>An optional exponent</LI>
</UL>
</UL>


<P>An exponent consists of the letter "E" followed by a signed or unsigned integer and represents a power of 10 by which a preceding number is to be multiplied.  For example, E-8 represents the value 10 raised to the power -8.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> A floating-point atom must include a decimal point followed by a digit or an exponent, or both.
</P>

<P>Floating-point numbers are stored in double-precision and can represent the same range of values as a "double" in the C language. (On VAX systems, this is D_float data;   see the <I>VAX Architecture Handbook. </I> On Alpha systems, this is G_float data; see the <I>Alpha Architecture Handbook.</I>)</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> INSTANCE-IDs are not integers. Arithmetic operations cannot be applied to values of type INSTANCE-ID, and they cannot be compared except for identity or nonidentity.</P>

<P>More information on variables bound to atoms of type INSTANCE-ID is found in Chapter 3.</P>

<P><B><I>Virtual Address Atoms Virtual Address Atoms</I></B></P>

<P>Values of type OPAQUE store addresses of functions or external data structures. An OPAQUE value is an "atomic address" or in C terms, a "void *".</P>

<P>The print form of an OPAQUE atom is a percent sign and an x (%x) followed by a string of hexadecimal digits. The size of OPAQUE atoms depends on the machine architecture you are using. Note that OPAQUE may or may not be the same size as the INTEGER data type.</P>

<P>There is no way in RuleWorks directly to create a constant of type OPAQUE, except for the null pointer which is a RuleWorks constant.  For example:  </P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1>
<P>%x0 ; the null pointer</P>
</FONT>

<P>An OPAQUE constant can be passed into RuleWorks from an external routine, or as an input argument to an entry block, and then passed out or returned.</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P><B>Variables</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>A variable is any unquoted symbol enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;). An example is &lt;PRICE&gt;.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> In RuleWorks, the symbols &lt;=&gt; and &lt;-&gt; represent the same-type and different-type operators. They cannot be used as variables.</P>

<P>You can use a variable as an argument to an action if the variable is bound to a value. A variable can be bound to a value in a condition element or in a BIND action.  </P>

<P><B>Arithmetic Expressions</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>Arithmetic expressions can be used anywhere a numeric constant may be used.  An arithmetic expression can contain numbers, variables bound to numbers, functions which return numbers, and arithmetic operators. The expression must be enclosed in parentheses, except when indexing into a compound value. For example:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>^price = (&lt;item-1&gt; + &lt;item-2&gt;)  ; add two bound variables</P>
<P>^card-in-slot[&lt;n&gt; + 1] memory   ; add a variable and a constant</P>
</FONT>

<P>The valid operators are:</P>

<P>If an expression contains both integers and floating-point numbers, the result is a floating-point number.  If an expression contains integers only, the result is an integer (by truncation).  For example, 7.0 (float) divided by 4 (integer) is 1.75 (float), but 7 (integer) divided by 4 (integer) is 1 (integer).</P>

<P><B>Note:</B>  Use the modulus operator only with integer operands.</P>

<P>Use infix notation in RuleWorks arithmetic expressions, that is, place operators between operands. Separate each operator and operand with a space.  Surround the entire expression with parentheses. For example:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=3><P>(2 + &lt;X&gt;)</P>
</FONT>

<P>Spaces are not required around any of the special characters in the first five rows of the table.</P>

<P>Expressions are evaluated from left to right. Precedence of operators  follows the normal conventions:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>-&#9;&#9;; unary negation, highest precedence</P>
<P>* / \&#9;; multiplication, division, and modulus</P>
<P>+ -&#9;&#9;; addition and subtraction, lowest precedence</P>
</FONT>

<P>For example, the following expression evaluates to 12, not 20:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>(2 + 2 * 5)</P></FONT>

<P>To override the normal precedence, use more parentheses. The following expression does evaluate to 20:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>((2 + 2)* 5)</P>
</FONT>

<P>Consider the following rule:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1>
<P>(rule choose-slots:place-memory</P>
<P>        (active-context ^name choose-slots)</P>
<P>        (box ^$ID &lt;the-box&gt; ^card-in-slot { [=] &lt;len&gt; [&lt;] 6 } )</P>
<P>        (memory ^$ID &lt;the-mem&gt; ^is-placed NIL ^takes-slot YES)</P>
<P>     --&gt;</P>
<P>        (modify &lt;the-box&gt;</P>
<P>                ^card-in-slot [ ( &lt;len&gt; + 1 ) ] memory</P>
<P>                ^card-in-slot-obj-id [ ( &lt;len&gt; + 1 ) ] &lt;the-mem&gt; )</P>
<P>        (modify &lt;the-mem&gt; ^is-placed YES ^in-slot ( &lt;len&gt; + 1 ) ) </P>
<P>)</P>

</FONT>
<P>The MODIFY actions in this rule use numeric expressions for the index into a compound attribute and for the value of a scalar attribute.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> RuleWorks does not have complex mathematical functions built in. For example, RuleWorks has no ARC-COSINE function. For such complex mathematical  functions, a RuleWorks program can call external routines written in other languages that are optimized  for algorithmic coding.</P>

<FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P><B>Function Calls</B></P>
</FONT>

<P>The format for specifying a function call is:  </P>

<B><P>(<I>function-name argument-1 argument-2</I> ..)</P>
</B>

<P>Use the same format whether the function is built-in or user-defined (as an external function or an entry block that returns a value).</P>

<P><B>Note:</B>  If a function requires no arguments, you must still enclose the function name in parentheses.</P>

<P>You can represent a value with a call to a built-in RuleWorks function.  Consider the following MAKE action:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>(make input-thing ^item (accept-atom infil))</P>
</FONT>

<P>First, the run-time system evaluates the call to the ACCEPT-ATOM function.  The MAKE action then stores the value returned by the ACCEPT-ATOM function in the ^ITEM attribute of the INPUT-THING object it creates.</P>

<P>You can also represent a value with a call to a user-defined function, written in RuleWorks or some other language. In either case, you must declare the function before you call it.  The following BIND action calls the external function SQUARE_ROOT:</P>

<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1>
<P>(BIND &lt;STD_DEVIATION&gt; (SQUARE_ROOT &lt;VARIANCE&gt;))</P>
