Introduction</P></B></I></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RuleWorks is a rules-based application development tool providing the convenience of cross-platform development combined with one of the most powerful high level rules-based languages and fastest inference engine. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RuleWorks is a language, compiler (with debugger), and Run-Time Library for constructing high performance, modular, object-oriented, forward-chaining, rules-based applications. It provides portability by producing ANSI C sources which can then be compiled with any of the leading C or C++ compilers.  There is a Run-Time Library for each supported platform and C compiler.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rules-based approaches have been successful in numerous applications in the manufacturing industries wherever decision support or rapid prototyping is required. Other applicable domains include configuration, selection, data acquisition and process control.  Healthcare firms and others who require interactive diagnostic programs have also used expert systems to great advantage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A rule (or production) is defined as an "if-then" or &quot;when-do&quot; construct consisting  of a conditional part, called the Left Hand Side (LHS), and an action  sequence, called the Right Hand Side (RHS). Rules operate on in-memory objects which represent concepts or entities in the real world. These objects, called Working Memory Objects, are composed of a set of attribute value pairs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During each recognize-act cycle, RuleWorks examines the LHS of all active rules to determine which rules' LHS conditions are satisfied given the current state of Working Memory Objects.  RuleWorks then applies conflict resolution criteria to determine which of these rules should have its action sequence executed.  Actions in turn, can modify the state of Working Memory Objects.  This cycle is repeated until no more rules are satisfied or until a rule explicitly halts processing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A rules-based language differs from a conventional programming language in that rules are not processed in sequential order; rather, the order of execution is driven by the current state of working memory data.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P>Portability</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RuleWorks compiler and the run-time systems are written in ANSI C and the compiler generates ANSI C output files. RuleWorks is currently supported on the following platforms:</P>
<B><P>Processor  &#9;Operating System</P>
</B><P>Intel          &#9;Windows 98/95</P>
<P>Intel          &#9;Windows 2000/NT</P>

<B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P>Modularity</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RuleWorks provides features designed to support the software engineering concepts of modularity and information hiding.  For example the programmer can write multiple independent rules-based subsystems which do not interfere with each other. It is also possible for multiple  rules-based subsystems to share specific sets of information with each other, or to share all of the information to which each has access. Programmers can also control all of the functional and all of the matchable information subsystem interfaces.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rules-based subsystems can be called from other rules-based programs or from programs written in other languages. From a rules-based module, calls can be made to any other subprogram (including those which are rules-based), even recursively.  Function arguments are passed via standard calling mechanisms with automatic data type coercions.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Match Extensions</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The LHS is the "if" or &quot;when&quot; part of a rule. It specifies the conditions in working memory which must be true before the rule can execute. The LHS is composed of condition elements (CEs), each of which can match objects of a particular class, and its subclasses, if any. RuleWorks performs a logical AND operation on all the CEs on the LHS. A rule is eligible to execute when there are objects which match all of its positive CEs, but there are no objects which match any of its negative CEs. The RHS is the "then/do&quot; part of a rule. It consists of one or more actions. The actions on the RHS of a rule are executed only when the LHS matches working memory and the  resulting particular instance is picked during conflict resolution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RuleWorks provides the following new matching features:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&#9;Variables are evaluated within value disjunctions, including variables bound in other condition elements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&#9;Relational predicates (&gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, =) can compare integers to floats, and symbols with symbols using localizable lexicographic ordering.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&#9;New similarity predicate, ~=, which for numbers tests  for equality within a 1% margin, and which for symbols uses the SOUNDEX algorithm to compare phonetic (in English) similarity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&#9;New dissimilarity predicate, -~=, which matches when the similarity test fails.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&#9;Comparisons of compound attributes against function return values.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&#9;The containment and non-containment predicates can be applied to scalar attributes, as long as the argument to the predicate is a compound value (e.g. ^name [+] &lt;name-list&gt;).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>
&#9;The containment predicate can also be applied in conjunction with a scalar predicate to search the compound attribute for a value which satisfies the scalar predicate.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P>Application Development Process</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Developing applications for any supported platform is straightforward:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Applications (including client server, object oriented programs) are composed in ASCII text using any suitable editor and the RuleWorks language.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The RuleWorks compiler is called, either independently from the system prompt or from within another development environment such as Visual C++, and utilizes the ASCII source as its input.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The RuleWorks compiler produces ANSI C source code portable to the platform in which the application will ultimately be run.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The RuleWorks-produced C code is compiled and linked with the RuleWorks run-time library utilizing the target platform C compiler. Note that this compiler could be the very same as was in use in the environment from which RuleWorks was called. For example the RuleWorks-produced C can be compiled simultaneously with the Visual C++ sources.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The resulting object code will execute on the platform corresponding to the C compiler utilized.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Programs produced with RuleWorks can be created in modules which can be individually tested, debugged and used with new applications as required. </LI></P></UL>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P>Compiler</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RuleWorks achieves high performance through a compiled language implementation,  and utilizes a variant of the Rete match algorithm to represent the interdependencies of rules and data in a highly efficient way.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Rete network greatly speeds up the pattern-matching (inference) operation  by eliminating the need for exhaustive redundant tests at execution time.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE=4><P>Run-Time System</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RuleWorks run-time system includes a command interpreter which lets the user control the running of RuleWorks programs and issue debugging  commands.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RuleWorks debugging commands can be used to find errors in the program and to interact with it while it is running. The DEBUG action and the DEBUG qualifier together allow the user to control the invocation of the RuleWorks command interpreter with no changes to the source code.  If your program calls routines written in another language, you use that language's debugger to find errors in those routines.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RuleWorks run-time system also provides an application programming interface for use from other languages.</P>
