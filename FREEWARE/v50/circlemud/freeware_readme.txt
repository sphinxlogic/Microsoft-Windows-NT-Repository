CircleMUD, GAMES, Multi-user Dungeon Game

"CircleMUD is a multi-user dungeon game system (MUD) written by Jeremy Elson,
originally at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science (I
graduated in May of 1996). CircleMUD is a derivative of DikuMUD Gamma 0.0, which
was written in 1990 at DIKU, the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Copenhagen, by Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen, Hans Henrik Staerfeldt,
Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer. 

A MUD (Multiple User Dimension or Multiple User Dungeon) is a computer program
which allows Internet users from around the world to connect to it, create
fictional characters for themselves, and then interact with other real users as
well as computer-generated entities in a virtual environment. Users can explore
their virtual world, talk to or perform actions with other human players, roam
through dangerous monster-infested areas, solve puzzles, and seek treasures.
DikuMUD is a particular class of MUD which tends to be combat-oriented with a
look and feel similar to some (non-computerized) role-playing games. CircleMUD
is a derivative of DikuMUD. While Circle still retains the "look and feel" of
the original DikuMUD, it has dozens of additional features and bug fixes, and
much of the code has been rewritten to be more flexible, efficient, easy to
understand, and easy to extend. 

CircleMUD is freeware! You can download all of Circle's source code, libraries
and documentation absolutely free. The code compiles under most versions of UNIX
(including Solaris, SunOS 4.x, Ultrix, Linux, AIX, and HP/UX), Microsoft Windows
(Windows 95 and Windows NT), IBM OS/2, Mac System 7/8, OpenVMS, and the Amiga."
