BISON, UTILITIES, GNU bison -- parser generator (alternative to yacc)

aug-1995 Sheldon Bishov, Compaq
feb-2000 revised

The source for files was Free Software Foundation, ftp from
anonymous@prep.ai.mit.edu

MMS (Module Management System) is the easiest way to rebuild the tool
since there is already a DESCRIP.MMS file provided.  To rebuild, simply
$ SET DEFAULT to the directory where you unzipped the source files,
then type  $ MMS and press return.

To (optionally) load help into user library, set default to the source
directory and enter the following commands:
    $ library/help/create bison.hlb
    $ library bison.hlb/help bison.hlp
    $ @install_help bison.hlb

Other requirements for installation:

Assign a rooted directory logical gnu_bison; for example,

$ assign /trans=concealed WORK215:[TOOLS.BISON-A2_3.] gnu_bison

Either build bison.exe using the information in *readme*.* and install.;
files, or use the version from the [.VAX] or [.ALPHA] subdirectory.
Move the .exe file to the gnu_bison:[000000] directory. Then be sure to
move a copy of the file bison.simple and (for VAX only) vmshlp.obj to
this same directory.  Note that the VAX version was built under OpenVMS
V6.1, the Alpha version under OpenVMS V6.2.

If you use a name for the executable file other than bison.exe, edit
the bison.cld file.  For example if you want to use the name bison.exe_vax,
change the "IMAGE" line to:
        IMAGE   GNU_BISON:[000000]BISON.EXE_VAX

Read other *readme*.* files, and install.; for further installation
instructions.

To process bison input files, and compile the code generated by bison,
you can use build-bison.com.  P1 is the name of the file, without the
.bison or other extension.  A sample input file, calc.bison, is provided
in the source directory.  When built it functions as a simple
(non-graphical) calculator.

The DCL command,
 $ set command bison
should be executed to update the DCL tables using bison.cld prior to
executing build-bison.com.


Following changes in code:

build.com: Update cc_option

build-bison.com: New procedure, makes easier build of .exe using bison

install_help.com: new procedure for optional installation of help file.

vmsgetargs.c: Remove redundant extern int declarations
