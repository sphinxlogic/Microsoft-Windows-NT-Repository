           1       HOW DECtalk WORKS 1

              DECtalk is a text-to-speech converter that provides any
              computer with a human-sounding voice. You can enter the text
              from a host computer or a terminal keyboard connected to the
              unit. You can hear the resulting speech through the built-in
              speaker, a headset, external speakers with an amplifier, or
              a telephone. You can also display the spoken output on a
              monitor screen or print it in hardcopy form.

              Operating Modes

              DECtalk operates in one of three modes, on-line, off-line,
              and setup. Figure 1-1 shows how the three modes are related.

              o  In on-line mode, DECtalk communicates with a host
                 computer. While on-line, the local terminal cannot
                 directly interact with the DECtalk text-to-speech program
                 or command processor. On-line mode is described in the
                 DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual.


                                                                         1
 







              o  In off-line mode, DECtalk acts as a standalone
                 text-to-speech system, reading commands from the local
                 terminal and speaking text as requested. Off-line mode is
                 described in Chapters 2 through 5.

              o  In setup mode, DECtalk lets you set various internal
                 parameters (such as communication line speeds). The setup
                 command processor uses a prompt/request dialogue format.
                 Setup commands are described in Chapter 3.

              Converting Text to Speech

              Text is converted into speech by a 3-level process.









           2
 







              Level   First DECtalk accepts text from a terminal or host
              1       port and converts it from one special computer code
                      into another. The text is in ASCII format when it
                      enters DECtalk, and is converted to phonemic code
                      for further processing.
                      Phonemic code uses the phonemic alphabet, described
                      in Chapter 4. Each symbol in the phonemic alphabet
                      has only one pronunciation. DECtalk uses a large
                      internal dictionary and the rules of English
                      pronunciation to do the conversion.

              Level   The phonemic code is then converted into synthesizer
              2       control commands. In this level, several DECtalk
                      internal filters are set to the correct pitch and
                      timbre for the DECtalk voice.

              Level   Finally, the speech synthesizer uses the control
              3       commands to generate speech.


                                                                         3
 







              In levels 2 and 3, a synthesizer control command is
              generated every 6.4 milliseconds, and the digital signal
              processor sends a speech waveform value every 100
              microseconds. This process generates "frames" of speech.
              DECtalk acts somewhat like a TV picture, in that these
              frames of speech are presented to the listener just as
              frames of pictures are presented to the viewer, In both
              cases, the frames appear to be one continous, unbroken
              sequence.

              In addition to the text-to-speech program, DECtalk contains
              software to control the host and local terminal ports (by
              interpreting and executing commands) and the telephone line
              interface. DECtalk has a self-test that automatically checks
              the unit each time you turn on the power.

              Self-tests and tests with the remote loopback cable are
              described in the DECtalk DTC01 Installation Manual and the
              DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual.


           4
 







              DECtalk Software Program

              The 3-level process described in the last section happens in
              nine program modules (Figure 1-2). Each module is described
              briefly in the following paragraphs.

              Converting ASCII Text to Phonemic Code

              1  A sentence parser breaks the input stream into separate
                 words and locates some clause boundaries (such as commas
                 and other punctuation marks). The sentence parser also
                 recognizes phonemic symbols and commands that you may
                 have added to the input text. Phonemics are discussed in
                 Chapters 4 and 5.

              2  A word parser breaks compound wods into their component
                 parts, yielding words in their final pronounceable form.
                 Strings of text that do not form English words are
                 spelled out letter by letter.



                                                                         5
 







              3  A number formatter is used if the text contains numerals.
                 The number formatter knows the rules for many common
                 number formats and converts the numbers into English
                 words by these rules. The number formatter also
                 recognizes some abbreviations, such as "lb." for
                 "pound(s)." Refer to Appendix A for more information on
                 number-speaking rules.

              4  A dictionary manager searches the pronunciation dictionar-
                 ies. DECtalk has a built-in dictinary of many commonly used
                 words. In some cases a single spelling has two different pro-
                 nunciations and DECtalk gives you a way to indicate which one
                 to use in a particular sentence. The dictionary contains ad-
                 ditional space where you may enter special words such as proper
                 names, techincal terms, and words that you want pronounced
                 differently from the way DECtalk pronounces them. Chapter 3
                 of the DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual describes
                 how to set up your own dictionary, and Appendix B lists words
                 with more than one pronunciation.


           6
 







              5  A letter-to-sound module uses a set of English
                 pronunciation rules to assign phonemic form and lexical
                 stress patterns to words not found in the dictionary.

                 Refer to Chapter 4 for ways to modify the phonemic form
                 of words, and Chapter 5 for special voice qualities (such
                 as emphasis and singing).

              6  A phrase structure module recombines all phonemic output
                 from the dictionary search and other modules.

                 This module looks for embedded punctuation to construct
                 proper phrasing and intonation of the text (for example,
                 a comma indicates that a slight pause should occur). As
                 each recognizable clause is converted, it is passed to
                 the phoneme-to-voice module. Refer to Chapter 5 for more
                 information on adjusting emphasis and timing.





                                                                         7
 







              Converting Phonemic Code to Synthesizer Control Commands

              7  The phoneme-to-voice module processes clauses passed from
                 the phrase structure module and converts them to control
                 signals for the speech synthesizer.

                 This module modifies the clauses by changing the phonemes
                 into parameters that determine the natural resonant
                 frequencies of the vocal tract (formants), sound source,
                 amplitudes, and so on.

              8  Synthesizer control commands are sent to the speech
                 synthesizer for output.

              Converting Control Commands to Speech

              9  The digital speech synthesizer computes a speech waveform
                 with acoustic characteristics that are determined by the
                 synthesizer control commands received.



           8
 







              Tuning DECtalk Speech

              Sometimes it is important to make a few sentences sound very
              good because they are used often, for example, to open a
              dialogue with a customer. Usually DECtalk does a
              satisfactory job, but sometimes it mispronounces a word or
              gets the phrasing wrong. In these cases, you may wish to
              take the time to tune the quality of one or several
              sentences. The following steps are recommended.

              1  Type the sentence in local mode, then use the CTRL-R
                 command (refer to the "Modifying DECtalk Text and Speech"
                 section of Chapter 2 to listen repeatedly, focusing on
                 each word in turn to detect any mispronunciations.

              2  For each word that is mispronounced, you can use several
                 methods to get the correct pronunciation.

                 o  If a word has two alternative pronunciations and
                    DECtalk has chosen the wrong one, place a right
                    parenthesis in front of the word to get the second
                    pronunciation. (Refer to the "Beginning of Verb
                                                                         9
 







                    Pharase" section of Chapter 4 and Appendix B, which
                    lists the words with two pronunciations in DECtalk.)
                    For example, type the following.

                      >I )read yesterday that . . .

                 o  Replace the correct spelling of the word by an
                    intentional misspelling. (Refer to the "Pronunciation
                    Errors" section of Chapter 4.)

                      >I red yesterday that . . .

                 o  If the word is a compound, use a hyphen to help
                    DECtalk recognize its two parts. (Refer to the
                    "Compound Noun" section of Chapter 4.)

                      >I met the slide-show host.





           10
 







                 o  Replace the English spellng with a phonemic string
                    using the phonemic symbols described in the "Vowel and
                    Consonant Phonemes" section of Chapter 4. Check that
                    the stress pattern is correct. (Refer to the "Stress
                    and Syntactic Symbols" section of Chapter 4.) For
                    example, instead of the word Cindy, you can type the
                    following.

                      >[s'ihndiy]

              3  Now that each word has been pronounced in the best
                 possible way, listen to the total sentence rhythm and
                 accent pattern. If it is not right, try the following
                 steps.

              4  If you think there should be a short pause in a
                 particular sentence location, but DECtalk says the
                 sentence without a pause, try inserting a comma. (Refer
                 to the "Clause Boundary" section of Chapter 4.)

                   >The old man, stares at everyone.

                                                                        11
 







              5  If the comma makes a pause that is too noticeable, try a
                 beginning of verb phrase symbol instead. (Refer to the
                 "Beginning of Verb Phrase" section of Chapter 4.)

              6  Place a new paragraph [+] symbol before each new
                 paragraph in the text.

                   [+] For more information on Digital's products, please call
                   1-(800)-344-4825.

              7  Use the ['] and ["] symbols to correct DECtalk's word
                 stress. the ['] symbol gives normal word stress to an
                 otherwise unstressed function word, while the ["] symbol
                 gives a word emphatic stress. If the wrong word in a
                 sentence is emphasized, placing an emphatic stress symbol
                 before it may help. Compare the following examples.

                   >The book that I took . . .
                   >['] That is the book I took.
                   >["] that is the book I took.


           12
 







                 In the first sentence, the word "that" has its normal
                 unstressed form. When used as the subject of a sentence,
                 it receives normal word stress, as shown in the second
                 sentence. The third sentence shows how you can emphasize
                 that it is "that" specific book you took (and not some
                 other).

              8  Use the pitch control symbols [/], [\], and [/\] to make
                 final adjustments.

              9  If none of these procedures results in a satisfactory
                 sentence, you can specify duration and pitch individually
                 for each phoneme using the commands described in the
                 "Duration and Pitch" section of Chapter 4. This is a
                 difficult procedure, and you should not try it until you
                 have completed the other steps described here. If

              Conventions Used in This Manual

              Terminals have many special keys in addition to the standard
              typewriter keys. These extra keys are not standardized. This
              section and Table 1-1 list the conventions for keys used in
              this manual. The keys in Table 1-1 appear in boldface type
              in this manual.

              CTRL-K     -           ATerminates a clause if DECtalk is
                                     currently speaking phonemic text.
                                     Stops phonemic mode and returns
                                     DECtalk to normal text processing.
                                     This function is useful if you are
                                     not sure whether DECtalk is in text
                                     or phonemic mode.

              Control Characters

              Terminals have a set of nonprinting characters called
              control characters, which are used to perform special
              functions. Table 1-1 lists the control characters that have
              special functions in DECtalk in off-line and setup modes.


                                                                        17
 







              Control characters are typed by holding down the CTRL key
              and pressing the correct letter. For example, to type the
              control character R, hold down the CTRL key and type R.

              Control keys are shown in this manual as CTRL-n, where n is
              the key to use. For example, the control character R is
              written as CTRL-R (pronounced "control-R").

              Examples

              Dot matrix type is used in this manual to show computer
              dialogue. The prompt you will see on your screen in off-line
              mode is ">". The prompt in setup mode is "SETUP". You do not
              type these prompts.

           1       Getting Started
                   From a Terminal 2

              The best way to learn to use DECtalk is to experiment with
              it--by typing on a terminal and listening to the spoken
              result. If you are reading this manual for the first time,
              you may find it helpful to have a terminal available and
              connected to the DECtalk local port. By using the examples
              in this manual, you can hear the result and understand
              better how DECtalk operates.

              For more information on how to connect DECtalk to a
              terminal, refer to the DECtalk DTC01 Installation Manual.








                                                                        19
 







              Connecting DECtalk to a Terminal

              DECtalk powers up in on-line mode (refer to the "Operating
              Modes" section in Chapter 1). To connect DECtalk and change
              to off-line mode, do the following.

              1  Connect the terminal to the local DECtalk port (Figure
                 2-1). Digital Equipment Corporation recommends that you
                 use a BC22D or similar interconnect cable.

              2  Turn the terminal and DECtalk on.

                 When DECtalk starts, it performs a self-test that takes
                 about 7 seconds and then says, "DECtalk version xxx is
                 running" (xxx is a version of DECtalk firmware). If no
                 sound results, check the volume control on the local
                 speaker and restart DECtalk.

              3  Check that the terminal is set to 9600 baud (the
                 factory-set default baud rate for DECtalk).



           20
 







                 If the baud rate is not correct, or other problems
                 happen, refer to the terminal owner's manual and the
                 DECtalk DTC01 Installation Manual.

              4  Press the BREAK key on the terminal. This places DECtalk
                 in setup mode.

              5  Type the OFFLINE command followed by RETURN to change to
                 off-line mode. Then enter the commands shown in the
                 following example. (Chapter 3 describes the setup
                 commands.)

                 BREAK

                   SETUP>OFFLINE

                 (Enter off-line mode.)

                   SETUP>SET LOG PHONEME ON

                 (Display phonemic text.)

                   SETUP>SET MODE SQUARE ON
                                                                        21
 







                 (Let [] delimit phonemic text.)

                   SETUP>EXIT

                 (Leave setup mode.) > (DECtalk is waiting for something
                 to speak.)

              Headphones and Auxiliary Speakers

              DECtalk comes with a built-in loudspeaker and volume
              control. You may wish to listen with headphones or connect
              DECtalk to a high-fidelity system.

              You can connect headphones or an auxiliary speaker to
              DECtalk through the headphone jack in the back of the
              DECtalk unit. Plugging in the headphones or speaker turns
              off DECtalk's internal speaker.

              You can connect an amplifier to DECtalk through the audio
              output jack. The output jack does not disconnect the DECtalk
              internal speaker. You can disable the internal speaker by
              turning down the DECtalk volume control.

           22
 







              DECtalk speech is easier to understand on a hi-fi system,
              especially if you set the bass control low.

              Telephone Output

              You can make DECtalk work on a telephone line. Because of
              the limited frequency range of the telephone, speech heard
              over a phone line is not as clear as that heard through the
              DECtalk speaker. Keep this limitation in mind if you are
              preparing text for telephone transmission.

              Refer to the DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual for
              more information on DECtalk telephone communications.









                                                                        23
 







              Entering Text on DECtalk

              Unless otherwise advised by special commands, DECtalk
              assumes that everything you type at the keyboard is to be
              spoken. DECtalk processes what you type, but will not speak
              until

              1  You type a period, comma, semicolon, colon, question
                 mark, or exclamation point, followed by RETURN, or

              2  DECtalk's internal buffers fill.

              Type the following:

                   >The sum of $45.98 is too much to pay<RETURN>
                   >for a pair of shoes.<RETURN>

              This results in DECtalk saying, "The sum of forty-five
              dollars and ninety-eight cents is too much to pay for a pair
              of shoes." The speech will begin after you type the period
              and second RETURN. (for more information on spoken numbers,
              refer to Chapter 4 and Appendix A.)

           24
 







              You do not need to wait for the speech to stop before typing
              more input text.

              You can force internally buffered text to be spoken by
              pressing RETURN twice (adding a blank line). This is useful
              if you forgot to type a period before a carriage return.

              When you enter a long string of words, DECtalk may have to
              begin processing the speech before it reaches a terminating
              punctuation mark to prevent over-flowing the internal
              buffers. However, the limit is about 50 words, and most
              spoken sentences are much shorter. Extremely long words are
              also broken into smaller word pieces by DECtalk.

              If you want to type in a long sentence, you can prevent
              DECtalk from speaking the sentence early by typing it as one
              line, without a carriage return. However, if you embed a
              comma in the sentence, DECtalk may still begin speaking
              before the sentence is completed.



                                                                        25
 







              Modifying DECtalk Text and Speech

              This section describes how to correct typing and
              pronunciation errors, and how to add emphasis to DECtalk
              speech.

              Correcting Typing Errors

              You can correct typing mistakes before pressing the RETURN
              key.

              o  You can delete a single character with the DELETE or
                 BACKSPACE keys.

              o  You can delete an entire line by pressing CTRL-U. When
                 the line is erased, a new ">" prompt appears.







           26
 







              Repeating a Line of Text

              Sometimes you want to hear a sentence over without having to
              retype it. If you typed the sentence on a single line (no
              RETURN until the end of the sentence), you can recall it
              with the CTRL-R command. You will hear the sentence as soon
              as you type RETURN.

              You can keep repeating the sentence, using CTRL-R and RETURN
              You can edit the sentence before typing RETURN by erasing
              the unwanted text with the DELETE key and retyping it.

              You can redisplay a line by typing CTRL-R. This lets you see
              a line you have just edited or redisplays the current line
              (useful on a hardcopy terminal).

                >Hello. RETURN
                (YOU TYPE THIS LINE.)

                hxehl'ow.
                (DECtalk echoes when it speaks.)

                                                                        27
 







                >CTRL-R
                          CTRL-R                (You type

                >Hello.
                (DECtalk retypes the line.)

                >RETURN
                (DECtalk repeats the spoken line.)

           1       Setup Commands 3

              Setup mode allows you to set the parameters for your unit,
              such as the transmission speed. Examples of some useful
              setup commands are given in the "Setup Command Examples"
              section.

              Setup is available in off-line mode (connected to a local
              terminal) or on-line mode (connected to a computer). Refer
              to the DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual for
              information on using setup mode on-line.


           28
 







              Setup Command Syntax

              A setup mode command consists of a sequence of words,
              separated by spaces and terminated by RETURN. You can always
              abbreviate a command word to its shortest unambiguous form.

              When DECtalk is in setup mode, all local terminal input is
              processed one line at a time. No commands are processed
              until you press RETURN.

              You can edit a single line before typing a carriage return.
              Table 1-1 lists the edit keys.

              Entering Setup Mode

              When DECtalk is connected to a terminal, you enter setup
              mode by pressing the BREAK key. DECtalk responds with the
              setup prompt.

              >BREAK (You press the BREAK key from off-line mode.)

                     SETUP>EXIT
              (The setup prompt appears.)
                                                                        29
 







              Once you are in setup mode, you can give commands to change
              the DECtalk environment.

              Leaving Setup Mode

              You can return to off-line or on-line mode by typing the
              EXIT command.

                     SETUP>EXIT
              (Command to leave setup mode.)

              > (Off-line mode prompt.)

              Any commands you enter while in setup mode work after you
              type EXIT.

              Figure 3-1 shows how the modes and commands are related.

              To make any setup changes permanent, use the SAVE command,
              described in Table 3-1 and the "SAVE" section.

              HELP [command]   Provides help on DECtalk commands,
                               functions, and parameters. Typing HELP by
                               itself gives an overview of DECtalk
                               commands. Typing HELP and a command gives
                               information on that command.

              LBREAK           Sends a long break to the host (shift-break

              Command          Description
              SET              Sets the DECtalk modes of operation.
              [parameter,      Separate each parameter by a comma.
              subparameter]    Table 3-2 lists the SET command parameters.

              SHOW             Displays the value of a parameter. If the
              [parameter,      parameter has multiple values, gives all
              subparameter]    values.
                               The SHOW command takes the same parameters
                               as the SET command. Table 3-2 lists these
                               parameters.

              Command          Description

              TEST             Runs DECtalk self-tests. The [test_code]
              [test_code]      specifies which test to run.
                               Table 3-3 lists the TEST command
                               parameters.

              Setup Mode Commands

              Table 3-1 lists the setup mode commands. the commands are
              described in detail in the paragraphs that follow.

              All commands are actual words entered while in setup mode.
              For example, you type the word BREAK; you do not press the
              BREAK key.




           34
 







              BREAK

              The BREAK command sends a short break (230 milliseconds) to
              the host.

              EXIT

              The EXIT command ends setup mode. DECtalk returns to
              off-line or on-line mode, depending on which mode was
              current before setup.

              HELP

              Use the HELP command when you need information about DECtalk
              functions or commands. Typing HELP without a specific
              command gives you a description of the HELP command itself.
              Specifying a command along with HELP gives you a description
              of that command. You can further specify a particular
              parameter; this gives you a description of that parameter.
              The following are examples of using the HELP command.

                     SETUP>HELP
                                                                        35
 







              (Describes the HELP command)

                     SETUP>HELP SHOW LOCAL

              (Describes the SHOW LOCAL command and gives parameters.)

                     SETUP>HELP SHOW LOCAL SPEED

              (Describes the LOCAL SPEED parameter)

                     SETUP>HELP SHOW LOCAL SPEAK ON

              (Describes the LOCAL SPEAK parameter with the switch set
              on.)

              LBREAK

              The LBREAK command sends a long break (3.5 seconds)(a VT100
              shift-break) to the host.




           36
 







              OFFLINE

              The OFFLINE command configures DECtalk for use without a
              host computer. In off-line mode, lines of text are read from
              the local terminal and sent to the DECtalk text-to-speech
              converter.

              ONLINE

              The ONLINE command configures DECtalk for use with a host
              computer. In on-line mode, all characters typed on the local
              terminal are sent to the host, and all characters received
              from the host are spoken or executed as commands. Refer to
              the DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual for more
              information.







                                                                        37
 







              RECALL

              The RECALL command recalls the DECtalk parameters from
              nonvolatile memory. It is followed by a memory parameter
              that specifies which memory to use. The memory must be
              either USER (the memory set by the SAVE command) or FACTORY
              (the read-only memory containing the factory defaults). If
              you omit the memory parameter, the USER memory is used.

              SAVE

              The SAVE command stores the current DECtalk parameters from
              nonvolatile memory. When you turn on DECtalk, it starts with
              the values stored by SAVE.

              NOTE: Using the SAVE command erases any parameters
              previously stored in USER memory.





           38
 







              SET

              The SET command is followed by one or more parameters and
              lets you control a large number of DECtalk modes. Table 3-2
              lists the parameters you may use.

              Many SET parameters control switches that may be set on or
              off. For example, to log spoken phonemes on the local
              terminal, enter this command.

                     SETUP>SET LOG PHONEME ON

              You can also abbreviate this command to the shortest form
              needed to prevent ambiguity.








                                                                        39

                         PHONEME      When on, converts spoken text to its
                                      phonemic equivalent and then
                                      displays it on the terminal.

                         RAWHOST      When on, transmits all data received
                                      from the host, including escape
                                      sequences, to the terminal in the
                                      same form in which it is received.

                                      When on, DECtalk does not transmit
                                      DECtalk-specific escape sequences to
                                      the local terminal. DECtalk also
                                      ignores most non-DECtalk escape
                                      sequences.
                                      Note that you must set LOG RAWHOST
                                      on if you want data other than
                                      escape sequences transmitted from
                                      the host computer.

                                      set the equivalent mask bits. SET MASK
                                      OFF turns off the keypad mask. The key-
                                      pad mask is saved in DECtalk's nonvolatile

              TEST

              The TEST command runs the DECtalk self-tests. It is followed
              by a test_code parameter that specifies the test to run
              (Table 3-3)

              The LDATA test works only when DECtalk is connected to a
              host computer. You cannot run it off-line through a
              terminal.

              To run the HDATA and HCONTROL tests, you must attach a
              loopback connector to the host line. Refer to the DECtalk
              DTC01 Installation Manual for more information.

              You may also have to set other subparameters during testing,
              such as SPOKENSETUP or SPEED.

              Using setup mode, you can control a variety of built-in
              debugging features that simplify application development.
              For example, you can display host and telephone interaction
              on the local terminal in a variety of ways.

              All characters received from the host

              All characters sent to the host

              SETUP COMMAND EXAMPLES

              This section shows how you can use several setup commands in
              combination to configure DECtalk for special operations.
              These examples assume that you have given a SET LOG command.

              Figure 3-1 shows the setup commands used by DECtalk in local
              mode.

              Speech Debugging

              When using DECtalk to develop an application, you begin
              debugging by entering the following setup commands.

                     SETUP>SET MODE SQUARE ON
                     SETUP>ONLINE
                     SETUP>EXIT

              Setting MODE SQUARE on lets you transmit phonemic text using
              square bracket delimiters. This command also enables
              selection of correct pronunciation for the words listed in
              Appendix B.

           58
 







              While debugging the application, you may wish to log text
              and escape sequence commands as follows.

                     SETUP>SET LOG TEXT ON
                     SETUP>LOG OUTHOST ON
                     SETUP>SET LOG ERROR ON
                     SETUP>SET LOG TRACE ON

              These commands log text that is to be spoken, all characters
              sent by DECtalk to the host computer, error messages, and
              interpreted escape sequences. While debugging the
              application, you also log telephone interaction.

              Figure 3-2 shows how the internal logic paths of DECtalk are
              configured when you enter these commands.

              While testing the application, you may discover that escape
              sequences are not being interpreted as you intended, either
              by DECtalk or the host computer. To find the location of the
              error, you can extend debugging mode to see all characters
              sent from the host as follows.

                                                                        59
 







                     SETUP>SET LOG TEXT OFF
                     SETUP>SET LOG INHOST ON

              If you set text logging off, DECtalk does not display spoken
              text twice. Inhost logging is useful to see if line speed
              (or line quality) problems are destroying data.

              Figure 3-3 shows how DECtalk is configured in this case.

              When you have solved the communications problems, you may
              wish to tune DECtalk's output for the best possible speech
              quality. Give the following commands.

                     SETUP>SET LOG INHOST OFF
                     SETUP>SET LOG TRACE OFF
                     SETUP>SET LOG OUTHOST OFF
                     SETUP>SET LOG TEXT ON
                     SETUP>SET LOG PHONEME ON




           60
 







              The spoken text and its phonemic translation are now logged.
              (Errors are still being logged.) You now tune the
              application for the best quality speech. Before releasing
              the application for production, you remove logging and save
              these parameters in DECtalk's nonvolatile memory.

                     SETUP>SET LOG TEXT OFF
                     SETUP>SET LOG PHONEME OFF
                     SETUP>SET LOG ERROR OFF
                     SETUP>SAVE

              DECtalk as a Workstation for a Blind Professional

              When DECtalk is used to deliver speech to a worker with a
              visual disability, it acts as a "line splice" in the
              terminal-to-host communication path. The terminal is
              connected to DECtalk's local port, and the host computer is
              connected to the remote port. You select the setup modes as
              follows.

                     SETUP>ONLINE
                                                                        61
 







              (Link DECtalk to the host computer instead of the local
              terminal.)

                     SETUP>SETL MODE SQUARE OFF

              (Type all input exactly as received, since the user does
              directly control DECtalk.)

                     SETUP>SET HOST SPEAK ON

              (DECtalk will say all text sent from the host.)

                     SETUP>SET LOCAL SPEAK ON

              (DECtalk will say all text typed at the terminal. If the
              host echoes received text, this command is not needed.)

                     SETUP>SET LOCAL FILTER ON

              (Don't send DECtalk escape sequences to the terminal.)

                     SETUP>SAVE

           1       DECtalk PHONEMICS 4

              Most users do not need to know anything about DECtalk
              phonemics. However, in order to understand how DECtalk works
              and to make it correctly pronounce any English word, you
              need to know something about speech sounds and how to
              represent them on a keyboard. Since spelling in English does
              not always show exactly how words are pronounced,
              dictionaries use symbols to show how words really sound.
              Sometimes these symbols are the same as letters used in
              spelling. A word written the way it is pronounced is said to
              be written in phonemic transcription.




                                                                        63
 







              PRONUNCIATION ERRORS

              DECtalk tries to pronounce all the text it receives
              according to the rules of English pronunciation and
              punctuation. DECtalk also knows the rules of many special
              cases of pronunciation and tries to follow all the rules and
              exceptions.

              DECtalk knows how to pronounce many words, but if it is
              unfamiliar with a word, it has to guess at its
              pronunciation. If it gets a word wrong and the error is
              serious enough that you want to correct it, there are three
              ways to do this.

              1  Change the input text to "misspell" the word in a way
                 that sounds correct.

                   >Thomas.

                 (Mispronounced [th'aamaxz].)

                   >Tomass.

           64
 







                 (Correct pronunciation)

                 An appropriate misspelling may not be easy to find. In
                 some cases, no satisfactory misspelling exists.

              2  Enter the word as a string of phonemes.

                   >[t'aamaxs] Edison.

              3  If your DECtalk unit is under computer control, you can
                 enter the word and its correct pronunciation into the
                 user dictionary. You can only load the user dictionary
                 through a computer application program. The DECtalk DTC01
                 Programmer's Reference Manual describes how to create and
                 load a user dictionary.

              INTRODUCTION TO PHONEMIC THEORY

              At one time long ago, English was pronounced as it was
              spelled, with each letter (or pair of letters) representing
              one sound, or phoneme. Because of historical sound changes
              (such as the dropping of sounds like the "gh" of "bought"
              and word borrowing from other languages, English
              pronunciation rules have become complex and include many
              exceptions.

              For example, "of" is pronounced with a v sound, while all
              other English words spelled with "f" are pronounced with an
              "f" sound. The vowel digraph "ea" can be pronounced in at
              least a half-dozen different ways, as illustrated by the
              sounds in the words "cheap," "head," "earth," and "cochlea."
              The letters "th" can be pronounced with a voiceless phoneme,
              as in "thin"; or with a voiced phoneme, as in "the"; or the
              "th" can represent the t phoneme followed by the h phoneme
              in compound words such as "outhouse."


           66
 







              Figure 4-1 shows how English phonemes are classified by
              linguists, according to how the speaker forms them.

              Some words have two pronunciations, for example, "read."
              Correct pronunciation of a sentence such as "Will you read
              the book or have you read it already?" requires
              understanding the meaning of the sentence--a task beyond
              DECtalk's ability. Therefore, DECtalk speaks words with
              alternative pronunciations by choosing the most frequently
              used pronunciation.

              You can give the alternative pronunciation in several ways.

              o  By misspelling the word: "red" for "read"

              o  By phonemic spelling: [r'ehd]

              o  By using the alternative pronunciation symbol [)], as
                 described in the "Beginning of Verb Phrase" section.




                                                                        67
 







              Stress is an important part of phonemic representation.
              Stress alone gives the two different pronunciations of words
              like "insert." English words usually have one syllable that
              is spoken with more emphasis than the other syllables in the
              word. You can indicate this emphais to DECtalk by placing
              the phonemic symbol ['] just before the vowel. The [']
              symbol is described in the "Primary Stress" section.

              Considering the complexity of English pronunciation rules
              and the number of exceptions, it is not surprising that
              DECtalk sometimes makes pronunciation errors. You can adjust
              DECtalk's pronunciation through a large number of symbols,
              described in the rest of this chapter.

              PHONEMES

              A phoneme is the smallest unit of speech that distinguishes
              one word from another. Of all the sounds that human beings
              can produce, relatively few are significant in any one
              language. Only about 55 different sounds are used in
              standard American English.

              The phonemes of English are not pronounced the same by every
              speaker. We all know people who pronounce some words
              differently from the way we do, yet we understand them. The
              differences may occur because we come from different parts
              of the country. Because of these variations, there is no
              such thing as a universal standard pronunciation of English.

              Since DECtalk pronounces a phoneme in only one standard way,
              it is not possible to imitate all English dialects (although
              you can approximate some dialectal differences by phonemic
              spelling).



                                                                        69
 







              Tables 4-1 and 4-2 list the symbols used in DECtalk and the
              sounds they represent. These tables contain all the sound
              distinctions needed for English speech. Linguists prefer to
              list phonemes according to how they are produced, as shown
              in Figure 4-1. However, the symbols in Tables 4-1 and 4-2
              are alphabetized for ease of use for the nonlinguist DECtalk
              user.

              Sounds tend to be influenced by other sounds near them, a
              process called assimilation. For example, the t sound in
              water tends to sound like a d because it is between two
              vowels, the second unstressed. DECtalk uses an extensive set
              of pronunciation rules to produce these subtle differences
              in pronunciation. Because the rules are so complex, they are
              an internal feature of DECtalk not available to the DECtalk
              user.

              VOWEL AND CONSONANT PHONEMES

              Linguists have identified 26 vowel phonemes and 29 consonant
              phonemes and allophones in English, all of which are
              recongnized by DECtalk. (An allophone is a phonemic
              variant.) Table 4-1 lists the vowels, and Table 4-2 lists
              the consonants and allophones.


                                                                        75
 







              DECtalk uses a 2-character symbol for each English phoneme.
              DECtalk also recognizes a 1-character system of representing
              phonemes. Using the 1-character system is discouraged,
              because it is not widely used and may not be supported in
              future releases of DECtalk. You can set DECtalk to the
              1-character system by a command described in the "Changing
              to 1-Character Mode" section.

              Dictionaries use other methods of representing pronunciation
              (usually with symbols over the words, and accent marks).
              Yoiu can convert dictionary phonemic markings into DECtalk
              phonemic symbols using the guidelines in Appendix C.

              Vowels

              When linguists want to set up a phonemic system for English,
              they must decide whether to represent vowels by sound or
              spelling analogies. DECtalk uses a sound-based, 2-character
              system. This is the default phonemic system and the
              recommended sound representation for DECtalk. It takes time
              to get used to the symbols for vowel phonemes, but once you

           76
 







              learn these symbols you can easily apply them when
              correcting pronunciation errors. Table 4-1 lists the
              phonemic vowels used by DECtalk.

              Syllabic Consonants

              Words like "butter," "bottle," "bottom," and "button" end in
              consonants that act as vowels in that they form syllables by
              themselves. The phonemes rr, el, em, and en are called
              syllabic consonants. A word such as "button" sounds better
              if you represent it [b'ahten] rather that [b'ahtaxn].

              Consonants

              Because there is little difference between the spelling and
              pronunciation of consonants, their phonemic representation
              is fairly simple. There are a few exceptions: some English
              consonants are represented by combining two letters. Table
              4-2 lists the phonemic consonants used by DECtalk.



                                                                        77
 







              DECtalk speaks an English dialect that does not distinguish
              between voiced and voiceless w, so that words like "which"
              and "witch" are pronounced alike as [w'ihch].

              The letter "g" can be pronounced in two ways. In words like
              "gift," the consonant phoneme g is used. In words like
              "gin," the affricate phoneme jh is used.

              The Silence Phoneme [_]

              DECtalk automatically inserts a silence (brief pause)
              whenever punctuation appears in the text. The phonemic
              silence symbol [_] is useful for controlling silences while
              in phonemic mode. Silences and other pauses are described in
              more detail in the "Duration and Pitch" section.







           78
 







              CHANGING TO 1-CHARACTER MODE

              DECtalk uses the 2-character system as the default sound
              representation and recognizes phonemic symbols in uppercase
              or lowercase. If you want to use the 1-character system
              shown in Tables 4-1 and 4-2, enter the following commands.

                     >BREAK
                     SETUP>SET MODE ASKY ON
                     SETUP>EXIT

              Only one mode is active at a time. You cannot type
              2-character phonemes in 1-character mode, or the reverse.

              To return to 2-character mode, type the following commands.

                     >BREAK
                     SETUP>SET MODE ASKY OFF
                     SETUP>EXIT



                                                                        79
 







              STRESS AND SYNTACTIC SYMBOLS

              Correct speech is more than simply stringing together a
              series of words. The meaning of a sentence is carried by the
              words, plus rhythm, stress, and intonation (pitch change).
              You recognize a question by the rising intonation of the
              voice, while a statement of fact is usually accompanied by
              falling intonation. A speaker can give certain words in a
              sentence more importance by adding stress (loudness and
              length) to them. Pitch often reveals the emotional state of
              the speaker. For effective communication, you need to
              consider these expressive features as well as the verbal
              features of speech.

              DECtalk uses stress and syntactic symbols to represent
              rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns. These symbols
              include punctuation marks, such as commas, periods, and
              exclamation marks. Punctuation marks are recognized by
              DECtalk as indicating special phrasing requirements. The
              following sections and Table 4-3 show how you can use stress
              and syntactic symbols to improve speech.
           80
 







              As any good actor knows, punctuation alone is not enough to
              indicate the full meaning of a sentence. some fine points of
              expression cannot be indicated by using phonemic symbols.
              Full control of the expression of a sentence is gained by
              directly changing the duration and pitch of words and
              phrases. These direct control techniques are discussed in
              the "Duration and Pitch" section.

              Primary Stress [']

              All content words of English (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and
              adverbs) contain one primary stressed syllable. DECtalk
              represents primary stress syllables with an apostrophe [']
              placed before the stressed vowel phoneme of the word as in
              the following example.

                     >[bahtrr].

              (No stress, flat intonation, too rapid.)

                     >[baht'rr].



           84
 







              (Stress on wrong syllable--"butter."

                     >[b'ahtrr].

              (Correct stress--"butter)

              You can also write the primary stress syllable between
              words, where it modifies the next word. For example, in the
              sentence "He rang up the sale," DECtalk treats "up" as a
              particle (without stress). "Up" is correctly stressed if you
              write the sentence as

                     >He rang ['] up the sale.

              Secondary Stress [']

              Use the secondary stress symbol['] to indicate a degree of
              stress that is between primary stress and unstressed.
              Secondary stress is appropriate in the following cases.

              o  To highlight the next strongest syllable of polysyllabic
                 words, such as "demonstration."

                                                                        85
 







                      >[d'ehmaxnstr'eyshaxn].

              o  On second parts of compounds, as in "pushover."

                      >[p'ush#`owvrr].

              o  In the strongest syllable of polysyllabic function words,
                 as in "after."

                      >[`aeftrr].

              DECtalk produces secondary stress by lengthening the vowel
              sound more than unstressed but less than primary stress.
              However, even this small change can be too much. In most
              cases, it is better to leave out the secondary stress
              symbol.

              Emphatic Stress ["]

              You can place the emphatic stress symbol ["] before any
              vowel to give emphasis to that syllable of the word. good
              readers of English text understand the message of the
              sentence well enough to pick out the most important word and
              emphasize it. DECtalk merely pronounces words; it does not
              understand the sentences it is saying. DECtalk cannot place
              emphasis on words to give a completely different meaning to
              the sentence unless you use the emphatic stress symbol. Here
              is an example.

                   Dennis loves Mary.

              (Usual neutral pronunciation.)

                   >[d"ehnihs] loves Mary.

              (Dennis--not Frank--loves Mary.)

                   >Dennis loves [m"ehriy].

                                                                        87
 







              (Dennis loves Mary--not Jill.)

              You can also use the emphatic stress at the beginning of a
              sentence to improve DECtalk's presentation of speech.

                   >["] Joan won the marathon.

              The exclamation point has the same effect in a one-syllable
              sentence.

                   >Help!

              Unstressed Syllables

              DECtalk stresses only one vowel phoneme in a word. All other
              vowels are unstressed (they are spoken with no emphasis).
              Spoken English tends to follow a stressed/unstressed
              sentence rhythm, and most English sentences are spoken in
              this way.



           88
 







              This is partly because English contains a set of words that
              are always unstressed, called syntactic function words.
              These include the following.

              Prepositions (for, over)

              Conjunctions (and, but)

              Determiners (the, some)

              Auxiliary verbs (is, has)

              Pronouns (her, myself)

              Clause introducers (complementizers)(which, that)

              These words have no stress symbols in their dictionary
              entries. It is sometimes necessary to emphasize a function
              word that is stored in DECtalk's dictionary without stress.
              You can do this by including a primary stress symbol or an
              emphatic stress symbol in the phonemic transcription as in
              the following example.

                   >He went ['owvrr] the fence, not under it.
                                                                        89
 







              Pitch Control [/], [\], [/\]

              DECtalk contains built-in rules to determine the pitch
              contour of a sentence. While these rules are correct most of
              the time, you can override them by placing the pitch rise
              [/], pitch fall [\], and pitch rise and fall [/\] symbols
              before selected words (or vowels if you want finer control).

              The [/] and [\] symbols must alternate, and the first symbol
              must be a rise. Note that you can place both a rise and a
              fall on the same syllable using [/\]. You can hear the
              difference by trying the following two sentences.

                   >it's a mad mad mad mad world.

                   >It's a [/] mad [\] mad [/] mad [\] mad [/\]
                world.





           90
 







              Word Boundary

              Any whitespace character (SPACE, TAB or RETURN) in the text
              you enter indicates a word boundary. DECtalk uses word
              boundary symbols to help select the word-beginning or
              word-ending version of a phoneme.

              Some host computers automatically insert RETURN into lines
              that are too long (and would go off the edge of the screen
              or paper). This may cause DECtalk to pronounce text
              incorrectly. You can prevent this problem by breaking long
              sentences with RETURN at an appropriate place.

              Syllable Boundary [-]

              DECtalk uses a set of rules to determine where words break
              into syllables, so that consonants within words are assigned
              to their correct syllable. Use the syllable boundary symbol
              [-] to tell DECtalk where to assign the consonants within
              ambiguous words. (This type of error rarely happens in
              DECtalk.)

                                                                        91
 







              Morpheme Boundary [*]

              English words are made up of meaningful pieces called
              morphemes. For example, "spell" has only one morpheme, while
              "misspelling" is made up of three: "mis," "spell," and
              "ing."

              In most cases, the pronunciation of a word does not depend
              on morpheme boundaries. There are exceptions, however, and
              then the morpheme boundary symbol [*] can force the correct
              morpheme boundary to be recognized. For example,
              "misspelling" should be pronounced with a double "s." Adding
              the morpheme boundary symbol improves the pronunciation of
              the word.

                   >misspelling.
                   mixsp'ehlixnx

              (The single "s" is too short.)

                   >[mixs*sp'ehlixnx]

           92
 







              (Better.)

              Compound Noun [#]

              Compound words, such as "baseball," should have less stress
              on the second word and should be spoken as two words rather
              than one. DECtalk's dictionary includes an extensive list of
              compound words. You can use the compound noun symbol [#] to
              correct words that are not in the dictionary. For example,
              for "sideache," type the following.

                   >[s'ayd#eyk].

              Using a hyphen in compound words produces the correct
              pronunciation most of the time. You rarely need the [*] and
              [#] symbols






                                                                        93
 







              Beginning of Verb Phrase [)]

              Moderately long declarative sentences are usually spoken as
              if they contained two units: a noun phrase and a verb
              phrase. There is no pause between these two phrases, but the
              pitch tends to fall and then rise. DECtalk searches for this
              syntactic boundary in order to change pitch. However, the
              complex meaning of sentences can cause confusion.

                   >the old man in the chair was rocking slowly.

              (Correct verb phrase detected.)

                   >The old man in the chair sat rocking slowly.

              (Verb phrase not detected; pure mechanical analysis of the
              sentence does not show where "sat" belongs.)

                   >The old man in the chair [)s'aet] rocking slowly.

              (Phonemic correction.)


           94
 







              The right parenthesis [)] symbol is useful where a
              separation is needed between phrases but a comma is not
              appropriate. For example, you can use [)] to indicate a
              dangling prepositional phrase.

                   >She hit the man with the umbrella.

              (Man carries umbrella.)

                   >She hit the man [)] with the umbrella.

              (She uses umbrella.)

              The [)] symbol has a second purpose: it is used to indicate
              how noun/verb or adjective/verb words should be pronounced.
              The word "insert" is either a noun or a verb, depending on
              its use. DECtalk always pronounces it as a noun.

              Appendix B lists the ambiguous noun/verb and adjective/verb
              words that DECtalk knows. Placing the [)] symbol in front of
              these words changes the pronunciation from noun or adjective
              to verb.

                                                                        95
 







                   >The experienced sectretary ) inserts more inserts per hour.

              Clause Boundary [,]

              When a sentence is composed of more than one clause, it
              should be spoken in such a way that the listener can easily
              separate the sentence into its component clauses. The comma
              [,] is the symbol used to indicate clause boundaries.

              Inserting a comma improves the quality of spoken sentences
              in the following cases.

              o  After an introductory prepositional phrase:

                      >In particular cars cause pollution.

                 (Poor phrasing.)

                      >In particular, cars cause pollution.

                 (Correct.)


           96
 







              o  Around a parenthetical remark:

                      >A picture it seems is worth . . .

                 (Poor phrasing)

                      >A picture, it seems, is worth . . .

                 (Correct.)

              o  In a list of more than two items:

                      >They ate apples oranges and bananas.

                 (Poor phrasing)

                      >they ate apples, oranges and bananas.

                 (Correct)





                                                                        97
 







              Period [.]

              A sentence is usually a single, complete thought. It is also
              the longest utterance that you can comfortably speak in one
              breath. DECtalk inserts a pause when it find a period that
              marks the end of the sentence, duplicating the human
              speaker's pause to take a breath.

              The [.] symbol also tells DECtalk to begin speaking. DECtalk
              will not speak a phrase until it finds a comma or sentence
              terminator. DECtalk also tests each period to make sure that
              it is not part of a known abbreviation.

              CTRL-K also ends a phrase, causing DECtalk to process (and
              speak) the phrase. Use CTRL-K to stop speech when DECtalk is
              not pronouncing words correctly, for example, because
              phonemic mode is on.





           98
 







              Question Mark [?]

              The simplest way to indicate a question in English is by a
              rising tone at the end of a sentence. Although true question
              intonation is not that simple and depends on the meaning of
              the question, the rising tone is all that DECtalk does.

              There are many cases in English whee a question tone is not
              used, even though the sentence ends with a question mark.

              o  Rhetorical questions or quotations may contain a question
                 mark, but the speaker ends with a period (falling tone).

              o  Sentences that begin with "wh" words usually end with a
                 falling tone, even if they are questions.

              Although DECtalk is smart enough to recognize "wh" questions
              and speak them correctly, you should send question marks to
              DECtalk only when the statement really is a question. Here
              are some examples.

                   >Laura ate her broccoli?

                                                                        99
 







              (DECtalk asks a question.)

                   >What time is it?

              (DECtalk recognizes "wh" and does not ask a question.)

                   >I asked when could he come?

              (Wrong: DECtalk asks a question.)

                   >I asked when could he come.

              (Correct: question tone removed.)

              Exclamation Point [!]

              Exclamations are short statements spoken with special
              emphasis. DECtalk interprets an exclamation point to mean
              that the last stressed syllable in the sentence should have
              extra emphasis.

                   >Stop!

           100
 







              Long sentences ending with an exclamation point typically
              have a single word that receives extra stress. DEctalk has
              no way of knowing which word to stress and chooses the last
              word by default. Use the emphatic stress symbol ["] to
              emphasize a different word when the last word is not
              appropriate.

                   >Joan won the marathon!

              (DECtalk emphasizes the last word.)

                   >["] Joan won the marathon.

              (Correct.)








                                                                       101
 







              New Paragraph [+]

              Place the new paragraph symbol at the start of a new
              paragraph. This symbol causes DECtalk to pause and start the
              first sentence of the new paragraph on a slightly higher
              pitch. Using this symbol keeps long passages of text from
              sounding monotonous and helps the listener locate major
              groupings of information. Here are two examples.

                   >[+] Once upon a time . . .

                   >[+] And they lived happily ever after.

              DIRECT CONTROL OF DURATION AND PITCH

              Good speakers use a variety of techinques to hold their
              audience. Stage actors, for example, overemphasize key
              words, pause longer than normal, and wave their arms to
              convey a feeling to the audience that otherwise would be
              lost through distance.


           102
 







              DECtalk has the same problem when addressing an
              audience--even if it is an audience of one person. You cannot
              make DECtalk wave its arms or change its facial expression
              to make a point, but you can add dramatic emphasis and
              feeling through several special commands.

              Duration and Pitch [<>]

              Sometimes emphasis is added to a phrase through extendeed
              syllable length ("Goooood evening." or dramatic rise in
              pitch ("What?!??".) You can add this emphasis through values
              enclosed in angle brackets [<>].

              The format is

                     <duration,pitch>

              where duration is the length of the phoneme in milliseconds
              and pitch is the fundamental frequency of the phoneme in
              hertz (Hz).



                                                                       103
 







              Any phoneme may be followed by angle brackets to alter the
              default duration and pitch. If either value is omitted, or
              specified as zero, the default value is used. Multiple
              values are separated by commas.

                   >[ow]

              (Normal phonemic specification)

                   >[ow<1000>]

              (1,000 ms duration.)

                   >[ow<,90>]

              (Default duration, 90 Hz pitch.)

                   >[ow<1000,90>]

              (1,000 ms duration, 90 Hz pitch.)



           104
 







              The specified pitch is a target pitch. DECtalk reaches this
              pitch only at the end of the phoneme. If the specified pitch
              was held throughout the phoneme, the result would be a
              monotone, or at least a strange inflection of the word.

              Displaying the correct emotion through voice alone is a
              difficult task, as any radio actor will tell you. The best
              method is to experiment with phonemic symbols until you
              achieve the quality you want. Emotional content is usually
              connected to the sentence content, so varying both contents
              together is the best way to convey feelings.

              For example, you can have DECtalk say a simple phrase like
              "Good morning" in several different ways.

                   >good morning

              (Normal tone.)

                   >good morning!


                                                                       105
 







              (Emphatic)

                   >good morning?

              (Questioning.)

                   >[g"uhd] morning

              (Emphasize "good.")

              If these alternatives do not produce what you need, you can
              use direct prosodic control. You must represent the entire
              sentence phonemically, specifying a duration for each
              phoneme that does not match the natural model. You should
              also give some or all phonemes specific target pitch values.
              DECtalk will compute smooth transitions between pitch
              values, where the specified pitch is reached at the end of
              the phoneme.




           106
 







              For example, to say "Oh?" with a greater degree of
              skepticism than DECtalk normally imparts, you could type the
              following.

                   >[_,<90>ow<400, 150>].

              The [ow] phoneme begins at 90 Hz and ends (after 400 ms) at
              150 Hz.

              Note the use of the silence symbol [_] in the example just
              given. Pitch and duration values must always be attached to
              a preceding phoneme. The silence symbol is used so that the
              value (90 Hz in this example) is applied to the beginning
              tone of the next spoken phoneme.

              Many of the phonemes listed in Tables 4-1 and 4-2 (all
              except the stop consonants p,t,k,b,d, and g) can be
              sustained in a monotone for an arbitrarily long duration by
              using direct prosodic control. For example, to sustain "ah"
              for a duration of 10 seconds (10,000 ms) at a pitch of 120
              Hz, type this:

                                                                       107
 







                   >[_<, 120>ah<10000, 120>].
                   (Produces "ahhhhhh . . .")

              To produce a prolonged sigh, you might type

                   >[_100, 150>ah<2500,80>].

              where the silence phoneme causes the pitch contour to start
              at 150 Hz at the beginning of the "ah" and end at 80 Hz at
              the end of the "ah."

              Singing

              Obviously, singing uses different voice control techniques
              than conversation. Even untrained singers add richness to
              sung notes by varying the pitch slightly, a quality called
              vibrato. Singing in DECtalk sounds mechanical without
              vibrato. For example, to sing the first four notes of
              Beethoven's Fifth Symphony using the syllable "da," type the
              following.


           108
 







                   >[d<100, 192>aa<250> d<100, 192>aa<250>]
                   >[d<100, 192>aa<250> d<120, 161>aa<500>].

              Each word or syllable is defined phonemically. The first
              number following a phoneme is the duration in milliseconds,
              and the second number is the pitch in hertz. Vowels and
              consonants not assigned a pitch remain at the same pitch as
              preceding segments. You can intersperse silence phonemes if
              you wish.

              DECtalk stays exactly on pitch when the pitch is specified
              phonemically. You can add vibrato (to give a realistic
              singing quality) by specifying notes with pitch values from
              1 to 37. Note 1 is C2 and 37 is C5 on an equal tempered
              scale as shown in Table 4-4. C2 is the second C below middle
              C on a piano, C4 is middle C, and so on.

              When you specify tones, DECtalk reaches the pitch you want
              within about 100 ms after the start of the phoneme and adds
              vibrato while changing to this pitch. When you give a
              specific pitch, DECtalk reaches the pitch you want at the

                                                                       109
 







              very end of the phoneme with no vibrato. The following
              example makes DECtalk sing the first four notes of
              Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

                   >[d<100, 20>aa<400> d<100, 20>aa<400>]
                   >[d<100, 20>aa<400> d<120, 17>aa<700>].

              USER DICTIONARY

              Since there are so many exceptions to English pronunciation
              rules, DECtalk uses a built-in dictionary that lists the
              most common exceptions in standard speech. DECtalk also has
              a separate dictionary, called the user dictionary, that you

                                                                       115
 







              can maintain. However, the user dictionary is difficult to
              build and maintain under off-line (terminal) control.

              When your DECtalk unit is connected to a host computer, the
              user dictionary can be loaded by a computer application
              porgram. If the user dictionary is present, DECtalk will
              search this dictionary before it uses its own dictionary.
              The user dictionary overrides the built-in dictionary.

              The DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual describes
              loading and maintaining the user dictionary.

           1       MODIFYING THE VOICES 5

              DECtalk has a set of simple commands that you can use to
              change the speaking rate, or to change the voice to one of
              nine different male, female, or child voices or a
              user-definable voice as shown in Figure 5-1. You can use
              other, more complex commands to modify the characteristics
              of each voice, or to create a new voice or special effects.
              the complex commands require skill and experience to use
              effectively, but the simple commands are easy to use in
              DECtalk applications.

              When using the telephone, we can usually tell whether the
              voice of a stranger is that of a man, woman, or child. There
              are slight differences in voice quality that are
              characteristic of these different speakers. The size of the
              head and vocal tract account for some of the differences.
              For example, women's and children's voices are usually
              higher pitched than men's voices. We also notice that some


                                                                       117
 







              people talk faster than others, and that some people speak
              more clearly than others.

              Chapter 4 described ways you can modify DECtalk
              pronunciation. This chapter shows how you can change the
              DECtalk voice itself by selecting the speaking rate, sex,
              and other voice characteristics.

              DECtalk has five commands that you can use to modify voice
              characteristics (Table 5-1). Since the commands are entered
              within phonemic brackets ([]), you must first enter setup
              mode and set MODE SQUARE on (Chapter 3). (A MODE SQUARE
              option is provided, and the default is off, so that DECtalk
              does not try to interpret text appearing normally between
              brackets as phonemes.) The commands are as follows.

              1  Speaking rate [:ra]

              2  Comma pause duration [:cp]

              3  Period pause duration [:pp]

              4  New voice [:n_]
           118
 







              5  Design voice [:dv]

              Each of the first four commands has a single, simple
              function. The design voice command introduces the parameters
              used to produce the standard DECtalk voices. You can use the
              [:dv] command to create a completely new voice.

              The sections that follow describe the voice modification
              commands in detail.

              SPEAKING RATE [:ra]

              DECtalk reads text at about 180 words per minute. This is a
              typical reading rate that is comfortable for most
              situations. You can use the [:ra] command to make this
              reading rate faster or slower.

              The [:ra] command takes a single numeric parameter, between
              120 and 350 words per minute. For example, the following
              command changes the speaking rate to 120 words per minute.

                   >[:ra 120]


           120
 







              This is a slow rate of speech useful for students learning
              English or customers copying information over a phone.
              DECtalk produces slower speaking rates partly by breaking
              the speech into short phrases bounded by pauses.

              You might use a faster speaking rate to skim electronic mail
              until you find a particular message. The following command
              changes the speaking rate to 250 words per minute.

                   >[:ra 250]

              Words per minute is a relative measurement. DECtalk adjusts
              its speech rate for average-length words. It does not count
              the number of words in a sentence before speaking them.
              Sentences with long words take longer to speak than
              sentences with short words.






                                                                       121
 







              THE PAUSE COMMANDS [:cp] AND [:pp]

              DECtalk pauses for 160 milliseconds after commas and 640
              milliseconds between sentences. In human speakers, this
              pause allows the speaker to take a breath and plan the next
              thought.

              You can make longer pauses between commas and sentences with
              the [:cp] and [:pp] commands. These commands change the
              pause durations, thus affecting the current words-per-minute
              [:ra] rate.

              The [:cp] command changes the pause rate when DECtalk finds
              a comma. For example, the following command changes the
              comma pause from the default of 160 milliseconds to 410
              milliseconds (or 160 + 250):

                   >[:cp 250]

              Changing the pause length after commas might be useful if
              you are transcribing lists of information given by DECtalk.


           122
 







              You can change the period pause in the same way. For
              example, this command changes the period pause from 640
              milliseconds to 2640 milliseconds (or 640 + 2000).

                   >[:pp 2000]

              Educational research has shown that listeners take between 5
              and 8 seconds to assimilate a new thought. If you are using
              DECtalk to pass on a lot of information, increasing the
              period pause is one way to help the listener grasp all that
              is being said. Changing the period pause, rather than the
              speech rate, keeps DECtalk sentences from sounding bored or
              draggy.

              The pause values are exact only for the standard speaking
              rate. The actual pause duration changes if you adjust the
              speaking rate.





                                                                       123
 







              SELECTING A VOICE

              DECtalk has nine built-in voices and one voice that is user
              definable. You can refer to each voice by the command [:n_]
              where "_" is a letter representing one of the DECtalk
              voices. Table 5-2 lists the [:n_] parameters.

              You can change voices with the new voice command as in this
              example.

                   >[:nb] Hello. I'm Betty.

              You can also change voices in the middle of a sentence.

              DECtalk needs a brief silence in order to change to a new
              voice. If a voice change occurs in the middle of a sentence,
              DECtalk automatically pauses slightly. The pause is the
              equivalent of inserting a comma before (or after) the
              midsentence command. For example, you could type the
              previous sentence as follows.

                   >[:np] this is a demo, [:nb] of a sudden change in voice.

           126
 







              It is good practice to always end a sentence (insert a
              period) before changing voices. This allows the listener to
              prepare for a new speaker.

              DESIGNING A NEW VOICE

              If one of the DECtalk voices does not suit you, you can
              design you own voice by using the [:dv] command. Designing a
              voice is not easy. As you will see, individual voices have
              many subtle characteristics.

              One easy way to modify the way DECtalk sounds is to change
              the pronunciation and inflection of words and sentences.
              Actors and character impersonators actually mimic a person's
              way of speaking more than his or her voice characteristics.

              To design a new voice, start by modifying a current voice to
              give it new characteristics. You can set a voice by using
              the new voice [:n_] command and then modify that voice using
              [:dv] parameters.


                                                                       127
 







              Table 5-3 lists the parameters for the design voice [:dv]
              command. You can string these parameters together as a
              series to give the voice characteristics you want, or you
              can enter them one at a time with separate [:dv] commands.

              The paragraphs that follow describe the parameters you need
              to know in detail.

              To prevent communication line problems, [list] is recognized
              only when you entered it from the local terminal in off-line
              mode. No list is transmitted to the host computer.

              The list contains six columns of information as follows.

              o  Parameter name

              o  Current value

              o  Unit (hertz, percent, decibel, or integer)

              o  Minimum permitted value of the parameter

                                                                       135
 







              o  Maximum permitted value of the parameter

              o  A brief explanation of the parameter

              The [listall] parameter lists the values for all the DECtalk
              voices.

              The [save] Parameter and [[:nv] Voice

              You can save a modified speaker definition in a
              semipermanent buffer while synthesizing speech with one of
              the other voices. The Variable Val voice [:nv] is either
              male (Prince Valiant) or female (Valerie) depending on what
              values are stored in it. If you call Val before storing any
              values in the buffer, DECtalk uses the Perfect Paul voice
              [:np]. The following commands store a modified Betty voice
              in Val and then recall it.

                   >[:nb :dv sex m save]



           136
 







              (Store the modified Betty voice in Val.)

                   >[:np] I am Paul.

              (Use another voice.)

                   >[:nv] I am Val.

              (Recall the Val [modified-Betty] voice.)

              You must reenter new voice characteristics if you turn off
              DECtalk.

              The [sex] Parameter

              Speakers Paul, Harry, Frank, and Dennis are male (sex=0).
              Kit the kid can be considered either male or female, since
              children younger than 10 years old have similar voices for
              both sexes.

              You can also enter the [sex] parameter as [m] or [f].


                                                                       137
 







              You can change the sex of any of DECtalk's built-in voices
              by making the voice current and then changing the [sex]
              parameter. For example, the following command gives Paul
              some of the speaking characteristics of a woman.

                   >[:np] hello.  [:dv sex f] Good-bye.

              Many characteristics determine the sex of a speaker,
              including pitch, head size, breathiness, and dialect
              patterns.

              If you change the sex of the speaker, some phonemes may
              cause DECtalk's filters to overload, producing a squawk.
              (While the squawk is unpleasant, it will not damage
              DECtalk.) The "Synthesizer Gain" section describes how to
              correct this problem.






           138
 







              Average Pitch [ap]

              You can use the angle bracket qualifier [<>] described in
              Chapter 4 to change the pitch and duration of a phoneme. The
              average pitch [ap] parameter changes the pitch for the
              entire voice and for all phonemes after you enter it.

              Every voice has a different averge pitch. To find the
              average pitch value for the current voice, type the
              following command.

                  >[:dv list]

              As the example in "The [list] and [listall] Parameters"
              section shows, the [ap] parameter is included in the
              resulting list. You can now adjust the average pitch up or
              down in hertz. For example, if the current voice has an
              average pitch of 120 Hz, you can raise the pitch to 180 Hz
              by typing the following.

                   >[:np] Hello.  [:dv ap 180] Hello.

                                                                       139
 







              Pitch Range [pr]

              Pitch range is expressed as a percentage change relative to
              the current average pitch [ap] value, and has a default
              value corresponding to the pitch range of a typical
              moderately expressive voice.

              As explained in the last section, every voice is centered
              around a particular pitch. For example, the default average
              pitch of Paul is 120 Hz, and the normal pitch range is 100
              percent. This means that Paul's voice may vary in pitch over
              the entire frequency range of a male baritone: from about 50
              Hz to 180 Hz.

              The best way to determine a good pitch range for a new voice
              is by trial and error. the paragraphs that follow describe
              some effects of altering the pitch range.





           140
 







              You can create a monotone or robotlike voice by setting the
              pitch range to zero. For example, to create a monotone with
              Betty at exactly 180 Hz, type the following.

                   >[:nb  :dv  ap 180 pr 0] Hello.

              Reducing the pitch range tends to reduce the dynamics of the
              voice, producing emotions such as sadness.

                   >[:np :dv ap 100 pr 20] There is little hope.

              Increasing the pitch range while setting the average pitch
              steady or slightly higher produces excitement.

                   >[:nb :dv ap 250 pr 200] I am [r"iyliy] excited.

              To return Betty to her normal voice, simply type the default
              value.

                   >[:nb] Now I am calm again.



                                                                       141
 







              Head Size [hs]

              Head size is specified with respect to the average size for
              an adult man (if sex = 1) or an adult woman (if sex = 0).

              Real human head size has a strong influence on a person's
              normal speaking voice. Larger musical instruments tend to
              produce lower notes, and humans with larger heads tend to
              have lower, more resonant voices. For example, to make Betty
              sound like a larger woman, type this command.

                   >[:nb :dv hs 120]

              (Betty now has a 20 percent larger head.)

              Head size is one of the best variables to use if you want to
              achieve dramatic changes in voice quality. For example, Paul
              has a head size of 100 percent of normal, while Harry's deep
              voice is caused in part by a head size value of 115, or 15
              percent greater than normal. Decreasing head size produces a
              higher voice, such as in a child or adolescent.

              Synthesizer Gain [g1 to g5]

              Changes in head size can sometimes produce overloads in the
              synthesizer circuits. If this occurs, there are several gain
              controls inside the synthesizer (normally unchanged) that
              you can adjust to attenuate the signal at critical points
              and then amplify it back to normal later in the synthesis.

              Use the following procedure to correct an overload
              (typically indicated by a squawk during part of a word).
              First, synthesize the word or phrase several times to make
              sure that the squawk occurs consistently. Then use the same
              test word each time one of the following changes to a gain
              is made.

              First type the [list] command to get a printout of the
              current speaker definition.

              Note especially the values for g1, g2, g3, g4, and g5.
              Reduce the number printed for g1 by an increment of 2 at a
              time until the squawk goes away.

                   >[:dv g1 58]
                   >yellow.

              (Test utterance causing squawk.)

                   >[:dv g1 56]
                   >yellow.

              When the squawk goes away, note the reduction that was
              needed (4 in this example). Now try removing the squawk by
              using g2 rather than g1 (reducing the gain later in the
              synthesis).

                   >[:dv g1 60 g2 55]

              (Return original value to g1, decrement g2 by 4.)


                                                                       145
 







              If the squawk is still gone, repeat the procedure by
              resetting g2 and decrementing g3, then g4 and g5, until you
              find the resonator that overloaded.

              After you find the farthest gain control (the largest number
              in the set g1 to g5) that removes the squawk, try to return
              the output signal to its full value by adding the decrement
              you used to one of the gain controls farther down the chain.
              For example, suppose that the 4 dB decrement of the example
              just given succeeds for g3, but not for g4. Then first try
              to increase g4 by the decrement amount as follows.

              as possible (perhaps none at all).


                                                                       147
 







              NOTE: You should keep a list of test words and phrases that
              cayuse squawks. Then, when you modify a voice, you can
              systematically confirm that you have not fixed one problem
              and caused two others.

              Breathiness [br]

              Some voices can be characterized as breathy in that the
              vocal folds vibrate in such a way that some breath noise is
              generated as well. Breathiness is a characteristic of many
              female voices, but it is also common under certain
              circumstances for all voices.

              The range of [br] is from 0 dB (of breathiness) to 70 dB
              (strong breathiness). By experimenting, you can learn what
              intermediate values sound like. Listing breathiness values
              for each of the predefined speakers may also help. For
              example, to turn Paul into a whispering speaker, type the
              following.

                   >[:np :dv br 60 gv 0 g5 80 sm 0 ri 0] This is a whispering voice.

           148
 







              This voice is not as loud as the others, but it is quite
              intelligible and human sounding.

              Smoothness [sm]

              Breathy voices often need an increase in the [sm] parameter
              to sound best. Smoothness is caused by a decrease in voicing
              energy at higher frequencies, while its opposite,
              brilliance, comes from an increase.

              The range of [sm] is from 0 (least smooth and most
              brilliant) to 100 (most smooth and least brilliant). For
              most breathy voices, a good value is about 50.

              To make Paul breathy and smooth, type the following.

                   >[:np :dv br 50 sm 50]

              Professional singing voices that are trained to be able to
              sing above an orchestra are usually brilliant, whle anyone
              who talks softly or in a whisper tends to become both
              breathy and smooth. Smoothness has little effect on voice

                                                                       149
 







              quality, but changes in smoothness can be heard in quiet
              surroundings.

              Richness [ri]

              Richness is similar to brilliance. The opposite of richness
              is softness. Brilliant rich voices carry well and are more
              intelligible in noisy environments, while smooth soft voices
              sound more friendly. For example, typing the following
              command produces a soft smooth voice.

                   >[:dv sm 50 ri 0]

              The following produces a rich and brilliant (forceful)
              voice.

                   >[:dv sm 0 ri 100]





           150
 







              Smoothness and richness can often be adjusted together, and
              these two parameters do not influence the speaker's identity
              very much. For example, to turn Betty into a nonbreathy,
              maximally brilliant and rich voice, type the following.

                   >[:nb :dv br 0 sm 0 ri 100]

              Laryngealization [la]

              Many speakers tend to speak irregularly at the beginnings
              and ends of sentences, which gives a querulous tone to the
              voice. This is called laryngealization or creaky voice
              quality.

              The [la] parameter controls the amount of laryngealization
              in the voice. A value of 0 results in no laryngealized
              irregularity, a value around 50 restricts laryngealization
              to sentence beginnings and ends, while a value of 100 (the
              maximum) produces some laryngealization at all times.



                                                                       151
 







              For example, to make Betty moderately laryngealized, type
              this command.

                   >[:nb :dv la 50]

              Other Commands

              Human voices are made up of many frequencies, even in the
              "purest" singing voice. These frequencies have been
              identified and grouped into categories (such as formants) by
              linguists and voice specialists. Table 5-3 lists the values
              for all DECtalk voice parameters, including these special
              values. These additional values are of interest to
              linguists.

              Because adjusting the parameters not already discussed
              requires specialized measuring instruments, they are best
              left as they are. However, you may wish to experiment with
              these values to see what influence they have on the voice.



           152
 







              Table 5-3 lists the values alphabetically. If you use the
              [list] command, the values are listed in a different order.
              The example in "The [list] and [listall] Parameters" section
              shows a DECtalk parameter list.

              VOICE COMMAND SYNTAX

              Like the phonemic symbols, the voice commands are enclosed
              in square brackets. However, voice commands start with a
              colon (:) and include parameters. For example, the
              following command changes the speaking rate.

                   >[:ra 150] Hello, how are you?

              In this example, [:ra] is the command, and [150] is the
              parameter. The parameter changes the speaking rate to 150
              words per minute. The "Speaking Rate" section discussed the
              [:ra] command in detail.

              DECtalk uses the following voice command syntax rules.

              1  Begin every command with a colon (:)

                                                                       153
 







              2  Separate each command and its parameter(s) from the text
                 by a valid word boundary such as SPACE, TAB, or RETURN.

              3  You can include several commands in the same square
                 bracket set.

                      >[:ra 150 :nb] Hello. How are you?

              4  You can include several parameters in the same square
                 bracket set if the command allows more than one
                 parameter. If you use several parameters, you must give
                 them all before a second command in the same square
                 bracket set.

                      >[:dv ap 160 pr 50 save : nv] Hi there.
                                         (Parameter group modifies the [:dv] command.)

                      >[:dv ap 160 save :nv pr 50] Hi there.
                                                 (Wrong. Parameter group is out
                                                 of place.)


           154
 







              5  If you give two conflicting parameters or commands,
                 DEctalk will use the last command in the sequence. For
                 example, if you type

                      [:nb :np] Hello.

                 DECtalk will use Paul's voice.

              6  You can use phonemic symbols in the same square brackets
                 with voice commands.

                      >Now I'm [:dv ap 90 pr 130; r"iyliy] thrilled!

              7  If the value in a [:dv] command is too low, DECtalk will
                 use the minimum valid value. If the value is too high,
                 the maximum valid value will be used.

              8  Once you give a command, that command applies to all
                 further text until overridden by another command. For
                 example, the command

                      >[:nk]

                                                                       155
 







                 will make DECtalk use Kit's voice on all entered text
                 until you enter another new voice command.

              9  All [:dv] commands are lost when you power down DECtalk.

              10 Invalid commands are ignored.

              DEVELOPING AN ADVANCED APPLICATION

              The development process described in this manual assumes
              that your application has full control over the text being
              spoken. If you are developing an application that must read
              arbitrary text (such as electronic mail messages), your task
              is more difficult.

              In most applications, DECtalk is controlled by a computer.
              Since even the smallest personal computer has enough logic
              to preprocess (filter) text to handle application-unique
              cases, it is reasonable to put application-specific text
              filters in the controlling computer, rather than adding many
              additional special cases (and switches to enable and disable
              them) to DECtalk.

           156
 







              Some electronic mail preprocessors may make the following
              conversions for text with DECtalk.

              1  Parse the header boilerplate to remove extraneous
                 information.

              2  If DECtalk is speaking paragraphs of text, add the [+]
                 symbol to a blank line separating each paragraph.

              3  If words are separated by "/" or another special
                 character, replace the "/" by a space (for example,
                 "and/or" becomes "and or".

              4  Write your own application-specific dictionary for words,
                 such as proper names, that DECtalk mispronounces. If
                 DECtalk is connected to a database containing names,
                 consider adding a pronunciation field to the name record,
                 entering phonemic text when appropriate.




                                                                       157
 







              5  Scan the text for strings of numbers in a format
                 understandable to your application but not to DECtalk.
                 For example, if you can extract the time format from an
                 electronic mail message, you can add code to your
                 application to expand it to its "o'clock" form.

              6  In many applications, the listener will want to write
                 down number strings (such as prices or telephone
                 numbers). Your application can scan the text for strings
                 of numbers and, when found, transmit them to DECtalk
                 followed by "that is" and the number spelled out.

              7  For example, if your application speaks money (such as
                 bank balances or item costs), it might say

                      >Your balance is $244.05
                      That is 2, 2, 4, point 0, 5, dollars.

                 The Basic-Plus program example in the DECtalk
                 Programmer's Reference Manual includes a function,
                 RNexpand$ (at line 3000), that shows how this might be
                 done.
           158
 







              8  When spelling an item out, your application may have to
                 distinguish the case of letters. Consider using different
                 voices to distinguish between uppercase and lowercase
                 letters (for example, Harry and Paul).

           1       ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS A

              This appendix describes how DECtalk processes numbers,
              abbreviations, and acronyms, and how it decides whether a
              word is pronounceable. It also includes suggestions for
              correcting spoken output problems.

              DECtalk processes text to be spoken by applying the
              following rules in this order.

              1  The input text stream is broken into groups of letters
                 delimited by white-space characters (SPACE, TAB, or
                 RETURN).

              2  If the letter string is not already phonemic text and is
                 to be converted, any understandable numbers are first
                 expanded to their word equivalents.
                                                                       159
 







              3  Some abbreviations are expanded to their full-word
                 equivalents using a list of numeric abbreviations and
                 rules for a few special cases. The user dictinary cannot
                 override this conversion.

              4  Each letter string is broken into pronounceable entities.
                 Punctuation (including parentheses and quotation marks),
                 hyphenated words, and sequences that must be spelled out
                 are analyzed. Some abbreviations and acronyms are
                 recognized, plus any entries from the user dictionary.

              5  Any text that DECtalk recognizes as a non-pronounceable
                 word is spelled out.

              A few rules operate on sequences of words. Interspersing
              phonemic symbols or DECtalk commands (certain escape
              sequences, for example) will block these rules. Therefore,
              make sure that spoken text is as contiguous as possible and
              keep breaks in structure (from English spelling to phonemic
              transcription) to a minimum.

              Character     Any of the printable ASCII characters,
                            including letters, digits, and punctuation.

              Digit string  A string of digit characters (0 through 9).
                            DECtalk decides whether these should be

                            For example, "123," is pronounced "one hundred
                            twenty-three," while "1(2)3" is pronounced
                            "one left-parenthesis two right-parenthesis
                            three."





                                                                       161
 







              NUMBER PROCESSING

              DECtalk recognizes seven general number classes, and a large
              number of special cases and subclasses. The general classes
              are as follows.

              o  Part numbers, when strings of mixed letters, digits, and
                 the "_" and "/" characters.

              o  Cardinal numbers are the simple numbers that are used in
                 counting. Examples include "123," "123,456," "12.345,"
                 "01234," "+1.2E-4," and "12%"

              o  Ordinal numbers are simple strings of numbers with "st,"
                 "nd," "rd," or "th" added, for example, "1st," "23rd."

              o  Fractions include "1/2," "2/3," and "44/100%."

              o  Money is recognized by the presence of a dollar sign ($)
                 as part of the number string or as an immediately
                 preceding word.


           162
 







              o  Dates, when written in Digital's standard format ("23-
                 Sep-1983"), are expanded to their English equivalent.

              o  Time of day, when written in the 24-hour format used by
                 the VAX/VMS operating system ("11:04:03.01"), is spoken
                 in its English equivalent.

              Part Numbers

              A part number is defined as a string of mixed letters,
              digits, and the "_" and "/" characters, containing at least
              one digit. The following are examples of part numbers.

              DTC01-AA
              VAX-11/780
              54-15966-01

              DECtalk first appempts to find the part number in the user
              and built-in dictionaries. If it is unsuccessful, DECtalk
              breaks the part number into strings of letters, strings of
              digits, and separators.


                                                                       163
 







              Pieces of the part number are separated by pauses (using the
              [,] phoneme after letters that are spelled out and the [)]
              phoneme after strings of digits). Thus, " (VT100) becomes
              "vee [,] tee [,] one hundred [)]." The pause phonemes are
              generally not shown in the examples.

              A string of digits within a part number is spoken as
              follows.

              1  If the digit string begins with 0 or is more than four
                 digits long, it is spelled out ("VS01" becomes "vee ess
                 oh one").

              2  One- or two-digit strings are spoken as normal cardinal
                 numbers ("PDP-11" becomes "pee dee pee eleven").

              3  Three- or four-digit strings that end with 00 are spoken
                 as normal cardinal numbers (" VT100" becomes "vee tee one
                 hundred").

              4  Other three-digit strings are spoken as "digit, pair of
                 digits" ("VT220" becomes "vee tee two twenty").

           164
 







              5  Other four-digit strings are spoken as "pair, pair"
                 ("DEC2040" becomes "deck twenty forty"). Note that if the
                 second pair begins with 0, it is pronounced "oh"
                 ("IBM1401" becomes "eye bee em fourteen oh one"). The [)]
                 and [,] phonemes distinguish this from "eye bee em
                 fourteen [)] oh [,] one."

              An alphabetic string is spoken as follows.

              1  One- or two-character strings are spelled out ("VT100"
                 becomes "vee tee one hundred").

              2  Longer strings are searched for in the user and built-in
                 dictionaries. If they are not found, they are spelled out
                 ("DEC2040" becomes "deck twenty forty").

                 The dictionary search differs in this case from the
                 search used for ordinary text. Thus, "THE7" becomes "tee
                 aich ee seven," even though the word "the" is found in
                 the dictionary in its lowercase form.


                                                                       165
 







              DECtalk cannot handle all possible part numbers perfectly.
              The following are examples of part numbers that are
              inconsistent with DECtalk's number and text processing
              algorithms.

              VAX/VMS   Not a part number--no digits.

              net10000  "Net" is spelled out if it isn't in the
                        dictionary.

              1E-14     DECtalk thinks this number is scientific notation.

              ALL-in-1  Found in the built-in dictionary.

              When processing numbers and number words, DECtalk first
              removes leading and trailing punctuation. Thus, DECtalk
              translates ("123") as "one hundred twenty-three."





           166
 







              Cardinal Numbers

              A cardinal number is a string of digits. If commas are
              included, they must break numbers into groups of three. For
              example, "123,456" is correct, but"1234,56" is not. The
              latter will be spelled out as "one two three four comma five
              six."

              Cardinal numbers may also include decimal fractions
              ("12.34") and scientific notation ("12.34E56"). In
              scientific notation, the exponent must be less than 100.

              A cardinal munber preceded by "+" or "-" will be spoken as
              "plus" or "minus" whether or not MODE MINUS is on.

              If the first digit is ("01234"), the number will be spoken
              as a string of digits as would be appropriate when reading
              postal zip codes.




                                                                       167
 







              If the number is greater than 999,999,999, it will be spoken
              as a string of digits with pauses between each group of
              three digits. If commas are provided, they will control the
              pause behavior. If not, the output will pause after each
              group of three digits, provided six or more digits remain.
              Thus, "12345678901" will be spoken as "123, 456, 78901"
              rather than "12,345,678,901."

              Four-digit numbers without commas are spoken in a variety of
              formats. for example, "5000" becomes "five thousand," while
              "1984" becomes "nineteen eighty-four." This yields
              reasonable behavior when processing years.

              Sometimes DECtalk does not understand the test well enough
              to pronounce the number correctly. Here are some examples.

              o  The telephone number "(617) 493-8255" will be spoken as
                 "six hundred seventeen, four nine three dash eight two
                 five five." You can correct this by:



           168
 







                 1. Spelling out the digits as "six one seven, four nine
                 three,eight two five five" (notice the commas to make
                 DECtalk pause at appropriate places), or

                 2. Separating the digits with spaces and commas: "6 1 7,
                 4 9 3, 8 2 5 5."

              o  The software cannot easily distinguish between "dash" and
                 "minus"

                      >How much is 10 - 15?
                      >Bake this 10 - 15 minutes.

                 The SET MODE MINUS setup option determines whether the
                 "_" is pronounced as dash or minus.

                 Some number formats are difficult to recognize out of
                 context. For example, the International Standard Date
                 format (83.09.20) and the United States telephone number
                 format (noted previously) are sometimes used by
                 manufacturers for part numbers. These ambiguous formats
                 are not recognized by DECtalk and you must correct them.

                                                                       169
 







                 After a cardinal number, DECtalk recognizes a set of
                 standard numeric abbreviations that are expanded to their
                 English equivalent. These abbreviations are hardwired
                 into DECtalk and cannot be modified by the applications
                 programmer. DECtalk correctly generates singular and
                 plural forms of these abbreviations.

                 Table A-1 lists the numeric abbreviations recognized by
                 DECtalk after a cardinal number. You can write them in
                 either uppercase or lowercase letters, but you must
                 follow them by a period, as the table shows.

                 Other abbreviations, such as "cc.," are spelled out by
                 DECtalk. This may cause problems, because the period that
                 follows such an abbreviation is pronounced ("cc." becomes
                 "see see period") and terminates the clause, while the
                 period in number abbreviations does not terminate the
                 clause.



           170
 







              Ordinal Numbers

              Ordinal numbers are formed from a string of digits (that may
              contain appropriate commas) followed by "st," "nd," "rd," or
              "th." Ordinal numbers are also generated by DECtalk when
              fractions and dates (in standard Digital format) are
              processed.

              DECtalk requires that the word portion of the ordinal number
              be correct. For example, "1st" will be processed correctly,
              but "2th" will not.

              Fractions

              Fractions consist of one or two digits in the numerator, the
              "/" character, and one to three digits in the denominator.
              The numerator may range from 1 to 99, while the denominator
              may range from 1 to 100. DECtalk correctly generates
              singular (1/3) and plural (2/3) forms.



                                                                       171
 







              Fractions can also use the ordinal abbreviations described
              in the "Ordinal Numbers" section, for exalmple, "2/3rds."

              Money

              DECtalk assumes a digit string is money when it is
              introduced by the currency symbol "$." (DECtalk does not
              recognize the English pound, yen, or international currency
              symbols.) The "$" may be a separate word; for examle, "$
              123.45" is equivalent to "$123.45"
                                                                       175
 







              When the "$" is recognized, DECtalk allows two forms of
              number strings.

              o  General digit strings have optional decimal fractions
                 ("$12.345".)

              o  Digit strings are in dollars and cents format ("$12.34".

              DECtalk recognizes a list of number quantity words that
              modify number processing if they immediately follow the
              money word. For example, "$1.23" million is pronounced "one
              point two three million dollars." The following words are
              recognized.

              format, such as "23-Sep-1983," "23-Sep," or "23-Sep-83." It
              does not recognize the format "Sep. 23, 1983."

              Time of Day

              DECtalk recognizes the time of day when written in the
              format used by Digital operating systems. Because this
              format can easily be confused with part number formats,
              DECtalk does not try to convert the digit string. Instead,
              it speaks the string with appropriate punctuation. Thus,
              "12:00" becomes "twelve, oh-oh," rather then "twelve noon."

              DECtalk correctly processes VAX/VMS time values, including
              the fractional second value when it is present.

              ABBREVIATIONS

              DECtalk recognizes and expands a set of abbreviations, Those
              abbreviations that follow standard pronunciation rules are
              processed by DECtalk directly (for example, "governor" for
              "gov."). The built-in dictionary contains many abbreviations
              that are exceptions to these rulkes, such as "RSTS."
              Abbreviations in the user dictionary override the built-in
              values.

              Abbreviations Processed by DECtalk

              In addition to the abbreviations that are recognized only
              after cardinal numbers, DECtalk recognizes two special
              cases, "Dr." and "St." The pronunciation of these
              abbreviations depends on whether the next word is
              capitalized.

              o  If the next word is not capitalized or if there is no
                 next word (the clause has ended), then "Dr." is
                 pronounced "drive" and "St." is pronounced "street." The

                                                                       179
 







                 next word must be on the same input line for the rule to
                 work properly.

              o  If the next word is capitalized, then "Dr." is pronounced
                 "doctor" and "St." is pronounced "saint."

                 Following these rules, DECtalk correctly pronounces
                 "Doctor Zhivago Drive" and "Saint Louis Street" in
                 running text.

                 Abbreviations in the built-in dictionary

                 Table A-2 lists the abbreviations stored in the built-in
                 dictionary. Some of these abbreviations are also in Table
                 A-1.

                 If the abbreviation can be recognized by DECtalk during
                 number processing, then the English text form of the
                 abbreviation is spoken. Otherwise, the builit-in
                 dictionary form is spoken. Abbreviations stored in the
                 user dictionary override the built-in dictionary only.


           180
 







                 The numeric abbreviations can be blocked by including a
                 dummy phonemic string, for example, "1[]ft.3."

                 Dictionary entries that contain uppercase letters only
                 match text words that contain uppercase letters in the
                 same position. Thus, "Apr." matches "APR." but not "apr."
                 This is necessary to distniguish between words at the end
                 of a sentence and valid abbreviations, such as "mar" (to
                 damage) and "Mar." (for March).

                 If a word in Table A-2 is written with a terminating
                 period, you must include that period in the input text.
                 (It will not terminate the current clause.)

              WORD SPELLOUT STRATEGIES

              After number processing, DECtalk must decide whether to
              pronounce a string of characters as a single word or a
              compound word, or if it must be spelled out. DECtalk uses
              the built-in and user dictionaries and a series of word
              transformations to make this decision.

              Number conversion, number abbreviations, and the "Street
              /Saint" test have all been performed before DECtalk begins
              the decision tests. Punctuation has not yet been removed.

              1  DECtalk looks for the word in the dictionaries. First the
                 user dictionary is scanned, then the built-in dictionary.
                 (Note that the user dictionary takes precedence. If the
                 word is found in that dictionary, the search stops.)
           194
 







                 The dictionary lookup procedure involves stripping
                 prefixes and suffixes such as pre-, -ed, and -ing. If the
                 word is found in the dictionary, DECtalk speaks the
                 associated phonemic transcription.

              2  If the word is not found, any punctuation around the word
                 is removed. If present, the punctuation symbols "'( are
                 removed from the front of the word, and the punctuation
                 symbols "').:;? are removed from the end of the word. The
                 square brackets [] are removed only if MODE SQUARE is
                 off.

              3  A special test is performed to see if the ")"
                 (alternative pronunciation character) is present. If MODE
                 SQUARE is off and the word starts with ")" it is
                 considered unpronounceable and spelled out.

              4  If some puncutation was removed, DECtalk performs a
                 special test for abbreviations. This is necessary because
                 the trailing "." would otherwise be processed as a
                 clause-terminating punctuation mark. If this fails,

                                                                       195
 







                 DECtalk searches the dictionaries for the word without
                 any punctuation.

                 For example, DECtalk processes the text string "(foo.)"
                 as follows.

                 (foo.) (Without change.)
                 foo. (Abbreviation test.)
                 foo (Without punctuation.)

              5  Next, DECtalk looks for acronyms. (An acronym is defined
                 as a word written as a string of uppercase letters
                 separated by ".") For example, the string "A.P.O." is
                 pronounced "aye pea oh." Other strings with embedded
                 periods are spelled out. Thus, "a.p.o." would be
                 pronounced "aye period pea period oh period."

                 If an acronym is recognized, the last "." will terminate
                 the clause, unless it is followed by some other
                 punctuation.


           196
 







              6  If the acronym test fails, all uppercase letters are
                 converted to lowercase and DECtalk searches the
                 dictionaries again (if some letter was modified).

              7  If the word is still not found, it is examined for
                 hyphenation (as in compound nouns) and the single-quote
                 character. A test is also performed to make sure any word
                 or word fragment has both consonants and vowels (the
                 letter y is considered to be both). Those few English
                 words that lack consonants are stored in the built-in
                 dictionary. If the test fails, the word is spelled out.

                 This test makes sure that the word does not contain
                 embedded punctuation. Thus a word like "sys$system" is
                 spelled out.

              8  If DECtalk decides the word is pronounceable, it
                 processes each part of a compound noun independently. If
                 the word is not in the dictionary, it is processed by the
                 letter-to-sound rules.


                                                                       197
 







              9  If the word was pronounced, DECtalk examines the
                 punctuation after the word for silence or clause
                 terminators. The punctuation marks " ' ) ] produce a
                 brief silence (only one silence is produced, even if
                 several characters are processed). The punctuation marks
                 ; : ! , . ? terminate a clause.

                 There is a special test for a string of periods at the
                 end of a word, as in "Hello . . ." This is equivalent to
                 "Hello."

              10 If DECtalk decides that the word must be spelled out, the
                 entire word is spelled, including left and right
                 punctuation. If the last letter of the word is "." or ","
                 it is considered punctuation and is not spelled.

              11 A single letter, digit, or other printing character
                 within quotes or parentheses is spelled out (but the
                 punctuation isn't spoken). Thus "A" is pronounced [ey]
                 rather than "uh." This helps DECtalk process lists such
                 as the following.

           198
 







                   >(a) books
                    (b) newspapers

              12 Brackets, parentheses, and braces act as commas,
                 producing a clause boundary. Parenthetical expressions
                 (such as this one) sound more natural.

              13 When text is spelled out, a brief pause is added after
                 each character. This makes it easier to transcribe text,
                 such as part numbers.

              14 A series of words separated by "/" is spelled out ("/" is
                 special only in part numbers as just noted). This causes
                 DECtalk to fail to recognize words such as
                 "Raleigh/Durham" (unless they are stored in the user
                 dictionary), but DECtalk properly speaks part numbers of
                 the format "XXX/YYY."

              Multinational Letters

              Characters in the Digital Multinational Character Set are
              either ignored or converted into the appropriate English
              letter without any diacritical marks ("#" becomes "o").

              The Digital Multinational Character Set is in Appendix A of
              the DECtalk DTC01 Programmer's Reference Manual.

           1       WORDS WITH MORE THAN
                   ONE PRONUNCIATION B

              Table B-1 lists the words that have alternative
              pronunciations in DECtalk. The alternative pronunciation is
              given in two-character phonemic form. This is the
              pronunciation for the form given after the slash in the
              Morphology column. For example, conduct (first syllable
              stressed) is the noun form of the word. Typing a right
              parenthesis [)] before the word makes DECtalk pronounce the
              word as the verb conduct, the pronunciation shown in Table
              B-1.

           200
 







              For DECtalk to use the alternative pronunciation, you must
              enter setup mode and set MODE SQUARE on.

              Several English phonemic alphabets are widely used today.
              Table C-1 lists the phonemic alphabets that DECtalk uses,
              together with the phonemic alphabets from two well-known
              dictionaries. It also gives an example of each sound.




                                                                       211
 







              Dictionaries put the stress symbol after the vowel nucleus.
              DECtalk requires that the stress symbol appear before the
              vowel.

              This appendix contains the text used to demonstrate DECtalk
              at the 1984 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics,
              Speech, and Signal Processing. The text is presented twice,
              the first time as originally written, and the second time
              after phonemic and textual fixes were applied.

                A California Shaggy Bear Tale
                  for Seven DECtalk Voices

                      By Dennis Klatt

                [:nh]. This story was used to demonstrate DECtalk at ICASSP-84, in May of
                1984, at San diego, California.

                [:np]. Once upon a time, there were three bears. They lived in the great
                forest, and tried to adjust to modern times.

           224
 







                [:nh]. I'm papa bear. I love my family, but I love honey best.

                [:nb]. I'm mama bear. Being a mama bear is a drag.

                [:nk]. I'm baby bear and I have trouble relating to all of the demands of older
                bears.

                [:np]. One day, the three bears left their condominium to search for honey.
                While they were gone, a beautiful young lady snuck into the bedroom through an
                open window.

                [:nw]. My name is Whispering Wendy. My purpose in entering this building
                should be clear. I am planning to steal the family jewels.

                [:np]. Hot on her trail was the famous police detective, Frail Frank.

                [:nf]. Have you seen a lady carrying a laundry bag over her shoulder?

                [:np]. A woman kneeling with her left ear firmly placed against a large rock
                responded.




                                                                       225
 







                [:nu]. No. No one passed this way. I've been listening for earthquakes all
                morning, but have only spotted three bears searching for honey.

                [:np].
