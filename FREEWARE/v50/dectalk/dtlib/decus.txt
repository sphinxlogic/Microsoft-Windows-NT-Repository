                                            Abstract

        The  DECtalk  support  library  contains  an  extensive  collection   of
        subroutines, written in C, that should simplify application development.
        It includes subroutines to carry out DECtalk specific functions, such as
        answering  the  phone,  as  well  as low-level operating-system specific
        functions, such as generating and parsing escape sequences.

        Several simple application programs are  also  provided,  including  the
        DECtalk  telephone  demonstration  program and a "spoken fortune cookie"
        program.  There are also sample programs written in Basic-Plus and COBOL
        for RSTS/E.

        All source modules are provided,  including  several  operating-specific
        libraries   also   distributed   with   Decus  C  (11-SP-18).   The  Vax
        distribution contains source files and executable code, while the PDP-11
        distribution  contains  only  source modules.  Unix installations should
        obtain the PDP-11 distribution and make their own arrangements for  tape
        file format translation.
