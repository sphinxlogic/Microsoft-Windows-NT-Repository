
      GTK+ for OpenVMS Alpha

      Release Notes

      July 26, 2000 

      
      Introduction

      GTK+ Version 1.2.8 for OpenVMS Alpha is an open source, free
      software library for creating graphical user interfaces. It is an
      unofficial, interim port of GTK+. 

      If you have questions or comments, or to report a problem with 
      GTK+ for OpenVMS, please send mail to openvms-internet@compaq.com.  
      Do not report problems to www.gtk.org.

      See http://www.gtk.org for more information about GTK+. 


      Prerequisites

      GTK+ for OpenVMS requires the following software. (Other 
      configurations have not been tested.) 

           OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1-2 

           Compaq C Version 6.2-006 

           The OpenVMS Porting Library (from 
      http://www.openvms.compaq.com/openvms/products/ips/porting.html )
      must be installed, and: 

             -  the Porting Library shareable image must be accessible via the
                VMS_JACKETS logical name 

             -  the Porting Library header files must be accessible (edit
                VMS_BUILD_SETUP.COM) 

           Perl 5.002_01 or higher (optional) (Perl for OpenVMS is now 
           available for download from 
  http://www.openvms.compaq.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/apache_perl.html )

           GNU AWK 2.15 (patchlevel 6) (optional) 

      Note: Perl and AWK are used in a full build, but you can modify
      the OpenVMS GTK+ build procedures so that neither of these
      utilities is required. 

      GTK+ for OpenVMS is built in DCL using OpenVMS-specific build procedures.
      The UNIX tools make and autoconf (configure) are not required. 


      Expanding and Installing GTK+ for OpenVMS

      Perform the following steps to expand and install GTK+ for OpenVMS.

      Note: You must also download and install the OpenVMS Porting
      Library in order to use GTK+ for OpenVMS. 

        1. Download GTK+ Version 1.2.8 for OpenVMS from 
           http://www.openvms.compaq.com/openvms/products/ips/gtk_down.html

           A self-extracting archive and a .ZIP file are available for
           download. The contents of the kits are identical. 

           Download the self-extracting archive to expand and install
           the kit on an Alpha system. You can expand the .ZIP file on an Alpha
           system or on a PC, if you want to simply view the files in the kit. 

        2. After you download the kit, create a directory where you
           want the source code tree to reside. Set your default directory to
           that location. 

           $ CREATE/DIRECTORY DKA0:[GTK128]
           $ SET DEFAULT DKA0:[GTK128]

        3. To expand and install the GTK+ for OpenVMS self-extracting
           archive, run the kit you downloaded. For example: 
    
           $ RUN DKA0:[KITS]GTK128-OPENVMS-A1.SFX_AXPEXE


      Building GTK+ for OpenVMS

      This section explains how to build GTK+ for OpenVMS.

        1. Edit [GTK128]VMS_BUILD_SETUP.COM to match your system's
           configuration. 

        2. If you do not have Perl or AWK, edit
           [GTK128.GTK.GTK]VMS_BUILD.COM and uncomment the goto
           no_perl statement. 

           The OpenVMS kit contains pre-built generated files. You
           should rebuild GTK.DEFS and the other generated files only 
           if you are making changes to GTK+ source code. 

        3. (Optional) If you need to build a debug version of GTK+,
           enter the following command: 

           $ DEFINE BUILD_DEBUG 1

        4. Run VMS_BUILD.COM from the top-level directory:

           $ SET DEFAULT [GTK128]
           $ @VMS_BUILD

        5. Depending upon how fast your system is, the build will take
           between 10-30 minutes. A few warnings are normal. 
 
      During a build of GTK+ for OpenVMS, the following directories are built:

           glib 
                gmodule 
                gthread 
                tests (optional) 
           gtk 
                gdk 
                gtk 

      Each directory contains a VMS_BUILD.COM that is used to build
      the contents of that directory, plus the contents of its
      subdirectories. 

      Most tests can be built by invoking VMS_BUILD.COM in the
      appropriate directory and passing it the parameter test. 

      After the build has completed, four shareable images have been created:

           [GTK128.GLIB]LIBGLIB.EXE 
           [GTK128.GLIB.GMODULE]LIBGMODULE.EXE 
           [GTK128.GTK.GDK]LIBGDK.EXE 
           [GTK128.GTK.GTK]LIBGTK.EXE 


      Your Application and GTK+ for OpenVMS

      Consider the following when you build your application and link
      against the GTK+ shareable images. 

        -  The code added to GTK+ for OpenVMS uses event flags 2 and 3
           without allocating them. Your application must not use these event
           flags. This restriction will be lifted in GTK+ 1.3 by ensuring that
           any event flags used are allocated via LIB$GET_EF. 

        -  GTK+ is compiled using /NAMES=AS_IS. This means that all of
	   the entry points in the shareable images are case-sensitive, and you
	   will have to compile your application the same way. If you want to
	   change this, edit VMS_CC.COM (to remove NAMES=AS_IS) and all the
	   xxx_create.opt files (to remove the CASE_SENSITIVE statements) and
	   rebuilt GTK+. 

        -  GTK+ is compiled using /NAMES=SHORTEN. This means that any
	   long symbol names in the GTK code are shortened rather than 
           truncated. Your application should also be compiled with this 
           qualifier. 

        -  GTK+ is compiled using /FLOAT=IEEE and /IEEE=DENORM. Your
           application must also be built with these qualifiers. 

        -  When compiling code that uses GLib, include the following
           directories on your header file include path: 

                [GTK128.GLIB] 
                [GTK128.GLIB.GMODULE] 

        -  When compiling code that uses GTK, include the following
           directories on your header file include path: 

                [GTK128.GTK] 
                [GTK128.GLIB] 
                [GTK128.GLIB.GMODULE] 

        -  There are four shareable images against which you need to link your
           application, as follows: 

                [GTK128.GLIB]LIBGLIB.EXE 
                [GTK128.GLIB.GMODULE]LIBGMODULE.EXE 
                [GTK128.GTK.GDK]LIBGDK.EXE 
                [GTK128.GTK.GTK]LIBGTK.EXE 


      POSIX and GNV Considerations

      If you are building your application inside of POSIX or GNV,
      then GLib and GTK both need to be installed so that autoconf based
      applications can locate the installations. If you have built GLib and
      GTK on OpenVMS, then they are already installed and glib-config and
      gtk-config can be used as usual. 

      For example, if your GTK+ directory root is DKB300:[GTK128], you
      can configure an autoconf based application as follows: 

      configure \
        --with-glib --with-glib-prefix=/dkb300/gtk128/glib/ \
        --with-gtk --with-gtk-prefix=/dkb300/gtk128/gtk/

      Following is a summary of the changes made to the GTK+ source files.
