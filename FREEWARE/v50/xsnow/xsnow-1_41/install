How to compile:
---------------
To build:
	xmkmf
	make depend
	make
 
To run:
	./xsnow
    or:
	./xsnow&  (in the background)
 
To install (be root):
	make install
	make install.man

If xmkmf does not work and you cannot get a working Makefile that way
then try compiling yourself, eh, xsnow this way: 

	cc -o xsnow snow.c  -lXext -lX11 -lXpm -lm -lsocket -lnsl
 
gcc, SUN Solaris users without a C-compiler, but with gcc installed,
try the following two commands. The first compiles Xsnow, the second
links Xsnow.
 
	gcc -c -O2 -I/usr/openwin/include -DSVR4 -DSYSV xsnow.c
	gcc -o xsnow xsnow.o -O2 -L/usr/openwin/lib -lXext -lX11 -lXpm -lm -lsocket -lnsl
 
Note: Xsnow-1.41 needs the Xpm library. It is available from:

	ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/

The current Xpm version is xpm3.4k                                                       

More information in the README file.

Merry X-mas!
