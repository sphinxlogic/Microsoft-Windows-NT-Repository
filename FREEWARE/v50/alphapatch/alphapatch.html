Have you ever been puzzled or frustrated by the absence of PATCH/ABSOLUTE
on the alpha? -- I sure have been.

<p>
Since we don't actually have a 'patch' for alpha, the next best thing would
be to VEST vax patch to the alpha. Unfortunately, patch is linked with
VMS, and VEST promptly coughs up the following furball:
<pre>    AXP$ VEST PATCH.EXE
    %VEST-F-LNKSYS, Image is linked against OpenVMS VAX and references symbols
    in it -- not translatable
    %VEST-F-TRANSFATAL, Translation was impossible
    %VEST-I-BZZZT, Wrong Answer! Thank you for playing.
    -VEST-I-GIFTS, We have some nice porting gifts for you.
    AXP$</pre>
(Well almost anyway. I made those last two up.... :)

<p>
During a recent discussion with "the openvms wizard", it was discovered that he
had actually *PATCHED* PATCH to bypass this problem with VEST!!! Well, with
that revelation in hand, I set out to duplicate this effort and get PATCH/ABS
up on alpha. The rest of this article is a discussion of how you too can
run a VESTed PATCHed PATCH on the alpha.

<p>
Parts list:
<ul>
<li>	VAX/VMS &amp; AXP/VMS (I used v 6.2)</li>
<li>	VEST (DECMIGRATE)</li>
<li>	UNMESSAGE (ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/fileserv/unmessage.zip)</li>
<li>	VERB (ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/fileserv/verb.zip)</li>
<li>	1 Copy of VAX SYS$SYSTEM:PATCH.EXE</li>
<li>	1 Copy of VAX SYS$HELP:PATCHHELP.HLB</li>
<li>	1 Copy of VAX SYS$MESSAGE:PRGDEVMSG.EXE</li>
</ul>

<p>
Starting with the error message given above, the next step is to use ANALYZE
/IMAGE/INTERACT to look at exactly *what* the system linkage looks like.
This looks like the following:
<pre>    VAX$ analyze/image/inter patch

    Press RETURN to continue, or enter a period (.) for next file:

<p>
The first problem is the system version array. There may be others, but for
starters, let's just shut the system version array down cold &amp; go from there.
We can get away with this because the reference to the image activator version
is most likely due to patch's handling of VAX images when NOT operating in
ABSOLUTE mode. We're only going to use ABSOLUTE mode on the Alpha anyway.
The version check was put there during image link as a safety precaution to
stop execution of patch if the host version of VMS differs from what PATCH
expected.
<p>
The first block of an image is described by an IHDDEF structure for which the
layout can be found in SYS$SHARE:LIB.REQ. The symbol IHD$W_VERSION_ARRAY_OFF,
value 10 contains an offset to the version array. If we just stuff a zero in
there, then the version array should go away... So, on the VAX, we do this:
<pre>    VAX$ patch/abs patch.exe

      PATCH  Version 6.2    5-MAY-1994
    
    %PATCH-I-NOGBL, some or all global symbols not accessible
    %PATCH-I-NOLCL, image does not contain local symbols
    PATCH>exam/word 0a
    0000000A:  00B0
    PATCH>dep/w .=0
    old:    0000000A:  00B0
    new:    0000000A:  0000
    PATCH>upd
    %PATCH-I-WRTFIL, updating image file DEVL:[VAXPATCH.ARTICLE]PATCH.EXE;2
    PATCH>Exit</pre>

<p>
If we repeat the analyze/image, it tells us that the system version array is
empty. So.... we try the VEST again...
<pre>    AXP$ vest patch/nofeedback
    %VEST-I-LNKSYSOK, Image is linked against OpenVMS VAX but references no symbols in it -- translation possible
    %VEST-W-UNSUPABSREF, Reference to unsupported absolute address IMG$DECODE_IHD (S0_space+00002780)
        At:    00014093 (00014093)
        Input: CALLS  S^#07,@#80002780
    %VEST-W-UNSUPABSREF, Reference to unsupported absolute address IMG$GET_NEXT_ISD (S0_space+00002788)
        At:    0001430F (0001430F)
        Input: CALLS  S^#07,@#80002788
    %VEST-W-TRANSWARN, Translation completed with warnings -- review them before using the output image</pre>

<p>
The UNSUPABSREF messages refer to IMG$...IHD routines that caused the reference
to SYS$K_IMAGE_ACTIVATOR that we blew away. We'll assume that these routines
are used for patching images rather than PATCH/ABSOLUTE. So we'll try it out:
<pre>    AXP$ r patch_tv
    %CLI-F-SYNTAX, error parsing 'ABSOLUTE'
    -CLI-E-ENTNF, specified entity not found in command tables</pre>

<p>
Oops.... need a CLD... Use VERB on the VAX to extract the PATCH.CLD from the
VAX dcltables, edit it, change the 'image PATCH' statement to
'image wherever:[dir]PATCH_TV'
<pre>    VAX$ verb patch /out=patch.cld
    VAX$ edit patch.cld</pre>

<p>
Nowww try it....
<pre>    AXP$ copy sys$login:login.com sys$disk:[]fodder.dat
    AXP$ set command patch
    AXP$ patch/absolute fodder.dat

      PATCH  Version 6.2    5-MAY-1994

    %PATCH-I-NOMSG, Message number 006D81D3
    %PATCH-I-NOMSG, Message number 006D81CB
    PATCH>Exit</pre>

<p>
Whoops... Something is still wrong here. Looks like the message definitions
for patch are not present on the alpha.  On the VAX, these messages are defined
in SYS$MESSAGE:PRGDEVMSG.EXE. This file exists on the alpha also, but does not
contain the PATCH messages. The implication is that we need to extract the
patch messages from the VAX, and place them _somewhere_ on the alpha. Putting
them into PRGDEVMSG.EXE seems like the wrong answer because I don't really
want to modify the alpha PRGDEVMSG.EXE. A better approach is to create a new
SYS$MESSAGE:PATCHMSG.EXE. Use UNMESSAGE on the VAX to extract the PATCH message
definitions from PRGDEVMSG. Unmessage all of PRGDEVMSG, output to PATCHMSG.MSG,
and edit out all non-patch message stuff. (And while we're at it, let's snag a
copy of the VAX PATCHHELP.HLB file too).
<pre>    VAX$ UNMESS SYS$MESSAGE:PRGDEVMSG /OUT=PATCHMSG.MSG
    VAX$ EDIT PATCHMSG.MSG
       (Keep the stuff from .FACILITY PATCH.... to the next .FACILITY line)</pre>
Now build the Alpha patchmsg.exe:
<pre>    AXP$ MESSAGE PATCHMSG
    AXP$ LINK PATCHMSG/SHAR</pre>

<p>
The next step is to patch patch to use the new patchmsg file. We'll do this
on the VAX version of PATCH, and re-vest the image. Of course, we'll need to
know _where_ to patch patch too.
<pre>    VAX$ COPY SYS$HELP:PATCHHELP.HLB []
    VAX$ DUMP PATCH.EXE/OUT=PATCH.DMP
    VAX$ EDIT PATCH.DMP
      --Find PRGDEVMSG, note virtual block number and offset
        Mine is in VBN 123 (Hex 7b) at offset hex 20.</pre>
Note that the data is an ASCIC (ASCII Counted) string. We'll now replace
the sequence {9}PRGDEVMSG with {8}PATCHMSG{0}
<pre>    VAX$ patch/abs patch.exe

      PATCH  Version 6.2    5-MAY-1994

    %PATCH-I-NOGBL, some or all global symbols not accessible
    %PATCH-I-NOLCL, image does not contain local symbols
    PATCH>dep/byt 7a*200+20=8
    old:    0000F420:  09
    new:    0000F420:  08
    PATCH>dep/asci 7a*200+21
    NEW>'PATC'
    NEW>'HMSG'
    NEW>exit
    old:    0000F421:  'PRGD'
    old:    0000F425:  'EVMS'
    new:    0000F421:  'PATC'
    new:    0000F425:  'HMSG'
    PATCH>dep/byt 7a*200+29=0
    old:    0000F429:  47
    new:    0000F429:  00
    PATCH>upd
    %PATCH-I-WRTFIL, updating image file DEVL:[VAXPATCH.ARTICLE]PATCH.EXE;3
    PATCH>exit</pre>
If you noticed, I used '7a' when inside PATCH, but the VBN we patched was
'7b'. This is because VBNs (virtual block numbers) start with 1, but PATCH
starts counting bytes at 0.
<p>
Now on the alpha, re-vest the image. We get the same messages as before, and
we'll still ignore them. Now let's copy the help file and the message file
into the right places, then try it again:
<pre>    AXP$ COPY PATCHHELP.HLB SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]
    AXP$ COPY PATCHMSG.EXE SYS$COMMON:[SYSMSG]
    AXP$ patch/absolute fodder.dat

      PATCH  Version 6.2    5-MAY-1994

    %PATCH-I-NOGBL, some or all global symbols not accessible
    %PATCH-I-NOLCL, image does not contain local symbols
    PATCH>
      :</pre>

<p>
After some playing around, we can tell that it seems to work... Probably
a good time to call it soup, (though there are a few more interesting
things that could be tried to neaten it up a bit).
