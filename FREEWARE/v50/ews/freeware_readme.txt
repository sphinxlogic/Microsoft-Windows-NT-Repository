EWS, Utilities, VAXELN Windowing Software

  The VAXELN Window Server (EWS) package provides a way to use a VAX
  workstations as an X Windows terminal.

  EWS is a collection of software components that are used to set up a
  network environment in which an OpenVMS host system provides DECwindows
  services for specific X Windows client terminals -- these EWS client
  systems bootstrap and run the (included) EWS client software.

  The EWS Client is based on the VAXELN operating system environment, and
  supports specific Compaq VAX workstations and X Windows terminals.
  Please see the included documentation for configuration requirements
  and details.

  As with other X Windows terminals, an EWS client can be accessed from
  a variety of X Windows platforms.
