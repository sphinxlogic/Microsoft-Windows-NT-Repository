1 WILD-CARDS

Wild-card Characters:

Some  commands   accept   wild-card   character   specifications   for
parameters.  The server uses the following wild-card characters:

*      Matches any number of any characters in the current character position

%      Matches exactly 1 character in the current character position

For example, in the following command:

InfoServer> SHOW SERVICE AB%DE*

all services that start with the letters AB are shown, followed by any
single  character,  followed by the letters DE, followed by any number
of any characters.

--

1 SPECIAL-CHARACTERS

Special Characters:

The InfoServer  management  interface  treats  certain  characters  as
special characters:

DELETE           Deletes the previous character in the current command line.
RETURN           Executes the current command and terminates the command.
Ctrl/B           Recalls the previous command.
Ctrl/D           Moves the cursor position back one character in the command
                 line.
Ctrl/E           Moves the cursor to the end of the current command line.
Ctrl/F           Moves the cursor position forward one character in the
                 command line.
Ctrl/H           Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current command line.
Ctrl/U           Deletes all characters from the current cursor position back
                 to the beginning of the command line.
Ctrl/Z           Executes the current command and terminates the command.
Up-arrow         Recalls the previous command.
Down-arrow       Recalls the next command in the command circular buffer.
Left-arrow       Moves the cursor back one character in the command
                 line.
Right-Arrow      Moves the cursor forward one character in the
                 command line.

1 BACKUP

BACKUP

Use the BACKUP command to make copies of an InfoServer-formatted disk,
preserving  the  associated  service  information.   Use  the RETRIEVE
command to restore the disks from backup copies.  A  BACKUP  operation
followed by an immediate RETRIEVE operation defragments the disk.  You
can use the BACKUP command to move the entire contents of one disk  to
a disk of dissimilar size.

To preserve data integrity, no remote disk  operations  are  permitted
during  BACKUP  operations:  the server must be in the OFF state.  See
the SET SERVER STATE  OFF  command.   See  the  RETRIEVE  command  for
information on restoring from a BACKUP operation.

2 BACKUP DEFRAGMENTATION

Defragmentation

Over time, as partitions are created and deleted, InfoServer disks can
become fragmented.  SHOW PARTITIONS DKn FULL shows the space allocated
to  deleted  partitions  and  the  amount  of  free  space.    Deleted
partitions can be reused by the file system, but the largest partition
that may be created is the largest of the deleted  partitions  or  the
free  space.   Thus,  a device could have 100,000 free blocks, but the
largest partition that can be created might be much smaller.

Defragmentation requires a disk device on which to  stage  the  backup
copy   of   the  disk  being  defragmented.   The  staging  device  is
initialized, and any data on the disk before the  operation  is  lost.
The  following example assumes that DK1 is being defragmented and that
DK15 (an additional hard disk) is being used for the staging disk:

InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
InfoServer> BACKUP DK1 DK15
InfoServer> RETRIEVE DK15 DK1
InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON
InfoServer> SAVE

--
2 BACKUP REPLICATION

Replicating a disk

Suppose your X terminals have been using an RZ55 disk  as  the  remote
device,  but  now  you are adding more terminals and you want to use a
larger disk.  As with defragmentation, you must stage the data  on  an
intermediate  disk.   (Tapes  devices are not yet supported for BACKUP
operations.) The following example assumes that DK8 is the RZ55,  DK11
is  the  destination  disk, and DK15 is a device large enough to stage
the data.

InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
InfoServer> BACKUP DK8 DK15
InfoServer> RETRIEVE DK15 DK11

At this point, you might want to INITIALIZE DK8.  This operation  both
frees  up  the disk and deletes all services that reference partitions
that have moved to DK15.  If you  do  not  INITIALIZE  the  disk,  you
should delete the services pointing to the original source disk before
entering the SAVE command.

InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON
InfoServer> SAVE

--
2 BACKUP SAVING

BACKUP src-device dest-device

The  BACKUP  command  copies   partitions   and   services   from   an
InfoServer-formatted   source  disk  to  the  destination  disk.   The
destination  disk  can  be  manipulated  by  standard  user  interface
commands.   The  SHOW  PARTITIONS command displays disk partitions and
prints a message describing the disk as a BACKUP disk.   Tape  devices
are not currently supported for BACKUP operations.

During a BACKUP operation, the destination device is initialized,  the
partitions   are  copied  from  the  source,  and  any  services  that
referenced the source device are  saved  to  the  BACKUP_CONFIGURATION
partition on the destination disk.

Example:

InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
InfoServer> BACKUP DK1 DK15
InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON

--
1 RETRIEVE

RETRIEVE src-device dest-device

Use the RETRIEVE command to restore the partitions and services from a
disk  that was created by the BACKUP command.  If the source device is
not a BACKUP disk, the server issues an error message.   Tape  devices
are  not currently supported for RETRIEVE operations (see HELP for the
BACKUP command).

During a RETRIEVE operation, the destination  device  is  initialized,
the  partitions are copied from the source, and the services that were
saved are restored.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  To preserve the services that were restored, you must
enter a SAVE command after the RETRIEVE operation.

Example:

InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
InfoServer> RETRIEVE DK15 DK1
InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON
InfoServer> SAVE

--
1 BIND

BIND ODS-2_service_name

Use the  BIND  command  to  establish  a  network  connection  to  the
specified  ODS-2 service and create the virtual device VDK1:  for that
service.  The virtual device is used as if it were a locally  attached
compact disk drive.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> BIND UPDATE_SERVICE

Additional information available for optional qualifier:

PASSWORD

++
2 BIND PASSWORD

BIND ODS-2_service_name PASSWORD string

Use the PASSWORD option when making a connection to an  ODS-2  service
that is password protected.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> BIND UPDATE_SERVICE PASSWORD TFORTWO

--

1 CLEAR

CLEAR

Use the CLEAR command  to  erase  the  screen  of  an  ANSI-compatible
terminal.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CLEAR

--

1 COPY

COPY DKn:[partition_name] DKn:[partition_name]

Use the COPY command  to  copy  data  between  InfoServer  devices  or
partitions.   The first parameter specifies the source device, and the
second parameter specifies the destination device.  If  you  omit  the
optional  partition_name  from  either  parameter, the server uses the
entire device for the copy operation.  If you  specify  a  destination
partition  that does not exist, the COPY command creates the partition
before starting the copy operation.

Copy operations require that the source  and  destination  devices  or
partitions  are  the  same  size.   To  preserve  data  integrity, the
InfoServer state must be set to OFF before  any  copy  operations  are
executed (see the description of the SET SERVER STATE command).

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> COPY DK2: DK1:
          InfoServer> COPY DK1:MY_PARTITION DK1:BACKUP

--

1 CRASH

CRASH

Use the CRASH command to force server software to take a  recognizable
bugcheck and create a dump.  Crashdump processing must be enabled.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CRASH

--

1 CREATE

CREATE

Use the CREATE  command  to  create  a  new  InfoServer  partition  or
service.

Additional information available:

PARTITION      SERVICE

++
2 CREATE PARTITION

CREATE PARTITION DKn:partition_name

Use the CREATE PARTITION command to  create  a  new  partition  on  an
InfoServer-formatted read/write disk.  A partition is a logical subset
of disk blocks that can be served to the network as though it were  an
entire disk.

The CREATE PARTITION command accepts as  a  parameter  a  device  name
coupled  with a partition name (for example, DK1:VIRTUALDISK) followed
by the size of the partition in BLOCKS, BYTES,  or  MEGABYTES.   Bytes
are  rounded  up  to  the  nearest  block.   The maximum length of the
partition name is 36 characters.  The command also accepts  ERASE  and
MOP options.

EXAMPLES: InfoServer> CREATE PARTITION DK1:VIRTUAL_DISK BLOCKS 1000 ERASE
          InfoServer> CREATE PARTITION DK1:MOP_IMAGE MEGABYTES 3 MOP ENABLED

Additional information available:

BLOCKS        ERASE        MOP

++
3 CREATE PARTITION BLOCKS

CREATE PARTITION DKn:partition_name {BLOCKS | BYTES | MEGABYTES} value

These parameters specify the size of the partition (one disk block  is
512  bytes).  If you omit this parameter, you are prompted for a BLOCK
value.

--
3 CREATE PARTITION ERASE

CREATE PARTITION DKn:partition_name ERASE

The ERASE qualifier specifies that the partition is to be erased  when
it is created.  The erase algorithm is a single-pass write of zeros.

--
3 CREATE PARTITION MOP

CREATE PARTITION DKn:partition_name MOP {ENABLED | DISABLED}

The MOP qualifier specifies whether the partition is to  be  used  for
downline  loading.   If  a partition is created with MOP ENABLED, then
that partition cannot be served to the network as a virtual disk,  and
can be used only for downline loading.  If a partition is created with
MOP DISABLED, then the partition can be served to  the  network  as  a
virtual  disk  and  cannot  be  used  for  downline  loading.  If this
optional qualifier is omitted, the default value of  MOP  DISABLED  is
used.

--
2 CREATE SERVICE

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name]

Use the CREATE SERVICE command to create a new service to which client
systems  on  the  extended LAN can connect.  The command specifies the
service name and the associated device or partition name.  The  CREATE
SERVICE command also accepts a number of optional qualifiers.

Service names are restricted to a maximum length of 80 characters  and
may contain only characters in the following set:

    A-Z               a-z          0-9
    $ (dollar sign)   . (period)   _ (underscore)    - (hyphen)
    Multinational characters in the (decimal) range 192-255

EXAMPLES: InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE CONDIST FOR DK2:
          InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE VIRTUAL-DISK FOR DK1:MY_PARTITION

Additional information available for optional qualifiers:

CLASS           CONTAINER       DYNAMIC_RATING  PASSWORD        READAHEAD
READBEHIND      READERS         STATIC_RATING   WRITERS

++
3 CREATE SERVICE CLASS

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] CLASS class_name

The CLASS qualifier specifies the service  class  (name  space)  under
which  the  service  is  offered.   Different  name spaces are used to
represent different  on-disk  structures.   Clients  connect  only  to
service classes that are meaningful to them.

If you omit the CLASS option, the server attempts to use  all  classes
for file systems found on the device.  If the on-disk format cannot be
determined, the server uses the ODS_2 class.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: CLASS V2.0
          InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE ULTRIX_BOOK FOR DK13 CLASS ULTRIX

Additional information available:

Class_Name

++
3 CREATE SERVICE CONTAINER

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] CONTAINER

The CONTAINER qualifier searches the source disk or partition  for  an
ISO9660  container  file.   This service is then tied to the container
file instead of the disk.  This option is used to verify  a  container
file before it is recorded on a CDROM.

If no container file is found then the command returns with no service
created.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE VIRTUAL_CD FOR DK2:PARTITION CLASS CONTAINER

--
4 CREATE SERVICE CLASS CLASS_NAME

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] CLASS class_name

Valid class_name values are the following:
APPLE             (Apple hierarchical or flat volumes)
HIGH_SIERRA       (High Sierra Group (HSG) compact disc format)
ISO_9660          (ISO 9660 compact disc format)
MOP               (MOP-loadable service name)
MSDOS             (MS-DOS virtual disks)
NTFS              (Windows NT file system)
ODS_2             (VMS virtual disks)
ULTRIX            (ULTRIX virtual disks)
UNFORMATTED       (Virtual disk has no format)
V2.0              (Names understood by MS-DOS clients)
VXT_WORKGROUP     (X-terminal workgroups)
VXT_SYSTEM        (X-terminal system disks)
VXT_CONFIGURATION (X-terminal configuration information)
VXT_PAGEFILE      (X-terminal paging information)

--
3 CREATE SERVICE DYNAMIC_RATING

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] DYNAMIC_RATING

The  DYNAMIC_RATING  option  indicates  that  the  InfoServer   should
calculate  a  dynamic  rating  for the created service.  The rating is
used to balance the client  access  load  across  redundant  services.
Clients  select  the  highest  rated  service when the same service is
offered  more  than  once  on  the  network.   The  InfoServer  system
calculates  a  new  dynamic  rating  for the service every 10 seconds,
based on server CPU load and service I/O activity.  DYNAMIC_RATING  is
the default value.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: DYNAMIC_RATING

--
3 CREATE SERVICE PASSWORD

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] PASSWORD [string]
CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] NOPASSWORD

The PASSWORD option indicates that a password is required from  client
systems  before the server accepts connections to the created service.
The string specifies the required password.  If the password string is
omitted,  and  the  PASSWORD  option is the last option on the command
line, the InfoServer system prompts you for the password.

The NOPASSWORD option indicates  that  no  password  is  required  for
clients  to connect to the created service.  NOPASSWORD is the default
value.

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: PASSWORD SECRET
           InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: PASSWORD
           _Password: SECRET (not echoed)
           _Verification: SECRET (not echoed)

If you omit the password option, no password is needed to  access  the
service.

--

3 CREATE SERVICE READAHEAD

CREATE SERVICE service_name READAHEAD
CREATE SERVICE service_name NOREADAHEAD

The READAHEAD option for a service determines whether blocks following
a  request  are  also  inserted into cache.  The number of blocks read
into the cache is determined by the  value  of  the  CACHE  BUCKETSIZE
parameter.    If  the  READAHEAD  attribute  is  enabled,  the  blocks
following a request are loaded into cache up to the next cache  bucket
boundary.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE CONDOC FOR DK2: READAHEAD

--
3 CREATE SERVICE READBEHIND

CREATE SERVICE service_name READBEHIND
CREATE SERVICE service_name NOREADBEHIND

The  READBEHIND  option  for  a  service  determines  whether   blocks
preceding  a  request  are  also  inserted  into cache.  The number of
blocks that are read into the cache is determined by the value of  the
CACHE  BUCKETSIZE  parameter.  If the READBEHIND attribute is enabled,
the blocks  preceding  a  request  are  loaded  into  cache  from  the
beginning of the bucket up to the current request.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE CONDOC FOR DK2: READBEHIND

--
3 CREATE SERVICE STATIC_RATING

CREATE SERVICE  service_name  FOR  DKn:[partition_name]  STATIC_RATING
rating

The STATIC_RATING option indicates  that  the  InfoServer  should  not
periodically  calculate  a  rating for the service based on InfoServer
load.  Instead, the service has a constant rating, which is the  value
specified  on  the command line.  The rating value can be in the range
from 0 to 65535.  Clients select the service with the highest  service
rating.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: STATIC_RATING 1

The default value of DYNAMIC_RATING is used for the created service if
the STATIC_RATING option is omitted.

--

3 CREATE SERVICE READERS

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] READERS number
CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] NOREADERS


The  READERS  option  indicates  the  number  of   concurrent   client
connections  allowed  to  the  service for read access.  The number of
readers can be from 0 to 1000.  The default value of 1000 is used  for
READERS if this option is omitted.

The NOREADERS option indicates that client read access to the  created
service is not allowed.  This option is the same as specifying READERS
as 0.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: READERS 1


--

3 CREATE SERVICE WRITERS

CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] WRITERS number
CREATE SERVICE service_name FOR DKn:[partition_name] NOWRITERS


The  WRITERS  option  indicates  the  number  of   concurrent   client
connections  allowed  to  the service for write access.  The number of
writers can be either 0 or 1.  The default value  of  1  is  used  for
WRITERS if this option is omitted.

The NOWRITERS option indicates that client write access to the created
service is not allowed.  This option is the same as specifying WRITERS
as 0.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: WRITERS 0


--

1 DELETE

DELETE

Use the DELETE command to delete an existing InfoServer  partition  or
service.

Additional information available:

PARTITION       SERVICE

++
2 DELETE PARTITION

DELETE PARTITION DKn:partition_name [ERASE]

Use the DELETE PARTITION command to delete an existing partition on an
InfoServer-formatted read/write disk.  The disk space that the deleted
partition occupied is made available again.  Use the ERASE  option  to
erase  the  partition  when  it  is deleted.  The erase algorithm is a
single-pass write of zeros.

If the partition being deleted has  associated  service  names,  those
names  are  also deleted.  If clients are accessing the partition when
you enter the DELETE PARTITION command, the server  issues  a  warning
message and prompts for confirmation of the DELETE operation.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> DELETE PARTITION DK1:VIRTUAL_DISK

--
2 DELETE SERVICE

DELETE SERVICE service_name [FOR DKn:[partition_name]]
                            [CLASS class_name]

Use the DELETE SERVICE command to delete  an  existing  service  name.
Wild-card specifications are allowed for the service name.

The DELETE SERVICE  command  accepts  optional  qualifiers.   You  can
specify  the device name or partition name for the service you want to
delete if  the  service  is  offered  for  more  than  one  device  or
partition.  You can also specify the service class if the same service
name is offered under more than one service class.  If you omit either
of these qualifiers, all matching service names are deleted.

EXAMPLES: InfoServer> DELETE SERVICE CON_DIST*
          InfoServer> DELETE SERVICE ONLINE_DOC FOR DK2:
          InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE VIRTUAL-DISK CLASS V2.0

Additional information available for optional qualifiers:

CLASS

++
3 DELETE SERVICE CLASS

DELETE SERVICE service_name [FOR DKn:[partition_name]] CLASS class_name

The CLASS qualifier specifies the service class of the partition to be
deleted.   If  the same service name exists under two or more classes,
this qualifier allows you  to  delete  one  specific  service  without
deleting the others.

Valid class_name values are the following:

APPLE             (Apple hierarchical or flat volumes)
HIGH_SIERRA       (High Sierra Group (HSG) compact disc format)
ISO_9660          (ISO 9660 compact disc format)
MOP               (MOP-loadable service name)
MSDOS             (MS-DOS virtual disks)
NTFS              (Windows NT file system)
ODS_2             (VMS virtual disks)
ULTRIX            (ULTRIX virtual disks)
UNFORMATTED       (Virtual disk has no format)
V2.0              (Names understood by MS-DOS clients)
VXT_WORKGROUP     (X-terminal workgroups)
VXT_SYSTEM        (X-terminal system disks)
VXT_CONFIGURATION (X-terminal configuration information)
VXT_PAGEFILE      (X-terminal paging information)

--

1 DISCONNECT

DISCONNECT [LAT | LAST] [SESSION] session_number

Use the DISCONNECT command to disconnect a LASTport  or  LAT  session.
If  you omit the LAST or LAT keyword, the server assumes that you want
to disconnect a  LASTport  session.   Session_number  indicates  which
session  you  want  to disconnect.  The SHOW SESSIONS command displays
current sessions.

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> DISCONNECT LAST SESSION 1
           InfoServer> DISCONNECT LAT SESSION 24

--
1 EXIT

EXIT

Use the EXIT command to terminate a management session.  You can  also
use  the  LOGOUT  command  to  terminate  a management session.  These
commands exit to the password prompt on a local console or terminate a
remote LAT session.

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> EXIT
           InfoServer> LOGOUT

--
1 ERASE

ERASE device[:partition_name] {FUNCTIONS | SERVICES}

Use the ERASE command  to  erase  the  specified  read/write  disk  or
partition  or  FUNCTIONS  or SERVICES data on NVRAM.  The server state
must be set OFF before you execute this command.

The ERASE algorithm is a single-pass write of zeros.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> ERASE NVRAM SERVICES

--

1 INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE DKn:

Use the INITIALIZE command to create the on-disk  structure  for  disk
partitions  on  a  read/write  disk.   Once a read/write disk has been
initialized, you can create partitions on  the  disk  or  save  system
configuration  parameters  to  the  disk.   To  execute the INITIALIZE
command,  you  must  set  the  server  state  off.   Initializing   or
reinitializing a device erases all data on the device.

By default, the internal read/write disk on  InfoServer  100  and  150
systems  is  already  initialized.  You cannot initialize the internal
FLASH device on InfoServer 1000 systems.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> INITIALIZE DK12:

--

1 LOOP

LOOP [command]

Use the LOOP command to repeat  any  valid  InfoServer  command.   The
command  takes  an optional InfoServer command as a parameter.  If you
omit the InfoServer command, the server prompts you for it.

The LOOP command continues to repeat the command until you  enter  any
keyboard  character.   Once you enter a character, the LOOP terminates
after the current command has been executed.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> LOOP SHOW DEVICES

1 MONITOR

MONITOR

Use the MONITOR command to repeat any valid  InfoServer  command  once
every  2-3 seconds.  Each time the InfoServer command is executed, the
cursor returns to the home position.  The MONITOR command continuously
updates  any  valid  InfoServer  SHOW display.  The command accepts an
optional  InfoServer  command  as  a  parameter.   If  you  omit   the
InfoServer command, the server prompts you for it.

The MONITOR command continues to repeat the command until you type any
keyboard  character.  Once you type a character, MONITOR terminates at
the end of the current command.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> MONITOR SHOW SERVER

1 PURGE VXT

PURGE VXT DKn:  [Dkm:]

If you decide not to purge old X terminal files when you  execute  the
UPDATE  VXT command, you can use the PURGE VXT command to do so later.
(For  more  information,  see  the  UPDATE  VXT  command.)  The  first
parameter  is  the drive containing the VXT distribution compact disc.
The second, optional parameter is the destination device.  If you omit
the second parameter, the InfoServer system uses, in order, one of the
following:

   o The disk from which the system booted, if the disk is writable
   o The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device number

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> PURGE VXT DK2:

--

1 REBOOT

REBOOT [YES]

Use the REBOOT command to cause the running server to  shut  down  and
restart   the  system  software.   If  you  omit  the  optional  "yes"
parameter, the server prompts you before performing the reboot.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> REBOOT
           _Are you sure you want to reboot the server now [No]? YES

--

1 RECORD

RECORD DKn[:partitionname] DKn[:]

Use the RECORD command to record the contents of the source device  to
a CDROM recorder attached to the InfoServer.


EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> RECORD DK1:STAGED_DATA DK2:

Additional information available:

HSFS    ISO     SIZE    SPEED   TEST    TIME

++

--

2 RECORD HSFS

RECORD DKn[:partition_name] DKn[:] HSFS

This parameter specifies that a High Sierra container file  exists  on
the  source partition and instructs the recorder to record the data as
a High Sierra CDROM.  If  no  container  file  is  found  the  command
returns with no operations performed.

This parameter cannot be used in conjunction with the ISO parameter.

--
2 RECORD ISO

RECORD DKn[:partition_name] DKn[:] ISO

This parameter specifies that a ISO9660 container file exists  on  the
source  partition  and instructs the recorder to record the data as an
ISO9660 CDROM.  If no container file is found the command returns with
no operations performed.

This parameter cannot be used in conjunction with the HSFS parameter.

--
2 RECORD SIZE

RECORD DKn[:partition_name] DKn[:] SIZE valueinbytes

This parameter specifies the amount of data, in bytes, to be  recorded
onto  the  CDROM.   If  omitted the source disk or partition size will
determine the size of the resulting CDROM.

--
2 RECORD SPEED

RECORD DKn[:partition_name] DKn[:] SPEED {1|2|4}

This parameter specifies the speed  at  which  the  record  will  take
place.   This is either 1, 2 or 4 times the speed of an audio CD.  The
Default speed if the parameter is omitted is  2,  even  for  recorders
that support 4X recording.

Not all speeds are supported by all recorders.  Refer to your recorder
documentation for more information.

--
2 RECORD TEST

RECORD DKn[:partition_name] DKn[:] TEST

This parameter causes the recorder to perform all of the functions  of
recording  a  CDROM without actually writing a CDROM.  This feature is
useful for verifying the source device can maintain  sufficient  speed
to perform an actual record.

This parameter is not supported  by  all  recorders.   Refer  to  your
recorder documentation for more information.

--
2 RECORD TIME

RECORD DKn[:partition_name] DKn[:] TIME valueinminutes

This parameter controls how often, in  minutes,  update  messages  are
printed  to  the  screen  while  a  record  is  taking place.  If this
parameter is omitted then a default value of  1  minute  is  used.   A
value of 0 disables the printing of any update messages.

1 RESTORE

RESTORE [DKn:]

Use the RESTORE command to restore  from  the  system  device  to  the
running  server all parameters previously saved with the SAVE command.
Any services previously  saved  are  added  to  the  current  list  of
services.   You  can optionally specify the device from which you want
to restore the system configuration.  If you omit the device name, the
InfoServer system uses, in order, one of the following:

   o NVRAM for InfoServer 1000 systems
   o The device from which the system booted, if the device is writable
   o The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device number

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> RESTORE

--
1 REWIND

REWIND TPn:

Use the REWIND command to rewind the tape on the specified tape  drive
without unloading the tape.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> REWIND TP15:

--

1 SAVE

SAVE [DKn:]

The SAVE command saves a snapshot of the current system  configuration
and writes all the services, device states, and system parameters to a
read/write device on the system.

You can optionally specify an InfoServer device as the destination  of
the  save  operation.   If  you  omit  the device name, the InfoServer
system uses, in order, one of the following:

   o NVRAM for InfoServer 1000 systems
   o The device from which the system booted, if the device is writable
   o The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device number

When the server boots, it searches the  boot  device  for  the  system
configuration  partition  (called  CONFIGURATION),  to  which the SAVE
command writes configuration data.  The server automatically sets  all
system parameters from this partition.

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> SAVE
           InfoServer> SAVE DK12:

--
1 SET

SET

Use the SET command to modify the InfoServer or an existing InfoServer
entity.   InfoServer  entities that can be modified include partitions
and services.  The SET command modifies attributes of the server or  a
server entity.

++
2 SET DEVICE AUTOMOUNT

SET DEVICE [ALL | device-list] AUTOMOUNT {ENABLED | DISABLED}

Use the SET DEVICE  command  to  enable  or  disable  automounting  of
devices, such as compact discs, that are not in InfoServer format.  If
you specify a device list, use commas to separate the  devices.   Note
that serverwide automount must already be enabled (see the description
of the SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT command).

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET DEVICE DK3,DK4 AUTOMOUNT ENABLED

--
2 SET PARTITION

SET PARTITION DKn:partition_name MOP {ENABLED | DISABLED}

Use the SET PARTITION command to enable or disable the  partition  for
downline  loading.   If  a  partition  is  set to be MOP ENABLED, that
partition cannot be served to the network as a virtual disk and can be
used  only  for  downline  loading.   If  a partition is set to be MOP
DISABLED, the partition can be served to the network as a virtual disk
and cannot be used for downline loading.

EXAMPLE:  SET PARTITION DK1:PR0801ENG MOP ENABLED

--

2 SET SERVER

SET [SERVER]

Use the SET SERVER command to change the  InfoServer  characteristics.
When  a  SET  command  is  issued,  the  resulting change takes effect
immediately.  When you issue a SAVE command, all characteristics  that
have  been  SET  are preserved across InfoServer reboots.  For all SET
SERVER commands, the keyword SERVER is optional.

Additional information available:

AUTOMOUNT     CACHE          CRASHDUMP      EXTENSION
GROUP         LASTPORT       LAT_RESPONDER  IDENTIFICATION
MOP           MULTICAST      NAME           PASSWORD
PROMPT        REMOTE         STATE          WRITE

++
3 SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT

SET [SERVER] AUTOMOUNT {ENABLED | DISABLED}

Use the SET AUTOMOUNT command  to  enable  or  disable  the  automatic
serverwide  mounting  and serving of devices using the volume label as
the service name.  Tapes are not automounted.  By  default,  AUTOMOUNT
is enabled.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT ENABLED

--
3 SET SERVER CACHE

SET [SERVER] CACHE BUCKETSIZE {8 | 16 | 32}

Use the SET CACHE BUCKETSIZE command to change the  size  of  a  cache
bucket  in blocks.  Cache bucket size determines how many blocks ahead
or behind the current block are loaded into cache  when  a  read  from
disk  takes  place.  The actual number of blocks read is a function of
both cache bucket size and the service READAHEAD and READBEHIND flags.

SET [SERVER] CACHE SIZE n

The server cache size can be set from 1 to 3 megabytes less  than  the
total  amount  of system memory.  On an InfoServer with 8 megabytes of
system memory, the server cache  size  may  be  set  to  5,  6,  or  7
megabytes.   Any  remaining  server  memory  is  allocated  to pool to
maintain client connections.  A smaller cache  size  allows  for  more
concurrent client connections.

Because these values are read at boot time, they take effect when  the
server is rebooted.

EXAMPLES: InfoServer> SET SERVER CACHE BUCKETSIZE 16
          InfoServer> SET SERVER CACHE SIZE 2

--
3 SET SERVER CRASHDUMP

SET [SERVER] CRASHDUMP {ENABLED | DISABLED} [device:]

Use  the  SET  CRASHDUMP  command  to  enable  or  disable   crashdump
processing  in  the  event of an InfoServer crash.  When you enter the
SET CRASHDUMP  ENABLED  command,  the  server  creates  an  8000-block
partition  (called  the CRASH_PARTITION) for the memory dump.  You can
optionally specify a device to hold the dump.  If you omit the  device
parameter, the InfoServer system uses, in order, one of the following:

   o The device from which the system booted, if the device is writable
   o The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device number

The partition cannot be deleted with the DELETE PARTITION command  but
is removed when CRASHDUMP is DISABLED.

By default, CRASHDUMP is DISABLED.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER CRASHDUMP ENABLED

--
3 SET SERVER EXTENSION

SET [SERVER] EXTENSION [LIMIT] n

Use the SET EXTENSION command to limit the amount of  disk  space  (in
blocks)  that  any  single  remote client connection can consume.  The
command specifies a server-wide upper limit for the  size  of  virtual
disks created remotely.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER EXTENSION LIMIT 60000

--
3 SET SERVER GROUP

SET [SERVER] GROUP [CODES] {ALL | code-list} {ENABLED | DISABLED}

Use the SET GROUP command to enable or disable  the  LAT  group  codes
that  the  InfoServer  uses  to  advertise its management service.  To
connect to the InfoServer management interface, a terminal  server  or
other  LAT  node  must have at least one group code in common with the
group codes set for the InfoServer system.

Specifying ENABLE adds the specified LAT  group  codes  to  the  list;
DISABLE  removes  them.   The  "code-list"  can  include multiple code
numbers from 0 to 255, separated by a comma or by a hyphen to indicate
a  list.   Additionally, the keyword ALL can be used for the code list
to indicate that all  group  codes  should  be  enabled/disabled.   By
default, group code 0 is enabled.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER GROUP CODES 1, 10-20, 250-255 ENABLED


--
3 SET SERVER IDENTIFICATION

SET [SERVER] IDENTIFICATION "string"

Use the SET IDENTIFICATION command to set a descriptive string of 0 to
64  characters  to  be  associated  with  the InfoServer.  This string
advertised with each LAT announcement and can be displayed  by  remote
terminal  servers  to  help  identify  the  particular InfoServer.  By
default, no identification string is set.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET IDENTIFICATION "Server located on floor 3, pole G"


--
3 SET SERVER LAT_RESPONDER

SET [SERVER] LAT_RESPONDER {ENABLED | DISABLED}

The SET LAT_RESPONDER command enables or disables the InfoServer's LAT
responder  capability.   When LAT_RESPONDER is enabled, the InfoServer
system maintains a database of all LAT services available on  the  LAN
and  responds  to requests for this information from nodes that do not
maintain such a database.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER LAT_RESPONDER ENABLED

--
3 SET SERVER MOP

SET [SERVER] MOP [V4] {ENABLED | DISABLED}

Use the SET MOP command to enable or disable MOP downline  loading  by
the  InfoServer.   By  default,  the  server enables the MOP multicast
address and performs downline loading for any MOP images installed  on
the  server.   If  no  downline  load images are installed, MOP can be
disabled.

The  InfoServer  supports  both  Version  3.0  and  Version  4.0   MOP
protocols.   The default configuration enables MOP V3 downline loading
and disables MOP V4.  When MOP V4 is enabled, the InfoServer  responds
to both V3 and V4 downline load requests.

In local area networks with multiple servers, MOP V4 downline  loading
should  be  enabled  only  if there is a specific need to do so -- for
example, to downline load 802.3-only products.  In that case,  MOP  V4
should  be  enabled on only one server at a time.  Otherwise, attempts
by multiple servers to respond  to  a  load  request  within  a  brief
interval might conflict and cause the load to fail.

EXAMPLES: InfoServer> SET SERVER MOP ENABLED
          InfoServer> SET SERVER MOP V4 ENABLED

--
3 SET SERVER MULTICAST

SET [SERVER] MULTICAST [TIMER] value

Use the SET MULTICAST  command  to  change  the  frequency  which  the
InfoServer  advertises its LAT management service to the network.  The
timer value is expressed in seconds and can be in the range from 10 to
255.   By  default,  the  multicast  value  is  60,  meaning  that the
InfoServer management service is advertised to the  LAT  network  once
per minute.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER MULTICAST TIMER 30


--
3 SET SERVER NAME

SET [SERVER] NAME string

Use the SET NAME command to associate  a  new  name  string  with  the
InfoServer  system.  The NAME string is used as the management service
advertised over LAT.  The server name can be from 1 to  16  characters
in length and can include only the characters A-Z, 0-9, ".", "-", "_",
"$", or multinational characters  in  the  ASCII  range  192-255.   By
default,  the  server  name  is LAD_address, where "address" is the 12
hexadecimal digits representing  the  InfoServer's  Ethernet  address.
InfoServer names must be unique across the extended LAN.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER NAME TEST_INFOSERVER


--
3 SET SERVER PASSWORD

SET [SERVER] PASSWORD [PRIVILEGED | NONPRIVILEGED]
SET [SERVER] NOPASSWORD [PRIVILEGED | NONPRIVILEGED]

Use the SET  PASSWORD  command  to  change  either  of  the  passwords
required  to  access  the  InfoServer  management interface.  You must
enter the password at the console or at the local  terminal  interface
before a LAT connection is allowed to the remote management interface.
A password can be up to 16 characters long.  Either  password  may  be
set to the null string by specifying NOPASSWORD.

The default privileged password is "ESS".  The default  non-privileged
password  is  "INFOSERVER".   If both the PRIVILEGED and NONPRIVILEGED
keywords  are  omitted,  the  default  is  PRIVILEGED.   If  both  the
privileged and nonprivileged passwords are identical, the session will
be logged in as a privileged session.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER PASSWORD
          _New_password: SECRET (not echoed)
          _Verification: SECRET (not echoed)

--
3 SET SERVER PROMPT

SET [SERVER] PROMPT "prompt-string"


Use the SET PROMPT command  to  change  the  server  prompt  from  the
default   prompt   "InfoServer>".    The   prompt   can  be  a  useful
identification aid when connecting to various servers using LAT.   The
maximum  prompt  string  length is 24 characters.  One space is always
appended to the specified string.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET PROMPT "My Server>"
          My Server> SHOW SERVER

--
3 SET SERVER REMOTE

SET [SERVER] REMOTE [DEVICES] DKn:[,...] [{ENABLED | DISABLED}]

Use the SET REMOTE command to allow (or disallow)  remote  clients  to
create  virtual  disks  on  InfoServer  writable  disks.   To create a
service remotely on a specific device,  the  device  must  be  in  the
remote  device  list.   You use the SET REMOTE command to maintain the
remote device list.  To add devices  to  the  current  list,  use  the
ENABLED  keyword.   To  remove devices from the list, use the DISABLED
keyword.  If both keywords are omitted, the entire list is replaced by
the list on the command line.  (Use the SHOW SERVER command to display
the remote device list.)

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> SET SERVER REMOTE DEVICES DK1,DK15
                (The remote devices list is now DK1,DK15.)
           InfoServer> SET SERVER REMOTE DEVICES DK1 DISABLED
                (The remote devices list is now DK15.)
           InfoServer> SET SERVER REMOTE DEVICES DK1 ENABLED
                (The remote devices list is now DK1,DK15.)

--
3 SET SERVER STATE

SET [SERVER] STATE {ON | OFF | SHUT}

Use the SET SERVER STATE command to change the  operational  state  of
the server.

When the state is set ON (default), connections  to  InfoServer  disks
are allowed.

When the state is set OFF,  no  new  connections  to  the  server  are
allowed,  and  any  existing  connections  to  disks are broken.  This
setting is used during problem diagnosis, or if a parameter  needs  to
be changed that cannot be modified with existing connections.

Specify SHUT when shutting the server down.  No  new  connections  are
allowed  to InfoServer disks, but any existing connections are allowed
to continue until terminated by the remote client.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE SHUT


--
3 SET SERVER LASTPORT

SET [SERVER] LASTPORT [GROUP] value

Use the SET SERVER  LASTPORT  GROUP  command  to  set  the  InfoServer
LASTport group code.  LASTport groups are a method for segmenting LANs
so that only certain clients and InfoServer systems  can  communicate.
The  server  communicates  only  with  clients that belong to the same
LASTport group as the server.

The LASTPORT GROUP value is a decimal number in the range 0-1023.   By
default,  the  InfoServer  system  belongs  to  group 0.  Changing the
LASTport group changes the LASTport protocol  multicast  address  that
the server uses.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP 20

--
3 SET SERVER WRITE

SET [SERVER] WRITE [ACCESS] {BLOCKING | PRE-EMPTIVE}

Use the SET SERVER WRITE ACCESS command to change the  server's  write
access  policy.  The Server allows only one write session at a time to
a virtual disk and blocks all other sessions during the write session.
The  SET  SERVER  WRITE  ACCESS  command  controls how write access is
granted.

Specifying PRE-EMPTIVE (default) means  that  all  read  sessions  are
disconnected  when  a  write  session is initiated.  Read sessions are
allowed once the write session disconnects.

Specifying BLOCKING means that a write session cannot be initiated  if
read  sessions  are current.  The write session cannot start until all
read sessions are disconnected and the virtual disk is idle.

EXAMPLE: InfoServer> SET SERVER WRITE ACCESS BLOCKING

--
2 SET SERVICE

SET SERVICE service_name [FOR DKn:[partition_name]] [CLASS class_name]

Use the SET SERVICE  command  to  modify  the  characteristics  of  an
existing service.  The SET SERVICE command accepts a service name as a
parameter.  Wild-card service names are allowed.  The SET command also
accepts  an  optional  device  or partition name and an optional CLASS
name to further qualify the service.  If either  of  these  parameters
are  omitted,  all  services that match the specified service name are
modified.

The SET SERVICE command also takes a  number  of  optional  qualifiers
listed below.

EXAMPLES: InfoServer> SET SERVICE CON_DIST FOR DK2: WRITERS 0
          InfoServer> SET SERVICE DISK FOR DK2: CLASS V2.0 STATIC_RATING 0

Additional information available for optional qualifiers:

DYNAMIC_RATING  PASSWORD        STATIC_RATING   READAHEAD
READBEHIND      READERS         WRITERS

++
3 SET SERVICE DYNAMIC_RATING

SET SERVICE service_name DYNAMIC_RATING

The  DYNAMIC_RATING  option  indicates  that  the  InfoServer   should
calculate  a  dynamic  rating  for the created service.  The rating is
used to load-balance clients across redundant services.  Clients  will
select the highest rated service when the same service is offered more
than once on the network.  The InfoServer will calculate a new dynamic
rating  for the service every 10 seconds, based on server CPU load and
the I/O load to the service.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> SET SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: DYNAMIC_RATING

--
3 SET SERVICE PASSWORD

SET SERVICE service_name PASSWORD [string]
SET SERVICE service_name NOPASSWORD

The PASSWORD option indicates that a password is required from  client
systems  before  connections to the created service are accepted.  The
string specifies the required password.  If  the  password  string  is
omitted,  and  the  PASSWORD  option is the last option on the command
line, the server prompts you for the password.

The NOPASSWORD option indicates  that  no  password  is  required  for
clients  to  connect  to the specified service.  This command clears a
password previously set for a service.

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> SET SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: PASSWORD SECRET

           InfoServer> SET SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: PASSWORD
           _Password: SECRET (not echoed)
           _Verification: SECRET (not echoed)


--

3 SET SERVICE STATIC_RATING

SET SERVICE service_name STATIC_RATING rating

The  STATIC_RATING  option  indicates  that  the  server  should   not
periodically  calculate  a  rating for the service based on InfoServer
load.  Instead, the service has a constant rating which is  the  value
specified  on  the command line.  The rating value can be in the range
of 0-65535.  Larger rating  values  mean  better  service  access  for
clients.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> SET SERVICE TEST STATIC_RATING 1


--
3 SET SERVICE READAHEAD

SET SERVICE service_name READAHEAD
SET SERVICE service_name NOREADAHEAD

The READAHEAD option determines whether blocks following a request are
also inserted into cache.  The number of blocks read into the cache is
determined by the CACHE BUCKETSIZE parameter on the  server.   If  the
READAHEAD  attribute  is  enabled,  the blocks following a request are
loaded into cache up to the next cache bucket boundary.

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> SET SERVICE CONDOC FOR DK2: READAHEAD
           InfoServer> SET SERVICE PAGEFILE NOREADAHEAD

--
3 SET SERVICE READBEHIND

SET SERVICE service_name READBEHIND
SET SERVICE service_name NOREADBEHIND

The  READBEHIND  option  for  a  service  determines  whether   blocks
preceding  a  request  are  also  inserted  into cache.  The number of
blocks read into the cache  is  determined  by  the  CACHE  BUCKETSIZE
parameter  on the server.  If the READBEHIND attribute is enabled, the
blocks preceding a request are loaded into cache from the beginning of
the bucket up to the current request.

EXAMPLES:  InfoServer> SET SERVICE CONDOC FOR DK2: READBEHIND
           InfoServer> SET SERVICE PAGEFILE READBEHIND

--
3 SET SERVICE READERS

SET SERVICE service_name READERS number
SET SERVICE service_name NOREADERS

The  READERS  option  indicates  the  number  of   concurrent   client
connections  allowed  for  read  access to the service.  The number of
readers can be from 0 to 1000.

The NOREADERS option indicates that client read access to the  created
service is not allowed.  This option is the same as specifying READERS
as 0.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> SET SERVICE TEST FOR DK2: READERS 1


--
3 SET SERVICE WRITERS

SET SERVICE service_name WRITERS number
SET SERVICE service_name NOWRITERS

The  WRITERS  option  indicates  the  number  of   concurrent   client
connections  allowed  for  write access to the service.  The number of
writers can be either 0 or 1.

The NOWRITERS option indicates that client write access to the created
service is not allowed.  This option is the same as specifying WRITERS
as 0.

EXAMPLE:  InfoServer> SET SERVICE TEST WRITERS 0
