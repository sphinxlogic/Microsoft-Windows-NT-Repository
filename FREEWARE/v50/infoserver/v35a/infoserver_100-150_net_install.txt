	 Network Update Procedure for InfoServer 100/150 Systems

Important Note:

In order to do a network update, your InfoServer must have disk functions
enabled.  InfoServer 150/VXT systems are normally the only systems that do
not have disk functions enabled.  If SHOW FUNCTIONS does not tell you that
disk services are enabled, you cannot do a network update until you obtain
the function CD and install it.

The Software:

    Copy:	TAPE::ESS$KITS:[V35A]SYSBOOT.EXE
		TAPE::ESS$KITS:[V35A]HELP.MEM

Installing:

WARNING:	Failure to follow this procedure carefully may crash
		your VMS client system.  You have been warned.

1) 	Copy the software to a VMS system where you have a
	privileged account.


2)	Log into the InfoServer.  Create a service for the boot
	partition.

	InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE BOOT_PAR FOR DK1:BOOT_PARTITION

3)	Log into the VMS client system.  You will need a privileged account.
	Bind to the service.

	$ MCR ESS$LADCP BIND/WRITE/SYSTEM BOOT_PAR

4)	From VMS, initialize the virtual disk.  This will destroy the
	old version of the InfoServer software.  If anything goes wrong
	after this point, you will need to go back to step 1.

	$ INIT/SYS DAD$BOOT_PAR IS_SYS

5)	Mount the disk on the VMS client.

	$ MOUNT DAD$BOOT_PAR IS_SYS

6)	Create the system directories.

	$ CREATE/DIRECTORY DAD$BOOT_PAR:[SYSD.SYSEXE]/OWN=SYSTEM

7)	Copy the new software over.

	$ COPY/CONTIG SYSBOOT.EXE DAD$BOOT_PAR:[SYSD.SYSEXE]
	$ COPY/CONTIG HELP.MEM	DAD$BOOT_PAR:[SYSD.SYSEXE]

8)	Reboot the InfoServer.

	InfoServer> REBOOT YES

9)	When the InfoServer boots successfully, dismount the virtual disk.

$ DISMOUNT/UNLOAD DAD$BOOT_PAR
