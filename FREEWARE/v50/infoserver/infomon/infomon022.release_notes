	1  Problems Resolved in InfoServer Monitor V2.2

              InfoServer Monitor V2.1 will not mount disks when running
	      on OpenVMS V7.1 systems.

	      This is because OpenVMS now enforces a MOUNT calling
	      standard to which previous versions of InfoServer Monitor
	      did not adhere.

	2  New Features in InfoServer Monitor V2.2

	      InfoServer Monitor now displays error messages when a
	      disk cannot be mounted.

	      Common error messages include:

	      - %MOUNT-F-MEDOFL, medium is offline
	        This might indicate a problem with the InfoServer or
		the CD drive.

	      - %MOUNT-F-NOSUCHDEV, no such device available
	        This indicates the InfoServer service is not available
		on your network for some reason.

	      Error messages are displayed in the InfoServer Monitor
	      log file (SYS$MANAGER:INFOSERVER_MONITOR.LOG) in the
	      following format:

		 4-NOV-1996 15:00:19  Error mounting _DAD203:
				      %MOUNT-F-MEDOFL, medium is offline
		 4-NOV-1996 15:00:37  Error mounting _DAD226:
				      %MOUNT-F-NOSUCHDEV, no such device

        3  Problems Resolved in InfoServer Monitor V2.1
	      
	      Two problems, sometimes seen on fast systems, have been
	      resolved.

	      - The disk dismount requested by the InfoServer Monitor
	        might not complete before the subsequent mount request.
	        This could cause the system to crash.  Timing has been
	        changed to allow the dismount to complete before the
		disk is mounted again.
	      
	      - When restarting the InfoServer Monitor, the deletion
	        of the old InfoServer Monitor process might not
		complete before the new one was started.  This could
		cause the new process creation to fail with a
		duplicate process name error.  The command procedure
		SYS$MANAGER:INFOSERVER_MONITOR_STARTUP.COM now waits
		before starting the new process to allow the old
		process to be deleted.

	      The log file now correctly displays the current software
	      version.


	4  New Features in InfoServer Monitor V2.1

	      The log file SYS$MANAGER:INFOSERVER_MONITOR.LOG now
	      displays the InfoServer Monitor's process ID (PID) at
	      the top of the file.


	5  ISO9660 disk restrictions

	      InfoServer Monitor does not correctly mount ISO9660 disks
	      on systems running OpenVMS VAX V5.5 and F11CD software.
	      This functionality may be included in a future release of
	      InfoServer Monitor.

	      Since ISO9660 disks are supported in versions of the
	      OpenVMS operating system starting with OpenVMS VAX V6.0
	      and OpenVMS Alpha V6.1, InfoServer Monitor V2.0 correctly
	      handles ISO9660 disks when running under these versions
	      of OpenVMS.
