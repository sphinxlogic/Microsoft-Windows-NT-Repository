                                          InfoServer Monitor Description



              InfoServer services can become inaccessible for a number
              of reasons:

              o  A compact disc is replaced with a new disc that has a
                 different volume label.

                 When compact discs are routinely updated (for instance,
                 Online Documentation Library Discs, OpenVMS software
                 kits) the volume label changes with each new version.
                 The InfoServer Monitor regularly checks volume labels
                 and remounts disks using the new volume labels.

              o  Connection is broken between OpenVMS client and
                 InfoServer system

                 This condition can be caused by network failure, power
                 outage, or by rebooting the InfoServer system. The
                 InfoServer Monitor ensures that all InfoServer services
                 are remounted after such events.

              o  Data has been written to an InfoServer hard disk

                 When an InfoServer hard disk is accessed for write, all
                 read connections are terminated. These connections
                 must be manually reestablished using the OpenVMS
                 command MOUNT. The InfoServer Monitor regularly checks
                 InfoServer hard disks and remounts any disks that are
                 found to be inaccessible because of a previous write
                 access.

              The InfoServer Monitor ensures that all InfoServer devices
              remain accessible to users when such events occur. As
              described in Section 1.1, the Monitor takes actions on
              specific devices and creates a log file like that shown in
              Example 1-1.

                                                                     1-1

 



        InfoServer Monitor Description


              The Monitor runs as a detached process on each OpenVMS
              node on which InfoServer disk access is desired. The
              process is usually created during system startup by
              running the InfoServer Monitor startup procedure.

              InfoServer services must be bound (using the OpenVMS LADCP
              utility) but do not need to be mounted. The InfoServer
              Monitor can handle all mounting of disks.

        1.1 Devices Selected and Actions Taken

              A device is selected for InfoServer Monitor action if all
              the following criteria are met:

              o  The device name begins with DAD.

                 On OpenVMS systems, all InfoServer compact disc and
                 hard disk device names begin with DAD.

              o  The device is read-only.

                 A writable InfoServer device is one that has been
                 created with the LADCP command BIND /WRITE. Mounting
                 such a device would disconnect all read access to
                 the service mounted under another device name, so
                 the device should never be mounted systemwide. This
                 condition would exist if someone had bound a service
                 for write and had not yet mounted it or had logged off
                 before unbinding the device.

              o  The device is not allocated.

                 The InfoServer Monitor ignores any InfoServer device
                 that is allocated to another user.

              If these criteria are met, the InfoServer Monitor takes
              the following actions:

              o  If the device is mounted, InfoServer Monitor attempts
                 a read of the device to determine whether it is
                 accessible.

                 -  If the read fails, InfoServer Monitor remounts the
                    device with the known volume label.

                 -  If the remount fails because the volume label is
                    different, the device is mounted to find the new
                    volume label and then mounted systemwide with the
                    new volume label.

                                          InfoServer Monitor Description
                                  1.1 Devices Selected and Actions Taken

              o  If the device is not mounted, the disk is mounted to
                 find the volume label and then mounted systemwide.

              By default, InfoServer Monitor checks devices every ten
              minutes. If you want to change this interval, define the
              system logical name INFO_INTERVAL to be the number of
              minutes between checks. For example, if you want the
              Monitor to check every two minutes, define the logical
              name as follows:

              $ DEFINE/SYSTEM INFO_INTERVAL 2

              Note that because the Monitor checks the value of INFO_
              INTERVAL after each cycle, you can change the interval
              without having to stop and restart the Monitor.

        1.2 Event Logging

              InfoServer Monitor records device mounting and dismounting
              activity in a log file like that in Example 1-1.

              Example 1-1 InfoServer Monitor Log File

                                 Installing InfoServer Monitor Software



              This chapter describes installation prerequisites and
              explains how to install InfoServer Monitor software.

        2.1 Disk Space Requirements

              Installing the Monitor requires 27 blocks of disk storage
              on the system disk. Additional minimal space is needed for
              the log file after the Monitor starts to run. Space used
              by the log file depends on how much activity the Monitor
              performs but would typically be a few blocks per day.

        2.2 Disk Mounting Requirements

              If you mount InfoServer devices before starting the
              InfoServer Monitor, specifiy the /NOMOUNT_VERIFY qualifier
              to the OpenVMS command MOUNT. This qualifier enables
              quick determination of which devices need to be remounted.
              The InfoServer Monitor always mounts devices with mount
              verification disabled.

        2.3 Installation Procedure

              The installation procedure consists of a series of
              questions and informational messages and should take less
              than five minutes.

              To start the installation, you invoke the VMSINSTAL
              command procedure from a privileged account, such as the
              SYSTEM account.

              To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
              Ctrl/Y. When you press Ctrl/Y, the installation procedure
              deletes all files it has created up to that point and
              exits. You can then start the installation again.

                                                                     2-1

                    VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure Vn.n-n

              It is dd-mmm-yyyy at hh:mm.
              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

        2.3.1 Installation Questions

              This section discusses the questions that appear during
              the installation. See Appendix A for a sample installation
              procedure.

              Each question in the installation is marked with an
              asterisk (*) at the beginning of the line. Some questions
              show the default response in brackets, for example [YES].
              If you want to give the default response, press the RETURN
              key.

              1  System backup

                 VMSINSTAL asks if you are satisfied with your system
                 backup. If you are satisfied with the backup of your
                 system disk, press RETURN. Otherwise, enter NO to
                 discontinue the installation. Because only three
                 files are added to the system startup directory,
                 there is no need to perform a system backup before
                 the installation.

                 * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?

              2  Device name

                 The device where the InfoServer Monitor kit is located.
                 Specify the tape name or disk and directory where the
                 kit is located. You may also specify a logical name
                 pointing to that device or directory. For example,
                 if the InfoServer Monitor kit is on InfoServer device
                 DAD2, use DAD2 as the device-name.

                 * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted: DAD2

              3  Product name

                 Enter the name of the product you are installing. Enter
                 INFOMON.

                 versions of InfoServer Monitor that are superseded
                 by this installation. Purging is recommended; however,
                 if you need to keep files from the previous version,
                 enter NO in response to the question.

                 * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? <Return>

        2.3.2 Informational Messages

              At this point, the installation procedure displays a
              number of informational messages that report on the
              progress of the installation. There are no further
              questions. If the installation procedure has been
              successful up to this point, VMSINSTAL moves the new or
              modified files to their target directories and displays
              the following messages:

                            After Installing InfoServer Monitor Software



              This chapter describes operations you perform after
              installing InfoServer Monitor software.

        3.1 Starting InfoServer Monitor from the System Startup
            Procedure

              The InfoServer Monitor installation procedure starts the
              Monitor but does not provide for automatic startup of the
              Monitor when your system reboots.

              The InfoServer Monitor installation places the InfoServer
              Monitor system startup file INFOSERVER_MONITOR_STARTUP.COM
              in the SYS$MANAGER directory. To start the Monitor with
              each system reboot, proceed as follows:

              o  If you start up your system with the SYSMAN utility,
                 enter the following commands:

                 $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN
                 SYSMAN> STARTUP ADD FILE SYS$MANAGER:INFOSERVER_MONITOR_STARTUP.COM
                 SYSMAN> EXIT

              o  Otherwise, add the following line to SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM
                 or the appropriate startup command procedure at your
                 site:

                 $ @SYS$MANAGER:INFOSERVER_MONITOR_STARTUP

        3.2 Service Names

              By default, the InfoServer system creates service names
              for most volumes, using the volume label (for example,
              CDDOC04MAR21) as the service name. Specifying a generic
              service name for the volume (for example, VMSDOC) allows
              the same service name to be used when the volume label
              changes. See the InfoServer System Operations Guide for
              information about the CREATE SERVICE command.

                                                                     3-1

 



        After Installing InfoServer Monitor Software
        3.2 Service Names

              When used in conjunction with generic service names,
              InfoServer Monitor frees you from the need to know the
              volume labels of any InfoServer devices.

              To take advantage of this feature, remove from your system
              startup procedure any commands that mount InfoServer
              devices. Because the Monitor mounts all InfoServer
              devices it finds, you need only enter LADCP BIND /SYSTEM
              commands. This feature saves time during system startup
              and eliminates the need to hard-code volume labels in your
              system startup procedures.
