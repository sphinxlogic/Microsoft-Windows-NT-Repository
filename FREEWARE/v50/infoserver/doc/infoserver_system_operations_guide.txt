        Document Purpose

              This document explains how to manage an InfoServer system.
              You can use the InfoServer commands described in Chapter 3
              to set up services for client systems in your local area
              network (LAN). The document also provides troubleshooting
              information to help you solve problems that affect
              InfoServer operations.

              For information on installing and troubleshooting
              InfoServer hardware, refer to the following documents:

                 InfoServer 100 Installation and Owner's Guide
                 InfoServer 150 Installation and Owner's Guide
                 InfoServer 1000 Installation and Owner's Guide

              For information on managing InfoServer devices on client
              systems, see the InfoServer client documents for those
              systems.

                                                      Server Description



              The InfoServer system is a high-performance, virtual
              device server. It can serve physical device media and
              sets of logical disk blocks to client systems in a local
              area network (LAN). Systems running the appropriate client
              software can connect to virtual devices served by the
              InfoServer system and use them as though they are locally
              attached devices.

              Unlike a file server, the InfoServer system does not
              impose a file system on the virtual devices that it
              serves. The InfoServer system can serve compact discs
              and read/write disks with any type of on-disk structure.
              Because client systems interpret the on-disk structure,
              each client can use its own native file system. Multiple
              on-disk structures can be served by and accessed on a
              single InfoServer system at the same time.

     Server Description
     1.1 InfoServer Functions

     1.1 InfoServer Functions

           The InfoServer system can perform the following functions:

           o  Serve compact discs to network clients.

              The InfoServer system serves compact discs automat-
              ically, using the volume label as the service name
              when the server is booted, or when compact discs are
              inserted in InfoServer drives. Some client systems (for
              example, OpenVMS and ULTRIX) simply bind to and mount
              the compact discs under their volume labels.

              The InfoServer system can automatically serve to
              clients compact discs that are in Apple hierarchical
              file system (HFS), Files-11 On-Disk Structure Level 2
              (ODS-2), High Sierra Group (HSG), ISO 9660, or ULTRIX
              File System (UFS) format. other media types can be
              served manually through the InfoServer management
              interface.

           o  Serve Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) tapes.

              The InfoServer system can serve SCSI tape devices to
              network clients by using service names. Client systems
              can connect to these tape devices and utilize them as
              though they are locally attached devices.

           o  Serve read/write disk partitions.

              A partition is a logical subset of a read/write
              disk. A single disk can be subdivided into several
              partitions, each of which can be served to the
              network independently. To remote client systems, these
              partitions appear to be whole disks. For example, an
              OpenVMS client can access InfoServer partitions and use
              them as though they are local hard disks.

           o  Act as an initial load system for OpenVMS systems.

              The InfoServer system can downline load the primary
              bootstrap program to OpenVMS systems by responding
              to maintenance operation protocol (MOP) requests.
              The server can locate MOP downline load files on the
              OpenVMS software distribution compact disc and copy
              them into temporary MOP partitions on an InfoServer-
              formatted read/write disk.

                                                      Server Description
                                                1.1 InfoServer Functions

                 The ISL bootstrap program connects back to the software
                 distribution compact disc and boots Standalone Backup.
                 The Backup utility is then used to copy the OpenVMS
                 operating system save sets from the compact disc to a
                 read/write disk attached to the system. All subsequent
                 OpenVMS boots are done from the local read/write disk.

              o  Downline load other products.

                 You can use the InfoServer system to load any Ethernet
                 product by file name; that is, the server does not
                 require a Network Control Program (NCP) database entry
                 to locate the requested file. For example, X terminal
                 clients use the InfoServer system to downline load
                 their system software. You can create a special MOP
                 partition and copy the desired file to that partition.
                 The server additionally supports downline loading of
                 services by Ethernet address. Each InfoServer system
                 can handle up to 100 simultaneous downline loads more
                 efficiently than host-based downline loaders, which
                 must start processes to assist in the load.

        1.2 Server/Client Relationship

              Figure 1-1 shows the relationship of the InfoServer system
              to several client systems. In this figure, two compact
              discs and two hard disks connected to the server appear to
              the client systems as local devices. The VAX and RISC
              clients might be accessing software distribution and
              online documentation files on one or two of the compact
              disks, while the Macintosh client might be updating data
              on an InfoServer disk partition. The X terminal boots from
              the InfoServer system and uses InfoServer disks for page,
              font, and customization files.

              You can simply connect the InfoServer system to your LAN
              and turn the server on. After the server is initialized,
              or bootstrapped, the server software automatically
              makes available, or serves, to client systems the media
              connected to it. For example, if you insert a compact disc
              into a server drive, the server detects this new disc and
              automatically serves it to client systems by using the
              volume label as the service name.


                                                                     1-3

 



     Server Description
     1.2 Server/Client Relationship

           The server bootstraps from its internal read/write
           device, on which the InfoServer software is preinstalled.
           InfoServer software updates are distributed on compact
           discs. As these new releases become available, you
           can install the software onto the internal device for
           subsequent booting.

           You might want to customize InfoServer functions such as
           automounting of specific devices. You can control server
           functions by logging in to the server and entering server
           commands, described in Chapter 3.

     1.3 Automatic Service Policies and Availability Features

           The InfoServer system automatically serves compact discs
           to clients when the server is first turned on or when
           a disc is inserted in a drive. The server reads the
           volume label and uses the label as the name of the service
           offered to clients.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              You can use the SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT command to
              disable the serverwide automount function. You can
              use the SET DEVICE AUTOMOUNT command to disable
              automount for individual devices, such as compact
              discs, that are not in InfoServer format.

              _____________________________________________________

           If multiple servers offer the same services, the client
           uses a rating scheme to select the best service (see
           Section 2.7). When duplicate read-only devices are
           available under identical service names, the client
           balances the load among the devices.

           If you remove a compact disc from a server drive, the
           InfoServer system ends all client connections to the
           associated service. The server also stops offering, or
           unserves, the associated service to client systems.

           However, when a read-only service is interrupted (for
           example, the server reboots, or a compact disc is removed
           from a drive), the client attempts to reconnect to the
           service. If a duplicate read-only service is offered
           elsewhere on the LAN, the client automatically connects to

              the duplicate volume. File operations continue as normal,
              and users experience almost no service disruption.

        1.4 Establishing an InfoServer Management Session

              The server manager can establish a server management
              session from a local or remote console terminal as
              follows:

              o  For a local session, connect a terminal capable of
                 interpreting VT100 ANSI escape sequences to the serial
                 port on the rear of the InfoServer system unit.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                This terminal must be set to 9600 baud, 8 bits, no
                parity.

                _____________________________________________________

              o  For a remote session, make a connection to the
                 InfoServer system through a LAT terminal server.

                 Like many host systems, the InfoServer system
                 advertises a LAT terminal server service for its
                 management interface and accepts connections from
                 remote terminals attached to terminal servers.
                 Therefore, any terminal attached to a terminal server
                 on the extended LAN can act as a console terminal for
                 the InfoServer system (if the user knows the InfoServer
                 management password).

              Determining the Server's Default Service Name

              To make a remote connection to the InfoServer system for
              the first time, you must first determine the server's
              default name. To do this, add the 4-character prefix
              LAD_ to the hexadecimal Ethernet data link address on
              the system's enclosure (see the installation and owner's
              guide for your unit). You can change this default name by
              using the command SET SERVER NAME (see Chapter 3).

              The server's name is the service name to which you
              connect. For example, if the default server name is LAD_
              08002B15009F, then you would enter the following command
              at the terminal server's prompt to manage the InfoServer
              system:

                                                                     1-5

           Local> CONNECT LAD_08002B15009F

              ________________________Note ________________________

              See your terminal server user's guide to learn
              more about the establishment of LAT terminal server
              service connections.

              _____________________________________________________

           Entering an InfoServer Password

           After you connect to the InfoServer system, you must enter
           an InfoServer password. The default server password is
           ESS. You can change the password with the SET SERVER
           PASSWORD command (see Chapter 3).

           Sample Session

           The following example shows how to establish a session
           from a terminal server:

           Local> CONNECT LAD_08002B133C1C
           Password: ESS (not echoed)
           Local -010- Session 1 to LAD_08002B133C1C established

           DEC InfoServer 1000 V3.0

           InfoServer>

           In this example, the terminal server's prompt is Local>,
           and a LAT terminal server session is established to the
           InfoServer system whose service name is LAD_08002B133C1C.
           The server prompts you to enter a password. When you enter
           the correct password, the server displays the InfoServer>
           prompt.

           Ending a Session

           At the end of the management session, you can exit by
           entering EXIT at the InfoServer> prompt. This action
           returns you to the terminal server's Local> prompt if
           the management session is over a LAT terminal server
           connection.

              The InfoServer system provides a Help facility that
              contains information about each server command, including
              parameters, qualifiers, and examples of its use. See the
              HELP command description in Chapter 3 for more information
              about the Help facility.

                                           Server Features and Functions



              This chapter provides information on the following topics:

              o  LASTport protocols

              o  Automatic mounting of compact discs

              o  Installation of functional upgrades from compact discs

              o  Maintenance operation protocol (MOP) functions

        2.1 LASTport Protocols

              The InfoServer system uses the LASTport transport and
              the LASTport/Disk and LASTport/Tape system application
              protocols to provide access to the virtual devices it
              serves to the local area network (LAN). These protocols
              provide high-performance access to disk and tape devices
              in an extended LAN. The InfoServer system implements
              the server portion of the protocols, while the client
              systems that access InfoServer devices implement the
              client portion.


                                                                     2-1

 



     Server Features and Functions
     2.1 LASTport Protocols

     2.1.1 LASTport Protocol

           The LASTport protocol is a specialized transport protocol
           that allows many clients to access InfoServer systems
           and perform reliable transactions. For the InfoServer
           system, a transaction is a device read or write operation.
           The LASTport protocol allows various client systems to
           read and write information concurrently to an InfoServer
           device.

           Unlike timer-based protocols, the LASTport protocol is a
           transaction-oriented protocol. Normally, information does
           not pass between a client and an InfoServer system unless
           the client initiates a transaction. The client system then
           runs a timer on the transaction, normally waiting from 2
           to 5 seconds before assuming that the transaction was lost
           and retrying the operation.

           The LASTport protocol does not provide any routing
           functions; it runs only in a LAN network. The LASTport
           protocol type is 80-41. If the extended LAN uses any
           filtering devices, they must allow this protocol type
           to pass unfiltered so that clients can access InfoServer
           systems across the filtering device.

           The InfoServer system uses a multicast address feature of
           the LASTport protocol to establish connections to devices.
           The format of the multicast address is 09-00-2B-04-nn-nn,
           where nn depends on the LASTport group enabled (see the
           description of the SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP command in
           Chapter 3).

     2.1.2 LASTport/Disk Protocol

           The LASTport/Disk protocol is a specialized disk protocol
           that uses the LASTport transport. That is, LASTport
           /Disk messages are delivered in LASTport messages. The
           LASTport/Disk protocol provides the mechanism for reading
           and writing logical disk blocks independent from any
           underlying file system. The clients that implement the
           LASTport/Disk protocol interpret the file system locally.
           By using the LASTport/Disk protocol for disk access, the
           InfoServer system can support multiple operating systems
           and disk file structures concurrently.

                                           Server Features and Functions
                                                  2.1 LASTport Protocols

              The LASTport/Disk protocol also provides the naming
              facility to access disks. The InfoServer system assigns
              each virtual disk a name. The LASTport/Disk protocol
              allows clients to query the LAN for service names. When
              the requested service is found, the client connects to it,
              and disk access can begin. When duplicate virtual devices
              are available under duplicate service names, the LASTport
              /Disk protocol provides a facility for load balancing
              among the available devices (see Section 2.7).

        2.1.3 LASTport/Tape Protocol

              Like the LASTport/Disk protocol, the LASTport/Tape
              protocol uses the LASTport transport. That is, LASTport
              /Tape messages are delivered in LASTport messages. The
              LASTport/Tape protocol provides the mechanism for reading
              and writing tape records. Tape devices attached to the
              InfoServer system appear to tape clients as locally
              attached devices.

              The LASTport/Tape protocol also provides the naming
              facility to access tapes. The InfoServer system assigns
              each tape device a name. The LASTport/Tape protocol allows
              clients to query the LAN network for service names. When
              the requested service is found, the client connects to it,
              and tape access can begin.

        2.2 Automatic Mounting of Compact Discs

              The InfoServer system can automatically recognize newly
              installed devices that are in the following formats:

              o  Apple hierarchical file system (HFS)

              o  Files-11 On-Disk Structure Level 2 (ODS-2)

              o  High Sierra Group (HSG)

              o  ISO 9660

              o  ULTRIX File System (UFS)

              The server reads the volume label and makes that volume
              label name available to the LAN as a service name. This
              process is called the automount feature. You can use
              the SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT command to enable or disable
              the automount feature serverwide, and you can enable or

                                                                     2-3

 



     Server Features and Functions
     2.2 Automatic Mounting of Compact Discs

           disable automounting for specific devices with the SET
           DEVICE AUTOMOUNT command (see Chapter 3).

           With the automount feature enabled, you do not neet to
           enter any InfoServer management commands to access compact
           discs. The InfoServer system automatically makes the
           compact discs available to client systems. Client systems
           simply use their native access method to connect to the
           volume label name.

           The InfoServer system automatically serves any compact
           discs that are present when the InfoServer system boots.
           It also detects and serves new compact discs that are
           inserted while the system is running. If a volume is
           removed while the system is running, the system deletes
           the volume label service, and any client connections to
           the volume are broken. If the same volume is reinserted,
           client connections are reestablished. If a different
           volume is reinserted, it is automatically served with
           its own volume label.

           If you do not know the volume label of a compact disc or
           tape, you can use the InfoServer management interface to
           determine it. After inserting the volume, enter the SHOW
           SERVICE command at the InfoServer> prompt. This display
           lists the volume labels for all volumes on the system. See
           the description of the SHOW SERVICE command in Chapter 3.

     2.3 Installation of Functional Upgrades from Compact Discs

           InfoServer software enables installation of functional
           upgrades from Function compact discs. As new functions
           become available, customers can purchase separately and
           install each function that they want to make available
           on the LAN. See the description of the UPDATE FUNCTIONS
           command in Chapter 3.

     2.4 Internal Read/Write Device Functions

           The InfoServer 1000 system includes internal FLASH memory
           that stores the system image and help text. The FLASH
           ROM (read-only memory) is preinitialized and loaded with
           the InfoServer operational software. Server configuration
           information is stored in NVRAM (nonvolatile random access
           memory).

                                2.4 Internal Read/Write Device Functions

              The InfoServer 150 system comes with an internal
              read/write disk. The InfoServer software uses this disk
              to store InfoServer parameters, characteristics, and
              other information specific to the InfoServer system.
              This internal disk is preinitialized and loaded with the
              InfoServer operational software.

        2.4.1 Partitions

              Normally, any InfoServer disk (a disk that has been
              initialized with the InfoServer INITIALIZE command) is
              not served to the LAN network as a whole disk. Instead,
              logical subdisks called partitions are served to the LAN
              network. A single InfoServer disk can be subdivided into
              several smaller partitions. Each partition can be treated
              as a whole disk by remote clients. Because partitions
              do not overlap, different systems can use different
              partitions without conflict.

              InfoServer software automatically creates several
              partitions that are formatted with different file systems
              and are reserved for use by the system itself. Normally,
              the partitions (whose names are also reserved) are created
              on the internal device. The subsections that follow

              The BOOT_PARTITION partition is factory installed on
              the internal device and contains the bootable InfoServer
              kernel as well as online help information. This partition
              cannot be deleted, nor should it ever be served to
              the network, because OpenVMS clients might crash when
              attempting a connection.

              CONFIGURATION Partition

              The CONFIGURATION partition is created or updated whenever
              the InfoServer SAVE command is issued. This partition
              contains InfoServer characteristics such as the server
              name, password, and identification string. The partition
              is read whenever the server reboots, or when the RESTORE
              command is issued.

           2NDARY_CONFIGURATION Partition

           The 2NDARY_CONFIGURATION partition is created or updated
           whenever a remote client such as an X terminal requests
           creation of a partition and service name. Remotely created
           service names are saved separately from those created
           locally so that remote operations do not inadvertently
           save temporary local operations. Only information for
           remotely created services is saved in this partition.

           IS_FUNCTIONS Partition

           The IS_FUNCTIONS partition is created whenever Function
           compact discs are installed on the InfoServer system. All
           installed functions are saved in this partition so that
           they can be restored when the InfoServer system reboots.
           You can reconstruct this partition from Function compact
           discs if it is lost. You might also want to create another
           copy of the partition (using the InfoServer COPY command)
           under a different partition name.

     2.4.2 Serving an Entire Disk to the Network

           There are special cases when you might want to serve an
           entire InfoServer disk to the LAN. For example, you might
           want to make a backup of the InfoServer disk on a remote
           client system. The remote client system should access the
           disk as if the on-disk structure were unknown, because the
           disk is in InfoServer format. Under the OpenVMS operating
           system you would use a MOUNT/FOREIGN command. Note that
           you should never serve an InfoServer-formatted disk for
           write access. See Section 4.6 for an example of backing up
           InfoServer disks.

     2.5 Tape Functions

           The InfoServer system can serve Small Computer System
           Interface (SCSI) tape devices to the network using service
           names. Client systems can connect to these tape devices
           and utilize them as though they are locally attached
           devices.

           InfoServer clients can share tape devices. However,
           while many clients can access an InfoServer compact disc
           simultaneously, only one client at a time can access
           a tape device. When a client is finished using a tape
           device, the client disconnects. Other clients can then use

              the device. Each client views the remote tape device as
              though it were locally attached.

        2.6 X Terminal Clients

              X terminal clients use the InfoServer system to downline
              load their system software, provide font services,
              save configuration information, and page memory to and
              from InfoServer disks. X terminal system files can be
              installed on the InfoServer system from compact disc.
              Once installed, this system software is downline loaded on
              demand to each X terminal client when it is turned on.

              X terminal clients can dynamically allocate partitions
              on an InfoServer disk as needed. For example, when an X
              terminal user requests that terminal customizations be
              saved, the InfoServer system automatically creates a disk
              partition to hold the information and creates a network
              service name for that partition. Once customization
              information is saved, the X terminal client can recall
              the information at any time.

              Certain X terminals that are InfoServer clients can
              also be virtual memory machines. Such virtual memory
              X terminals (VXTs) can page sections of main memory to
              and from disks as required. Because a VXT client has no
              local disk, it uses InfoServer disks as page disks. When
              main memory needs to be paged out to disk, the VXT client
              requests the InfoServer system to create a partition.
              This partition is then automatically extended as needed.
              Partitions and their network service names are created
              dynamically, without the need for any user action.

              By default, the InfoServer disk DK10, which is the
              internal read/write disk that ships with InfoServer 100
              and 150 systems, is enabled to allow X terminal clients
              to allocate partitions remotely. Other disks can also be
              enabled through the use of InfoServer commands. InfoServer
              1000 systems require an external read/write disk to
              provide paging services for X terminal clients.

     2.7 Service Ratings

     2.7 Service Ratings

           The InfoServer system provides static load balancing
           across duplicate media within an extended LAN. To do this,
           the InfoServer system provides a rating for every service
           that it offers. When duplicate services are available,
           client systems select the service with the highest rating.
           A higher rating indicates a more readily available service
           for client connections; a lower rating indicates lower
           availability.

           By default, the InfoServer system dynamically calculates a
           rating based on the InfoServer load for each service. The
           dynamic rating for each device service is calculated and
           updated every 10 seconds. The following algorithm is used
           to calculate the dynamic rating for services, within the
           range of 0 to 65535:

           Rating = (32768*%CPU_FREE)+
           (32767*((0.9*last_calc_srvd_load)+(0.1*new_calc_srvd_load)))

           The first term, called the server load factor, is an
           instantaneous look at the CPU percentage, weighted over
           one-half the rating scale.

           The seconds term, called the service load factor, is 90
           percent of the last calculated load factor plus 10 percent
           of the current calculated load factor, weighted over
           one-half the rating scale. The LASTport load factor is
           then replaced with the current calculation of the service
           load factor. This calculation produces a moving weighted
           average that is calculated at each timer interval, for
           each service. The formula for the new_calc_srvd_load term
           is as follows:

           new_calc_srvd_load =1000-min(1000,__I/Os_to_service_in_last_10_sec)_

                                                    1000

           As a result, a load is imposed on the service based on
           the number of block reads in the past 10 seconds. The term
           last_calc_srvd_load is then updated with the new service
           load factor calculated.

              Any service that is blocked by a write session to an
              overlapping virtual disk is assigned a rating of 0. See
              Section 2.10 for more information on concurrent read
              /write-access.

              The following algorithm is used to calculate the dynamic
              rating for tapes, within the LASTport/Tape protocol range
              of 0 to 65535:

              Rating = (32768*%CPU_FREE)+  (32767*%POOL_FREE)

              Any tape service that has maximum connections receives a
              rating of 0.

        2.8 InfoServer Naming Conventions

              The InfoServer system manages several different resources
              by using their assigned names. For example, services,
              logical disk partitions, and devices have assigned names.
              Assigning names to resources makes it easier to access and
              manage them. Individual resources have different policies
              that govern the names applied to those resources.

        2.8.1 InfoServer Name

              The InfoServer system itself is assigned a name. Each
              InfoServer name must be unique within an extended LAN.
              The InfoServer name identifies the InfoServer unit. This
              name is also used as a LAT management service that is
              advertised to the LAN network.

              When the InfoServer system is shipped, the InfoServer
              software assigns each InfoServer unit a unique name.
              The default name is in the form LAD_nnnnnnnnnnnn, where
              nnnnnnnnnnnn is the hexadecimal ASCII representation of
              the InfoServer system's Ethernet adapter address. An
              example is LAD_08002B15009F. The maximum length of the
              name is 32 characters.

              If you choose, you can change the InfoServer name to
              a name that is more meaningful for your particular
              environment. If you assign an InfoServer name, you must
              use the following sets of characters:

              o  A-Z

              o  a-z

                                                                     2-9

 



     Server Features and Functions
     2.8 InfoServer Naming Conventions

           o  0-9

           o  $ (dollar sign)

           o  . (period)

           o  _ (underscore)

           o  - (hyphen)

           o  Multinational characters in the ASCII range 192 through
              255

           All InfoServer names are case-insensitive. For example,
           the InfoServer system would treat an uppercase A and
           lowercase a as a match.

     2.8.2 Service Names

           The InfoServer system can assign service names to devices
           and partitions. These service names are the access
           mechanism for remote client nodes. Clients specify the
           names of services to which they want to connect. The
           InfoServer system resolves the names down to the requested
           virtual device, and then completes the connection request.

           Service names offered by the InfoServer system are
           restricted to the same set of characters used for
           InfoServer unit names (see Section 2.8.1).

           Note that some compact discs might have volume labels
           that contain characters other than those listed in
           Section 2.8.1. In that case, the InfoServer system
           substitutes underscore (_)  characters. If a compact disc
           does not have a volume label, you must create a service
           manually. See the description of the CREATE SERVICE
           command in Chapter 3.

           Because identical media or data can be made available
           on the extended LAN concurrently, it is possible to have
           duplicate service names. A service name might be available
           more than once on a single InfoServer system or might
           be available on more than one InfoServer system. When
           redundant service names are available, clients use load
           balancing to select the least busy media. If one service
           should fail, clients automatically attempt to connect to
           any available duplicate service.

        2.8.3 Partition Names

              The InfoServer system can create sets of logical blocks,
              called partitions, on read/write media. A partition is a
              subset of a physical read/write device that can be served
              to the LAN as though the partition were an entire disk.
              When the InfoServer system creates a partition, the server
              assigns the partition a name.

              Partition names are local to the InfoServer system and
              are not visible to remote client systems. Clients gain
              access to partitions through the use of service names. The
              partition names are used only by the InfoServer command
              set for ease of management. Partition names are unique
              within a single read/write device.

              Partition names created by the InfoServer system are
              restricted to the same set of characters used for
              InfoServer server names (see Section 2.8.1).

        2.8.4 Device Names

              To allow use of CD-ROM changers and SCSI multiplexers
              with the InfoServer system, InfoServer software provides
              support for two levels of bus addressing as described
              in the Small Computer System Interface specification
              (SCSI 2). Eight SCSI units are assigned logical unit
              numbers (LUNs) 0 through 7, which are set by switches
              on the device. Each unit can be subdivided into eight
              additional units, which are also assigned logical unit
              numbers 0 through 7. Devices are numbered from 0-77 on
              InfoServer 1000 systems and 0-157 on InfoServer 100 and
              150 systems. The numbering starts with the SCSI devices on
              SCSI-A and continues with SCSI-B for the InfoServer 100
              and 150 systems. Table 2-1 lists the range of DKn devices
              available to the system (tape devices have the form TPn).

        2.8.5 Device Discovery at Boot Time

              The InfoServer system attempts to locate devices at all
              LUNs for all units on the available busses. the search
              algorithm depends on the SCSI 2 compliance of the devices
              on the bus. Most single devices correctly identify the
              device as having no LUNs, and the server skips to the next
              unit number. Some devices, however, return misleading
              information, potentially extending boot time. If the
              server appears to be hung during the boot process, attempt
              successive boots with only one device attached until you
              identify the offending device or devices.

        2.8.6 Synchronous Device Mounting

              To accomodate the relatively long media change operation
              on CD-ROM changers, the InfoServer system forces
              synchronous mount operations if a changer device is
              present. Use the SHOW SERVER command to determine whether
              synchronous mounting is enabled. There is no command to
              disable synchronous mounting.

              Synchronous mounting might cause some delays during boot.
              Several devices being ejected and reinserted in a very
              short period can also cause delays.

        2.9 Service Classes

              Because the InfoServer system is a virtual disk server
              rather than a file server, it can support multiple
              operating systems and multiple on-disk file structures
              concurrently. The InfoServer system provides a means for
              logically subdividing the services offered on the LAN
              network into groups that are meaningful to each client
              system. These logical subdivisions are based on service
              classes.

              A service class divides the individual virtual disks
              that the InfoServer system offers to the LAN into
              different namespaces. Each client system accesses only
              the namespaces that are meaningful to it. For example,
              OpenVMS systems access services that are offered under
              the ODS_2 and ISO 9660 namespaces, while ULTRIX systems

                                                                    2-13

 



     Server Features and Functions
     2.9 Service Classes

           access services under the ULTRIX, High Sierra Group (HSG),
           and ISO 9660 namespaces. Because each client sees only the
           services in its own namespace, an OpenVMS client can never
           accidentially connect to an ULTRIX disk.

           When it automounts a new compact disc, the InfoServer
           system creates a service under the service class that is
           appropriate for the disk structure found on the compact
           disc. For example, if the InfoServer system reads the
           volume label from an ISO 9600 compact disc, it creates a
           service with the volume label as the name under the ISO
           9600 service class.

           The InfoServer system can automatically serve compact
           discs that are in Apple HFS, High Sierra Group, ISO
           9660, ODS-2, and ULTRIX UFS formats. You can can use
           InfoServer commands to serve other media types under any
           of the supported service classes. Chapter 3 describes the
           available service classes and the InfoServer commands.

     2.10 InfoServer Read/Write-Access Policies

           The InfoServer system is a virtual disk server. Because
           it does not impose an underlying file structure on the
           disks it serves, the InfoServer system does not provide
           a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent write-access
           to the same sets of disk blocks. Instead, the InfoServer
           system enforces a connection policy that prevents such
           conflicts that could result in data corruption.

           You can select one of two policies:

           o  Pre-emptive. By default, the InfoServer system allows
              write-access to a virtual disk only after all other
              read access has been disconnected. For example, a LAN
              write-access connection would immediately disconnect
              all read access connections that conflict with the
              write-access request, then allow write access after
              all readers are disconnected. Readers are blocked from
              reconnecting to those same disk blocks for the duration
              of the write-access connection.

                              2.10 InfoServer Read/Write-Access Policies

                 This type of policy is ideally suited for classes of
                 data that are infrequently updated, but frequently
                 read. Readers are prevented from reading bad data while
                 the write-access connection updates the data. After
                 the write-access connection is terminated, the readers
                 reconnect to the updated data.

              o  Blocking. Instead of immediately disconnecting any
                 read-only connections, the write-access connection is
                 delayed until all read connections are disconnected
                 voluntarily by the remote clients.

                 This policy is ideally suited for information that must
                 be highly available for read access, but may be updated
                 during off hours.

              For either policy, the InfoServer system prevents
              concurrent access during write operations. This local
              locking policy guarantees data integrity.

              Note that because partitions do not overlap on an
              InfoServer disk, write access to one partition does not
              prevent read or write access to a different partition on
              the same device. Locking occurs only for requests to the
              same partition, or to the same disk volume.

              For more information on setting the InfoServer write
              access policy, see the SET SERVER WRITE ACCESS command
              description in Chapter 3.

        2.11 MOP Functions

              The InfoServer system implements several features of the
              maintenance operation protocol (MOP) of the DECnet Digital
              Network Architecture. The following sections describe
              supported features.

        2.11.1 MOP Identify Self Message

              The InfoServer system responds to MOP "request identity"
              messages with a MOP "system identification" message to the
              requesting node.

              The InfoServer system also broadcasts a system identifica-
              tion periodically to the LAN and responds with its system
              virtual address (SVA) as the communication device type.

                                                                    2-15

     2.11.2 MOP Request Counters Message

           The InfoServer system responds to MOP "request counters"
           messages with a MOP "counters" message to the requesting
           node.

     2.11.3 MOP Loop Messages

           The InfoServer system responds to MOP "loop direct" and
           MOP "loop assist" messages by returning the loop data as
           directed in the received loop request. For example, on an
           OpenVMS system, you can test Ethernet connectivity with
           the InfoServer system by using the DECnet NCP command LOOP
           CIRCUIT; from a terminal server, you can use the terminal
           server's TEST LOOP command.

     2.11.4 MOP Downline Loading

           The InfoServer system can be configured to act as a MOP
           downline load server. This means that the InfoServer
           system can receive downline load requests and then
           downline load the requesting system, if the requested load
           image is present. You can enable or disable this feature
           for individual InfoServer systems by using the command
           SET SERVER MOP. You can enable or disable the feature
           for specific devices by using the command SET DEVICE MOP
           SEARCH. (See Chapter 3).

           The InfoServer system can handle up to 100 concurrent
           downline loads. Unlike host-based downline load servers
           that must start processes to assist in the loading
           process, the InfoServer system can handle downline load
           requests quickly and efficiently. The InfoServer system
           can provide an ideal solution for LAN conditions that
           cause many systems to request a downline load at the same
           time, such as after a power failure in a terminal server
           LAN network.

           When the InfoServer system receives a load request that it
           can possibly service, it searches for the following:

           1  A matching service name in the MOP service class

           2  On InfoServer-formatted disks, a MOP partition with a
              matching partition name

              3  In the directory [SYS0.SYSEXE] on ODS-2 format disks, a
                 matching file name with the .SYS file type.

              MOP partitions are special partitions that can be downline
              loaded. For information on installing MOP partitions for
              downline loading, see Section 4.9.

              and provides examples of their use.

        3.1 Command Syntax Conventions

              The following conventions apply to the commands in this
              chapter:

              __________________________________________________________
              Convention__________Meaning_______________________________

              UPPERCASE           Words in uppercase indicate a command
                                  or command option that you enter as
                                  shown.

              Lowercase           Words in lowercase indicate parameters
                                  that you specify.

        3.1.1 Wildcard Matching

              Some InfoServer commands allow wildcard operations. If
              you use a wildcard string in an InfoServer command, then
              all objects matching the wildcard string are used in the
              specified operation.

                                                                     3-1

 



     Server Management Commands
     3.1 Command Syntax Conventions

           The InfoServer system uses two wildcard characters:

           *   Matches any number of any characters in the current
               character position.

           %   Matches exactly one character in the current character
               position.

           For example, suppose you entered the following command:

           InfoServer> SHOW SERVICE AB%DE*

           The InfoServer system would select all services whose
           names start with the letters AB, followed by any one
           character, followed by the letters DE, followed by any
           number of any characters.

     3.1.2 Special Keys

           The InfoServer management console reserves certain
           keyboard keys for special functions. Table 3-1 lists the
           reserved keys that the InfoServer console uses and the
           function that each key provides.

           Key___________________Function____________________________
           <_                    Deletes the previous character in

                                 the current command line.

           <Return>              Ends the current command line and
                                 executes the command.

           <Ctrl/b>              Recalls the last InfoServer command
                                 executed. The InfoServer system
                                 saves the last 10 commands executed
                                 at the console.

           <Ctrl/u>              Deletes all characters in the
                                 current command line.

           <Ctrl/z>              Displays "Exit" in reverse

     BACKUP


     ________________________________________________________________

     BACKUP

           Backs up InfoServer-formatted disks. You use the RETRIEVE
           command to restore the disks.

     Format

           BACKUP  src_device[:] dest_device[:]

     Parameters

           src_device[:]
           Specifies the source device, which must be a valid
           InfoServer-formatted disk, as defined in Table 2-1.

           dest_device[:]
           Specifies the destination device, which must be a valid
           InfoServer-formatted disk, as defined in Table 2-1.

     Description

           The BACKUP command copies all partitions from an
           InfoServer-formatted disk to the destination disk. The
           destination disk is initialized in InfoServer format,
           and the partitions are copied along with additional
           information to identify the disk as a backup copy. (The
           SHOW PARTITIONS command identifies the device as a backup
           device.) In addition, service information about the
           partitions copied is also saved to the destination disk.

           Unlike the COPY function, the BACKUP function can
           be performed between devices of different sizes. If
           all partitions do not fit on the destination device,
           InfoServer software displays warning messages while
           the backup operation continues. In addition, the BACKUP
           command performs disk compression, allocating partitions
           contiguously and defragmenting InfoServer-formatted disks
           during BACKUP and RETRIEVE operations.

           To preserve data integrity, InfoServer software does not
           permit BACKUP operations unless the InfoServer state
           is set OFF. This check prevents remote virtual disk
           operations from interfering with local disk operations.

              (See the description of the SET SERVER STATE command.)
              In addition, the BACKUP command locks both the source and
              destination devices against local disk operations for the
              duration of the BACKUP operation.


        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
              InfoServer> BACKUP DK10 DK150
              InfoServer> RETRIEVE DK150 DK10
              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON
              InfoServer> SAVE

              These commands back up the data on the system disk DK10 to
              the DK150 disk and defragment the DK10 disk.

     ________________________________________________________________

     BIND

           Connects to an ODS-2 compact disc service on another
           InfoServer system on the local area network (LAN) and
           creates the virtural device VDK10.

     Format

              BIND  ODS-2-service-name [PASSWORD optional-password ]

     Parameters

           ODS-2-service-name
           Specifies the ODS-2 service name of a compact disc
           attached to another InfoServer system on the LAN.

           PASSWORD optional-password
           Optionally specifies a password to access the service.

     Description

           The BIND command connects to an ODS-2 class service
           on a remote InfoServer system and create the virtual
           device VDK10, which you can use as the source device for
           network installations and updates. All update operations
           (FUNCTION, MOP, SYSTEM, and VXT) are supported using the
           BIND, UNBIND, and UPDATE commands. (The UNBIND and UPDATE
           commands are described in this chapter; for detailed
           information on performing network installations and
           updates, refer to Section 4.13.)

              The BIND command connects to the service UPD_DRV,
              associates the password RAINMAN with the service, and
              creates the virtual device VDK10. The SHOW DEVICE command
              then displays the characteristics of the device.

        ________________________________________________________________

        COPY

              Copies data from one disk or partition to another disk or
              partition.

        Format

              COPY  src_device[:partition] dest_device[:partition]

        Parameters

              src_device[:partition]
              Specifies the source device or partition. The device
              must be a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined in
              Table 2-1.

              The partition must already exist on the specified device.
              If you do not specify a partition, the entire disk is
              copied.

              dest_device[:partition]
              Specifies the destination device or partition. The device
              must be a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined in
              Table 2-1.

              The partition must already exist on the specified device.
              If you do not specify a partition, the entire disk is
              copied.

        Description

              You use the COPY command to make copies of data from
              one InfoServer disk or partition to another disk or
              partition. The src_device[:partition] parameter specifies
              the source of the copy. The dest_device[:partition]
              parameter specifies the destination of the copy. For
              the copy to complete successfully, the size of the
              source and destination must be the same. If the dest_
              device[:partition] parameter specifies a partition name
              that does not exist, the system creates the destination
              partition.


                                                                     3-9

 



     COPY


           To preserve data integrity, the InfoServer system does not
           allow copy operations unless you have set the InfoServer
           state to OFF. This operation prevents remote virtual disk
           operations and local disk operations from interfering with
           each other. For more information, see the description of
           the SET SERVER STATE command.

           A copy operation blocks all other local operations to the
           source and destination devices. This action ensures that
           local users do not corrupt data by copying the data to the
           same disk partitions. A copy operation to a tape device
           creates an unlabeled tape that contains sequentially
           written data blocks.

     Example

           InfoServer> COPY DK10:MY_PARTITION DK110:SAVE_PARTITION
           %ESS-I-CREATED, Create partition completed successfully.
           %ESS-I-COPIED, Copy operation completed successfully.

           This command copies the data from a partition named MY_
           PARTITION on the DK10 disk to a partition named SAVE_
           PARTITION on the DK110 disk. The message following the
           command indicates that DK110:SAVE_PARTITION did not exist.
           The InfoServer system created it and continued with the
           copy operation.

        ________________________________________________________________

        CRASH

              Causes the server software to take a recognizable machine
              check, creating a dump if crash dump processing is
              enabled.

        Format

              CRASH  [YES]

        Description

              Use the CRASH command if you are requested to produce a
              dump for analysis by Digital support personnel. The CRASH
              command prompts for confirmation.

        Example

              InfoServer> CRASH
              _Are you sure you want to force a crash of the server now [No]?

              If you answer Y or YES, this command creates an InfoServer
              crash dump if crash dump processing is enabled. (See the
              description of the SET SERVER CRASHDUMP command.)

     CREATE PARTITION

           Creates a partition on a writable disk.

     Format

           CREATE PARTITION  device:partition {BLOCKS | BYTES | MEGABYTES} value [options]

     Parameters

           device:partition
           Specifies a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined in
           Table 2-1. Tape devices are not partitioned.

           The partition must not already exist on the specified
           device.

           value
           Specifies the size of the partition to be created in
           blocks, bytes, or megabytes. One block is equal to 512
           bytes of disk storage. Bytes are rounded up to the nearest
           block size.

     Options

           MOP DISABLED (D)
           Specifies that the partition not be used to contain
           an image file that the InfoServer system can downline
           load using the maintenance operation protocol (MOP) (see
           Section 2.11). MOP DISABLED is the default if the option
           is omitted.

           MOP ENABLED
           Specifies that the partition can be used to contain an
           image file that the InfoServer system can downline load
           using MOP. The InfoServer system downline loads images
           only from partitions that have MOP enabled.

           ERASE
           Writes an erase pattern on the allocated blocks. The erase
           algorithm is a single-pass write of zeros.

        Description

              You use the CREATE PARTITION command to create a partition
              on a writable disk. Partitions are a subset of logical
              blocks that can be served to the local area network (LAN)
              as a whole disk. The size of the partition might be larger
              than the number of specified blocks if the InfoServer
              system reuses a previously deleted partition or optimizes
              the partition size for its own internal disk structure.

              See the SHOW PARTITIONS command for information on
              specified and actual sizes.

        Example

              InfoServer> CREATE PARTITION DK10:VIRTUAL_DISK BLOCKS 1024 MOP DISABLED
              %ESS-I-CREATED, Create partition completed successfully.

              This command creates a partition named VIRTUAL_DISK with
              1024 blocks on the DK10 disk and with MOP disabled.

     CREATE SERVICE


     ________________________________________________________________

     CREATE SERVICE

           Creates a service name for an entire disk device, a disk
           partition, or an entire tape device.

     Format

           CREATE SERVICE  service-name [FOR] device[:partition] [options]

     Parameters

           service-name
           Specifies the name to which client systems can bind to
           access this virtual device service. Service names are
           restricted to the characters listed in Section 2.8.1.

           device[:partition]
           The specified device can be either of the following:

           o  DKn:

              Specifies a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined
              in Table 2-1. If you do not supply a partition name,
              the service is created for the entire disk. If you do
              supply a partition name, the service is bound to the
              partition on the disk. The partition must already exist
              on the disk.

           o  TPn:

              Specifies a valid InfoServer tape device, as defined in
              Table 2-1.

     Options

           CLASS class-name
           Specifies the namespace in which this service name exists.
           Various client systems use different namespaces for
           different on-disk structures. Namespaces are partitioned
           so that clients see only the names that are meaningful to
           them. Classes also allow two services to use the same name
           without conflict.

                                                          CREATE SERVICE


              If a device being served contains data in a known format,
              the default service class matches the on-disk structure.
              For example, if you use the CREATE SERVICE command to
              create a service for an Apple compact disc and do not
              specify the service class, the service is created under
              the APPLE namespace. If the InfoServer system does not
              recognize a device's on-disk structure, the service is
              created in the ODS_2 namespace.

              The class name used depends on the client systems that
              connect to the service being created. For example, OpenVMS
              systems use the ODS_2 namespace by default when attempting
              to mount an InfoServer device. Table 3-2 lists valid
              class-name parameter values.

     CREATE SERVICE


           DYNAMIC_RATING
           Specifies that the InfoServer system should calculate a
           rating for this service dynamically. This is the default
           method for service ratings.

           [NO]PASSWORD string
           Specifies an optional access control password for the
           service. The password string may be up to 39 alphanumeric
           ASCII characters in length. After you set a password, a
           client must specify the password to access the service.
           If you do not specify a password in this command, then
           clients are not required to provide a password to access
           the service.

           You can enter the password without having it echoed on the
           screen by entering the PASSWORD option as the last option
           in the CREATE SERVICE command. After entering the keyword
           PASSWORD, press Return. The InfoServer system prompts you
           for the password.

           [NO]READERS number
           Specifies the maximum number of client connections allowed
           for read access. A value of 0 indicates write-only access,
           as qualified by the WRITERS option, if present. If a
           client requests read-only access or read/write access
           to the service, one reader is counted against this number.

           Default: 1000 readers

           [NO]WRITERS number
           Specifies the maximum number of client connections allowed
           for write access. A value of 0 indicates read-only access,
           as qualified by the READERS option, if present. If a
           client requests write-only access, one writer is counted
           against this number. If a client requests read/write
           access to the service, one writer and one reader are
           counted.

           Default: 1 for read/write media, 0 for compact discs

              STATIC_RATING rating
              Specifies a rating from 0 to 65535, used for load
              balancing across redundant services. Clients always choose
              a higher rating over a lower one. If you omit the STATIC_
              RATING option, the InfoServer system calculates a dynamic
              rating based on InfoServer load. Note that if a writer is
              connected to a service, the rating is not changed until
              the writer disconnects.

        Description

              The CREATE SERVICE command creates a service that
              represents either an entire disk or a partition on a disk.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                When you turn on the InfoServer system or insert a
                compact disc while the server is on, the InfoServer
                software automatically tries to serve the disk.
                The InfoServer system uses the volume label as the
                service name, along with the default parameters
                specified in the CREATE SERVICE command. You can
                disable this feature with the SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT
                or SET DEVICE AUTOMOUNT command.

        Examples

              1. InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE ONLINE_DOC FOR DK20:
                CLASS ODS_2 PASSWORD NEWCD NOWRITERS
                %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.

                 This command tells the server to create a service named
                 ONLINE_DOC that is password protected with the password
                 NEWCD. The service is associated with device DK20 and
                 is write protected by the NOWRITERS option.



                                                                    3-17

              %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.

              This command tells the server to create a service named
              BACKUP that is password protected with the password
              BCKUP4. This service is associated with device TP80 and
              allows one writer.

        ________________________________________________________________

        DELETE PARTITION

              Deletes an existing partition.

        Format

              DELETE PARTITION  device:partition [ERASE]

        Parameter

              device:partition
              Specifies a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined in
              Table 2-1. Tape devices are not partitioned.

              The partition must already exist on the specified device.
              Wildcard characters are permitted in partition names.

        Option

              ERASE
              Writes an erase pattern on the allocated blocks. The erase
              algorithm is a single-pass write of zeros.

        Description

              You use the DELETE command to delete a partition that has
              been previously created. If the partition has been served
              to the network, the services bound to the partition are
              also deleted.

              The InfoServer system prompts you for confirmation if
              you try to delete a partition to which remote clients are
              currently connected.

              Deleted partitions are marked, and then reused when new
              partitions are created. You can use the SHOW PARTITIONS
              command with the FULL option to display all the deleted
              partitions on a disk.

        ________________________________________________________________

        DELETE SERVICE

              Causes the InfoServer system to stop providing the
              specified service to clients.

        Format

              DELETE SERVICE  service-name [FOR] device[:partition] [CLASS class-name]

        Parameters

              service-name
              Specifies the name of the service to delete. Usually, a
              service name is the same as the volume label of the disk
              volume. The service name can contain wildcard characters.

              device[:partition]
              The specified device can be either of the following:

              o  DKn:

                 Specifies a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined
                 in Table 2-1. If you do not supply a partition name,
                 the service is created for the entire disk. If you do
                 supply a partition name, the service is bound to the
                 partition on the disk. The partition must already exist
                 on the disk.

              o  TPn:

                 Specifies a valid InfoServer tape device, as defined in
                 Table 2-1.

              As an option, you can add the device, or device and
              partition, to the DELETE SERVICE command. Because an
              InfoServer system might have two disk volumes with the
              same service name, the DELETE command lets you qualify
              which service you want to delete. If you omit this
              parameter, the InfoServer system searches and deletes
              all service names that satisfy the other qualifiers.

              CLASS class-name
              Specifies the namespace from which the service should be
              removed. Because each namespace can have the same service
              name, the CLASS parameter indicates which services to

                                                                    3-21

 



     DELETE SERVICE


           delete. If you omit this parameter, the InfoServer system
           searches and deletes all service names in all classes
           that satisfy all other parameters. Table 3-2 lists valid
           class-name parameter values.


     Description

           The DELETE SERVICE command deletes an existing service
           from the InfoServer system. Client systems can no longer
           access devices or partitions under the deleted service
           name.

           The DELETE SERVICE command lets you delete all in-
           stances of a service name or a particular service name
           qualified by device and class name. You can use the
           device[:partition] and CLASS parameters to specify the
           exact service name you want to delete. If you want to
           delete all instances of a service name, then omit these
           parameters.

           The DELETE SERVICE command warns you if clients are
           connected to the specified service name. You have the
           option to delete the service (terminating the sessions
           connected) or to abort the DELETE SERVICE command.

     Example

           InfoServer> DELETE SERVICE CD_DOC_00661 FOR DK110: CLASS ODS_
     2
           Warning: 5 users are connected to CD_DOC_00661
           Do you still want to delete CD_DOC_00661 [NO]?  YES
           %ESS-I-DELETED, Delete service request completed successfully.

           This command returns a warning because the specified
           service name has client systems connected to it. You
           are asked if the service should still be deleted. In
           this example, the answer is YES, so the remote users are
           disconnected from this service.

        ________________________________________________________________

        DISCONNECT

              Terminates an existing LASTport or LAT terminal server
              session.

        Format

              DISCONNECT  {LAST | LAT} session-number

        Parameter

              session-number
              Specifies the number of a LASTport or LAT terminal server
              session.

        Options

              LAST
              Specifies a LASTport session.

              LAT
              Specifies a LAT terminal server session.

        Description

              The DISCONNECT command immediately breaks an existing
              connection to the server. Each InfoServer LASTport or LAT
              terminal server session has a unique session number, which
              you can display by entering the InfoServer commands SHOW
              LAST or SHOW LAT. When you enter the DISCONNECT command,
              you specify the session number of the session you want to
              disconnect. If you omit the LAST or LAT keyword, LAST is
              assumed.

        Example

              InfoServer> DISCONNECT LAT 12
              %ESS-I-DISCONNECTED, Session 12 disconnected

              This command disconnects LAT terminal server session 12.



                                                                    3-23

 



     ERASE


     ________________________________________________________________

     ERASE

           Erases the specified disk or partition, or, if the device
           is NVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory), FUNCTIONS or
           SERVICES data.

     Format

           ERASE  device[:partition] {FUNCTIONS | SERVICES}

     Parameter

           device[:partition]
           Specifies the read/write disk, disk partition, or NVRAM.

     Options

           FUNCTIONS
           If the device is NVRAM, specifies that FUNCTIONS data be
           erased.

           SERVICES
           If the device is NVRAM, specifies that SERVICES data be
           erased.

     Description

           Use the ERASE command to erase the following:

           o  A read/write disk or partition

           o  FUNCTIONS or SERVICES data in NVRAM

           For disk operations, the server state must be set OFF
           to execute the ERASE command. The erase algorithm is a
           single-pass write of zeros.

     Example

           InfoServer> ERASE NVRAM SERVICES
           %ESS-I-ERASE, Erase operation completed successfully.

           This command erases SERVICES data on NVRAM.

        ________________________________________________________________

        EXIT

              Terminates the InfoServer management session.

        Format

              EXIT [LOGOUT]

        Description

              You use the EXIT command to log out of the InfoServer
              system and terminate the InfoServer management session
              after all management functions are complete. On the
              console terminal, you are prompted for the login password
              again before you can enter more commands. On a remote
              LAT terminal server management terminal, the LAT terminal
              server session is disconnected. The LOGOUT command is
              functionally equivalent to EXIT.

        Example

              InfoServer> EXIT

              This command ends the current server management session.

     Format

           HELP  [topic] [subtopic...]

     Parameters

           [topic] [subtopic...]
           You use the HELP command to obtain online help for any
           of the InfoServer commands. You can specify the topic and
           subtopic for which you want help. If you do not specify a
           topic, the system displays a list of topics and prompts
           you for a selection.

     Description

           The HELP command is an online reference for InfoServer
           commands. After you view an initial help display, press
           Return. The help display stops and the InfoServer> prompt
           is displayed.

           If you do not specify a command name, the HELP command
           displays general information on the commands for which
           help is available. If you specify a command name, you
           obtain syntax information for that command. If you enter
           the HELP command with a command name only, such as HELP
           SHOW, the InfoServer system displays a list of all of the
           command keywords used with the SHOW command.

     Example

           InfoServer> HELP SHOW

           This command displays a description of the SHOW command
           and the command format.

        Parameter

              device[:]
              Specifies a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined in
              Table 2-1. Tape, FLASH memory, and NVRAM (nonvolatile
              random-access memory) devices cannot be initialized.

        Description

              Use the INITIALIZE command to format a read/write disk
              into an InfoServer disk capable of supporting partitions
              or storing system configuration information. Initializing
              a disk destroys any data already stored on the disk.
              Before entering an INITIALIZE command, you must issue
              a SET SERVER STATE OFF command.

              By default, the single read/write disk preconfigured with
              the InfoServer system is already initialized.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
              InfoServer> INITIALIZE DK4:
              %ESS-I-INIT, Initialize completed successfully.
              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON

              This command initializes the DK4 disk.

                ________________________Note  ________________________

                When you initialize an InfoServer device, any
                data on the device is lost. This includes any
                configuration information that may have been saved
                previously.

              the command.

        Description

              You use the LOOP command to repeat any valid InfoServer
              command. The LOOP command continues to repeat the
              specified command until you press any key.

     MONITOR


     ________________________________________________________________

     MONITOR

           Repeats any valid InfoServer command every 3 seconds.

     Format

           MONITOR  [server-command]

     Parameter

           server-command
           Specifies a valid InfoServer command. If you do not
           specify a command, the InfoServer system prompts you for
           the command.

     Description

           You use the MONITOR command to repeat any valid InfoServer
           command. The MONITOR command pauses for 3 seconds between
           commands and moves the cursor to the home position on
           ANSI-type screens. This action makes the command useful
           for redisplaying SHOW command screens.

           To stop the MONITOR command, press any key.

     Example

           InfoServer> MONITOR SHOW ETHERNET

           This command repeats the SHOW ETHERNET command every 3
           seconds, refreshing the screen for each display.

        ________________________________________________________________

        PURGE VXT

              Purges previous versions of VXT files from the specified
              destination disk.

        Format

              PURGE VXT  src_device[:] [dest_device[:] ]

        Parameters

              src_device[:]
              Specifies the drive containing the VXT distribution
              compact disc.

              dest_device[:]
              Optionally specifies the destination device to which the
              new VXT files were copied and from which older VXT files
              are to be purged.

              If you omit the destination device name, the InfoServer
              system uses, in order, one of the following:

              1  The device from which the system booted, if the device
                 is writable

              2  The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device
                 number

        Description

              If you decide not to purge old X terminal files during an
              UPDATE VXT operation, you can use the PURGE VXT command to
              do so later.

        Example

              InfoServer> PURGE VXT DK20: DK10:
              %ESS-I-PURGE, Purge operation completed successfully.

              This command compares versions of X terminal files
              installed on the DK10 disk with the new versions supplied
              on the compact disc in the DK20 drive. If older versions

                                                                    3-31

        REBOOT

              Ends all active service connections and reinitializes the
              InfoServer system.

        Format

              REBOOT  [YES]

        Parameter

              YES
              Initiates the shutdown procedure.

        Description

              You use the REBOOT command to reboot the InfoServer
              system. The REBOOT command ends all active service
              connections by remote clients and starts the InfoServer
              bootstrap sequence.

              If you omit the YES keyword, the InfoServer system prompts
              you to confirm the shutdown.

        Example

              InfoServer> REBOOT
              _Are you sure you want to reboot the InfoServer now [No]? YES

              This command starts the reboot sequence. The user is asked
              to confirm the command.

     RECORD


     ________________________________________________________________

     RECORD

           Records data from an InfoServer disk or partition to a
           compact disc.

     Format

           RECORD  src_device[:parition] dest_device[:] [TIME
                   minutes] [SPEED {1 | 2} ] [ISO | HSFS]
                   [SIZE bytes] [TEST]

     Parameters

           src_device[:partition]
           Specifies the source device, which must be a valid
           InfoServer disk or partition.

           dest_device[:]
           Specifies the destination device, which must be the
           recorder compact disc drive.

     Options

           TIME
           Specifies the interval, in minutes, at which the recording
           software displays updates. For example, a value of 2
           specifies that updates be displayed every two minutes.
           The default value is one minute.

           SPEED
           Specifies the speed factor at which data is transferred
           from the source drive to the destination compact disc
           drive. A value of 1 indicates the speed at which an audio
           compact disc is read and is the default value for the Sony
           CDW-900E recorder. For other recorders, the default value
           is 2.

           ISO or HSFS
           Specifies ISO 9660 or High Sierra File System format. If
           you do not specify this option, the data is recorded in
           the client's native file format.

                                                                  RECORD


              SIZE
              Specifies the size, in bytes, of the source disk or
              partition. By default, the recording is the size of the
              source disk or partition. You can use the SIZE option to
              override the default value.

              TEST
              Disables physical recording so that the recording process
              can be verified before writing data to the compact disc.
              For example, you might want to check whether the source
              disk drive can transfer data to the Sony CDW-900E compact
              disc drive at the specified speed.

        Description

              You use the RECORD command to record data either in native
              format or, using a formatter, in ISO 9660 or High Sierra
              File System (HFSF) format. For detailed instructions on
              performing recording operations, see Section 4.12.

        Example

              InfoServer> RECORD DK5:ULTRIX_DATA DK20: TIME 2

              This command records data from the partition DK5:ULTRIX_
              DATA to the recorder drive DK2. The command requests that
              recording progress updates be provided every two minutes.

     RESTORE


     ________________________________________________________________

     RESTORE

           Restores the system state and all services from the last
           saved configuration.

     Format

           RESTORE  [ device[:] ]

     Parameter

           device[:]
           Specifies a valid InfoServer device, as defined in
           Table 2-1, to use for the restore procedure. Tapes are
           not used for restore operations.

           If you omit the device name, the InfoServer system uses,
           in order, one of the following:

           1  NVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) for InfoServer
              1000 systems

           2  The device from which the system booted, if the device
              is writable

           3  The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device
              number

     Description

           You use the RESTORE command to restore a previously saved
           system configuration. The SAVE command lets you save any
           services offered with the CREATE SERVICE command, as well
           as any InfoServer characteristics changed with the SET
           command. The settings are saved on an InfoServer read
           /write device. The RESTORE command resets the running
           InfoServer system to its last saved settings.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The RESTORE command does not delete any existing
              services before restoring previously saved services.
              Therefore, any saved services are added to the

     3-36

                existing list of services. Currently active services
                are not replaced by restored services.

                _____________________________________________________

        Example

              InfoServer> RESTORE DK10:
              %ESS-I-RESTORED, Restore completed successfully from DK10:

              This command restores the last set of InfoServer services
              and settings saved on the DK10 disk to the running
              InfoServer system.

     RETRIEVE


     ________________________________________________________________

     RETRIEVE

           Restores InfoServer-formatted disks that were saved with
           the BACKUP command.

     Format

           RETRIEVE  src_device[:] dest_device[:]

     Parameters

           src_device[:]
           Specifies the source device, which must be a valid
           InfoServer-formatted disk, as defined in Table 2-1.

           dest_device[:]
           Specifies the destination device, which must be a valid
           InfoServer-formatted disk, as defined in Table 2-1.

     Description

           The RETRIEVE command requires that the source device was
           created by the BACKUP command. The destination disk is
           initialized, the partitions are copied, and the services
           are saved when the partitions are restored.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The RETRIEVE command restores services that
              reference the restored device but does not attempt
              to save the services to disk. If you want to
              retain the restored services, you must enter a SAVE
              command. You might want to enter a SET SERVER STATE
              ON command before entering the SAVE command.

        Description

              The REWIND command rewinds the specified tape but does not
              unload it.

        Example

     SAVE

           Saves the current system state to nonvolatile storage.

     Format

           SAVE  [device[:] ]

     Parameter

           device[:]
           Specifies a valid InfoServer device to use, as defined in
           Table 2-1. Tapes are not used for SAVE operations.

           If you omit the device name, the InfoServer system uses,
           in order, one of the following:

           1  NVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) for InfoServer
              1000 systems

           2  The device from which the system booted, if the device
              is writable

           3  The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device
              number

     Description

           The SAVE command lets you save the current InfoServer
           state on a writable InfoServer device. This action allows
           the InfoServer system to restore service information
           quickly if an interruption occurs, such as a power failure
           or reboot. When the system reinitializes, it searches
           all writable devices for the first saved configuration
           information.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              Saving configuration information does not affect
              user data on the writable device if the device
              has been initialized. The InfoServer system
              automatically preallocates space on initialized
              devices for SAVE operations by creating a partition
              named CONFIGURATION. To reset your InfoServer system

                to the factory defaults, simply delete the partition
                named CONFIGURATION. If you want to save this file,

     SET DEVICE


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET DEVICE

           Changes device characteristics. When you enter a SET
           DEVICE command, the change takes effect immediately. Enter
           a SAVE command to preserve these characteristics across
           InfoServer reboots.

     Format

           SET DEVICE  [ALL | device-list ] {AUTOMOUNT | CHANGER | MOP [SEARCH] } {DISABLED | ENABLED}


     Parameters

           ALL
           Specifies all eligible devices.

           device-list
           Specifies a device or list of devices. Use commas to
           separate devices in a list.

     Options

           AUTOMOUNT
           Disables or enables automounting of devices, such as
           compact discs, that are not in InfoServer format. If you
           specify a device list, use commas to separate the devices.
           Note that to enable specific devices for automounting,
           serverwide automount must already be enabled. (See the
           description of the SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT command.)

           CHANGER
           Declares a device as a changer device. This is required
           for changers that InfoServer software does not automati-
           cally recognize as such. The command does not alter the
           characteristics of a device that the software recognizes
           as a changer.

           MOP [SEARCH]
           Controls selection of a device for MOP downline load
           requests. Disabling MOP search for a device prevents the
           device from being selected as part of a MOP downline load

              Disables an option.

              ENABLED
              Enables an option.

        Description

              Use this command to set characteristics of specific
              devices-for example, to restrict access to certain
              services by disabling automounting of the device or to

     ________________________________________________________________

     SET PARTITION

           Sets or clears the maintenance operation protocol (MOP)
           attribute on a partition.

     Format

           SET PARTITION  device:partition MOP {DISABLED | ENABLED}

     Parameter

           device:partition
           Specifies the parition for which the MOP attribute is
           enabled or disabled.

     Options

           DISABLED
           Clears the MOP attribute from a partition.

           ENABLED
           Enables the MOP attribute on a partition.

     Description

           You use the SET PARTITION command to set or clear the
           MOP attribute on a partition. When the MOP attribute is
           enabled on a partition, the InfoServer system downline
           loads an image from this partition if a client requests
           an image that matches the partition name. For more
           information, see the CREATE PARTITION command.

     Example

           InfoServer> SET PARTITION DK10:PR0801ENG MOP ENABLED
           %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

           This command enables the MOP attribute for the partition
           DK10:PR0801ENG.

        ________________________________________________________________

        SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT

              Allows the InfoServer system to provide access to
              removable media automatically.

        Format

              SET [SERVER] AUTOMOUNT  {DISABLED | ENABLED}

        Options

              DISABLED
              Disables the InfoServer system from automatically serving
              any compact discs by volume label when they are inserted
              and when the system boots.

              ENABLED (D)
              Enables the InfoServer system to serve compact discs
              automatically by volume label when they are inserted and
              when the system boots. This is the default setting.

        Description

              The SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT command lets you determine
              whether the InfoServer system automatically serves
              the compact discs to the network by volume label. When
              enabled, discs are served as they are inserted and when
              the system boots. The default setting is enabled.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT DISABLED
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

              This command disables the automount feature of the
              InfoServer system.

     SET SERVER CACHE BUCKETSIZE


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVER CACHE BUCKETSIZE

           Changes the size of a cache bucket.

     Format

           SET [SERVER] CACHE BUCKETSIZE  {8 | 16 | 32}

     Parameters

           8, 16, 32
           Specifies the cache bucket size in blocks.

     Description

           The SET SERVER CACHE BUCKETSIZE command lets you change
           the size of a cache bucket. You must specify one of the
           parameter values 8, 16, or 32. Cache buckets determine
           how many blocks ahead of or behind the current block are
           loaded into cache when a read from a disk occurs. The
           number of blocks read is a function of both cache bucket
           size and the service READAHEAD and READBEHIND flags (see
           the SET SERVICE command).

           Because the new value is read at boot time, the value
           takes effect the next time the server is booted. The
           default cache bucket size is 8 blocks.

     Example

           InfoServer> SET SERVER CACHE BUCKETSIZE 16

           This command sets the cache bucket size to 16 blocks.

        ________________________________________________________________

        SET SERVER CACHE SIZE

              Changes the size of cache.

        Format

              SET [SERVER] CACHE SIZE  {1 | 2 | 3}

        Parameters

              1, 2, 3
              Specifies the cache size in megabytes.

        Description

              The default value for the cache size is 3 megabytes. If
              you choose to run with a smaller cache, the memory not
              used for cache is allocated in the InfoServer pool memory,
              which can be used to support other InfoServer functions.

              This command is not dynamic. After setting the cache size
              and saving the new value, you must reboot the InfoServer
              system for the new value to take effect.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER CACHE SIZE 2

              This command sets the cache size to 2 megabytes.

     SET SERVER CRASHDUMP


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVER CRASHDUMP

           Enables or disables crash dumps.

     Format

           SET [SERVER] CRASHDUMP {DISABLED | ENABLED}  [ device[:]  ]


     Parameter

           device[:]
           Optionally specifies a valid InfoServer disk device,
           as defined in Table 2-1. If you omit the parameter, the
           InfoServer system uses, in order, one of the following:

           1  The device from which the system booted, if the device
              is writable

           2  The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device
              number

     Options

           DISABLED (D)
           Disables crash dumps.

           ENABLED
           Enables crash dumps.

     Description

           By default, the InfoServer system runs with CRASHDUMP
           disabled. Normally, you do not need to enable this
           function. If you experience a software problem that
           causes your system to crash, you can enable the CRASHDUMP
           function. The InfoServer system then creates an 8000-block
           partition called CRASH_PARTITION.

           If the InfoServer software crashes while CRASHDUMP is
           enabled, the InfoServer memory is written to the CRASH_
           PARTITION partition. You can then copy the data from
           this partition and submit it to Digital for analysis.

                                                    SET SERVER CRASHDUMP


              The partition cannot be deleted with the DELETE PARTITION
              command but is removed when CRASHDUMP is disabled.

              When CRASHDUMP is enabled, the InfoServer command SHOW
              SERVER displays the most recent crash dump status
              information. This single line of information can be
              helpful in identifying problems if you have experienced
              InfoServer crashes.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET CRASHDUMP ENABLED
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

              This command enables crash dumps.

     SET SERVER EXTENSION


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVER EXTENSION

           Specifies a serverwide upper limit, in blocks, for the
           size of virtual disks created remotely by clients.

     Format

           SET [SERVER] EXTENSION [LIMIT]  value

     Parameter

           value
           Specifies the number of blocks, from 64 to 10,000,000. The
           maximum number allowed depends on disk capacity.

     Description

           This command lets you limit the size of virtual disks
           created by clients. The default size is 50,000 blocks.

     Example

           InfoServer> SET SERVER EXTENSION 100000
           %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

           This command sets an extension limit of 100,000 blocks.

        ________________________________________________________________

        SET SERVER GROUP

              Allows the InfoServer manager to specify the LAT terminal
              server group codes under which the management service is
              offered.

        Format

        Parameters

              ALL
              Specifies all group codes (0 to 255) for the SET
              operation.

              code-list
              Specifies a set of group code numbers for the SET
              operation. Group codes are numbers in the range from
              0 to 255. You can specify multiple group codes. Group
              codes separated by a comma (,) indicate single group code
              numbers. Group codes separated by a hyphen (-) indicate a
              range of group code numbers.

        Options

              DISABLED
              Removes the group codes specified in code-list from the
              current set of group codes on which the InfoServer system
              offers its LAT terminal server management interface.

              ENABLED
              Adds the group codes specified in code-list to the current
              set of group codes on which the InfoServer system offers
              its LAT terminal server management interface.

     SET SERVER GROUP



     Description

           The SET SERVER GROUP command lets you enable or disable
           the LAT terminal server group codes used by the InfoServer
           system to advertise its management console. The codes
           range from 0 to 255. To connect to the management console,
           a terminal server must have at least one group code in
           common with the InfoServer system. Use the SHOW LAT
           CHARACTERISTICS command to view the currently enabled
           LAT group codes.

           Default : Group 0 is enabled.

     Example

           InfoServer> SET SERVER GROUP 1, 3, 10-20 ENABLED
           %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

           In this example, group codes 1, 3, and 10 to 20 are
           added to the group code list that the InfoServer system
           currently offers.

        ________________________________________________________________

        SET SERVER IDENTIFICATION

              Assigns an identification string to the InfoServer system
              to be used by the LAT protocol.

        Format

              SET [SERVER] IDENTIFICATION  "string"

        Parameter

              "string"
              Specifies a quoted text string of 0 to 64 printable ASCII
              characters.

        Description

              The SET SERVER IDENTIFICATION command assigns a text
              description to the InfoServer system. The LAT protocol
              uses this description to identify the system.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER IDENTIFICATION "InfoServer Floor 3 by copier"
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

              This command uses a text string that identifies an
              InfoServer system by its location. This string is used
              to advertise the remote management service to terminal
              servers.

     SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP

           Sets the LASTport work group of the InfoServer system.

     Format

           SET [SERVER] LASTPORT [GROUP]  value

     Parameter

           value
           Specifies a value, from 0 to 1023, that represents the
           LASTport group of this InfoServer system. The default
           group is 0.

     Description

           LASTport work groups provide a method of segmenting
           local area networks (LANs) so that services offered by
           an InfoServer system on one LAN segment are not seen by
           clients on another segment. To access virtual devices on a
           particular InfoServer system, client systems must belong
           to the same work group as that InfoServer system.

           One possible environment for this command is an extended
           LAN. Here, an InfoServer manager might want to restrict
           clients to the services offered by InfoServer systems on
           the same LAN segment.

     Example

           InfoServer> SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP 1
           %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

           This command sets the InfoServer LASTport work group to 1.
           The InfoServer system then communicates only with client
           systems that are in work group 1.

              Disables the LAT Responder function. This is the default
              setting.

              ENABLED
              Enables the LAT Responder function.

        Description

              When the LAT Responder function is enabled, the InfoServer
              system maintains a database of all LAT terminal server
              services available on the local area network (LAN) and
              responds to requests for this information from systems
              that do not maintain such a database.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET LAT_RESPONDER ENABLED
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

              This command enables the LAT Responder function.

     Options

           DISABLED
           Disables the InfoServer system's downline-loading
           capability.

           ENABLED (D)
           Enables the InfoServer system to perform MOP downline
           loading. This is the default setting.

     Description

           The SET SERVER MOP command provides the InfoServer manager
           with a convenient way to enable or disable the InfoServer
           system's MOP downline-loading capability. If the system
           does not need to perform MOP downline loading, disabling
           the function can enhance system performance.

           For more information on the uses of downline loading, see
           Section 2.11.4.

     Example

           InfoServer> SET MOP DISABLED
           %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

           This command disables the InfoServer system's MOP

     SET SERVER NAME


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVER NAME

           Changes the name that identifies the InfoServer system on
           the extended local area network (LAN).

     Format

           SET [SERVER] NAME  server-name

     Parameter

           server-name
           Specifies the name of the InfoServer system. The system
           uses a unique default name of the form LAD_Ethernet_
           address (for example, LAD_0800020000FF) until a new
           name is set with this command. The name can be up
           to 16 characters in length. Section 2.8.1 lists the
           characters you can use in InfoServer names.

     Description

           The SET SERVER NAME command lets you select a name string
           that identifies the InfoServer system on the extended LAN.
           This name allows you to identify an InfoServer system by
           using the SHOW SERVER command. The InfoServer name is also
           used to provide a LAT terminal server service to which
           you can connect from a terminal to manage the InfoServer
           system.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              InfoServer names must be unique within the extended
              LAN.

              _____________________________________________________

     Example

           InfoServer> SET SERVER NAME LAB1_INFOSERVER
           %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

           This command sets the InfoServer name to LAB1_INFOSERVER.

        SET SERVER PASSWORD

              Allows the InfoServer manager to change the InfoServer
              password.

        Format

                            {NOPASSWORD       } [{ NONPRIVILEGED  } ]
              SET [SERVER]  {                 } [{                } ]
                            {PASSWORD string  } [{ PRIVILEGED     } ]
                                                [                   ]

        Description

              The InfoServer password controls access to InfoServer
              management sessions. You can specify a privileged or
              nonprivileged password or no password. Users who log in
              using the nonprivileged password can perform only SHOW and
              HELP operations.

              You can set either password to the null string by
              specifying NOPASSWORD.

              The default privileged password is ESS. The default non-
              privileged password is INFOSERVER. If both the PRIVILEGED
              and NONPRIVILEGED keywords are omitted, the default is
              PRIVILEGED. If both the privileged and nonprivileged
              passwords are identical, the session is logged in as a
              privileged session.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER PASSWORD PRIVILEGED
              _New_password: SECRET (not echoed)
              _Verfication: SECRET (not echoed)
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

              This command sets the InfoServer privileged password to
              SECRET.




                                                                    3-59

 



     SET SERVER PROMPT


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVER PROMPT

           Allows the InfoServer manager to change the InfoServer
           prompt.

     Format

           SET [SERVER] PROMPT  "string"

     Parameter

           "string"
           A string enclosed in quotation marks (" "). A space is
           automatically inserted between the last character of
           the string and the first character a user types. The
           prompt string can contain a maximum of 24 alphanumeric
           characters.

     Description

           The SET SERVER PROMPT command changes the default
           InfoServer> prompt. To save the prompt across reboots,
           you must issue the SAVE command.

     Example

           InfoServer> SET SERVER PROMPT "DocServer>"
           DOCServer> SAVE
           %ESS-I-SAVED, Save operation completed successfully to DK10:

           These commands set the InfoServer prompt to DocServer> and
           save the prompt.

        ________________________________________________________________

        SET SERVER REMOTE

              Specifies a device or list of devices on which remote
              clients can create virtual disks.

        Format

              SET [SERVER] REMOTE [DEVICE]  device-list {DISABLED | ENABLED}

        Parameter

              device-list
              Specifies a writable disk or list of writable disks. Use
              commas to separate devices in a list.

        Options

              DISABLED
              Removes the specified device or devices from the
              InfoServer system's Remote Device List.

              ENABLED
              Adds the specified device or devices to the InfoServer
              system's Remote Device List.

        Description

              The SET SERVER REMOTE command enables remote clients
              to create virtual disks on InfoServer writable disks.
              Specifying ENABLED with device names adds the devices to
              the InfoServer system's Remote Device List (displayed with
              the SHOW SERVER command). Specifying DISABLED with device
              names removes the devices from the list. Specifying device
              names without ENABLED or DISABLED replaces any devices in
              an existing Remote Device List with the devices specified
              with the SET SERVER REMOTE command.

        Format

              SET [SERVER] STATE  {OFF | ON | SHUT}

        Parameters

              OFF
              Tells the InfoServer system to end all current connections
              and not to accept new connections.

              ON
              Tells the InfoServer system to accept new connection
              requests.

              SHUT
              Tells the InfoServer system to keep all current connec-
              tions but not to accept new connections.

        Description

              The SET SERVER STATE command tells the InfoServer system
              which actions to take when it receives a new service
              connection request from a client. The InfoServer state
              does not affect LAT terminal server connections used to
              manage the InfoServer system.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE SHUT
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

              This command shuts off new connections, but keeps all
              current connections. You might use this command when you
              plan to turn off the InfoServer system in the near future
              for maintenance.

     SET SERVER WRITE ACCESS


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVER WRITE ACCESS

           Sets the write policies for InfoServer virtual disk
           services.

     Format

           SET [SERVER] WRITE [ACCESS]  {BLOCKING | PRE-EMPTIVE}

     Parameters

           BLOCKING
           Tells the InfoServer system to block writers from
           accessing a service until all readers have disconnected
           from the service.

           PRE-EMPTIVE (D)
           Tells the InfoServer system to allow writers to access
           a service and end all read sessions to the service. Pre-
           emptive is the default write access mode.

     Description

           The SET SERVER WRITE ACCESS command allows the InfoServer
           manager to set the write policies that govern access to
           all InfoServer read/write services. There are two choices:

           1  Allow the readers to remain connected and deny access
              to the writer.

           2  Disconnect the readers and let the writer connect. Only
              one writer at a time can access a service, regardless
              of the write-access policy.

           YOu might use this command might when you want to perform
           nightly updates of a database on a virtual disk. Each
           night a writer could connect to a service to update the
           database, disconnecting any read-only connections. After
           the writer disconnects, the readers could reconnect and
           access the new data on the virtual disk.

     SET SERVICE


     ________________________________________________________________

     SET SERVICE

           Modifies the attributes of an existing service.

     Format

           SET SERVICE  service-name [FOR] device[:partition] [CLASS class-name] [options]

     Parameters

           service-name
           Specifies the name of a service to be modified. The
           service name can contain wildcard characters.

           device[:partition]
           The specified device can be either of the following:

           o  DKn:

              Specifies a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined
              in Table 2-1. If you do not supply a partition name,
              the service is modified for the entire disk. If you do
              supply a partition name, the service is modified for
              the partition on the disk. The partition must already
              exist on the disk.

           o  TPn:

              Specifies a valid InfoServer tape device, as defined in
              Table 2-1.

           Because an InfoServer system can have multiple devices
           with the same service name, this option lets you qualify
           which service you want to modify. If you omit this
           parameter, all service names that satisfy the other
           options are modified.

           CLASS class-name
           Specifies the namespace in which this service name
           exists. If you include this parameter, the InfoServer
           system searches only the specified class. If you omit
           this parameter, all service names that satisfy the other
           options are modified.

     3-66

 



                                                             SET SERVICE


              You use different namespaces for different on-disk
              structures used by various client systems. The purpose
              is to partition the namespaces so that clients see only
              names that are meaningful to them. This method also allows
              two services to have the same name and not conflict.

              The class name used depends on the client systems that
              connect to the service being created. For example, OpenVMS
              systems use the ODS_2 namespace by default when attempting
              to mount an InfoServer device. Table 3-2 lists valid
              class-name parameter values.

              Default names are ODS_2 (if a DK device is specified) and
              TAPE (if a TP device is specified).

        Options

              DYNAMIC_RATING
              Specifies that the InfoServer system should calculate a
              rating for this service dynamically. This is the default
              method for the service ratings.

              [NO]PASSWORD string
              Specifies an optional access control password for the
              service. The password string can be up to 39 alphanumeric
              ASCII characters in length. After you set a password, a
              client must specify the password to access the service. If
              you do not specify a password in this command, clients are
              not required to provide a password to access the service.

              You can enter the password without having it echoed on the
              screen by entering the PASSWORD option as the last option
              in the CREATE SERVICE command. After entering the keyword
              PASSWORD, press Return. The InfoServer system prompts you
              for the password.

              [NO]READAHEAD
              Determines whether blocks following a request are also
              inserted into cache. The number of blocks read into
              cache is determined by the BUCKETSIZE parameter of the
              SET SERVER CACHE command. If the READAHEAD attribute is
              enabled, the blocks following a request are loaded into
              cache from the beginning of the bucket up to the current
              request.

                                                                    3-67

 



     SET SERVICE


           [NO]READBEHIND
           Determines whether blocks preceding a request are also
           inserted into cache. The number of blocks read into cache
           is determined by the BUCKETSIZE parameter of the SET
           SERVER CACHE command. If the READBEHIND attribute is
           enabled, the blocks preceding a request are loaded into
           cache from the beginning of the bucket up to the current
           request.

           [NO]READERS number
           Specifies the maximum number of client connections allowed
           for read access. The default is 1000 readers. A value of 0
           indicates write-only access, as qualified by the WRITERS
           option, if present. If a client requests read-only access
           or read/write access to the service then one reader is
           counted against this number.

           STATIC_RATING rating
           Specifies a rating from 0 to 65535 to use for load
           balancing across redundant services. Clients always choose
           a higher rating over a lower one. If you omit the STATIC_
           RATING option, the InfoServer system calculates a dynamic
           rating based on InfoServer load.

           [NO]WRITERS number
           Specifies the maximum number of client connections allowed
           for write access. The default is one writer. A value of 0
           indicates read-only access, as qualified by the READERS
           option, if present. If a client requests write-only access
           or read/write access to the service, one writer is counted
           against this number.

              ________________________Note ________________________

              The InfoServer system does not allow more than one
              writer to connect to a read/write service at one
              time. See the SET SERVER WRITE ACCESS command for
              more information regarding the write-access policies
              described in Section 2.10.

                                                             SET SERVICE



        Description

              The SET SERVICE command lets you modify the attributes of
              an existing service. The network manager can change the
              rating, password, number of readers, or number of writers
              associated with a service.

              You can modify all instances of a service name or a
              particular service name qualified by device and class
              name. You can use the device[:partition] and CLASS
              parameters to specify the exact service name you want to
              modify. If you want to modify all instances of a service
              name, omit these parameters. The service name can include
              wildcard characters.

        Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVICE ONLINE_DOC FOR DK110: NOPASSWORD
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.

              This command tells the InfoServer system to remove the
              password currently required to access the ONLINE_DOC
              service, which represents the DK110 device.

        BIND

              Deletes the virtual device created by a BIND command
              and terminates the connection to the associated remote
              service.

        Format

              UNBIND  [VDK10[:]

        Parameters

              [VDK10[:]
              Optionally specifies the name of the virtual device. By
              default, VDK10 is assumed.

        Description

              You can use the same remote service to perform multiple
              updates on an InfoServer system (for example, you might
              use the service UPD_DRV to update VXT software and then
              install new functions). However, you must enter the UNBIND
              command after each update operation to flush data that has
              been cached from the previous one. You then enter the BIND
              command to reconnect to the UPD_DRV service before you
              perform the next update.

              For detailed information on performing network installa-
              tions and updates, refer to Section 4.13.

        Format

              UPDATE FUNCTIONS  src_device[:] [dest_device[:] ]

        Parameters

              src_device[:]
              Specifies the drive containing the new function compact
              disc.

              dest_device[:]
              Optionally specifies the writable InfoServer destination
              device, which can be either an InfoServer-formatted
              disk or NVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory). If you
              specify NVRAM, do not include the colon.

              If you omit the destination device name, the InfoServer
              system uses, in order, one of the following:

              1  NVRAM for InfoServer 1000 systems

              2  The device from which the system booted, if the device
                 is writable

              3  The InfoServer-formatted disk with the lowest device
                 number

        Description

              You use the UPDATE FUNCTIONS command to install new
              functions, which come on a special compact disc from
              Digital. The UPDATE FUNCTIONS command installs the
              functions from the compact disc onto the target device
              you specify.





                                                                   3-113

        UPDATE SYSTEM

              Updates the InfoServer operational software.

        Format

              UPDATE SYSTEM  src_device[:] [dest_device[:] ]

        Parameters

              src_device[:]
              Specifies the drive containing the new InfoServer software
              compact disc, or a hard drive and partition name. This
              parameter must specify a valid InfoServer drive, as
              defined in Table 2-1.

              dest_device[:]
              Optionally specifies the destination device on which the
              new software is installed. This parameter must specify
              either a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined in
              Table 2-1, or FLASH memory (InfoServer 1000 systems only).
              If you specify FLASH, do not include a colon.

              If you omit the destination device name, the InfoServer
              system uses, in order, one of the following:

              1  FLASH for InfoServer 1000 systems

              2  The device from which the system booted, if the device
                 is writable

              3  The InfoServer-formatted device with the lowest device
                 number

        Description

              You use the UPDATE SYSTEM command to update the InfoServer
              software. The InfoServer software is preinstalled
              on the internal read/write device, which is a disk
              for the InfoServer 100 and 150 systems and FLASH for
              InfoServer 1000 systems. If you receive software updates
              on compact discs, you can use the UPDATE SYSTEM command to
              install the updated software on the internal read/write
              device.

                                                                   3-115

 



     UPDATE SYSTEM


           You must specify a source InfoServer compact disc drive
           as the first parameter for the UPDATE SYSTEM command. The
           second parameter is the destination device.

           When you specify FLASH as the destination device, the
           flash burner program displays the current and update
           contents of the FLASH image and requests user confirmation
           of the update. This display consists of the following
           fields:

           __________________________________________________________
           Field_____Contents________________________________________

           Segment   Logical segment number (hex)

           Size      Size of the segment in bytes (hex)

           Version   Segment header version (hex)

           Maj.Rev.  Major version of the segment code (hex)

           Min.Rev.  Minor version of the segment code (hex)

           Pat.Rev.  Patch version of the segment code (hex)

           Time      Time-stamping of the segment code (hex seconds
                     since 1970.0)

           Name______Name_of_the_segment_____________________________

           The update function changes only the InfoServer code and
           help file, segments 4 and 5. The version information for
           these two segments should agree with that shown in the
           Cover Letter.

           During the update, the flash burner program displays
           progress messages on both the console and the InfoServer
           1000 light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The LEDs show a
           code that should be read from right to left, excluding
           the power LED. At the end of the procedure, the flash
           burner forces a console diagnostic startup by setting the
           "corrupt bit," which causes the diagnostics to flush all
           current console state and execute the powerup diagnostic
           sequence. Ignore the resulting "?? CRPT - Corrupt bit is
           set" message when this restart occurs.

        Parameter

              device[:]
              Specifies a valid InfoServer disk device, as defined in
              Table 2-1.

        Options

              NOREPAIR (D)
              Lists errors but does not attempt to repair them.

              REPAIR
              Lists errors and corrects them if possible.

        Description

              The VERIFY command validates the on-disk stucture of the
              specified device. To preserve data integrity, InfoServer
              software does not permit VERIFY REPAIR operations unless
              the InfoServer state is set OFF. This check prevents
              remote virtual disk operations from interfering with local
              disk operations.

        Example

              InfoServer> VERIFY DK10:
              %ESS-I-REWIND, Verify completed successfully.

              The standard InfoServer system provides transparent
              access to compact discs, without the need to enter
              any InfoServer management commands. However, for some
              customized configurations you might need to set up the
              system by using InfoServer commands.

              This chapter describes some of the advanced operations
              you can perform by using InfoServer commands. Each section
              provides examples. The chapter describes how to perform
              the following operations:

              o  Serve regularly updated compact discs

              o  Assign passwords to protect compact discs

              o  Serve media under several service names to allow access
                 by different operating systems

              o  Create and serve partitions to make use of open space
                 on the internal read/write disk

              o  Serve external read/write disks

              o  Back up read/write data locally or remotely

              o  Defragment an InfoServer disk by using BACKUP and
                 RETRIEVE commands

              o  Replicate an InfoServer disk

              o  Make downline loadable images available to clients

              o  Configure X terminals to use the InfoServer system

              o  Enforce network licensing limits for devices

              o  Record compact discs

              o  Perform installations and updates over the network

                                                                     4-1

 



     Advanced Operations
     4.1 Serving Regularly Updated Compact Discs

     4.1 Serving Regularly Updated Compact Discs

           By default, a running InfoServer system automatically
           serves compact discs to clients when you insert the discs.
           It also deletes services automatically when you remove
           compact discs. The system provides access to the current
           set of compact discs by their volume label.

           Access by volume label is convenient for compact discs
           that remain in the InfoServer system on a permanent basis.
           This method is also useful for temporary compact discs
           that will not be updated.

           However, you might want to use a different method for
           compact disc subscriptions where information is updated
           regularly. When you remove an old disc and insert the
           updated copy, the automaticaly assigned service name
           usually changes because the updated media has a new volume
           label. For these cases, you may want to assign a single
           service name to the compact disc drive.

           When you assign a single service name to a disc drive,
           clients can continue to use that name for connections when
           you insert a new disc. With a single service name, clients
           avoid the need to learn the volume labels of each new disc
           inserted.

           To provide a fixed service name, follow these steps:

           1  Assign the service name to a particular device.

           2  Save the name, so it remains in effect whenever the
              InfoServer system reboots.

           Example

           InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE CONDIST FOR DK20: CLASS ODS_
     2 WRITERS 0
           %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.
           InfoServer> SAVE
           %ESS-I-SAVED, Save completed successfully to DK10:
           InfoServer>

           In this example, the InfoServer manager enters the service
           name CONDIST for an InfoServer compact disc drive that
           will serve Digital's consolidated distribution software
           disc. When a new compact disc is inserted, users can

              continue to connect to the service CONDIST instead of
              having to learn the new volume label.


        4.2 Assigning Passwords to Protect Compact Discs

              By default, the InfoServer system automatically makes
              every inserted compact disc available to all client
              systems on the LAN. The InfoServer system creates the
              service for each compact disc and uses default values for
              service-related options such as password protection. By
              default, password protection is off.

              In some cases, you might want to restrict access to
              information on compact discs by assigning a password.
              To provide password protection for compact discs, follow
              these steps:

              1  Disable the automatic serving feature for the selected
                 compact disc, using the command SET DEVICE AUTOMOUNT
                 disabled.

              2  Assign a service name and password for the selected
                 compact disc.

              3  Save the service name and password, so they remain in
                 effect whenever the InfoServer system reboots.

              Example

              InfoServer> SET SERVER AUTOMOUNT DISABLED
              %ESS-I-SET, Set operation completed successfully.
              InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE SENSITIVE_INFO FOR DK20: PASSWORD
              _Password: SECRET (not echoed)
              _Verification: SECRET (not echoed)
              %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.
              InfoServer> SAVE
              %ESS-I-SAVED, Save completed successfully to DK10:
              InfoServer>

              In this example, the InfoServer manager assigns the
              service name
              SENSITIVE_INFO and the password SECRET to the compact disc
              in the DK20 drive.

                                                                     4-3

 



     Advanced Operations
     4.3 Serving Media Under Several Names

     4.3 Serving Media Under Several Names

           The InfoServer system and host clients use protocols that
           allow for redundant virtual devvices to be served on the
           LAN with identical service names. The InfoServer system
           also allows a single virtual devices to be served several
           times under several different names.

           You might want to provide several different names for the
           same virtual disk, for the convenience of users. You might
           also want to make the same media accessible to more than
           one operating system. To assign several names to a virtual
           disk, follow these steps:

           1  Create several services with different names or service
              classes, all for the same device.

           2  Save the services, so the names and classes remain in
              effect whenever the InfoServer system reboots.

           Example

           InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE RAW_DATA FOR DK20: CLASS ODS_2
           %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.
           InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE DATA_FROM_EXPERIMENT_
     2 FOR DK20: CLASS ODS_2
           %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.
           InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE RAW_DATA FOR DK20: CLASS ULTRIX
           %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.
           InfoServer> SAVE
           %ESS-I-SAVED, Save completed successfully to DK10:
           InfoServer>

           In this example, the InfoServer manager assigns three
           aliases to the compact disc in the DK20 drive. The first
           two services are accessible from an OpenVMS system, and
           the third from an ULTRIX system. This action assumes
           that the information on the disc is in a format that each
           operating system can read. Notice that the same name can
           be reused under different service classes.

        4.4 Creating and Serving Partitions

              InfoServer 100 and 150 systems use an internal read/write
              disk to store InfoServer parameters, configuration, and
              operational software. Because these systems use the disk
              for their operations, these systems normally do not make
              the disk available as a whole to the LAN.

              The systems use approximately 5000 to 10,000 disk blocks
              of the internal disk, depending on how many services
              are saved. You can make the remaining free disk blocks
              available to clients for general use, without interfering
              with the InfoServer data on the disk.

              To make the remaining space available, you create
              partitions. You can create partitions on any disk that
              is initialized as an InfoServer disk.

              To make read/write partitions available, follow these
              steps:

              1  Create partitions of the desired size.

              2  Create services for each partition in the proper
                 namespace, with the appropriate read/write access and
                 protection.

              3  Save the services, so they are available whenever the
                 InfoServer system reboots.

              Example

              In the following example, the InfoServer manager creates
              three partitions to serve to the LAN network.

           InfoServer>

           The first partition is used by OpenVMS clients and has two
           service names assigned. The first service is for read-only
           users to access online help. The second service is for
           the LAN network manager to gain write access to the same
           partition, in order to update online help.

           The last two partitions are used by MS-DOS clients running
           PATHWORKS. Notice that the PATHWORKS product uses scratch
           disk storage in the V2.0 service class, not the MS-DOS
           service class.

     4.5 Serving an External Read/Write Disk

           You can add compact discs, read/write disks, and tapes to
           the InfoServer system. The server handles external devices
           the same way as internal devices. For example, external
           compact discs are automatically served to clients when the
           discs are inserted.

                                 4.5 Serving an External Read/Write Disk

              For read/write drives, the disk is normally unformatted.
              Because an unformatted disk does not have a volume label,
              the InfoServer system does not automatically serve it to
              the LAN network.

              To make the disk accessible, follow these steps:

              1  Create a service in the proper namespace, with other
                 desired settings.

              2  Save the service so it is always available whenever the
                 InfoServer system reboots.

        2 WRITERS 1
              %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.
              InfoServer> SAVE
              %ESS-I-SAVED, Save completed successfully to DK10:
              InfoServer>

              After the InfoServer manager enters these commands, a
              client could bind to the service name RZ56, initialize the
              disk with an ODS-2 on-disk structure, mount the disk, and
              use the entire disk as if it were a locally attached RZ56
              disk.

        4.6 Backing Up Read/Write Data

              Because the InfoServer system provides access to read
              /write storage, you might need to periodically back up the
              stored information. Backing up data allows you to restore
              information if the system has a disk failure, you replace
              an InfoServer unit, or any similar interruption occurs.

              There are two methods available for backing up InfoServer
              data:

              o  If you have added a second read/write drive to the
                 InfoServer system, you can perform the backup operation
                 locally by using InfoServer commands.



                                                                     4-7

     4.6 Backing Up Read/Write Data

           o  You can also back up InfoServer disks to a remote
              client system, using the normal disk-access commands
              for your operating system to access the InfoServer
              system.

           The following sections describe how to perform local and
           remote backup operations.

     4.6.1 Backing Up Data Locally

           If you have added a read/write drive to your InfoServer
           system, you can use the InfoServer commands BACKUP and
           RETRIEVE to back up data to, and retrieve data from, that
           disk (see Chapter 3). For a local backup operation to
           succeed, the source and target disks must be the same
           size. If the disks are different sizes, you can create
           partitions.

           To back up data on a local read/write disk, follow these
           steps:

           1  Determine the size of the disk being backed up.

           2  Initialize the external disk, so it can be used to
              create partitions.

           3  Create the partition of the appropriate size.

           4  Use the InfoServer COPY command to save the data.

           To restore the data, you would use the same COPY command
           but specify the partition as the source and the disk as
           the target.

           Example

           InfoServer> SHOW DEVICE DK10:

           Device   Device      Device        Device      Dev. Size/   Volume     Device
            Name     State       Type         Address     Record Num.   Label      Char

           DK10:    On          Hard Disk     A/001         204864     UNKNOWN

           InfoServer> INITIALIZE DK120:
           InfoServer> CREATE PARTITION DK120:SAVE_PARTITION BLOCKS 204864
           %ESS-I-CREATED, Create partition completed successfully.
           InfoServer> COPY DK10: DK120:SAVE_PARTITION
           %ESS-I-COPIED, Copy operation completed successfully.

                                          4.6 Backing Up Read/Write Data

              In this example, the InfoServer manager backs up a
              smaller, internal RZ disk to a larger, external RZ56 disk.
              The manager initializes the RZ56 drive as device DK120 and
              then creates a partition on the RZ56 to match the storage
              size of the internal RZ disk. The backup operation saves
              all system configurations, parameters, and operational
              software, as well as any partitions created.

        4.6.2 Backing Up Data Remotely

              You might want to back up data to a remote client system
              under one of the following conditions:

              o  You do not have additional read/write disks on your
                 InfoServer system.

              o  You want to back up data to some other media, such as
                 magnetic tape.

              Example

              This example shows how to back up data to an OpenVMS
              system. Here are the basic steps:

              1  On the InfoServer system, make the entire disk
                 available through a service.

              2  On the OpenVMS system, access the disk as though the
                 online disk structure were unknown.

              3  Perform the backup operation.














                                                                     4-9

     4.6 Backing Up Read/Write Data

           On the InfoServer system:


           InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE BACKUP FOR DK10: CLASS ODS_2 WRITERS 0 PASSWORD
           _Password: SECRET (not echoed)
           _Verification: SECRET (not echoed)
           InfoServer>

           Then, on the OpenVMS system:

           $ MCR ESS$LADCP
           LADCP> BIND/PASSWORD=SECRET BACKUP
           %LADCP-I-BIND, service bound to logical unit DAD$BACKUP (_DAD4:)
           LADCP> EXIT
           $ MOUNT/FOREIGN/NOWRITE DAD$BACKUP:

           $ MOUNT/FOREIGN DKA200:
           %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED,              mounted on _DKA200:
           $ BACKUP/PHYSICAL DAD$BACKUP: DKA200:

           Note that you could use any other operating system to
           perform this backup operation, as long as that system has
           client software to access the InfoServer system. Simply
           use the appropriate commands for your operating system in
           place of the OpenVMS commands in this example.

     4.7 Defragmenting an InfoServer Disk

           As partitions are created and deleted on an InfoServer-
           formatted disk, the disk can become fragmented. However,
           the file system can reuse deleted partitions for requested
           new partitions provided that the deleted partitions
           are large enough. Because partitions are contiguous,
           a requested new partition cannot be larger than the
           largest deleted partition or than the largest segment
           of remaining free space on the disk. The command SHOW
           PARTITIONS DKn: FULL shows the sizes of both deleted and
           currently allocated partitions.

           Defragmenting a disk requires another disk on which to
           stage the data during the operation. Tape devices are not
           currently supported for BACKUP operations. To defragment
           the disk, you save its contents to a staging disk and
           then immediately restore them using the RETRIEVE command.

                                    4.7 Defragmenting an InfoServer Disk

              Remember to issue the SAVE command to save the restored
              services.

              For example, to back up the system disk DK10 to the backup
              disk DK150 and to defragment the system disk, you enter
              the following commands:

              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
              InfoServer> BACKUP DK10 DK150
              InfoServer> RETRIEVE DK150 DK10
              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON
              InfoServer> SAVE

        4.8 Replicating an InfoServer Disk

              You can use the BACKUP and RETRIEVE commands to move all
              the partitions from one disk to another. For example,
              suppose you want to replace the InfoServer 150 system's
              internal boot disk with a larger device and that hard disk
              DK150 is available to stage data during the exchange. You
              can follow these steps:

              1  Back up the boot device:

                 InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
                 InfoServer> BACKUP DK10 DK150
                 InfoServer> SHUTDOWN Y

              2  Turn off the system and replace the internal disk with
                 a larger device.

              3  Insert the InfoServer kernel compact disc in the
                 internal compact disc drive and turn on the system.
                 The system reboots from the compact disc.

              4  Log in to the InfoServer system and restore the backup
                 to the new disk:

                 InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
                 InfoServer> RETRIEVE DK150 DK10

              5  Restore the old service database from the restored copy
                 of the boot device. The services for the partitions on
                 DK10 have been restored by the RETRIEVE command.

                 InfoServer> RESTORE DK10
                 InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON

                                                                    4-11

     4.9 Making Downline Loadable Images Available to Clients

           To make system software and other downline loadable images
           available to clients, follow these steps:

           1  Determine the size of the downline loadable image.

           2  Create a partition on the InfoServer system to receive
              the image.

           3  Create a service to access the partition from the
              client system.

           4  Copy the image to the partition.

           5  Modify the partition to be a maintenance operation
              protocol (MOP) partition.

           6  Make sure that the MOP downline loading feature is
              enabled.

           Example

           This example shows the steps for downline loading a
           DECserver 200 that requests a file named PR0801ENG.SYS.
           The example uses OpenVMS as the client system that has the
           downline loadable image. You could use any other operating
           system that has client access to the InfoServer system;
           simply use the appropriate commands for your operating
           system in place of the OpenVMS commands.

           On the OpenVMS system currently performing downline
           loading, issue a DIRECTORY command to determine the size
           of the downline loadable file. For example:

           $ DIRECTORY/SIZE MOM$LOAD:PR0801ENG.SYS

           Directory SYS$COMMON:[MOM$SYSTEM]

           PR0801ENG.SYS;1       378

           $

           From an InfoServer console terminal, enter the CREATE
           PARTITION command to set aside storage for the MOP
           downline loadable file. The partition name must be the

     4-12

              same as the OpenVMS file name, but without the file type
              (which is the name requested by the system being downline
              loaded). Serve the partition to the LAN, so that the
              OpenVMS system can copy the downline loadable file to
              the partition. For example:


              InfoServer> CREATE PARTITION DK10:PR0801ENG BLOCKS 378
              %ESS-I-CREATE, Create partition completed successfully.
              InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE MOP_UPDATE FOR DK10:PR0801ENG CLASS ODS_2
              WRITER 1 PASSWORD
              _Password: SECRET (not echoed)
              _Verification: SECRET (not echoed)
              %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.
              InfoServer>

              On the OpenVMS client system, bind to the service under
              which the partition was served. Next, mount the device as
              a foreign device. Then copy the downline loadable file to
              the device connected to the partition.

              $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:ESS$LADCP
              LADCP> BIND/WRITE/PASSWORD=SECRET MOP_UPDATE
              %LADCP-I-BIND, service bound to logical unit DAD$MOP_UPDATE (_DAD3:)
              LADCP> EXIT
              $ MOUNT/FOREIGN DAD$MOP_UPDATE
              %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED,              mounted on _DAD3:
              $ COPY MOM$LOAD:PR0801ENG.SYS DAD$MOP_UPDATE:
              $ DISMOUNT DAD$MOP_UPDATE
              $

              On the InfoServer console terminal, you might want to
              unserve the MOP partition to avoid possible corruption
              by other clients accidentally connecting to the MOP file.
              Then set the partition type to MOP and enable downline
              loading for the InfoServer system. For example:

              InfoServer> DELETE SERVICE MOP_UPDATE FOR DK10:PR0801ENG CLASS ODS_2
              InfoServer> SET PARTITION DK10:PR0801ENG MOP
              InfoServer> SET SERVER MOP ENABLED
              InfoServer> SAVE
              %ESS-I-SAVED, Save completed successfully to DK10:
              InfoServer>


                                                                    4-13

     4.9 Making Downline Loadable Images Available to Clients

           The InfoServer system is now capable of downline loading
           any system that requests the file PR0801ENG.

     4.9.1 MOP Downline Loading by Ethernet Address

           By using the MOP service class, you can set up the
           InfoServer system to answer MOP downline load requests
           by Ethernet address as well as by file name. The general
           procedure is as follows:

           1  Create a partition containing the image you want the
              InfoServer to load (see Section 4.9).

           2  For each system that will request this image, create
              for the partition a service in the MOP service class,
              using a service name of the form MOP$nnnnnnnnnnnn,
              where nnnnnnnnnnnn is the system's hexadecimal Ethernet
              address.

           3  Perform a SAVE operation.

           As an example, if you have a VT1300 X terminal that is
           currently loading from a VAX host, you can free host
           resources by loading that terminal from an InfoServer
           system.

           Follow these steps:

           1  Determine the terminal's hardware address (for example,
              08-00-2b-2c-bd-0c)

           2  Create a MOP service and save the service.

              InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE MOP$08002B2CBD0C FOR DK10:VXTLDR0130 CLASS MOP

     4.9.2 Automatic Installation of MOP Partitions

           Some compact discs provide information that allows
           the InfoServer system to copy MOP images from the
           compact disc to partitions on a local hard disk. This
           mechanism provides two benefits. The first is improved
           performance. Because MOP files are located more quickly on
           an InfoServer-formatted read/write disk than on an initial
           system load (ISL) compact disc, downline loads are faster.

                4.9 Making Downline Loadable Images Available to Clients

              The second benefit is enhanced problem diagnosis. Because
              the InfoServer system cannot perform a DIRECTORY of
              MOP files located on an ODS-2 formatted compact disc,
              the system manager cannot determine which MOP files
              are present. Because InfoServer software automatically
              copies the MOP files to InfoServer partitions, the system
              manager can enter the InfoServer command SHOW PARTITIONS
              to display the special MOP paritions, which are flagged as
              MOP and TEMPORARY. When the compact disc is removed, the
              partitions are deleted.

        4.10 Configuring X terminals

              You can use InfoServer commands to optimize X terminal
              usage of InfoServer resources. The following example shows
              one of various ways to configure X terminals on your LAN.
              The example explains how to do the following:

              o  Install X terminal software from compact disc

              o  Ensure that the InfoServer system is configured to load
                 X terminal software

              o  Change the default disk on which X terminal partitions
                 are created

              o  Change the maximum size of partitions that X terminals
                 are allow to create remotely

              o  Enable services that assist X terminals in establishing
                 connections

           %ESS-I-SAVED, Save completed successfully to DK10:
           InfoServer>

           The commands perform the following operations:

           1  This command moves the X terminal software from the
              distribution compact disc (inserted in drive DK20) to
              the internal read/write disk, where the software is
              stored in the correct InfoServer format.

           2  This command ensures that the InfoServer system is
              configured to load the X terminals by using MOP.

           3  This command disables device DK10 for use by X
              terminals and enables devices DK80 and DK90. The
              example assumes that external read/write disks have
              been added to the InfoServer system as devices DK80 and
              DK90. and that these devices have been formatted with
              the InfoServer INITIALIZE command.

           4  This command modifies from 50,000 to 60,000 blocks
              the maximum partition size that the InfoServer system
              allows any single X terminal to create.

           5  This command enables the LAT Responder function. This
              function enables X terminals to complete LAT terminal
              server connections quickly.

           6  Finally, settings are made permanent with the SAVE
              command.

     4.11 Enforcing Network License Limits for Devices

           Information providers frequently offer licenses to
           use their compact disc databases based on a number of
           simultaneous users. The InfoServer system can assist in
           license enforcement.

           Because the InfoServer automount function allows
           unrestricted read access to a device by default, you must
           disable automount for any device that contains a service
           to which you want to limit access. If you want to restrict
           access to all the devices on the server, you can disable

     4-16

              automount for the entire server by using the command SET
              SERVER AUTOMOUNT DISABLED.

              However, if you want to restrict access to a specific
              device while permitting automount in general, you can
              disable automount for that device by using the command SET
              DEVICE AUTOMOUNT DISABLED.

              Once automount is disabled for the specific device, you
              must create a new service for the device, specifying
              a reader limit that matches your license. Remember to
              perform a SAVE operation to keep your changes.

              For example, suppose you have a compact disc labeled
              CENSUS for which you have a 5-user simultaneous network
              license. The search software runs under the DOS system,
              which uses the class name V2.0 to access InfoServer
              devices. You have decided to allocate the compact disc
              drive DK70 to this disc. To enforce the license limit,
              follow these steps:

              1  Disable automount for the DK70 drive:

                 InfoServer> SET DEVICE DK70: AUTOMOUNT DISABLED

              2  Insert the compact disc in DK70 and create a service
                 that limits access to 5 readers:

                 InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE CENSUS FOR DK70: CLASS V2.0 READERS 5

              3  Perform a SAVE operation:

                 InfoServer> SAVE

              Only five clients can now access the service CENSUS
              simultaneously.

                 o  Phillips CDD 521

              2  Set the recorder switches for recording as described in
                 the owner's manual.

              3  Verify that the recorder is ready by entering the
                 following command on the InfoServer system:

                 InfoServer> SHOW RECORDER FULL

                 If the recorder is ready, the sytem displays informa-
                 tion like the following:

                  Device Name:      DK20:

              If the display shows that the recorder is not ready,
              review the operations in the previous step.

        4.12.2 Recording Procedures

              To perform a recording operation, follow these steps:

              1  On the client system, prepare the data you want to
                 record.

              2  Log in to the InfoServer system and create on the
                 staging disk a partition large enough for the data
                 to be recorded (minimum recordable size is 5,120,000
                 bytes, or 10,000 blocks).

                 To ensure integrity of data on the staging disk,
                 specify the ERASE option when creating the partition.
                 For example, to create a 1,500,000 block partition
                 called VIR_CD on DK50, you would enter the following
                 command:

                 InfoServer> CREATE PARTITION DK50:VIR_CD BLOCKS 1500000 ERASE
                 %ESS-I-CREATED, Create partition completed successfully.

                                                                    4-19

 



     Advanced Operations
     4.12 Compact Disc Recorder (CD-R) Function

           3  Create a service for the partition, specifying the
              appropriate service class. For example:

              InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE ULTRIX_DATA FOR DK50:VIR_CD CLASS ULTRIX
              %ESS-I-CREATED, Created service ULTRIX_DATA [ULTRIX].
              %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.

           4  Mount the service and format the partition for the
              desired file system. Refer to your client's user
              documentation for instructions.

           5  Copy the data to the staging disk partition and verity
              the data.

              For native format:

              a  Copy the data using the client's native copy
                 command.

              b  Request a directory to verify data and file
                 attributes.

              For ISO 9660 or High Sierra File System (HSFS) format:

              a  Use a formatter to copy the data to the partition.
                 Typically, the formatter displays the size of the
                 data in bytes when the copy operation completes.

              b  Dismount the original service on the client and
                 optionally delete the service on the InfoServer
                 system.

              c  Create a new service for the partition, specifying
                 the ISO (or HSFS) and CONTAINER options. For
                 example:

                 InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE ISO_DATA FOR DK50:VIR_CD CLASS ISO CONTAINER
                 %ESS-I-CREATED, Created service ISO_DATA [ISO_9660].
                 %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.

                 This command creates a container file in the
                 partition. Because the container file is the virtual
                 compact disc, it must contain only the data to be
                 recorded. Do not attempt to write additional data to
                 the partition.

                 d  Mount the new service and request a directory to
                    verify data and file attributes. Note that file
                    names are displayed according to the ISO 9660
                    standard (upper case, underscores substituted for
                    spaces, and so forth).

              6  Enter a RECORD command specifying the staging disk
                 partition as the source and the recorder as the
                 destination device.

                 For example, if the data is to be recorded in native
                 format, enter a command like the following:

                 InfoServer> RECORD DK50:ULTRIX_DATA DK20: TIME 2 SPEED 2

                 By default, the data is recorded in the client's native
                 file format (in this case, ULTRIX).

                 If the data is to be recorded in ISO 9660 or HSFS
                 format, you must specify the ISO or HSFS option. (You
                 can also specify the size of the data shown by the
                 formatter's copy operation.) For example:

                 InfoServer> RECORD DK50:ISO_DATA DK20: TIME 2 SPEED 2 ISO SIZE 651405312

                 The system displays information like the following:

     4.13 Performing Network Installations and Updates

           Version 3.1 allows InfoServer managers to update an
           InfoServer system from a compact disc attached to another
           InfoServer system on the local area network (LAN). All
           update operations (FUNCTION, MOP, SYSTEM, and VXT) are
           supported using the new BIND and UNBIND commands and the
           existing UPDATE command.

     4.13.1 Connecting to a Remote Service

           You use the BIND command to connect to the specified
           ODS-2 service and create the virtual device VDK10 for
           that service. The device is used as if it were a locally
           attached compact disc drive. After a bind operation
           completes, the VDK10 device appears in the SHOW DEVICE
           display.

           You can specify an optional password to access password-
           protected services by entering a BIND commmand in the
           following format:

           BIND ODS-2-service-name [PASSWORD optional-password ]

           For example:

           InfoServer> BIND UPD_DRV PASSWORD RAINMAN
           %ESS-I-VDCREATE, Virtual device VDK10: successfully created.
           %ESS-I-VDCONN, VDK10: connected to service: UPD_DRV

           InfoServer> SHOW DEVICE VDK10:

           Device   Device      Device        Device    Dev. Size/    Volume     Device
            Name     State       Type         Address   Record Num.    Label      Char

           VDK10:   On          Virtual Disk    N/A          962     UPD_DRV       RO

     4.13.2 Performing Updates Using a Remote Service

           Once you have connected to a service, you can enter any
           UPDATE command, specifying VDK10 as the source device. The
           device must be specified as the source device because
           it is read-only. In the following example, the VDK10
           device is connected to a service containing an InfoServer
           function access compact disc:

           InfoServer> UPDATE FUNCTION VDK10: DK20:
           %ESS-I-UPDATE, Update operation completed successfully.

                       4.13 Performing Network Installations and Updates

        4.13.3 Disconnecting from a Remote Service

              After the update operation completes, you can use the
              UNBIND command to delete the virtual device and terminate
              the connection to the remote service. When the unbind
              operation completes, the virtual device VDK10 no longer
              appears in the SHOW DEVICE display.

              You can use the same remote service to perform multiple
              updates on an InfoServer system (for example, you might
              use the service UPD_DRV to update VXT software and then
              install new functions). However, you must enter the UNBIND
              command after each update operation to flush data that has
              been cached from the previous one. You then enter the BIND
              command to reconnect to the UPD_DRV service before you
              perform the next update.

              Syntax for the UNBIND command is as follows:

              UNBIND [VDK10:]

              For example:

              InfoServer> UNBIND
              %ESS-I-VDDELETE, Virtual device VDK10: deleted.

        4.13.4 Restrictions

              The following restrictions apply for network updates:

              o  Services intended for remote InfoServer systems must be
                 created in the ODS_2 service class. When automounted,
                 InfoServer and VXT software compact discs appear as
                 ODS-2 services with the disc's volume label as the
                 service name. For a Function Access compact disc, you
                 must create a service in the ODS_2 service class.

              o  Only one VDK device can be in use at any time.

              o  The VDK device is a read-only device.

              o  If a service becomes unavailable, the InfoServer system
                 does not attempt to reconnect. You must enter an UNBIND
                 command to terminate the connection and then enter
                 a BIND command to reconnect when the service again
                 becomes available.

                                                                    4-23

              This chapter describes some common problems that might
              occur when using the InfoServer system. Each section
              describes possible causes of the problem and lists the
              corrective steps to take. You might also want to reference
              the host client's documentation set for information on
              accessing the InfoServer system.

              For more information on troubleshooting the installation
              of an InfoServer system, refer to the installation and
              owner's guide for your system.

        5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

              If a client system cannot connect to an InfoServer
              virtual device, the InfoServer or client system might be
              configured incorrectly. In that case, an operating system
              error appears when you use the proper client commands to
              connect to the device. This section describes some of the
              possible problems and the corrective steps to take if you
              observe this symptom.

              Possible Problem:
              The compact disc to which you are trying to connect has
              been removed from the InfoServer drive.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether the compact disc has been removed
                 from the InfoServer drive. Log in to either the local
                 or remote LAT terminal server management console, and
                 then enter the SHOW DEVICE command. The Volume Label
                 column lists volume labels for all available compact
                 discs. If the volume label of the compact disc to which
                 you are trying to connect is not listed, the disc has
                 probably been removed from the InfoServer drive.

                                                                     5-1

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

           2  If the compact disc has been removed, reinsert it into
              a free InfoServer drive. Then enter the SHOW DEVICE
              command again and check to see if the volume label of
              the compact disc is listed.

           3  When the volume label appears, you should be able to
              connect to the compact disc from your client system.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system, client system, or both are
           physically disconnected from the local area network (LAN);
           or, they are attached to different networks.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the client and server are on the
              same LAN. From the client system, enter the command to
              invoke the MOP LOOP function. For example, on an MS-DOS
              system with the DECnet software installed:

              A:\> NCP LOOP CIRCUIT PHYSICAL-ADDRESS 08-00-2B-15-00-9F
              LOOP CIRCUIT test started at 15-May-1993 11:49:17
              Sending loop message  1, 46.
              Message echoed by remote circuit loopback  1, 46 bytes.

              LOOP CIRCUIT test finished successfully at 15-May-1993 11:50:00
              A:\>

           2  If the MOP LOOP function fails, the client and
              InfoServer systems are unable to communicate. One or
              both systems are probably not attached corretly to the
              same LAN.

           3  Some client systems can also provide the ability to
              list servers on the LAN. For example, on an OpenVMS
              system you can enter the following command:

              $ MCR ESS$LASTCP
              %LASTCP-I-VERSION, LASTDRIVER X1.5 is running
              LASTCP> SHOW SERVERS
               Node                 Node            Physical       Active      Start
               Name                  Id             Address         Links      Time

              LAZARUS          08002B157FA6-97A0  AA-00-04-00-A0-0C     0        -

              If the InfoServer system to which you are trying to
              connect is not listed, the client system and InfoServer
              system are probably not connected to the same LAN.

                                                         Troubleshooting
                   5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

              4  If this is the problem, connect the client and
                 InfoServer system to the same LAN. Inspect the Ethernet
                 connections for both systems to make sure the systems
                 are properly connected.

              Possible Problem:
              There is a filtering device between your InfoServer
              system and client system that does not allow the LASTport
              protocol or multicast address through.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  The steps to correct this problem depend on the
                 filtering device that is between the client and the
                 InfoServer system. For example, the filtering device
                 might be an Ethernet bridge.

              2  Enter the appropriate management commands to the
                 filtering device to determine whether the LASTport
                 protocol type is being filtered. The protocol type 80-
                 41 must be allowed across the device for clients and
                 InfoServer systems to communicate.

              3  Enter the appropriate management commands to the
                 filtering device to determine whether the LASTport
                 multicast address is being filtered. The multicast
                 address must be allowed across the filtering device
                 for clients and InfoServer systems to communicate.
                 The address is 09-00-2B-04-nn-nn, where nn-nn is the
                 hexadecimal value of the LASTport group that has been
                 set for the server).

              4  If either the protocol type or multicast address
                 are being filtered, enter the appropriate management
                 commands to the filtering device to allow the LASTport
                 protocol type and multicast address to pass unfiltered.
                 This action should allow client systems to connect to
                 the InfoServer system.

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer system has run out of local memory
              resources to complete new connections to devices.



                                                                     5-3

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the InfoServer system has run out
              of memory. Log in to either the local or remote LAT
              terminal server management console, and then enter
              the SHOW SERVER command. If the % of Pool Free value
              is below 5 percent, the server might not have enough
              memory to establish new connections.

           2  If the server does not have enough memory, the
              corrective action depends on how the InfoServer system
              is using memory. If the InfoServer system is offering
              many unused services to the LAN, you might have to
              delete some services.

           3  If the server is performing many concurrent downline
              loads, it might not be able to accept new connections.
              You can disable the maintenance operation protocol
              (MOP) downline load function with the command SET
              SERVER MOP DISABLED.

           4  The LAT Responder function might be enabled in a large
              network. You can disable this function.

           Possible Problem:
           The requested service name for the virtual device has not
           been served on the InfoServer system.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Enter the SHOW SERVER command to verify that the server
              state is on. If the state is not on, enter the command
              SET SERVER STATE ON followed by the SAVE command.

           2  Determine whether the InfoServer system is serving the
              requested service name. Connect to either the local
              or remote management console, and then enter the SHOW
              SERVICE * command. If the service name being requested
              is not listed, the InfoServer system is not offering
              the requested service.

           3  If the InfoServer system is not offering the requested
              service, enter the InfoServer CREATE SERVICE command
              to make the device or partition to which you want
              to connect available under the proper service name.
              See the description of the SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP
              command in Chapter 3.

                                                         Troubleshooting
                   5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

              4  You might want to save the created service with the
                 SAVE command, so the service is always available
                 whenever the InfoServer system reboots.

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer system and client system belong to
              different LASTport groups.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether the InfoServer system and client
                 system belong to different LASTport groups. Connect
                 to either the local or remote management console,
                 and then enter the SHOW SERVER command. Check the
                 Current LASTport Group field for the group to which
                 the InfoServer system belongs.

              2  Enter the appropriate command on the client system to
                 determine the group to which the client system belongs.
                 For example, on OpenVMS systems:

                 $ MCR ESS$LASTCP
                 LASTCP> SHOW STATUS
                 Status of LASTDRIVER X1.5 on node SAUL at 15-May-1993 12:16:41
                 Protocol version 3.1, Uptime: 5 04:09:48.03, Checksum Off,
                 Slow mode Off

                  25306 Bytes pool
                      8 Ethernet buffers
                      0 I/O request packets
                      0 Association control blocks
                      0 Local session control blocks
                      0 LSC In-Use blocks
                      0 Transaction control blocks
                      2 Circuit status blocks
                     44 Node data blocks
                      5 Transmit quota
                     80 Maximum circuits
                      0 LAN group code
                      0 Server circuit timeout

                 In this example, the LAN group code field lists the
                 group of the client system as 0.


                                                                     5-5

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

           3  Enter the appropriate InfoServer or client system
              command to put both systems into the same LASTport
              Group. See the SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP command in
              Chapter 3.

           Possible Problem:
           The requested service name is protected by a password
           on the InfoServer system, and the client system has not
           supplied the correct password.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the InfoServer service has a
              password. Connect to either the local or remote
              management console, and then enter the SHOW SERVICE
              service_name command, where service_name is the name of
              the service to which you are trying to connect. Check
              the Password field to see if password protection is
              enabled or disabled.

           2  If the service has password protection, then either
              disable the password by using the SET SERVER command
              (Chapter 3) or specify the correct password on the
              client system. Try to make the connection again.

           Possible Problem:
           There is a read/write conflict in accessing the requested
           virtual disk. If there is a write-access session to a
           virtual disk, the InfoServer system does not allow new
           read sessions and read/write sessions.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether there is read/write conflict
              accessing the virtual disk. Connect to either the
              local or remote management console, and then enter
              the SHOW DEVICE DKn: command, where DKn: is the device
              to which you are trying to connect. This display lists
              all services offered for that device.

           2  For each service name being offered for the device,
              enter the SHOW SERVICE service_name FULL command.
              This display lists the number of readers and writers
              connected to each system. See Section 2.10 for the
              different read/write policies used by the InfoServer
              system.

                                                         Troubleshooting
                   5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

              3  If there is a read/write conflict to the service, you
                 can do one of the following:

                 o  Wait until the conflicting connection is discon-
                    nected by the other client system.

                 o  Delete write access to the conflicting service from
                    the InfoServer management console.

                 o  Delete the conflicting service from the InfoServer
                    system.

                 Then try to connect to the InfoServer service again.

              Possible Problem:
              The service name for the virtual device that you are
              trying to access is in the wrong or different namespace.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine the service class under which the service
                 you are requesting is being offered. Connect to either
                 the local or remote management console, and then enter
                 the SHOW SERVICE service_name command. The variable
                 service_name is the name of the service to which you
                 are trying to connect. The display lists the service
                 class in brackets ( [] ) after the service name.

              2  If the service is not offered under the service class
                 for the client system from which you are trying to
                 connect, create the same service name under the
                 appropriate namespace. See the SET SERVER LASTPORT
                 GROUP command in Chapter 3.

              Possible Problem:
              The service name being requested by the client is
              offered on more than one InfoServer system. The client is
              selecting a service name different from the one intended,
              and the other InfoServer system is not set up correctly to
              allow client access.





                                                                     5-7

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.1 Client System Cannot Connect to InfoServer Device

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the service is offered by more than
              one InfoServer system. Connect to either the local or
              remote management console, and then enter the MONITOR
              SHOW ETHERNET command. Watch the Messages transmitted
              field under the LASTport counters section, while trying
              to connect from the client system again. If this
              counter does not increment during the client access
              attempt, another InfoServer system might be replying to
              the request.

           2  If another InfoServer system offers the same service
              name, use the InfoServer CREATE SERVICE command to
              create a unique service name for the virtual disk or
              partition to which you are trying to connect. Then try
              to connect from the client system again, using the new
              service name.

           Possible Problem:
           Disk functions (InfoServer VXT only) or tape functions are
           not enabled.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Insert the appropriate Function compact disc in an
              available drive.

           2  Enter the InfoServer command UPDATE FUNCTIONS.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system has encountered an internal software
           logic or hardware error, preventing access to its devices.

           1  If none of the other corrective actions solve this
              problem, there might be a software logic or SCSI
              hardware problem.

           2  If you have access to the InfoServer hardware unit,
              examine the eight diagnostic light-emitting diodes
              (LEDs) on the back of the InfoServer 100 or 150 unit.
              If the software is running properly, these LEDs should
              turn on in a rotating pattern from right to left.
              If the LEDs do not display the rotating pattern, the
              system is hung. (On the InfoServer 1000 unit, examine

                 To clear the condition, turn the InfoServer system off
                 and on, and then reboot the software.

              3  If you cannot recover from the problem, reboot the
                 InfoServer system. Then try to make the connection
                 again.

              4  If you still cannot access the device, enter console
                 mode, as described in the installation and owner's
                 guide for your system and enter the following command

        5.2 Access to InfoServer Devices Seems Slow

              Under normal operating conditions, access times for
              a virtual device on the InfoServer system should be
              comparable to access times for a locally attached device.
              In many cases, access to a compact disc on the InfoServer
              system can appear substantially faster than access to a
              locally attached compact disc, because of the server's
              caching policies. If access to virtual devices on the
              InfoServer system appears unusually slow, a problem might
              exist in your LAN.

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer system is experiencing "system buffer
              unavailable" errors. If the LAN load imposed on the system
              is too great, the client systems and InfoServer system
              intentionally decrease their LAN message rates to try to
              resolve the LAN's network-load problem.




                                                                     5-9

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.2 Access to InfoServer Devices Seems Slow

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the InfoServer system is experiencing
              "system buffer unavailable" errors. Connect to either
              the local or remote management console, and then enter
              the SHOW ETHERNET command.

              Check the System Buffer Unavailable counter for
              a nonzero value. If this counter is not 0 or is
              incrementing, the LAN load might be too high for the
              InfoServer system.

           2  If the System Buffer Unavailable counter is increment-
              ing, and you are not performing downline loading from
              the InfoServer system, you might want to enter the
              SET SERVER MOP DISABLED command. If MOP is enabled,
              a multicast address is enabled that causes the system
              to receive messages from the DECnet network that are
              not intended for the InfoServer system. This event is
              shown by the Unrecognized Destination field of the SHOW
              ETHERNET display.

              Disabling MOP disables this multicast filter on the
              InfoServer system and reduces the number of unintended
              messages received by the system. This action might
              correct the "system buffer unavailable" problem and
              speed up access to InfoServer devices.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system has just rebooted or has had the
           physical media removed and reinserted. In these cases, the
           client system might take several seconds to discover the
           broken connection and reestablish the connection to the
           InfoServer system.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the Server has recently rebooted.
              Enter the SHOW SERVER command, and inspect the Uptime
              field. The uptime indicates how much time has elapsed
              since the last reboot.

           2  If the server has recently rebooted or the media has
              been removed and reinserted, you do not have to perform
              any corrective action After the client reconnects to
              the InfoServer system, the access-delay problem should
              disappear.

        5.3 Cannot Enter InfoServer Commands from a Local Console

              The InfoServer management interface is always available
              from a local terminal connected to a running InfoServer
              system. This section describes some possible problems and
              corrective steps if you are unable to enter InfoServer
              commands from a locally attached terminal.

              Possible Problem:
              The local terminal is not connected to the communication
              serial port on the InfoServer 1000 system or is connected
              to the wrong serial port on the InfoServer 100 or 150
              system.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Make sure that the terminal is connected to the serial
                 port on the InfoServer 1000 unit or to serial port MMJ
                 1 on the back of the InfoServer 100 or 150 unit.

              2  If the terminal is not connected or is connected to the
                 wrong serial port, connect the terminal correctly.

              Possible Problem:
              The local terminal is not set up correctly to communicate
              with the InfoServer system.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Check the attached terminal, and make sure that it is
                 set for:

                 o  9600 baud

                 o  8 bits, no parity

                 o  XON/XOFF flow control

              2  If the terminal settings are incorrect, fix them. Then
                 try entering your InfoServer commands again.

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer system had an internal software logic
              error, preventing access from the terminal console line.

                                                                    5-11

           Corrective Steps:

           1  If none of the other corrective actions solve this
              problem, you might have a software logic problem.

           2  If you have access to the InfoServer hardware unit,
              examine the eight diagnostic LEDs on the back of the
              InfoServer 100 or 150 unit. If the software is running
              properly, these LEDs should turn on in a rotating
              pattern from right to left. If the LEDs do not display
              the rotating pattern, the system is hung. (On the
              InfoServer 1000 unit, examine the System OK LED on
              the front of the unit. This LED flashes if the system
              is running properly.)

              Turn the InfoServer system off and on to clear the
              condition, and then reboot the software.

           3  If you cannot recover from the problem, reboot the
              InfoServer system. Then try entering your InfoServer
              commands again.

           4  Please submit a Software Performance Report (SPR),
              describing in as much detail as possible the problem
              you experienced, the corrective actions you attempted,
              and the results. Also provide known information about
              the attached terminal and its setup.

     5.4 Cannot Enter InfoServer Commands from a Remote Console

           The InfoServer system uses the LAT protocol to allow
           remote terminal access to the InfoServer command set.
           This remote access is always available when the InfoServer
           system is running. This section describes the possible
           problems and corrective steps to take if you are unable
           to enter InfoServer commands from a remote LAT terminal
           server terminal.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system, terminal server, or both are
           physically disconnected from the LAN; or, they are
           attached to different networks.

              5.4 Cannot Enter InfoServer Commands from a Remote Console

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether the InfoServer system and terminal
                 server are on the same LAN. From the terminal server,
                 enter the command to invoke the MOP LOOP function. For
                 example, on a DECserver 200:

                 Local> TEST LOOP 08-00-2B-15-00-9F

              2  If the MOP LOOP function fails, the terminal server
                 and InfoServer system cannot communicate. One or both
                 systems are probably not attached to the same LAN
                 correctly.

              3  If this is the problem, connect the terminal server
                 and the InfoServer system to the same LAN. Inspect the
                 Ethernet connections for both systems.

              Possible Problem:
              There is a filtering device between your InfoServer
              system and the terminal server that does not allow the
              LAT protocol or multicast address through.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  The steps to correct this problem depend on the
                 filtering device between the terminal server and the
                 InfoServer system. For example, the filtering device
                 might be an Ethernet bridge.

              2  Enter the appropriate management commands to the
                 filtering device to determine whether the LAT protocol
                 type is being filtered. The protocol type 60-04 must
                 be allowed across the device for terminal servers and
                 InfoServer systems to communicate.

              3  Enter the appropriate management commands to the
                 filtering device to determine whether the LAT terminal
                 server multicast address is being filtered. The
                 multicast address 09-00-2B-00-00-0F must be allowed
                 across the filtering device for the clients and
                 InfoServer systems to communicate.

              4  If either the protocol type or multicast address are
                 being filtered, enter the appropriate management
                 commands to the filtering device to allow the LAT
                 protocol type and multicast address to pass unfiltered.

                                                                    5-13

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.4 Cannot Enter InfoServer Commands from a Remote Console

              This should allow the terminal server to connect to the
              InfoServer system.

           Possible Problem:
           The password for the InfoServer system to which you are
           trying to connect has been changed.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  If the InfoServer system has password protection
              enabled, the terminal server prompts you for a password
              to connect to the system. If the system does not accept
              the password you enter, the InfoServer password might
              have been changed.

           2  If you are unable to determine the new InfoServer
              password, you can reset the InfoServer password to
              a known password by following the steps in Section 5.9.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system has run out of local memory
           resources to complete new connections to the management
           interface.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the system has run out of memory.
              Connect to the local console and enter the SHOW SERVER
              command. If the percentage displayed in the % of Pool
              Free field falls below 5 percent, the server might not
              have enough memory to establish new LAT terminal server
              connections.

           2  If the server does not have enough memory, the
              corrective action depends on how the InfoServer system
              is using memory.

              o  If the system is offering many unused services
                 to the LAN, then you might have to delete some
                 services.

              o  If the server is performing many concurrent
                 downline loads, it might not be able to accept
                 new connections. You can disable the MOP downline
                 load function by using the SET SERVER MOP DISABLED
                 command.

              5.4 Cannot Enter InfoServer Commands from a Remote Console

                 o  If there are more than 100 connections to virtual
                    devices, the capacity of the InfoServer system might
                    be exceeded. The Current Sessions field of the SHOW
                    SERVER command lists the number of connections.

                    If this is the problem, you must distribute your LAN
                    connections among other available InfoServer systems
                    on the LAN. One way to do this is to put different
                    InfoServer systems and clients into different
                    LASTport groups. See the SET SERVER LASTPORT GROUP
                    command (Chapter 3) and the appropriate client
                    system documentation for the client syntax for
                    changing LASTport groups.

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer system and terminal server do not share a
              common group code.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether the InfoServer system and terminal
                 server share common group codes. Connect to either
                 the local or remote management console, and then
                 enter the SHOW LAT COUNTERS command. The Enabled Group
                 Codes field lists the LAT group codes offered by the
                 InfoServer system.

              2  Enter the appropriate command on the terminal server
                 to determine the group codes to which your console has
                 access. For example, on a DECserver 200:

                 Local> SHOW PORT

                 Port 5:                                Server: LAT_08002B13EDAF

           Possible Problem:
           The terminal server being used does not offer access to
           password-protected LAT terminal server services.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  If the terminal server issues an Invalid Password error
              message without first prompting you for a password,
              the terminal server might not support connections to
              password-protected services.

           2  Check your terminal server documentation to determine
              whether connections to password-protected services are
              allowed.

           3  If connections to password-protected services are not
              supported, you cannot use that type of terminal server
              to connect to the remote console. The service to the
              InfoServer remote management console is always password
              protected. Try using another type of terminal server to
              make the connection.

           Possible Problem:
           There is more than one InfoServer system with the same
           server name on the extended LAN. You are connecting to the
           incorrect InfoServer system, which does not accept your
           password.

              5.4 Cannot Enter InfoServer Commands from a Remote Console

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether there is more than one InfoServer
                 system with the same server name on the extended
                 LAN. Most terminal servers keep a count of duplicate
                 names detected on the LAN. For example, you can enter
                 the following command on a DECserver 200 to check an
                 InfoServer system named LIBRARY_IS:

                 Local> SHOW NODE LIBRARY_IS COUNTERS

                 Node: LIBRARY_IS

                 Seconds Since Zeroed:     451828     Multiple Node Addresses:      253

                 Bytes Transmitted:           208     Solicitations Rejected:         0

                 If the Multiple Node Addresses field is not 0, there is
                 more than one InfoServer system with the name LIBRARY_
                 IS.

              2  If there is more than one system with the same name,
                 connect a local terminal to one of the InfoServer
                 systems and change its name to a unique name. See the
                 SET SERVER NAME command (Chapter 3).

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer system had an internal software logic
              error, preventing access to its remote management
              interface.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  If none of the other corrective actions solve this
                 problem, you might have a software logic problem.

              2  If you have access to the InfoServer hardware unit,
                 examine the eight diagnostic LEDs on the back of the
                 InfoServer 100 or 150 unit. If the software is running
                 properly, these LEDs should turn on in a rotating
                 pattern from right to left. If the LEDs do not display
                 the rotating pattern, the system is hung. (On the
                 InfoServer 1000 unit, examine the System OK LED on

                                                                    5-17

              is running properly.)

              To clear the condition, turn the InfoServer system off
              and on. Then reboot the software.

           3  If you cannot recover from the problem, reboot the
              InfoServer system. Then try entering your InfoServer
              commands again.

           4  Please submit a Software Performance Report (SPR),
              describing in as much detail as possible the problem
              you experienced, the corrective actions you attempted,
              and the results. Also provide any known information
              about the remote terminal server and its setup.

     5.5 InfoServer Software Does Not Boot

           Normally the InfoServer system boots from its internal
           read/write device. Booting from the internal device rather
           than from a compact disc allows you to use any compact
           discs in any InfoServer drive.

           If the internal device becomes corrupted or the default
           boot configuration is altered, the InfoServer system might
           not boot correctly. This section describes how to recover
           when the InfoServer software does not boot.

           Possible Problem:
           The boot flags saved for the InfoServer system have been
           altered.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Enter console mode, as described in the installation
              and owner's guide for your system.

           2  At the console prompt (>>>), enter the following
              command:

              >>> SHOW BOOT

              On InfoServer 100 and 150 systems, the BOOT parameter
              must be set to DKA200,DKA100. If the SHOW BOOT command
              displays a different setting, enter the following
              command:

              >>> SET BOOT DKA200,DKA100

                                   5.5 InfoServer Software Does Not Boot

                 On InfoServer 1000 systems, the BOOT parameter must
                 be set to FLASH. If the SHOW BOOT command displays a
                 different setting, enter the following command:

                 >>> SET BOOT FLASH

              3  Enter the following command:

                 >>> SHOW BFLG

                 The BFLG parameter must be set to the hexadecimal value
                 D0000000. If the SHOW BFLG command displays a different
                 setting, enter the following command:

                 >>> SET BFLG D0000000

              4  Enter the following command:

                 >>> SHOW HALT

                 The HALT parameter must be set to 2. If the SHOW
                 HALT command displays a different setting, enter the
                 following command:

                 >>> SET HALT 2

              5  When all booting parameters are set correctly, try to
                 boot the InfoServer software:

                 >>> B

              Possible Problem:
              The system software is corrupted on the internal read
              /write disk
              (InfoServer 100 and 150 only). This problem could be
              caused by clients on the LAN accessing the device
              accidentally, or by a device failure.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Boot the software from the InfoServer compact disc
                 instead of from the internal read/write device. Insert
                 the compact disc supplied with the InfoServer unit into
                 a compact disc drive. Enter the REBOOT command or turn
                 the unit off and on to reboot the unit.

              2  After booting from the compact disc, enter the
                 following InfoServer command:

                 InfoServer> SHOW PARTITION DK10:

                                                                    5-19

     5.5 InfoServer Software Does Not Boot

           3  If the SHOW PARTITION command succeeds, but the special
              partition named BOOT_PARTITION does not appear, only
              the system software has been lost. To recover, enter
              the following InfoServer command:

              InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DK20: DK10:

           4  If an error occurs on the SHOW PARTITION command, the
              format of the internal disk has been lost. In this
              case, you must initialize the disk before the system
              software is copied, as in the following example:

              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
              InfoServer> INITIALIZE DK10:
              InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DK20: DK10:
              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE ON

           Possible Problem:
           An unsupported device is preventing the software from
           completing device initialization.

           Corrective Step

           Remove any unsupported devices.

           Possible Problem:
           A hardware failure occurred on the InfoServer system.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  If none of the other corrective steps in this section
              solve the problem, then your InfoServer system might
              have a hardware failure.

           2  Call your Digital service representative for assistance
              in repairing or replacing the InfoServer unit.

     5.6 Online Help No Longer Available

           If the internal read/write device is partially corrupted,
           online help might no longer be available. To reinstall
           online help, follow these steps:

           1  Connect to either the local or remote management

              2  Insert the compact disc supplied with the InfoServer
                 unit into a compact disc drive, for example, DK20. If
                 a disc is already installed in the drive, remove that
                 disc and reinstall it at the end of this procedure.

              3  If the InfoServer compact disc is in DK20, enter the
                 following command to update the system software on
                 InfoServer 100 or 150 systems:

                 InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DK20: DK10:

                 For InfoServer 1000 systems, enter the following
                 command:

                 InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DK20: FLASH

              4  If you removed another compact disc to insert the
                 InfoServer compact disc, reinstall that disc now.

        5.7 InfoServer System Does Not Boot Completely

              If the InfoServer system starts to boot but does not
              display the Password: prompt, the internal read/write
              device might be corrupted. This section lists the steps
              you can take to correct this problem.

              Possible Problem:
              The configuration partition used to store InfoServer pa-
              rameters, services, and other operational characteristics
              on the internal InfoServer 100 or 150 read/write disk
              might be corrupted.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Connect a local terminal to serial port MMJ 1 on the
                 rear of the InfoServer unit. Make sure the terminal
                 is set to 9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity. You must use a
                 local terminal; remote LAT terminal server terminals do
                 not work with this procedure.

              2  Press the halt switch on the rear of the InfoServer
                 unit. The console prompt (>>>) should appear.

              3  At the prompt, enter the following command:

                 >>> B/D0000001

                                                                    5-21

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.7 InfoServer System Does Not Boot Completely

              This command causes the InfoServer software to boot
              without reading the configuration database from the
              read/write disk. Therefore, all system defaults are in
              effect for this boot.

           4  At the Enter Password: prompt, enter the default
              password ESS.

           5  Reenter the characteristics that you want to save for
              the InfoServer system, then enter the SAVE command.
              This should correct the corruption of the configuration
              partition.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer operational software section of the
           internal read/write disk on an InfoServer 100 or 150
           system disk might be partially corrupted.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Boot the software from the InfoServer compact disc
              instead of from the read/write disk. Insert the compact
              disc supplied with the InfoServer unit into the compact
              disc drive on the right side of the InfoServer unit's
              front panel. Turn the InfoServer system off and on to
              reboot the unit.

           2  After booting from the compact disc, enter the
              following InfoServer command:

              InfoServer> SHOW PARTITION DK10:

           3  If the SHOW PARTITION command succeeds, but the special
              partition named BOOT_PARTITION does not appear, only
              the system software has been lost. To recover, enter
              the following InfoServer command:

              InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DK20: DK10:

           4  If an error occurs on the SHOW PARTITION command, the
              format of the disk has been lost. In this case, you
              must initialize the disk before the system software is
              copied, as in the following example:

              InfoServer> SET SERVER STATE OFF
              InfoServer> INITIALIZE DK10:
              InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DK20: DK10:

              The InfoServer operational software section of FLASH ROM
              on an
              InfoServer 1000 might be partially corrupted.

              Corrective Steps:

              You must have a compact disc drive available, either
              locally attached or accessible on a system that can MOP
              downline load your unit.

              If you have a locally attached drive, insert the
              InfoServer compact disc into the drive and enter a command
              in the following format, where n is the number of the
              drive holding the disc:

              InfoServer> UPDATE SYSTEM DKn: FLASH

              If the compact drive is located on a remote system, you
              can MOP downline load the system software as described in
              Chapter 4.

              Possible Problem:
              A hardware failure occurred on the InfoServer system.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  If none of the other corrective steps in this section

        5.8 InfoServer System Does Not Downline Load Clients

              The InfoServer system can automatically downline load
              client systems that request a specific load image by file
              name or Ethernet address. If the InfoServer manager has
              created the proper MOP partition on the InfoServer system,
              downline loading should work. This section describes the
              possible problems and corrective steps to take if you
              are unable to downline load a system from an InfoServer
              system.

                                                                    5-23

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.8 InfoServer System Does Not Downline Load Clients

           Possible Problem:
           The MOP downline loading feature is disabled on the
           InfoServer system.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether MOP downline loading is disabled on
              the InfoServer system. Connect to either the local or
              remote management console, and then enter the SHOW MOP
              command. If downline loading is disabled, asterisks
              (*)  appear at the bottom of the display.

           2  If MOP downline loading is disabled, enter the SET
              SERVER MOP ENABLED command to reenable downline
              loading.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system, the system requesting a downline
           load, or both are physically disconnected from the LAN;
           or, they are attached to different networks.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the InfoServer system and the client
              system requesting a downline load are on the same
              LAN. Most client systems cannot perform a MOP LOOP
              test before they are downline loaded. You must to
              monitor the InfoServer counters to determine whether
              the InfoServer system and client system are connected.

           2  Connect to either the local or remote management
              console. Then enter the following commands:

              InfoServer> ZERO MOP
              InfoServer> MONITOR SHOW MOP

              Try to downline load from the remote system again.
              If the remote system still fails to load and none of
              the MOP counters in the SHOW MOP display increment,
              the InfoServer system and remote system requesting a
              downline load are probably not connected to the same
              LAN.

           3  If this is the problem, connect the requesting system
              and InfoServer system to the same LAN. Inspect the
              Ethernet connections for both systems.

                    5.8 InfoServer System Does Not Downline Load Clients

              Possible Problem:
              There is a filtering device between your InfoServer system
              and client system that does not allow the LAT protocol or
              multicast address through.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  The steps to correct this problem depend on the
                 filtering device between the client and the InfoServer
                 system. For example, the filtering device might be an
                 Ethernet bridge.

              2  Enter the appropriate management commands to the
                 filtering device to determine whether the MOP-loading
                 protocol type is being filtered. The protocol type 60-
                 01 must be allowed across the device for requesting
                 systems and InfoServer system to communicate.

              3  Enter the appropriate management commands to the
                 filtering device to determine whether the MOP-loading
                 multicast address is being filtered. The multicast
                 address AB-00-00-02-00-00 must be allowed across
                 the filtering device for the requesting system and
                 InfoServer system to communicate.

              4  If either the protocol type or multicast address are
                 being filtered, enter the appropriate management
                 commands to the filtering device to allow the MOP-
                 loading protocol type and multicast address to pass
                 unfiltered. This should allow the requesting system to
                 downline load from the InfoServer system.

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer system has run out of local memory
              resources to complete new downline load requests.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether the InfoServer system has run out
                 of memory. Connect to either the local or remote
                 management console, and then enter the SHOW SERVER
                 command. If the percentage displayed in the % of Pool
                 Free field falls below 5 percent, the server might
                 not have enough memory to handle new downline load
                 requests.

                                                                    5-25

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.8 InfoServer System Does Not Downline Load Clients

           2  If the server does not have enough memory, the
              corrective action depends on how the InfoServer system
              is using memory.

              o  If the InfoServer system is offering many unused
                 services to the LAN, then you might have to delete
                 some services.

              o  If there are more than 100 connections to virtual
                 devices, the capacity of the InfoServer system might
                 be exceeded. The Current Sessions field of the SHOW
                 SERVER command lists the number of connections.

                 If this is the problem, you need to distribute your
                 LAN connections among other available InfoServer
                 systems on the LAN. One way to do this is to
                 put different InfoServer systems and clients
                 into different LASTport groups. See the SET
                 SERVER LASTPORT GROUP command (Chapter 3) and the
                 appropriate client system documentation for the
                 client syntax for changing LASTport groups.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system is currently processing the maximum
           number of downline load requests that it can handle.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the maximum number of downline load
              requests has been exceeded. Connect to either the local
              or remote management console, and then enter the SHOW
              MOP command. If the Load failed, server limit counter
              is not 0, the InfoServer system was handling its limit
              of downline load requests at some point.

           2  Wait until the InfoServer system completes some of the
              current downline loads and the Loads in progress count
              gets smaller. Then try the downline load operation from
              the requesting system again.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system does not contain the downline
           loadable image requested.

                                                         Troubleshooting
                    5.8 InfoServer System Does Not Downline Load Clients

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether the InfoServer system has the
                 requested downline loadable image installed. Connect to
                 either the local or remote management console, and then
                 enter the SHOW MOP command. If the Load error, file
                 not found counter increments each time the requesting
                 system attempts a downline load, the InfoServer system
                 does not have the image requested.

              2  See Section 4.9 for information on installing MOP
                 downline loadable images.

              3  Use the appropriate commands to install the desired
                 downline loadable image. Then try the downline load
                 operation again.

              Possible Problem:
              The InfoServer partition that contains the requested
              downline loadable image is not set up as a MOP partition.

              Corrective Steps:

              1  Determine whether the InfoServer partition is a MOP
                 partition. Connect to either the local or remote
                 management console, and then enter the SHOW MOP
                 command. Check if the Load failed, partition type count
                 is a value other than 0. If this counter increments
                 each time the remote system tries to downline load,
                 the partition containing the load image is not set up
                 properly.

              2  Enter the SHOW PARTITION DKn:image_name command.
                 DKn: is the device holding the image partition, and
                 image_name is the name of the requested image. If the
                 partition is listed without a MOP flag after the size
                 field, the image is not set up to be downline loaded.

              3  Use the SET PARTITION command to enable the partition
                 to be downline loaded.

              Possible Problem:
              The downline loadable image in the requested MOP partition
              was not copied to the server correctly, so the image has
              an invalid or unrecognized format. Or the image is too
              large to downline load in the requested manner.

                                                                    5-27

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.8 InfoServer System Does Not Downline Load Clients

           Corrective Steps:

           1  Determine whether the InfoServer system has a bad load
              image that it cannot load. Connect to either the local
              or remote management console, and then enter the SHOW
              MOP command. Check the following error counters for
              values other than 0:

              o  Load failed, not contiguous

              o  Load failed, read error

              o  Load failed, protocol error

              o  Load failed, file too big

              o  Load failed, bad file type

              If any of these counters increment each time the remote
              system tries to downline load, the load image is not
              installed correctly on the InfoServer system.

           2  See Section 4.9 for information on installing MOP
              downline loadable images.

           3  Use the appropriate command or commands to install the
              desired downline loadable image, then try the downline
              load operation again.

           Possible Problem:
           The InfoServer system has an internal software logic error
           that is preventing access to its devices or preventing the
           server from responding to the load request.

           Corrective Steps:

           1  If none of the other possible problems and solutions
              solve your problem, you might have a software logic
              problem.

           2  If you have access to the InfoServer hardware unit,
              examine the eight diagnostic LEDs on the back of the
              InfoServer 100 or 150 unit. If the software is running
              properly, these LEDs should turn on in a rotating
              pattern from right to left. If the LEDs do not display
              the rotating pattern, the system is hung. (On the
              InfoServer 1000 unit, examine the System OK LED on
              the front of the unit. This LED flashes if the system
              is running properly.)

                    5.8 InfoServer System Does Not Downline Load Clients

                 To clear the condition, turn the InfoServer system off
                 and on. Then reboot the software.

              3  If you cannot recover from the problem, reboot the
                 InfoServer system. Then try the operation again.

              4  Please submit a Software Performance Report (SPR),
                 describing in as much detail as possible the problem
                 you experienced, the corrective actions you attempted,
                 and the results. Also provide any known information
                 about the requesting system and its setup.

        5.9 InfoServer Password Forgotten

              The InfoServer system has the default password ESS,
              which you can change by entering the SET SERVER PASSWORD
              command. You must enter the correct password before you
              can start an InfoServer management session, either locally
              or remotely. If you forget your InfoServer password,
              you can reset the InfoServer system to its default
              configuration and password. Follow these steps:

              1  Connect a local terminal to the MMJ 1 serial port on
                 the rear of the InfoServer 100 or 150 system or to the
                 serial port on the InfoServer 1000 system. Make sure
                 the terminal is set to 9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity.
                 You must use a local terminal; remote LAT terminal
                 server terminals do not work with this procedure.

              2  Enter console mode as described in the installation and
                 owner's guide for your InfoServer system.

              3  At the console prompt (>>>), enter the following
                 command:

                 >>> B/D0000001

                 This command causes the InfoServer software to boot
                 without reading the configuration database from the
                 internal read/write device. Therefore, all system
                 defaults are in effect for this boot.

              4  At the Enter Password: prompt, enter the default
                 password ESS. You now have access to InfoServer
                 commands.

                                                                    5-29

 



     Troubleshooting
     5.9 InfoServer Password Forgotten

           5  After you log in, you can restore all of the previous
              system configuration by using the RESTORE command:

              InfoServer> RESTORE
              %ESS-I-RESTORE, Restoring Configuration from DK10:
              InfoServer>

           6  Change the server password to a known value:

              InfoServer> SET SERVER PASSWORD
              _Password: NEW_PASSWORD (not echoed)
              _Verification: NEW_PASSWORD (not echoed)
              InfoServer>

           7  Save the current settings, including the new password,
              by entering the SAVE command:

              InfoServer> SAVE
              %ESS-I-SAVED, Save completed successfully to DK10:
              InfoServer>

              The system is now restored to its previously saved
              configuration. Your new password is also saved.

              This appendix lists user messages that the InfoServer
              system displays. The appendix also provides corrective
              steps for error and warning messages.

              The InfoServer system displays three different types
              of messages to the user: error messages, information
              messages, and warning messages. You can identify each
              type of message by using its one-letter prefix. Following
              the prefix is a reason code and a simple text message
              explaining the error.

              Informational message:    %ESS-I-reason, text
              Error message:            %ESS-E-reason, text
              Warning message:          %ESS-W-reason, text

              Informational messages are positive feedback indicating
              that the attempted operation succeeded. These messages
              also tell you about results from the command that might
              not be obvious.

              Error messages indicate that a command failed to execute
              properly. The message should help you identify and correct
              the problem. Consult the other chapters in this manual if
              necessary.

              Warning messages indicate that a command was not able to
              execute due to a server restriction.

       %ESS-E-NOHELPFOUND, Sorry, no documentation on xxx

         Explanation: No online help exists for the requested topic.
         Refer to this guide for help.

       %ESS-E-NOPOOL, Insufficient memory available for operation

         Explanation: The server's memory is exhausted. This may be
         a temporary condition that corrects itself, or the server
         may be overloaded. Try the operation again. If the failure
         occurs a second time, you can set the server to the off
         state, perform the operation, and set the server state back
         on. This should free up enough resources to complete any
         operation.

       %ESS-E-NOSUCHDEV, Device not found.

         Explanation: You tried to perform an operation on a device
         that is not present in the configuration. Use the SHOW
         DEVICE command to list all devices on the InfoServer.

       %ESS-E-NOSUCHSERVICE, Service not found, xxx

         Explanation: You tried to set or delete a service xxx that
         does not exist. The service being accessed may be in a
         different namespace, or you may have misspelled the name.

       %ESS-E-NOTESSODS, Device does not have InfoServer disk format.

         Explanation: You tried an operation that can only be
         performed on an InfoServer device. InfoServer devices are
         devices that have been initialized with the INITIALIZE
         command.

       %ESS-E-NOTOFF, Server must be in the OFF state to perform
         local disk operations.

         Explanation: The server state was on when you entered a
         COPY, INITIALIZATION, or UPDATE command. These commands
         require the server state to be off.

       %ESS-E-NOTRWDEV, Can not write to device.

         Explanation: A write operation was attempted to a compact
         disc. One example is the INITIALIZE command.

         %ESS-E-PARPERM,  This partition can not be deleted.

            Explanation: You tried to delete a partition that is
            managed by the server. For example, the BOOT_PARTITION
            is a partition that cannot be deleted.

         %ESS-E-PARMTOOLONG,  Parameter supplied was too long.

            Explanation: You entered a command parameter string that is

            operation failed. Following this message is another message
            giving the exact reason the command failed. For example,
            one failure might be that the configuration partition was
            not found.

         %ESS-E-SAVEDFAILED,  Could not save configuration to DKn:

            Explanation: You tried to save the server's configuration
            to a device that is either not an InfoServer device or not
            a read/write device. Repeat the command to an InfoServer
            device.

         %ESS-E-SCSIREADERROR,  Error Reading disk.

            Explanation: The server received an error reading data from
            a device. Try the operation again. If the error continues,
            call your field service representative.

                                                                     B-7

       %ESS-E-SCSIWRITEERROR, Error writing disk.

         Explanation: The server received an error writing data to
         a device. Try the operation again. If the error continues,
         call your field service representative.

       %ESS-E-SIZEMISMATCH, Source and Destination sizes must be
         equal.

         Explanation: You tried to copy a device or partition to a
         destination device or partition with a different size. The
         source and destination device must be the same size.

       %ESS-E-UNKNOWNCOMMAND, Unrecognized command.

         Explanation: You entered a command that is not part of the
         InfoServer's command set. See Chapter 3 for the correct
         syntax.

       %ESS-E-VERIFYERR, Verification password failed to match new
         password.

         Explanation: You entered a verification password that does
         not match a new password. Please repeat the operation.

       %ESS-E-WRONGPASSWORD, Invalid password. Please try again.

         Explanation: You entered a password that does not match the
         current server's password. Enter the correct password, or
         see Section 5.9 if you cannot remember the password.

       %ESS-E-WRONGSTATE, Server state must be OFF to perform this
         operation.

         Explanation: You tried a COPY or UPDATE command with the
         server in the on state. The server state must be off for
         these commands, to preserve data integrity by limiting
         access to the server. This prevents remote disk operations
         from interfering with local disk operations.

         functions...

         Explanation: A bad function was found on a Function compact
         disc, and was skipped over by the InfoServer.

         %ESS-W-CANTSHARE,  Tapes cannot be shared by more than 1 user
            concurrently

            Explanation: You attempted to set a tape service to have
            more than one reader or writer. Tape devices cannot be
            shared concurrently more more than one client at a time.

         %ESS-W-ENDOFTAPE,  End of tape reached, copied data truncated

            Explanation: The data specified in the source of a COPY
            command would not fit on one tape. The InfoServer truncated
            the data that would not fit on the tape.

         %ESS-W-NOTINF,  Device not InfoServer-formatted, omitted from
            operation

            Explanation: You specified a device in a list (for example,
            in the SET SERVER REMOTE DEVICE command) that does not have
            InfoServer format (for example, has not been formatted with
            the InfoServer INITIALIZE command). The InfoServer skips
            the device listed and continues to operate on the rest of
            the list.

         %ESS-W-NOTPRESENT,  Device not present, omitted from operation

            Explanation: You specified a device in a list (for example,
            in the SET SERVER REMOTE DEVICE command) that does not
            exist on the InfoServer. The InfoServer skips the device
            listed and continues to operate on the rest of the list.

         %ESS-W-NOWRITERS,  CD volumes cannot be written. Setting
            maximum writers to zero.

            Explanation: You tried to set write access on a compact
            disc. Compact discs on the InfoServer are read-only.

         %ESS-W-TAPECLASS,  Tape devices can be served only under class
            TAPE

            Explanation: You tried to create a service for a tape
            device under one of the disk service classes. Tape devices
            can only be served under the TAPE class.
