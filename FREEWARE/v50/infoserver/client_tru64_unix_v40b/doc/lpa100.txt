                                                                     Page 2
  USAGE NOTES
  ===========

  1.) Ultrix service class is used to display and create DIGITAL UNIX
      services. 

      The latest (v3.4) release of the InfoServer kernel software will
      work properly with this new client. Services and service names 
      created automatically as part of the automount process will contain
      the word Ultrix in the name and be listed in the Ultrix service
      class. For example, when the DIGITAL UNIX documentation disc is
      inserted into a drive on the InfoServer, it shows up as follows:
      
      Wolf> show services

        Service Name         Service Class   Disk:Partition
        -------------------- --------------- ----------------------
        WOLF_ULTRIX_DK0      [ULTRIX]        DK0:

        To create another service for this disc, specify Ultrix as the 
        service class.  

        Wolf> create service UNIXDOC for dk0: class ultrix
        %ESS-I-CREATED, Created service UNIXDOC [ULTRIX].
        %ESS-I-CREATED, Create service completed successfully.

        Wolf> show service

        Service Name         Service Class   Disk:Partition
        -------------------- --------------- ----------------------
        UNIXDOC              [ULTRIX]        DK0:
        WOLF_ULTRIX_DK0      [ULTRIX]        DK0:

  2.) Mounting Ultrix CD-ROMs served by an InfoServer.

      The -d switch must be used to mount an Ultrix CD-ROM. If the 
      -d switch is not used, the mount command will return with the 
      error "Dirty file system" and the mount will not succeed. The 
      following example assumes there is an Ultrix CD-ROM in an 
      InfoServer served by service FOX_ULTRIX_DK3. 
           
      # bindladcunit 0 -serviceName FOX_ULTRIX_DK3

            Unit 0 Bound          Service FOX_ULTRIX_DK3 
        /dev/ladc/unit0c          Server  FOX

        Drive Name        DK3:            Service Rating             65016

                h         0               0
        
        # mount -dr /dev/ladc/unit0c /mnt 


                                                                     Page 3

  3.) Initializing InfoServer hard drive partitions.

      When creating partitions on an InfoServer hard drive, newfs may 
      produce warning messages about unallocated disk sectors. These 
      messages are particularly apparent with partitions that are 2MB 
      or smaller but a partition of any size may cause these warnings
      to occur. These messages can also be displayed if the -resizeEnabled
      switch on the bindladcunit command is set to "no" when binding the
      logical device to an InfoServer service. These warnings can be 
      ignored.

      The recommended method for initializing a partition under any 
      supported version of DIGITAL UNIX is to use disklabel followed 
      by the newfs commands. The disktype argument for the disklabel
      command must always be 'lad' regardless of the actual disktype
      (e.g. RZ28M) on which the InfoServer partition can be found. Using
      disktype 'lad' will insure that UNIX partition configuration entries
      in the /etc/disktab will not override the partition size information
      retrieved by the LAD device driver. The automatic UNIX partition 
      resizing algorithm built into the LAD driver will attempt to 
      create appropriately sized UNIX partitions within the InfoServer 
      partition when devicetype 'lad' is specified.

      The following is an example of the initialization of a 1000 blk 
      (1/2MB) InfoServer partition and the warning message that can be
      generated from the newfs command. This example assumes that
      logical unit 2 has been previously bound to an InfoServer service
      representing a partition on the hard drive. 

      # disklabel -wr /dev/ladc/runit2c lad

      # newfs /dev/ladc/runit2c
      Warning: 80 sector(s) in last cylinder unallocated
      /dev/ladc/runit2c:1200 sectors in 10 cylinders of 2 tracks, 64 sectors
           0.6MB in 1 cyl groups (16 c/g, 1.05MB/g, 256 i/g)
      super-block backups (for fsck -b #) at:
      32,

      # mount /dev/ladc/unit2c /mnt

      It is also possible that the disklabel command might issue truncation
      messages and prompts. If this occurs, respond to each truncation
      question with a "y". A "n" response to any of these questions will
      result in failure to write the disk label. 

  4.) Using FSCK to check the UNIX File System on an InfoServer Partition.

      Should the need arise to check the consistency of the UFS on an
      InfoServer partition, use the fsck utility with the -y switch. Running
      fsck might be necessary if mount returns with the message "Dirty
      file system". The switch will eliminate the need to type 'y' in 
      response to each "CANNOT READ: BLK", "CONTINUE? [yn]" prompt. 
      The reason for these errors is that fsck expects the UNIX partitions
      to be sized differently than the actual InfoServer partition.

  5.) FDDI, ATM, and TOKEN Ring network adapter support.

      The DIGITAL InfoServer Client for DIGITAL UNIX only supports ethernet
      network adapters. FDDI, ATM, and TOKEN Ring adapters are not supported
      at this time.



                                                                     Page 4


  6.) CD-ROM discs removed from the InfoServer while mounted.

      Users will receive "Connection timed out" or "I/O error" messages 
      if they try to access a mounted file system associated with a CD-ROM
      that was somehow made inaccessible (i.e. removed) from the InfoServer.
      Using the showladcbind command, the affected logical unit will show the 
      unit state as "Aborted" when it should be "Connected". To recover 
      from this type of situation, the system manager can follow either 
      one of the strategies below.

      A.) Unmount the file system and unbind the logical unit. Bind the
          logical unit to the chosen service and mount the file system.

      B.) Make sure the disc containing the correct service is placed in
          the exact drive in the InfoServer from which it was previously
          bound. Unmount the file system to transition the logical unit 
          from the "Aborted" state to the "Discarded" state. Then remount
          the file system to cause transition to the "Connected" state.
          Users should now be able to access the service. The "Discarded"
          state simply means that the logical unit was previously in the
          "Aborted" state. 

  7.) Occasionally when attempting to mount a DIGITAL UNIX disc served by
      the InfoServer, you might receive the message "Dirty file system".
      To mount the disc, simply use the -d switch on the mount command
      as follows:

         mount -dr /dev/ladc/unit1c /mnt

  8.) Receiving "No such device or address" when attempting to 
      mount a disc or partition served by the InfoServer. 

      # mount -r /dev/ladc/unit2c /mnt
      /dev/ladc/unit2c on /mnt: No such device or address
 
      The association request sent from the client as the result of the mount 
      command is transmitted four times at 1/2 second intervals before a
      failure is reported. A response from the InfoServer must be delivered
      across the LAN within 3 seconds or the mount will fail. Occasional
      failures may result from an InfoServer and/or network that is
      experiencing some load. The solution is simply to issue the mount
      command a second time. If the bind and mount commands are in shell 
      scripts, you might want to use a retry loop as follows:

      RETRY=true
      while $RETRY
      do
        if mount ...
        then
               RETRY=false
        else
               sleep 1
               echo "mount failed, trying again..."
        fi
      done

      The "No such device or address" and "Error: /dev/ladc/unit0c is
      an invalid device or cannot be opened" messages are also displayed
      when attempting to mount a hard drive partition that was opened by 
      another client in an incompatible access mode (read/write). Access
      mode compatibility is also governed by the type of write access 
      policy enabled on the InfoServer. 


                                                                     Page 5


  9.) Using the DIGITAL InfoServer Client for DIGITAL UNIX in a high 
      traffic network environment.

      A switch was added to the bindladcunit command to permit some control
      over the number of times the LAST protocol will attempt to transmit
      requests to an InfoServer before timing out the logical device. The 
      default value is set to 20 retry attempts. In a heavily loaded
      network, it is possible that the InfoServer Client might not receive
      a response from an InfoServer during the twenty retry window. Logical
      device (/dev/ladc/unit*) timeouts are reported in the console log
      as 
      
      LAD error log: Assoc to unit 0 (2) aborted for reason 0xf43c (errno 60) 

      To alleviate this problem, try setting the timeout value to something
      between 20 and 100 using the following command:

      # bindladcunit 0 -servicename WOLF_ULTRIX_DK0 -transmitlimit 25
 
      The transmitlimit applies only to the logical unix specified in the
      bindladcunit command. All other units are unaffected.
       

 10.) Staging an ISO image file on the InfoServer to publish CD media.

      The following are the steps that one can follow to stage an ISO
      image on the InfoServer to publish a CD-ROM. This procedure assumes
      the InfoServer is equipped with a hard disk, and CD-R drive and that
      an ISO-9660 CD-R publishing package is available on the DIGITAL UNIX
      system. The DIGITAL InfoServer Client for DIGITAL UNIX must be 
      loaded and started on the system. 

      a) Create an ISO-9660 image on the DIGITAL UNIX system using an 
         ISO-9660 publishing package. 

      b) Create a partition on the hard drive in the InfoServer slightly
         larger than the ISO-9660 image. If your ISO-9660 image is 40  
         megabytes, then you can safely create a partition that is larger 
         by 3 megabytes. A larger partition is necessary to provide for
         InfoServer file system overhead. 
         
         InfoServer> CREATE PARTITION DK1:STAGE MEGABYTES 43 ERASE
 
      c) Create a service for that partition in the ULTRIX class.
 
         InfoServer> CREATE SERVICE STAGE FOR DK1:STAGE CLASS ULTRIX.

      d) Issue the bindladcunit command on the DIGITAL UNIX system to
         bind to the STAGE service using any available unit number.
         For this example, unit number 0 is used.

         # bindladcunit 0 -servicename STAGE
         
      e) Execute the disklabel command twice, once to apply a label and
         once to zero it out. 

         # disklabel -wr /dev/ladc/runit0c lad
         # disklabel -z /dev/ladc/runit0c


                                                                     Page 6


 10.) (Continued...)

      f) Copy the image file to the raw InfoServer device using the DIGITAL
         UNIX dd command. This copy operation might take some time. 

         # dd if=dunix.img of=/dev/ladc/runit0c

      g) Now mount the logical device unit 0 on an available mount point
         and check out the files within the image.  

         # mount -r -t cdfs -o noversion /dev/ladc/unit0c /mnt

      h) If you are satisfied with the information in the ISO-9660 image, 
         unmount and unbind the unit.

         # umount /mnt
         # unbindladcunit 0

      i) Begin the record process on the InfoServer by verifying that the
         recorder is in the ready state. If the device is not in the ready
         state, make sure a blank piece of media has been inserted into
         the device. 

         InfoServer> SHOW RECORDER

         Execute the RECORD command in test mode first before performing
         the actual burn. When the record operation is run in test mode,
         the CD-R laser operates at read level instead of write. It is 
         very important to include both the ISO and SIZE switches. These 
         switches insure that the InfoServer only records the ISO-9660
         image on to the CD and not the surrounding file system. The exact
         size in bytes of ISO-9660 image must be known in order to use 
         the SIZE switch. Assuming the the CD-R is device DK0:, the record 
         command would look like the following:

         InfoServer> RECORD DK1:STAGE DK0: ISO SIZE nnn TEST 

      j) If the test proceeds without error, remove the TEST switch and 
         re-execute the record.  

         InfoServer> RECORD DK1:STAGE DK0: ISO SIZE nnn TEST 


                                                                     Page 7
  Documentation Errata
  ====================

  1.) Section 5.2 entitled "Enabling Your System as an InfoServer Client
      for DMS" in the "DIGITAL InfoServer Client for DIGITAL UNIX Installation
      and User's Guide" states that "some manual setup is required to permit
      bind and mount operations." Manual intervention is only required if 
      the InfoServer Client software is installed into an environment that
      one or more DMS clients are already using. The commands below must be
      executed on each DMS client from which the InfoServer Client is to 
      be used. These commands are to be used in place of the setup
      instructions described in Section 5.2.  

         # /usr/opt/LPABASE100/ladsetup.sh bblock
         # /usr/opt/LPABASE100/ladsetup.sh reboot
         # /usr/opt/LPABASE100/ladsetup.sh driver
         # /usr/opt/LPABASE100/ladsetup.sh adapter
         # /usr/opt/LPABASE100/ladc.sh start

      The setup above is not necessary if the InfoServer Client is 
      installed in an environment prior to adding one or more clients.          


  KNOWN PROBLEMS
  ==============

  1.) If there are no requested services available from InfoServers on the
      LAN or there are no InfoServers on the LAN, the showladservice command
      will solicit for approximately 15 minutes before returning. When the
      showladservice command is executed, it will display "Interrogating 
      network, please wait.." The Client will continually display more dots
      as solicitation request responses are received. This activity occurs
      almost immediately when services are available in the service
      solicitation class (Ultrix by default). If there are no services
      available, only two dots will be displayed for a long (10 seconds or 
      more) period of time. Simply type Ctrl/c to terminate the command 
      if this problem is encountered.

  2.) When the InfoServer Client is removed from a DMS environment, the
      subsystem names remain in the ./dms/dmsn.alpha/ProdNames file. This
      file is used by the dmu to display the contents of all software
      environments after selecting 's', "SHOW software environments"
      from the menu. To correct this problem, use an editor to open the 
      ProdNames file and delete the following subsystem names:

       'InfoServer Client for Digital UNIX LPABASE100'
       'InfoServer Client for Digital UNIX LPAMAN100'
