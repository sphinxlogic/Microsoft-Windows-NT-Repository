 *
 *      This is an include file, to separate the generic code for query.c from the
 *      cosmetic customizations that each site would want to have for itself.
 *
 *      The line that generates the </HEAD> and <BODY> tags, is required.  All other
 *      lines may be modified or eliminated, according to local tastes and standards.
