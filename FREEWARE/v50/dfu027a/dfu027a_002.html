<p>
The several characteristics can be combined in one command.If you want 
a logical OR behaviour in stead of the default AND behaviour, you can 
use the special option MATCH=OR eg:

<pre>
  SEARCH disk/CHAR=(NOMOVE,DIR,MATCH=OR) 
</pre>

<p>
<h3>/CREATED=option(,option)</h3>
The /CREATED qualifier is used to search files depending on their 
creation date. The options are :

<ul>
  <li>/CREATED=BEFORE=date
  <li>/CREATED=SINCE=date
</ul>

<p>
These 2 options can be used to get files which have a creation date 
before or after a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option can be 
combined in one command.
<h3>/EXCLUDE=(file1,file2...)</h3>
This qualifier is used to exclude files from the search. You can use 
wildcard filenames ; you can also specifiy a list of files.
<h3>/EXPIRED=option(,option)</h3>
The /EXPIRED qualifier is used to search files depending on their 
expiration date. The options are :

<ul>
  <li>/EXPIRED=BEFORE=date
  <li>/EXPIRED=SINCE=date
  <li>/EXPIRED=NONE
</ul>

<p>
The NONE option gives files which don't have a expiration date 
recorded.The other 2 options can be used to get files which have a 
expiration date before or after a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE 
option can be combined in one command.
<h3>/FID=file-id</h3>
The /FID qualifier is a special function of SEARCH. It directs SEARCH 
to go directly to the specified file without processing the rest of the 
Index file. Therefore, you cannot combine this qualifierwith other 
search qualifiers such as /FILE. Normally a file-id consists is in the 
form (x,y,z) where x is the number of the file header within INDEXF.SYS 
y is the sequence number, and z is the Relative Volume Number. You only 
need to specifiy the x value in the /FID qualifier.
<h3>/FILE=(file1,file2...)</h3>
This qualifier is used to search for files with a specific file 
name.You can use wildcard file names; also you can specify a list of 
files.
<h3>/FORMAT=format-string</h3>
Create an output file in a format described by the format string. The 
string must contain the !AS directive (this must be uppercase). At the 
!AS location the resultant filename will be filled in. The /OUTPUT 
qualifier is required.
<h3>/FRAGMENT=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr)</h3>
This qualifier displays the number of fragments and file headers of 
each file found. You can further limit the files found by using the 
MINIMUM and MAXIMUM= options. For example:

<pre>
DFU&gt; disk/FRAG 
DFU&gt; disk/FRAG=min=10 
DFU&gt; disk/FRAG=(min=10,max=100) 
</pre>

<p>
<h3>/FULL</h3>
If you use this qualifier, SEARCH will give a full output for each file 
found. This output is a look-alike of the output from DIRECTORY/FULL. 
You cannot combine this qualifier with /SORT or /SUMMARY.
<h3>/HOME</h3>
This qualifier directs search to give output from the disk's home 
block. SEARCH uses the home block for calculating the free and used 
file headers within INDEXF.SYS.
<h3>/(NO)IDENT=identifier or uic</h3>
You can search for files owned by a specific identifier or UIC. Any 
valid UIC or identifier format may be used. Another way is the 
/OWNER_UIC qualifier; you cannot combine these 2 qualifiers in one 
SEARCH command. Issueing /NOIDENT directs DFU to search for files NOT 
owned by this IDENTIFIER, eg: DFU&gt; SEARCH 
sys$sysdevice/NOIDENT=SYSTEM.
<h3>/LBN=logical-block-number</h3>
The /LBN qualifier is a special function of SEARCH. This allows you to 
find a file which contains a specific LBN. This may be useful if you 
have bad blocks logged in the error log. You cannot combine /LBN with 
search qualifiers such as /FILE.
<h3>/LIMIT=(MINIMUM=n,MAXAXIMUM=m)</h3>
Searches DIRECTORY files which have a default version limit between n 
and m (including n and m). Either MINIMUM or MAXIMUM is required.
<h3>/NAME_TYPE=ODS2 | ISL1 | UCS2</h3>
Search for files which have the specified name type attribute. ODS2 if 
for classic VMS file names, ISL1 is for Iso-Latin-1 names and UCS2 is 
for Unicode names. This qualifier is only meaningfull for ODS5 disks 
(requires VMS 7.2).
<h3>/(NO)OWNER_UIC=uic or identifier</h3>
This qualifier is used to get files owned by a specific UIC or 
identifier. Any valid UIC or identifier format may be used. You cannot 
combine this qualifier with /IDENT. Specifying /NOOWNER directs DFU to 
search for files NOT owned by this UIC or identifier.
<h3>/NOSEARCH</h3>
This qualifier can only be used in combination with /HOME. It is used 
to get the Homeblock info, without searching the entire disk.
<h3>/NOVOLSET</h3>
The default behaviour of SEARCH is to process an entire volume set. You 
can override this behaviour with /NOVOLSET. This may be useful when 
doing a /LBN search.
<h3>/MODIFIED=option(,option)</h3>
The /MODIFIED qualifier is used to search files depending on their 
modification date. The options are :

<ul>
  <li>/MODIFIED=BEFORE=date
  <li>/MODIFIED=SINCE=date
</ul>

<p>
These 2 options can be used to get files which have a modification date 
before or after a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option can be 
combined in one command.
<h3>/MULTIPLE</h3>
This qualifier searches for files which have more than 1 file header.
<h3>/ORGANIZATION=INDEXED | SEQUENTIAL | RELATIVE | DIRECT</h3>
Search for files with the specified RMS file organization.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file</h3>
This qualifier redirects the output from SEARCH to an output file.This 
file can later be used as input to the DEFRAG, DIRECTORY or SET command.
<h3>/OVER_ALLOCATED=n</h3>
Searches for files where the difference between the used and allocated 
size is at least 'n' blocks.
<h3>/PLACED</h3>
Checks for files which have a placement control retrieval pointer.This 
is sometimes set by non-DEC disk defragmentation programs.
<h3>/SIZE=(minimum=size1,maximum=size2)</h3>
The /SIZE qualifier is used to limit files found by their file size.You 
can either use minimum= or maximum= or use both options together. 
SEARCH will use the actual file size for selecting files, except when 
the /ALLOCATED qualifier is used.
<h3>/SORT</h3>
This qualifier will sort the files found before being output. You can 
combine this with the /OUTPUT qualifier (the default output is 
SYS$OUTPUT).
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3>
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed 
Time, I/O and PageFaults.
<h3>/SUMMARY</h3>
This qualifier will limit the output to the total number of files 
found, with their size (and optional the fragmentation when /FRAG is 
used). You cannot combine /SUMMARY with /FULL.
<h3>/TYPE=option</h3>
The /TYPE qualifier has 2 options : /TYPE=ODS2 or /TYPE=ODS5. This 
qualifier can be used to search for files with either a ODS2 or an ODS5 
file header. This qualifier is only usefull on ODS5 disk (VMS V7.2).
<h3>/VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=n,maximum=m)</h3>
The /VERSION_NUMBER qualifier is used search for files within a range 
(n thru m) of file version numbers. Logfiles which are produced with 
the same name may pose problems when they reach the maximum version 
number (32767). Using /VERSION=MIN=32000 is a quick way to find such 
files.

<a name="chapter_11"><h1>Chapter 11<br>SET</h1></a>

<p>
This chapter describes the SET command with the related parameters and 
qualifiers.
<a name="hd10_1"></a>

<a name="heading_11.1"><h1>11.1 Introduction</h1></a>

<p>
The SET command allows you to modify file attributes which can't be 
modified through DCL commands. Note that you should be careful about 
using this function; you may easily corrupt files. This much wanted 
functionality was introduced in VMS 6.0 with a new DCL command $SET 
FILE/ATTRIBUTES. Still DFU's SET has some options which are not in SET 
FILE/ATTRIBUTES (such as setting a BACKUP date).

<p>
The new qualifier, /IGNORE=INTERLOCK, allows setting file attributes 
even on open or locked files.
<a name="hd10_2"></a>

<a name="heading_11.2"><h1>11.2 UIC and identifier processing</h1></a>

<p>
As of version V2.4 of DFU the /OWNER and /IDENT qualifier now accepts 
all valid UIC or identifier formats. See chapter 10.5 for details.

<h3>file1,file2,...,@file</h3>
The files to be modified. The attributes to be modified are specified 
with qualifiers. Wildcards area allowed in the filename. An indirect 
file can be used by using the @ sign. This allows processing of a file 
list produced by a DFU SEARCH command.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ACCESS_DATE=date</h3>
<h3>/NOACCESS_DATE</h3>
Controls whether a new last-access date is assigned to the specified 
files. (V7.2 only) Specify the date according to the rules described in 
Chapter 1 of the VMS DCL Concepts Manual. Absolute date keywords are 
allowed. If you specify 0 as the date, today's date is used. If you 
specify /NOACCESS_DATE the last access date field will be cleared.
<h3>/ATTRIBUTE_DATE=date</h3>
<h3>/NOATTRIBUTE_DATE</h3>
Controls whether a new last attribute change date is assigned to the 
specified files (V7.2 only). Specify the date according to the rules 
described in Chapter 1 of the VMS DCL Concepts Manual. Absolute date 
keywords are allowed. If you specify 0 as the date, today's date is 
used. If you specify /NOATTRIBUTE_DATE the last attribute change date 
field will be cleared.
<h3>/BACKUP_DATE=date</h3>
<h3>/NOBACKUP_DATE</h3>
Controls whether a new backup date is assigned to the specified files. 
Specify the date according to the rules described in Chapter 1 of the 
VMS DCL Concepts Manual. Absolute date keywords are allowed. If you 
specify 0 as the date, today's date is used. If you specify 
/NOBACKUP_DATE the Backup date field will be cleared.
<h3>/BADACL</h3>
<h3>/NOBADACL</h3>
Sets or resets the 'BADACL' flag in the file header. This enables 
deletion of a file with a corrupted ACL.
<h3>/BCK</h3>
<h3>/NOBCK</h3>
Clears or sets the files NOBACKUP bit. Setting a file to NOBACKUP with 
/NOBCK causes it to be skipped by a BACKUP operation.
<h3>/BUCKETSIZE=size</h3>
Sets a new value for the bucket size in the file header.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether a request is issued before each individual SET 
operation to confirm that the operation should be performed on that 
file. When the system issues the prompt, you can issue any of the 
following responses:

<pre>
  YES      NO     QUIT 
  TRUE     FALSE  CTRL/Z 
  1        0      ALL 
           &lt;RET&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters for word 
responses. Word responses can be abbreviated to one or more letters 
(for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE). Affirmative answers are YES, 
TRUE, and 1. Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and &lt;RET&gt;. QUIT 
or CTRL/Z indicates that you want to stop processing the command at 
that point. When you respond with ALL, the command continues to 
process, but no further prompts are given. If you type a response other 
than one of those in the list, the prompt will be reissued.
<h3>/CONTIGUOUS_BEST_TRY</h3>
<h3>/NOCONTIGUOUS_BEST_TRY</h3>
Sets or resets the 'CONTIGUOUS_BEST_TRY' bit in the file header.
<h3>/CREATION_DATE=date</h3>
<h3>/NOCREATION_DATE</h3>
Controls whether a new creation date is assigned to the specified 
files. Specify the date according to the rules described in Chapter 1 
of the VMS DCL Concepts Manual. Absolute date keywords are allowed. If 
you specify 0 as the date, today's date is used.
<h3>/DIRECTORY</h3>
<h3>/NODIRECTORY</h3>
Sets or resets the directory attribute of a file. This qualifier allows 
you to set the directory bit of a file which was mistakingly reset by 
the 'SET FILE/NODIRECTORY' command. If it is done on a non-directory 
file, then access to that directory will give a 'BADIRECTORY' error.
<h3>/EBLOCK[=block]</h3>
This qualifier will reset the end-of-file mark to the highest block 
allocated if no block has been specified. Otherwise the end-of-file 
mark will be set to the specified block.
<h3>/EBYTE[=byte]</h3>
This qualifier will set the end-of-file byte mark to the highest byte 
if it has not been specified. Otherwise the end-of-file byte mark will 
be set to the specified byte.
<h3>/EXPIRATION_DATE=date</h3>
<h3>/NOEXPIRATION_DATE</h3>
Controls whether an expiration date is assigned to the specified files. 
Specify the date according to the rules described in Chapter 1 of the 
VMS DCL Concepts Manual. Absolute date keywords are allowed. If you 
specify 0 as the date, today's date is used.
<h3>/IDENT=identifier or uic</h3>
Modify the file ownership. See also /OWNER_UIC. This allows 
modification of the file-ownership even if the file is open, eg. 
INDEXF.SYS. You cannot use both /IDENT and /OWNER_UIC.
<h3>/IGNORE=INTERLOCK</h3>
Perform the SET command on open or locked files. Default DFU will 
return a %SYSTEM-E-ACCONFLICT on open files. The /IGNORE=INTERLOCK 
option can overrule this behaviour.
<h3>/LOCKED</h3>
<h3>/NOLOCKED</h3>
This qualifier will lock a file for future use. Nothing else can then 
be done with the file, until it is unlocked (which can also be done 
with the VMS 'UNLOCK' command.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether the SET command displays the file specification of 
each file after the modification is made.
<h3>/MAXREC=record</h3>
Sets a new value for the maximum record number in the file header.
<h3>/NOMOVE</h3>
This qualifier disables or enables (/NONOMOVE) the MoveFile attribute 
on files. It is the same as the DCL command SET FILE/NOMOVE, but in 
conjunction with /IGNORE=INTERLOCK DFU can change the setting on Open 
or Locked files.
<h3>/ORGANIZATION=keyword</h3>
The following keywords are used as parameters for the ORGANIZATION 
qualifier: DIRECT, INDEXED, RELATIVE and SEQUENTIAL. This will allow 
you to modify the file organization type in the file header. Of course 
this won't change the real organization of the file.
<h3>/OWNER_UIC=uic or identifier</h3>
Modify the file ownership to an UIC or identifier. See also /IDENT. 
This allows modification of the file-ownership even if the file is 
open, eg. INDEXF.SYS. You cannot use both /IDENT and /OWNER_UIC.
<h3>/RECATTRIBUTES=keyword</h3>
The following keywords are used as parameters for the RECATTRIBUTES 
qualifier: NONE, FORTRAN, IMPLIED, PRINT and NOSPAN. This will allow 
you to modify the file's record attributes in the file header. NONE, 
FORTRAN, IMPLIED and PRINT are mutually exclusive, but can be used in 
combination with NOSPAN. When NOSPAN is omitted SPAN is assumed (the 
default is to allow records to cross block boundaries).
<h3>/RECSIZE=size</h3>
Sets a new value for the record size in the file header.
<h3>/RECTYPE=keyword</h3>
The following keywords are used as parameters for the RECTYPE 
qualifier: FIXED, STREAM, STREAMCR, STREAMLF, UNDEFINED, VARIABLE and 
VFC. This will allow you to modify the file's record type in the file 
header.
<h3>/REVISION_DATE=date</h3>
<h3>/NOREVISION_DATE</h3>
Controls whether a revision date is assigned to the specified files. 
Specify the date according to the rules described in Chapter 1 of the 
VMS DCL Concepts Manual. Absolute date keywords are allowed. If you 
specify 0 as the date, today's date is used.
<h3>/RVCOUNT=count</h3>
Sets a new value for the revision count in the file header.
<h3>/UPDATE</h3>
<h3>/NOUPDATE (default)</h3>
Normally the file's revision date will be updated after any 
modification to it. SET however disables this update (otherwise the 
REVISION date could not be set). Specify this qualifier if you want the 
revision date to be updated.
<h3>/VFCSIZE=size</h3>
Sets a new value for the VFC size in the file header. This value will 
only be used with the VFC record type.

<a name="chapter_12"><h1>Chapter 12<br>UNDELETE</h1></a>

<p>
This chapter describes the UNDELETE command with the related parameters 
and qualifiers.
<a name="hd11_1"></a>

<a name="heading_12.1"><h1>12.1 Introduction</h1></a>

<p>
The UNDELETE function is designed to recover deleted files, if 
possible. UNDELETE operates in a safe mode such that it first checks if 
the deleted file header and diskblocks are still available. Only in 
that case will the file be recovered. Otherwise UNDELETE will leave the 
disk unmodified. UNDELETE has some powerfull options:

<ul>
  <li>Generate a list of recoverable files with the /LIST qualifier. This 
  qualifier will not undelete any file, and therefore it does not lock up 
  the disk.
  <li>Undelete multiple files in one pass.
  <li>Make file selections based on the owner with the /OWNER or /IDENT 
  qualifier.
  <li>Undeleted files which cannot be entered back in their original 
  directory will be moved to the [SYSLOST] directory. This saves an 
  additional ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR action.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="hd11_1a"></a>

<a name="heading_12.2"><h1>12.2 File specification syntax</h1></a>
Because a deleted file no longer 'knows' its parent directory you must 
NOT enter a directory specification in the file name. Therefore , the 
syntax to undelete a specific file is :

<pre>
   DFU&gt; UNDELETE &lt;device:&gt;/file=&lt;filename.ext&gt; 
 
 eg: 
 
   DFU&gt; UNDELETE $1$DIA1:/file=FOO.BAR 
</pre>

<p>
DFU will try to re-enter the file in its original directory; it that 
fails the file will be entered in the [SYSLOST] directory.
<a name="hd11_2"></a>

<a name="heading_12.3"><h1>12.3 How Undelete works</h1></a>

<p>
The UNDELETE command operates as follows :

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Lock the volume. In the same manner as ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR and SET 
  VOLUME /REBUILD Undelete locks the disk for other writers such that no 
  modifications to the INDEXF, BITMAP or QUOTA file can be made.
  <li>Search the INDEXF.SYS file if the requested file is still there. A 
  check is made if it really is a valid deleted file header.
  <li>Checks if the deleted file header and all possible extension 
  headers are still valid.
  <li>Checks if the blocks previously owned by this file are still free.
  <li>If all these conditions are met DFU will display the file and asks 
  for a confirmation.
  <li>Rebuilds all of the deleted file headers and bitmaps in memory. If 
  no errors are found all the file headers and bitmaps are written back 
  to disk. The files original backlink is saved in a table in memory.
  <li>If appropiate the blocks and headers are charged against diskquota.
  <li>When all of INDEXF.SYS has been scanned the volume is unlocked.
  <li>The file(s) is (are) entered in the original directory if possible, 
  using the table build up in memory. If the enter command fails 
  (probably because the original directory is gone) the file will be 
  entered in [SYSLOST]. DFU will create this directory if needed.
</ol>

<p>
If the /LIST qualifier is used, DFU will just list the recoverable 
files without performing any action on the disk. The disk will not be 
locked.

<p>
It is important to note that during the bitmap and file header 
processing any error will immediately terminate the recovery process, 
and unlock the disk. Files which have been recovered up to that point 
will still be entered in the appropiate directory. As no wrong 
information has been written back to the disk this should leave the 
disk in a proper state.

<p>
NOTE: The blocks recovered will NOT be subtracted from the Volume's 
free block count. To get the actual freeblock count a SET 
VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE is necessary. Also a complete reMOUNT will reset 
the freeblock count.

<p>
IMPORTANT: DFU takes care to recover only files whose original blocks 
are free. However these blocks may have been modified in the meantime 
by another file which also has been deleted. Therefore each recovered 
file must be checked manually to check its integrity.

<p>
Example of a Undelete session :

<pre>
DFU&gt; undel $1$dua102:/list 
 
Recoverable file [TEST]CHANGE_UIC.FOR;2 found 
Recoverable file [TEST]CHECK_ID.FOR;1 found 
Recoverable file [TEST]CHKPRDIMG.FOR;1 found 
Recoverable file [TEST]CHRLEN.FOR;1 found 
 
DFU&gt; undel/file=*.for $1$DUA102: 
 
%DFU-I-READBMAP, Reading BITMAP.SYS... 
%DFU-W-LOCKED, Volume now LOCKED for write 
%DFU-I-UNDEL, Start search on $1$DUA102: 
 
Recoverable file [TEST]CHANGE_UIC.FOR;2 found 
Recover this file? (Y/N) [N] : n 
Recoverable file [TEST]CHECK_ID.FOR;1 found 
Recover this file? (Y/N) [N] : y

Recover this file? (Y/N) [N] : n 
Recoverable file [TEST]CHRLEN.FOR;1 found 
Recover this file? (Y/N) [N] : y 
 
%DFU-S-RECOVER, File succesfully recovered 
%DFU-I-ADDQUOTA, updating diskquota... 
%DFU-I-UNLOCK, Volume unlocked 
%DFU-I-ENTER, Entering file(s) in directory... 
%DFU-S-ENTERED, File CHECK_ID.FOR entered in original directory 
%DFU-S-ENTERED, File CHRLEN.FOR entered in original directory 
 
DFU&gt; EXIT 
 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="hd11_3"></a>

<a name="heading_12.4"><h1>12.4 Files marked for delete</h1></a>
Normally DFU does not undelete files marked for delete. To recover 
files marked for delete you must use the /MARKED qualifier. This will 
specifically undelete files marked for delete. This allows the recovery 
of files which are deleted but still open, such as INSTALLed files, or 
even recovery of the system dump file SYSDUMP.DMP whenever such a file 
is accidentially deleted.

<a name="chapter_13"><h1>Chapter 13<br>SPAWN</h1></a>

<p>
The new SPAWN command creates an interactive subprocess. This allows a 
quick escape to the DCL level from an interactive DFU session. The 
subprocess has a default prompt DFU_sub$. In SMG mode the &lt;DO&gt; 
key also performs a SPAWN command. You must logout explicitly to return

This chapter describes the VERIFY command with the related parameters 
and qualifiers.
<a name="hd13_1"></a>

<a name="heading_14.1"><h1>14.1 Introduction</h1></a>

<p>
The VERIFY command makes an analysis of the disk, scanning for file and 
disk structure errors. VERIFY performs almost all of the checks 
normally done by a ANALYZE/DISK command. But VERIFY is several times 
faster than ANALYZE/DISK, and uses less resources.

<p>
VERIFY checks and reports the following errors:

<ul>
  <li>Checks the logical information contained in the disk's HOME block
  <li>Reports files marked for deletion
  <li>Reports mismatches in the index file's bitmap
  <li>Checks the VMS$COMMON.DIR backlink on system disks
  <li>Checks all backlinks.
  <li>Reports multiple allocated blocks
  <li>Reports blocks incorrectly marked free and allocated
  <li>Reports all lost files
  <li>Checks for mismatches between blocks used and blocks charged in 
  QUOTA.SYS. (Only done when diskquota is enabled)
</ul>

<p>
<a name="hd13_2"></a>

<a name="heading_14.2"><h1>14.2 Basic repair actions</h1></a>
The /FIX qualifier can be used to perform some basic repair actions. 
Unlike ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR this does not lock the disk! /FIX repairs 
the following errors:

<ul>
  <li>Deletes file marked for delete (if possible).
  <li>Recovers lost files and directories into [SYSLOST].
  <li>Recovers a very rare problem which will get ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR 
  into a computable loop (This problem is fixed in VMS V6.2 or with the 
  VERI02_061 patch kit).
  <li>Recovers a corrupted backlink for the Master File Directory 
  000000.DIR.
  <li>Recovers a wrong backlink for VMS$COMMON.DIR files on the system 
  disk

The /REBUILD qualifier can be used to perform some more repair actions. 
This will however lock the disk (like a DCL $SET VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE 
command) for a short period of time (usually less than 30 seconds). 
/REBUILD repairs the following errors :

<ul>
  <li>Mismatches in the INDEXF.SYS bitmap (files reported with the 
  NOBITSET and NOBITCLR errors)
  <li>Blocks incorrectly marked allocated or free in the BITMAP.SYS.
  <li>Mismatches in the diskquota file.
</ul>

<p>
Note that /REBUILD does NOT change the disk's free block count.

<a name="heading_14.4"><h1>14.4 Directory scanning</h1></a>
The /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier will force DFU to also verify and repair 
(when using /FIX) directory problems. This qualifier directs DFU to 
scan all directories on the disk. This has some advantages :

<ul>
  <li>Better detection of some cases of 'lost' files. Combined with the 
  /FIX qualifier DFU may be able to recover such files into the correct 
  directory instead of moving such files to [SYSLOST].
  <li>Detects and fixes file-id mismatches between directories and the 
  INDEXF.SYS file.
  <li>Using the /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier makes DFU fully compatible with 
  ANALYZE/DISK.
</ul>

<p>
Please note that a complete directory scan may take several minutes to 
complete.

<a name="heading_14.5"><h1>14.5 Interpreting errors</h1></a>

<p>
On a system (cluster) wide mounted disk there will probably be 
concurrent disk activity during the VERIFY command. Therefore VERIFY 
may report some errors which are not really errors. Try running VERIFY 
2 or 3 times to see if the errors are reported again. To get a really 
consistent report from VERIFY you can use the /LOCK qualifier. This 
will write-lock the disk during the VERIFY run, so don't use this 
qualifier too often. (The /REPAIR qualifier of ANALYZE/DISK also 
write-locks the disk). Even if DFU ends ungracefully the DFU exit 
handler will always UNLOCK the disk.

An example of a typical VERIFY run follows:

<pre>
DFU&gt; VERIFY mydisk 
%DFU-I-VERIFY, Verifying MYDISK: 
%DFU-S-CHKHOME, Home block info verified OK 
%DFU-I-IFSCAN, Scanning INDEXF.SYS ... 
%DFU-I-CHKBITMAP, Checking BITMAP.SYS... 
%DFU-I-CHKLOST, Checking for lost files... 
%DFU-I-CHKQUOTA, Checking QUOTA.SYS... 
  
DFU&gt; VERIFY/REBUILD sys$sysdevice 
%DFU-W-LOCKED, Volume now write locked 
%DFU=I-VERIFY, Verifying SYS$SYSDEVICE: 
%DFU-S-CHKHOME, Home block info verified OK 
%DFU-W-DELETED, file (620,351,1) RSF_DI_RSF_SERVER0.TMP;3 marked for delete 
%DFU-W-DELETED, file (6349,173,1) DCLTABLES.EXE;937 marked for delete 
%DFU-W-DELETED, file (19745,35,1) RSF_DI_RSF_SERVER0.TMP;3 marked for delete 
%DFU-I-CHKBITMAP, Checking BITMAP.SYS... 
%DFU-E-ALLOCCLR, blocks LBN 2667141 through 2667143 incorrectly marked allocated 
%DFU-E-ALLOCCLR, blocks LBN 2667153 through 2667161 incorrectly marked allocated 
  . 
  . 
%DFU-S-RBDBITMAP, BITMAP.SYS succesfully rebuild 
%DFU-I-CHKLOST, Checking for lost files... 
%DFU-I-UNLOCK, Volume unlocked 
 
DFU&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
VERIFY can report the following errors:
<blockquote>
ALLOCCLR, blocks incorrectly marked allocated,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Blocks were found which are not allocated 
by a file but set in the BITMAP file. This error is often seen when 
VERIFY is run and there is concurrent file activity on the disk. Also, 
if after a system crash the disk is mounted with /NOREBUILD such blocks 
may exist. ReRun VERIFY with /LOCK to see if the error is still there.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/REBUILD to rebuild the BITMAP 
file.
<blockquote>
ALLOCSET, blocks incorrectly marked free,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Blocks were found which are allocated by 
a file but not set in the BITMAP file. This error is often seen when 
VERIFY is run and there is concurrent file activity on the disk. Also, 
if after a system crash the disk is mounted with /NOREBUILD such blocks 
may exist. ReRun VERIFY with /LOCK to see if the error is still there.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/REBUILD to rebuild the BITMAP 
file.
<blockquote>
BADBLOCK, file has suspected bad blocks,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A file has suspected bad blocks. This is 
likely to be caused by hardware errors on the disk.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Try to copy the file to another location. 
Also check the Error Log.
<blockquote>
BADEXTLNK, link to extension header broken,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> VERIFY tries to follow the extension link 
of the file and it failed, or the extension header is invalid.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Try ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR. However, this 
may be an unrepairable error, in which case the file will be corrupted 
and unreliable.
<blockquote>
BADMFDLNK, directory has backlink to 000000.DIR on RVN n,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A directory has a backlink to a Master 
file directory other than the one on RVN 1. This is incorrect, but the 
only way to recover is to reenter the directory manually into the 
000000.DIR on RVN 1.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Do a SET FILE/ENTER into the 000000.DIR 
directory on RVN 1, then do a SET FILE/REMOVE from the wrong 000000.DIR.
<blockquote>
DELETED, file marked for delete,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A file was found marked for deletion. 
Such files usually exists as a result of file being deleted while it 
was still INSTALLed, or as a result of a system crash. It is not 
considered as an error. You can try to delete such files by using 
VERIFY/FIX.
<blockquote>
ERRHOME, Home block info not OK,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The Info contained in the Home Block was 
not consistent or corrupted.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR to try to fix the 
error.
<blockquote>
INVBAKFID, file has invalid backlink,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The files backlink file id is not filled 
in. This is likely to be a lost file. (Note that once VERIFY reports 
this error, it will not be reported again during the LOSTFILE check). 
But is also possible that the file is in a valid directory, but that 
the Backlink file id is not filled in.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR. If the file is 
in a valid directory the backlink will be repaired. Otherwise the file 
will be moved to the [SYSLOST] directory. You can also use VERIFY/FIX 
but then the file will unconditionally be moved to [SYSLOST].
<blockquote>
LOCKED, file is deaccess locked,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The file is deaccess locked. This may be 
a result of a system crash.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Try to unlock the file with the DFU SET 
command, or the DCL UNLOCK command.
<blockquote>
LOSTHDR1, file found in nonexistent directory,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> During the lost file check a file was 
discovered in a nonexistent directory. This error can be caused as 
follows : set a directory file to NODIRECTORY and delete it.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/FIX to move the file to the 
[SYSLOST] directory.
<blockquote>
LOSTHDR2, file found in directory with bad backlink,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> During the lost file check a file was 
discovered in a valid directory. However, the directory has an invalid 
backlink. This error can be caused by doing a SET FILE/REMOVE of a 
directory file.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/FIX to move the directory to 
the [SYSLOST] directory. Then move the directory back to the correct 
location. The files in the directory should be accesible again.
<blockquote>
LOSTHDR3, file found in invalid directory,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> During the lost file check a file was 
discovered in a directory which is not a valid directory. Either the 
file has a wrong backlink, or the directory file has the directory file 
attribute not set.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Look up the directory and use DFU SET to 
set the directory bit. If the directory file was OK then run VERIFY/FIX 
to recover the lost file.
<blockquote>
LOSTHDR4, not found in a directory,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> When the /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier is 
used, DFU detects files which have a valid backlink but which are not 
seen in the directory. This can be repaired with /FIX.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Using /FIX will enter these files in the 
correct directory.
<blockquote>
MULTALLOC, blocks multiple allocated,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> ERROR
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A file has blocks allocated which already 
belong to another file. Note that VERIFY will make a second pass 
through INDEXF.SYS to report all the files involved. This is a serious 
error, and may be a result of a disk being mounted on two seperated 
VAXClusters (or a partitioned VAXCluster).
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Copy all the files found to another 
location. Next all the files must be deleted. Run VERIFY/REBUILD to 
repair the BITMAP. All the afflicted files must be manually inspected 
to see which files are valid and which are corrupted.
<blockquote>
NOBITCLR, Deleted file header marked BUSY,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A file was deleted. The corresponding bit 
in the INDEXF bitmap should be cleared but is still set. This is not a 
serious error.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/REBUILD to fix the error.
<blockquote>
NOBITSET, index file bitmap bit not set,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A valid file was found, but the 
corresponding index file bitmap bit is clear. This is not a serious 
error.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/REBUILD to fix the error.
<blockquote>
NOOWNER, file has no owner,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A file was found with UIC [0,0] as the 
owner. This is not a normal situation.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Look up the file and modify the file 
owner.
<blockquote>
QUOTAERR, UIC [x,y] has n blocks used, QUOTA indicates m blocks,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> If a disk has diskquota enabled, VERIFY 
calculates the blocks used and compares them with the value in the 
QUOTA.SYS file. Any mismatch is reported. This error is often seen when 
VERIFY is run, and there is concurrent file activity on the disk. Also, 
if after a system crash the disk is mounted with /NOREBUILD such Quota 
mismatches may exist. ReRun VERIFY with /LOCK to see if the error is 
still there.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/REBUILD to rebuild the QUOTA 
file. Or run a DISKQUOTA&gt; REBUILD command.
<blockquote>
SLFBAKFID, backlink points to itself,
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> WARNING
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> This error indicates that DFU has found a 
directory with a backlink pointing to itself. This feature is only 
allowed for the MFD 000000.DIR. This error will result in ANALYZE/DISK 
going into a COMputable loop.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Run VERIFY/FIX to move the directory to 
the [SYSLOST] directory. Then remove the directory entry from itself 
with a SET FILE/REMOVE command. The files in the directory should be 
accesible again.
