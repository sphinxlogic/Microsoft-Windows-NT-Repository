XRN release 6.18:

- More bug fixes and cleanup than humanly possible
	Jonathan I. Kamens	<jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

- Faster entry into groups with lots of 'marked as unread' articles.	
	Per Hedeland		<per@erix.ericsson.se>

- xrn.ignoreNewsgroups - ability to specify groups (regular expressions)
  that you never want to see (even in the new groups window).  See the
  man page for more information.  This can really cut down the size of your
  .newsrc file and the memory usage of XRN.
	Jonathan I. Kamens	<jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

- XRN now supports _ANSI_C_SOURCE, _POSIX_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE, and other 
  standard-based defines, and thus is less vendor-specific (but clearly some
  still exists...).
	Marc Evans		<evans@zk3.dec.com>

- Support for Motif 1.2 and cleanup of the cancel button
	David Brooks		<dbrooks@osf.org>

- No more claims of X11R3 support.

- Performance Improvements (less fetching across NNTP)
	Jim Graham		<flar@sun.com>

- Permissions of the .newsrc file are not changed - previously after an
    update the .newsrc file would have the permissions specified in the umask
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>

- Settable Icon Pixmap and Name for normal, busy, and unread news modes
    - via the resources/options: iconName, iconPixmap, busyIconName,
				 busyIconPixmap, unreadIconName,
				 unreadIconPixmap
	Michael Salmon		<Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>

- Translation of Articles from ISO 646 to ISO 8859-1
	Michael Salmon		<Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>

- User settable number of characters in the subject line, via
    the indexLineLength resource/option
	Michael Salmon		<Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>

- Support for INN (InterNet News)
	Brendan Kehoe		<brendan@eff.org>

- XRN now can refile to RMAIL folders (use @folder, like MH +folder)
	Michael Thomas		<mike@gordian.com>

- The information box now tells you that articles posted to moderated 
  groups are sent to the moderator.
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>

- Xtoolkit work processes now do the prefetching of the next group
    (can be disabled by defining NO_IMMEDIATE_WORK_PROC_PREFETCH)
	Marc Evans		<evans@zk3.dec.com>
	Jonathan I. Kamens	<jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

- XRN now puts in the display name for editorCommand:
    xrn.editorCommand: xterm -display %D -e vi %s
    (%s for file name - must be specified, %D for display name, 
    this is optional)
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>

- New Default: xrn.onlyShow number
    Only grab the header information for the last 'number' of articles
    in each group.  This is useful if you have been away for a while 
    and only want to see that last 100 or so articles in each group.
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>

- Support for multiple signature files
    The appropriate signature file is the usual signature file name
    `~/.signature' followed by either a `-' and a  newsgroup name
    substring, or followed by a `.' and `followup', `forward', `gripe',
    `reply' or `post' according to the posting mode.  For example if you
    want to post a followup article in comp.sources.x then xrn uses the
    first valid signature file in the following order:

		    ~/.signature-comp.sources.x
		    ~/.signature-comp.sources
		    ~/.signature-comp
		    ~/.signature.followup
		    ~/.signature

	Nathan Maman		<Nathan.Maman@sophia.inria.fr>

- Support for executable signature files.  See 'executableSignatures'
  and 'localSignatures' in the man page.
	Nathan Maman		<Nathan.Maman@sophia.inria.fr>
	David Brooks		<dbrooks@osf.org>
	Jonathan I. Kamens	<jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

- XRN now unconditionally saves articles when posted via `editorCommand'.
        Conrad Kimball	        <cek@sdc.boeing.com>

- Set up defaults for reasonable line folding (of course, it's my definition
	of reasonable).
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>

- Fix for bad newsgroup names
	Per Hedeland		<per@erix.ericsson.se>
	Jonathan I. Kamens	<jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>

- XRN was reading the header information twice when `doing the right thing'
	Per Hedeland		<per@erix.ericsson.se>

- More XRN icons - xrn2.icon (news) and xrn3.icon (no news)
       Rainer Klute		<klute@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>

- Scrolling actions now exist for the subject index window
	    (artScrollIndex and artScrollIndexBack)
	Greg Schroeder		<greg@sharebase.com>
	
- Support for DEC Alpha OSF/1
	Eric Muller		<muller@src.dec.com>
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>
	Dave Hill		<ddhill@aosf.gsf.dec.com>

- Apollo 10.3.5 support
	Keith Cantrell		<kcantrel@core1.hssc.ksc.nasa.gov>

- Amiga-UNIX support
	Craig M. Votava		<ihlpf!cmv>

  data structures (new articles, etc.).
	Rick Spickelmier	<ricks@objy.com>

    When replying via mail to a posting, include or do not include an
    "X-Newsgroups:" line with the newsgroups list from the posting and a

- massive improvements to compose.c
  Jonathan I. Kamens <jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

    Bug							When it occurs
    ----------------------------------------------	-----------------
    When aborting an article or message, no		Always.
    distinction is made between articles and
    messages in the info messages.

    When being asked to confirm sending or		Non-null editorCommand.
    re-editing an article or message, no
    distinction is made between articles and
    messages.

    When posting a message from Newsgroup mode,		Null editorCommand.
    the cursor should be positioned on the
    "Newsgroups:" line of the header because it
    needs to be filled in.

    When posting a message from Article mode, the	Null editorCommand.
    cursor should be positioned on the "Subject:"
    line of the header because it needs to be
    filled in.

    When posting a gripe, there's an extra blank	Always.
    line at the top of the gripe template.

    When posting a gripe, the cursor should be		Null editorCommand.
    positioned at the beginning of the first
    field to be filled in.

    When posting a followup, the signature file		Null editorCommand.
    is not included at the bottom of the message.

    When sending a reply, the signature file is		Null editorCommand.
    not included at the bottom of the message.

    When forwarding a message, the cursor is		Null editorCommand.
    positioned one character too far to the left
    on the "To: " line.

    When including article text in a reply,		Null editorCommand,
    followup or forwarded message, includeCommand	non-null includeCommand.
    is ignored.

    When including the article text in a reply,		Null editorCommand.
    followup or forwarded message, the text is
    included one line at a time and gets inserted
    rather slowly.

    I think that's probably about it.  In addition to the bugs that are
    mentioned above, two other user-visible changes have been made:

    1) The editor command is now executed with the bourne shell, rather than
    the C shell, since that's what people expect commands run from programs
    to be executed with.  This should probably be controllable through an X
    resource, but if it isn't going to be, then sh is a better default than
    csh.  In any case, if someone wants to use csh, they can put "/bin/csh
    -fc ..." in the resource.

    2) The includeCommand resource is now expected to have only *two* %s in
    it, rather than three.  The first is replaced by the prefix, and the
    second is replaced by the article file name.  The filter is expected to
    output to stdout.

- found serious core leaks
  Jim Rees <rees@citi.umich.edu>

- clean up of the XRN man page
  Jonathan I. Kamens <jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

- replyTo works for mail also

  unread

- added support for DOTDIR
  Michael Salmon <Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se>

  Boyd Roberts <boyd@prl.dec.com>

- 'verboseKill: false' now eliminates all messages.

- i386 support
  Jonathan I. Kamens <jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

- includeCommand resources
  Nathan Maman                <sun!mirsa.inria.fr!Nathan.Maman>

  I've added the resource `includeCommand'.  It is a sprintf'able
  string with `%s' arg where the includePrefix and the article file name.

  For example, you can put the following line in your .Xdefaults:

      XRn.includeCommand: xmh-insert-reply -s '%s' %s

- 'P' for printed
  Nathan Maman                <sun!mirsa.inria.fr!Nathan.Maman>

- XRN now detects detects write failures when updating the .newsrc file
  (such as file system full, disk going off-line, etc).

- Works around horrible parsing done in `inews' for the newsgroups line.

- new option: xrn.lockFile, xrn -lockFile
	set the name of the file used for locking multiple XRN runs.
	(use:  xrn -lockFile .xrnlock-sports -newsrcFile .newsrc-sports)

- new option: ccForward resource (with the "CC" class) to cause
  forwarded messages to be CC'd to the author.
	Jonathan I. Kamens <jik@pit-manager.mit.edu>

	to use for finding 'refile'
	Andrew Wason <aw@rruxi.bae.bellcore.com>

- new resource to watching for new news, watchUnread
If the resource is not set or empty, i.e.

XRn*watchUnread:	

then the current behavior applies.  We set it in our XRn file to our
organization group and the "empty" option lets users reset it to "all".

- If you're running 1.5.11 NNTP or better, define NNTP_REREAD_ACTIVE_FILE

  this works that way I was told it does...
    
- Updates to the Motif support
	Mike Yang                   <mikey%eukanuba.wpd@sgi.com

- MOTIF support for the new scrolling buttons
    Mike Yang                   <mikey%eukanuba.wpd@sgi.com

- Modified Action procedure calling:

    Modified the calling sequence for the Action procs so that they pass 
    the other parameters (event, parameters, and count) to the Function 
    procs.  This allows the actions to be able be given strings.  I used 
    this to modify artSaveFunction to save using the given argument. 
    In my case, I modified the app-defaults file so that F6 calls artSave 
    with "| mail dce".  [added '%' in article mode to pipe the article 
    through uudecode - ricks]
    David Elliott               <dce@smsc.sony.com>

- toggle groups changed to List Old and the output is in a new format
    When a group contains only old news, the corresponding line is
    	"       news in misc.misc ..."
    instead of the old (and wrong)
    	"Unread news in misc.misc ..."
    similarly, when a group is totally empty (which is unfrequent), the
    line reads
    	"            in misc.misc ..."
    Marcin Skubiszewski		<skubi@prl.dec.com>

- new button in article mode: list old (artListOld)
    lists all articles available in the group
    Marcin Skubiszewski		<skubi@prl.dec.com>

- new format for "Unread news" lines in newsgroup mode
    	"Unread news in misc.misc          3 articles   + 350 old"
    where "+ 350 old" means that misc.misc contains 350 old messages.
    This count is not always right, but it is right for the newsgroups
    which never expire
	Marcin Skubiszewski <skubi@prl.dec.com>

- new resources: saveString and resetSave.
    saveString sets the default string to go in the Save dialog (the
    default is the empty string, as before), and resetSave affects
    whether or not the SaveString variable gets reset for each newsgroup.
    David Elliott               <dce@smsc.sony.com>

- the default distribution can now be set
  (see DISTRIBUTION and -distribution)

- 'Message-ID' and 'Date' now added to postings and followups
	(drw900@anusf.anu.edu.au)
     - in my opinion, this is really the responsibility of the NNTP
       server and news readers/posters have no business generating 
       these fields...  but there are a few NNTP servers that don't
       do it (or don't spawn an inews that does it)
       GENERATE_EXTRA_FIELDS in config.h turns on the generation of 
       these 2 fields
- got rid of 'Cc: user' on forwards
- new resource (xrn.cc), allows the user to specify if a 'Cc' should
  	be added to a reply.
- newsgroup names can now have '$' in them
	(dgreen@cs.ucla.edu + others)
- "--" now separates signatures and messages when posting



XRN release 6.10:

- usage message can be requested when another xrn is running
	(lock file is not checked until later on)

	popping up the 'cancel search' button
- added another way to specify the senders actual address (RETURN_HOST,

  - insertion point for compose windows now in the right place
  - tabs and new lines can now be in *ButtonList: X resources
  - occasionally xrn would die due to not being able to open
    the newsrc temp file - this has been fixed

  - group names can now be longer than 32 characters
	'hp-factory.software-eng.excalibur' can now be read
  - busy cursor appears all of the times when XRN is busy

    article mode, if the group was empty, you would pop back out
    to all/ng mode, but without any text in the top window
  - control C now aborts a subject search
  - exiting out of All mode had some problems
    (thanks to Rich Simoni <simoni@strat.stanford.edu>)

	addBindings, artBindings, allBindings, ngBindings
  - see the man page for more information

    subject search.  The default is 10

turning off kill file support:
  - for those of you that don't use kill files, the searching 
    for kill files can be turned off.  The kill buttons remain
    if you want to add something to a kill file, but they will
    not be processed.  See the +/-killFiles option.

ngLastGroup changed to ngPrevGroup
  - last group confused some people who thought it meant go to
    the last group displayed in the newsgroup index.

new button in article specific pane: print
  - print an article, uses the 'printCommand' resource/command line option
    (defaults to 'enscript')

new button in composition pane: include file
  - includes a file in a posting - like Meta-I in the text
    widget, but: (1) does not screw up your keyboard bindings,
    and (2) has an accelerator.

including an article now only includes the text (strips the header).
  - this can be changed via the 'includeHeader' option.
  (thanks to Paul Raveling <raveling@isi.edu>)

the .newsrc file can now be automatically updated when leaving article
  mode - see the `updateNewsrc' option.

  (thanks to Frederick M. Avolio (avolio@decuac.dec.com)
  - see config.h

USC ISI app-defaults file for XRN included (isi.app-defaults)
  (thanks to Paul Raveling <raveling@isi.edu>)

'abort' option in the death notifier dialog now dumps core in
the real stack rather than the signal stack (thanks to KJ Pires
<kjpires@ic.Berkeley.EDU).

Compiles with GCC.


XRN release (6.0):

Man page now even better reflects reality.

Much faster startup and rescan.

Can specify the order and number of buttons for each mode via
X resources or the command line: ngButtonList, addButtonList,
allButtonList, artButtonList, artSpecButtonList.

Post button exported to Newsgroup mode so you can post to
  newsgroups with no available articles.

Next Newsgroup works. 

Cleaned up included articles in composition windows

Bug fixes
  - fixed sending articles/messages with editorCommand
     (always would be sent)
  - loss of keybindings after dialog pop up attributed to
    window manager problems (gwm, hpwm, and sometimes twm and mwm).
    Key bindings are not lost when using dxwm, uwm.
    [VERY STRANGE]

Organization field can be defaulted in config.h

New XRN release (5.5):

line eater bug fix


New XRN release (5.4):

Changes from the last release of XRN:

- considerably less memory usage

  XRN uses a very simple data structure for storing information
  about newsgroups and articles.  For every newsgroup, an array
  the size of the number of articles available in that group
  is created.  This causes XRN to grow to 2.5 to 3Meg at most
  sites (at UCB, we have 650 groups and 2 week expiration, and
  XRN groups to 3Meg).  However there is no reason to keep article
  arrays for groups that you are not subscribed to. 

  Bill Webb (IBM AWD Palo Alto, ...!uunet!ibmsupt!webb) sent in a
  set of patches to have XRN only create article arrays for subscribed
  to groups.  This decreases the memory from 3Meg to 900k (for us).
  The amount you save will depend on what percentage of the newsgroups
  that you subscribe to.

- better nntp server error messages (sq)

  The messages XRN gives to the user for NNTP failures don't give
  you much information.   Ian Darwin (ian@sq.sq.com) sent in a set
  of patches to improve the error messages.

- alternative newsrcfile location (uiuc)

  Many people like to have xrn look for a newsrc file based on the
  particular server being used.  Dirk Grunwald (grunwald@flute.cs.uiuc.edu)
  sent in a set of patches to cause xrn to look for a newsrc file
  of the form <newsrcFile>-<nntpServer> before looking for just
  <newsrcFile>.

- includeSep

  A new Xdefault has been added to get rid of the "> " characters
  put in front of included messages.  Xdefault:
	
	    includeSep: on/off

  Command Line:

	    +/-includeSep

- header lines are no longer broken

  The last release included code to break long lines in news postings
  to reasonable values.  Unfortunately it would also break header
  lines (which is not allowed).  This version does not break the lines.

- updated man page

  The man page has been updated to reflect the current state of XRN.

- double click

  [note: this feature has not been added to the man page - it still
  has some problems]

  Double clicking on a newgroup entry will send you to the group.
  Double clicking on an article entry will display the article.
