Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.92 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components of the package (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32
systems.

Noticeable changes:

* Implemented separable CMYK PostScript output (the -level1sep switch
  to pdftops).
* Implemented Pattern color spaces with tiling patterns (polygon fills
  only).
* Implemented Stamp annotations.
* Implemented Named link actions.
* Fixed a really dumb bug in the TrueColor code in SFont (which
  affects both Type 1 and TrueType font rendering on 16-bit
  displays).
* Print a warning about Type 3 fonts (XOutputDev, PSOutputDev).
* Added CNS (Big5) Chinese font support (CHINESE_CNS_SUPPORT); renamed
  CHINESE_SUPPORT to CHINESE_GB_SUPPORT.
* Added Big5 support to pdftotext (with CHINESE_CNS_SUPPORT enabled).
* Fix an endianness problem in the Type 1 font code which resulted in
  an incorrect display with "-t1lib plain" on big-endian systems.
* Added "-title" switch and "xpdf.title" resource to set the window
  title.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
the incoming directory, but they will be moved to:

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X
