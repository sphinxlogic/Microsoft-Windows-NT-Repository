
Changes made between V1.93 FT1 and FT2:

1) Implemented Unix-style "shlock" locking mechanism.
Date:		10-Nov-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko

Unix code called only three of the
shlock routines - shlock (only called twice) and lopen and lclose (called all
over).

Originally wanted to rewrite shlock routines to use Perl 'C' extension which
used the VMS lock manager. However I ran into so many road blocks in trying to
code a Perl extension for VMS Perl that I gave up (temporarily at least). So, I
coded the shlock routines in a similar fashion to the way the were done on Unix.
To get a lock try to create a file. If we can create the file then we have
the lock, otherwise we don't.

The method used by the Unix version of the code to detect invalid locks was not
valid for VMS. Invalid locks are detected differently in the VMS code. (An
invalid lock occurs when the lock file is created and the process dies and
forgets to delete the lock file.) Any process that has a shlock lock leaves the
lock file open as long as it has the lock. Any process that is trying to get the
lock tries to create the lock file first and then, if it cannot create the lock
file, tries to unlink (ie. delete) the lock file. If the lock is "valid" then
the unlink call will get "file locked by another user". If the unlink works then
we know that no process had the file open so the lock was invalid. At this point
we try to create the lock file again.

Changes made for V1.93 FT3:

2) Perl scripts do SET FORWARD/USER commands referencing Majordomo logicals
Date:		18-Nov-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	CREATE-LIST and CREATE-MAJORDOMO-FWD

CREATE-LIST and CREATE-MAJORDOMO-FWD now use the logical name UCX$MAJORDOMO_HOME
in the value for the SET FORWARD strings rather than the equivalence name of
UCX$MAJORDOMO_HOME.

3) Reference UCX$MAJORDOMO_HOME logical in *.COM
Date:		18-Nov-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO.COM, RESEND.COM and REQUEST-ANSWER.COM

The .COM files weren't looking for the Perl scripts in UCX$MAJORDOMO_HOME. Now
they are.

4) Send "list owner info" to list owner when creating new list + misc
Date:		20-Nov-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	CHANGE-LIST, CREATE-LIST, MAJORDOMO-UTIL.PL, CONFIG_PARSE.PL
Files added:	VMS-LIST-OWNER-INFO.TXT

Each time a new list is created the list owner(s) will receive an email
containing the list name and passwd, et. and some information on being a list
owner.

Took out some temporary debug stuff in config_parse.pl that made it into CMS by
mistake

5) Support for digests
Date:		20-Nov-1996 - 3-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	4-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO, RESEND, CHANGE-LIST., CREATE-LIST.,
                MAJORDOMO-UTIL.PL, MAJORDOMO.CF_TEMPLATE, MAJORDOMO.PL, RESEND.,
                UCX$MAJORDOMO_SYSTARTUP.TEMPLATE, VMS-LIST-OWNER-INFO.TXT,
Files added:	DIGEST, DIGEST.COM

-  resend script
   -  After sending mail to list we send to the digest if defined.
   -  Hijacked command line "-d" option to hold name of digest if any. The Unix
   style Majordomo debug option (which was formerly set by the command line "-d"
   option) may still be set from the list's config file which is the prefered
   method anyway.

-  digest script
   -  Initial port

-  majordomo script
   -  Initial port of the mkdigest routine.

-  CHANGE-LIST., CREATE-LIST. ,MAJORDOMO-UTIL.PL, MAJORDOMO.PL
   - Support for creation of list with digest

-  VMS-LIST-OWNER-INFO.TXT
   -  give example of mkdigest command

6) Handle different requirements for SET FORWARD and double quotes
Date:		26-Nov-1996
Date into CMS:	4-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO-UTIL.PL, CREATE-MAJORDOMO-FWD

Newer versions of VMS mail parse double quotes using a new method for allowing
nested double quotes. This means that in order to get the correct forwards into
VMS mail the triple double quotes that have been in use for years are not
needed. The routines in MAJORDOMO-UTIL.PL that write the VMS mail SET FORWARD
commands to the .COM file were updated to call a new routine that detects which
address parsing scheme the installed version of VMS is using. This way the
scripts can be used transparently on either version of VMS. The same is true for
the routine in CREATE-MAJORDOMO-FWD that sets up *MAJOROMO* forwarding.

7) Take out old diagnostic SHOW commands from *.com
Date:		3-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	4-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	DIGEST.COM, MAJORDOMO.COM, REQUEST-ANSWER.COM, RESEND.COM

Took out SHOW LOGICAL, etc. commands.

8) Fix bug in shlock.pl that caused stray lock file.
Date:		25-Nov-1996
Date into CMS:	4-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	SHLOCK.PL

If lock was attained but file couldn't be opened (say it wasn't there) then the
lock file would never be deleted.

9) Cleanup temporary .NEW file in do_unsubscribe
  
Date:		5-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	9-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO

In majordomo's do_unsubscribe routine the .NEW file we were riting to wasn't
getting cleaned up as well as it could. If an error occured a .NEW file would be
left and subsequent threads wouldn't clean it up. Now a subsequent will clean
up.

10) Add new public routines to shlock code
Date:		6-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	9-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	SHLOCK.PL

Added new routines shlock_with_retry, shlock_release and shlock_lockfile
   -  shlock_with_retry
      Gets a lock on a resource with retry built in. (With regular shlock
      the caller must implement the retry.)
   -  shlock_release
      Releases a lock attained with shlock_with_retry or shlock.
   -  shlock_lockfile
      Converts a filename to a "resource name" (ie a lockfile name) to pass to
      shlock or shlock_with_retry routines.

Made lopen and lclose call shlock_release and shlock_lockfile where appropriate.

11) Fix bug where shlock called but status not checked.
  
Date:		6-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	9-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO and CONFIG_PARSE.PL

In one spot each in the majordomo and the config_parse.pl scripts there was a
call to shlock that didn't even check to see if the lock was granted and if not
retry. I asked the Unix Majordomo workers if this was a bug and they confirmed
that it was. I changed the code to call the new shlock_with_retry mechanism so
the lock retry is done automatically.

12) Remove some old diagnostics that are no longer needed from majordomo.pl
  
Date:		6-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	9-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO.PL

********************************************************************************
Changes made for V1.93 FT4:
13) Fix bug in lists command handling of advertise/noadvertise
  
Date:		11-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	12-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO.

The advertise and noadvertise configuration items are regexp's used by the LISTS
command (majordomo scripts do_lists routine). The existing code didn't work on
newer versions of Perl that expect '@' to be preceded with a \ inside a quoted
string. Changed code to prefix the '@' with '\' in the address being matched
against the advertise and noadvertise regexp's.

14) Headers of messages bounced by Majordomo not right
  
Date:		11-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	12-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	RESEND.

One problem was typo in file handle of print statement. The other was not
calling ParseVMSMailHeader after seeking back to the beginning of the input
file. 

15) Port "approve" script
  
Date:		10-Dec-1996 - 12-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	12-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	MAJORDOMO.PL
Files added:	APPROVE

-  Change majordomo.pl's RetMailAddr routine to recognize Return-Path as a valid
reply_to if the other headers it wants aren't there. Needed because the way the
approve script works that's the only from header we get.

-  Initial port of approve script

16) Stray .out file left when Majordomo bounces message
  
Date:		12-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	12-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	RESEND.

bounce routine was unlink temp files correctly but since we still had an open
write channel to the .OUT file unlink wasn't working. Solution is to close OUT.

17) shlock routine can't handle lock filename with version number 
  
Date:		13-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	13-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	SHLOCK.PL

Fix it. Change ';' to '_'. Now a specific version of a file can be locked if
need be.

18) Support "get" and "index" command for archives

Date:		13-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	13-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	majordomo., majordomo.pl, majordomo.cf_template

Initial support. Too many changes to mention.

19) Add vmshelp command

Date:		16-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	18-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	majordomo
Files added:	VMS-USER-INFO.TXT

Added new majordomo command vmshelp to give supplementary help for VMS
Majordomo. The help is contained in the new file VMS-USER-INFO.TXT which lives
in UCX$MAJORDOMO_HOME. The majordomo script just opens it and reads it.

20) Add pointer to DECnet majordomo server mail address in help.

Date:		17-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	18-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	majordomo, majordomo.pl

In help command text also give users who want to use DECnet mail to VMS
Majordomo the DECnet address of the VMS Majordomo server.

21) Make approve script tell you each file it's working on.

Date:		17-Dec-1996
Date into CMS:	18-Dec-1996
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	approve

Add trivial print statement.


22) Approve script only work if set def'd to UCX$MAJORDOMO_HOME

Date into CMS:	27-Jan-1997
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	approve

Re-arrange "require" statements so they're executed after we pull in
majordomo.cf and add $homedir to @INC


23) Don't die if VMS mail SET [NO]FORWARD .COM file incurs errors

Date into CMS:	??-???-????
Engineer:	Karol Zielonko
Files changed:	majordomo-util.pl, delete-list.

After we execute the .COM file to do the SET FORWARD or SET NOFORWARD for a list
do not exit if we get an error. The most likely cause of the error will be that
we hit the 32 character limit for VMS mail alias entries. Just continue since
most of the time the list will work anyway.
