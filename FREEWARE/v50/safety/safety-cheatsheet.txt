1. Install Safety:
$ @sys$update:vmsinstal safety015 disk:[somewhere-where-the-kit-is]

Answer the questions honestly. (Don't tell it you can get to internet
generally; it just tries to mail a notice. I don't need it.)

2. Post installation:

$set def sys$manager
$@jt_setup

answer the questions. See documents in the kit or built-in help
for help. You select the functions, and which disks Safety will
work on. Note that Safety can use one daemon for one or more
disks. If the same selections apply to several disks this saves
processes (small ones!) by using one daemon per. Otherwise you
can have what you need.

Then cause systartup_vms.com to have

$@sys$manager:sdh_startup

in it and cause sylogin.com to have

$@sys$manager:sdh_login

in it.

You can stop Safety by sending a $forcex to the daemon.
This takes privs but is there for convenience.

Look at symbol defs in the sdh_login script to see what
commands you use.

Also use the space making setup script before starting for the
first time. A reboot is NOT needed.
