S/Key is a login authentication method, using one-time key generation
in response to a "challenge".  The S/Key system is described in
RFC-1760 and RFC-1938.

The advantage of one-time keys is that such techniques as "packet
sniffing" cannot be used: each login requires a different key that is
derived in a secure fashion from a secret key that is never
transmitted during an authentication session.

Unlike Kerberos, S/Key does not require modification or special
versions of client programs such as Telnet, FTP, etc., and generally
it does not require connections to be made on special port numbers.

An example of an S/Key login:

    MyVAX [myvax.nowhere.null] VMS V6.2

    Username: JOE
    otp-md5 323 mno834                         <- S/Key challenge
    Password: ORB PO WAYS INTO JOLT BESS       <- S/Key one time password

            Welcome to MyVAX
            ...

S/Key one-time passwords may be generated on a secure PC or workstation,
or via the S/Key for VMS software.  While one may wish to calculate
S/Key passwords "on the fly" for each login, one may also print out a list
of one-time passwords that you can use when a calculator is not available.

Because S/Key for VMS provides authentication service that bypasses the
normal VMS authentication, you should be sure that the installation
savesets have not been tampered with.  Please note that this file is
