 Package Name:   WATCHDOG V2.0-2
     Category:   SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT
  Description:   OpenVMS events monitor with system manager alerts triggering

This demonstration will invoke the interactive monitor utility provided with 
WATCHDOG.  Simulated watchdog processing is generated by this demo, and the
results will be displayed by the monitor on your video terminal screen.

No actual WATCHDOG will run, and no alerts will be generated.  The problems
the monitor will display are not real, but rather, they are shown to provide
a sampling of the real time functions and alerts that WATCHDOG can perform on
your systems.
