GHOSTSCRIPT,UTILITIES,Postscript and PDF interpreter for OpenVMS

An interpreter for the PostScript language and the Adobe Portable
Document Format (PDF -- sometimes confused with Acrobat, Adobe's PDF
browser and editor product);

Input modules (utilities) for reading a variety of raster formats,
including CMYK, GIF, JFIF (JPEG), MIFF, PBM/PGM/PPM, and PCX;  Output
modules (drivers) for a wide variety of window systems (including X
Windows and Microsoft Windows), raster file formats, and printers, as
well as a PDF output module that implements functions similar to
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product; and

The Ghostscript library, a set of procedures to implement the
graphics and filtering capabilities that are primitive operations in
the PostScript language and in PDF.

In simple terms, this means that Ghostscript can read a PostScript or
PDF file and display the results on the screen or convert them into a
form you can print on a non-PostScript printer. Especially together
with several popular previewers, with Ghostscript you can view or
print an entire document or even isolated pages, even if your
computer doesn't have Display PostScript and your printer doesn't
handle PostScript itself.
