					F$MATCH
					-------

	MUST be invoked via a foreign command

		f$matc*h == "$wmc_library:f$match"

	f$match(candidate,pattern)

	candidate if the string to check against the pattern
	pattern is the string with the wildcards

	the parameters can be quoted strings or symbol names
	if the parameters are not quoted strings, an attempt will be made
	to evaluate the string as a symbol and it will fail
	do not use single quotes for symbol evaluation

	examples
	the following will NOT succeed

		$ f$match ('candidate','pattern')

	the following will work

		candidate = "abcdefeg"
		pattern = "ab*"

		$ f$match (candidate,pattern)
		$ f$match ("abshdgey",pattern)
		$ f$match (candidate, "*eg")
		$ f$match ("''candidate'", pattern)
