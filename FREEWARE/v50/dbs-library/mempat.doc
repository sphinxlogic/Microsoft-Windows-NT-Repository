	_Base address?

	enable write
	disable write

	expression=		evaluate expression and display result
				,address not changed

	Reset stack
	Zero base address	use current address as the value for Z

	.		current address
	q		last displayed value (contents)
	z		current zero base value

	%Xvalue		use hexadecimal radix (the default)
	%Dvalue		use decimal radix
	%Ovalue		use octal radix
	%Bvalue		use binary radix

	+		addition	}
	-		subtraction	} all operations are on unsigned
	*		multiplication	} longword integers
	/		division	}

	_		logical NOT
	!		logical OR
	&		logical AND
	#		logical XOR
