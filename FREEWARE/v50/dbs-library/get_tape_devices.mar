; Version:	X1-003
;
; Facility:	General Utilities.
;
; Abstract:	This program will use the device scan system service to find
;		all tape class devices on the system and then create logical
;		names that can be used to reference them.  An attempt is made
;		to delete any existing logical names that match the format
;		used by this program.
;		Logical names are in the format TAPE_DEVICE_n where n is a
;		number from 1 to the number of tape devices found.
;
; Environment:	User mode.
