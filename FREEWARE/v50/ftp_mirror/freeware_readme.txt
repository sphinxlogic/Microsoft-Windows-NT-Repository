--------------------
FTP_MIRROR is a DCL command procedure that can be used to set up a local
"mirror" of a remote FTP site.  It automatically detects when new or updated
files are placed on the remote system and will FTP them to the local system.

Due to the different commands used by FTP Clients, only a few FTP Clients are 
supported.  Due to the different output generated by different FTP Servers,
parsing routines have only been written for a few FTP Servers.

  o one of the following FTP Clients (on your system):
      - MultiNet 
      - MadGoat FTP
      - TCPware

  o mirrored against one of the following FTP Servers (on the remote system):
      - MultiNet
      - MadGoat FTP
      - TCPware
      - UCX (Compaq TCP/IP Services)
      - Unix

Limitations

  - Does not detect when a file has been deleted from the remote site

  - Starting with release 17, the procedure uses a lot of DCL symbols if it
    needs to keep track of symbolic links.  This may cause you to run out
    of space for symbols (DCL_W_SYMOVF).  In this event, you may do one of
    three things:

    1.	Increase the number of CTLPAGES allocated for each process (use AUTOGEN)
	and set MIN_CTLPAGES to some "large" number.

    2.	Break the transfer into more than one job (which may result in
	duplicating some data).

    3.	Set DEREFERENCE_LINKS to NO.
