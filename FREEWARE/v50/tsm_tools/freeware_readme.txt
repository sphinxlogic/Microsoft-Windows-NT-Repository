TSM_UTILS, SOFTWARE, Command files for use with TSM

The GET_MY_SERVER_SETUP.COM is a modified version of the
GET_SERVER_SETUP.COM that shipped with the Terminal
Server Manager (TSM) product.

The modifications allow it to save services defined on
the server, and also to save parameters LANTRONIX
EPS-1 terminal servers.

Please note that the command file does not save the
LAT license key on a LANTRONIX terminal server.


The UPLOAD_ALL_SERVERS.COM will go through the TSM
database and call GET_MY_SERVER_SETUP.COM to save their
parameters.
