TIN, UTILITIES, A Usenet news reader
TIN is a full-screen easy to use Usenet newsreader.  It can read news locally
(i.e., /var/spool/news) or remotely (rtin or tin -r option) via a NNTP (Network
News Transport Protocol) server.  It will automatically utilize NOV (News
OVerview) style index files if available locally or via the NNTP XOVER command.

This is an update of the most recent VMS port by Michael Stenns in 1998, using
SOCKETSHR, to TIN version 1.4.4
