For this cdrom, I tested/updated using accounts provided by Charles
Sandman and Jerry Leslie (VAX with OpenVMS 6.1), as well as the DECUS server
eisner.decus.org (Alpha with OpenVMS 7.2-1).

For other system configurations, you'll need a C compiler (I've tested with
DEC-C) and MMS (or its clone, MMK).  The library builds with NETLIB and UCX.

There are detailed build and install instructions in the sources (README.TXT).
