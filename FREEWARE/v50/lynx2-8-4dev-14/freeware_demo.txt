For this cdrom, I tested/updated using accounts provided by Charles
Sandman and Jerry Leslie (VAX with OpenVMS 6.1), as well as the DECUS server
eisner.decus.org (Alpha with OpenVMS 7.2-1).

There are two executables which have been built for the cdrom.  Both are
linked with UCX 4.1, and are zip'd in files named according to the
platform:

	axp_lynx.zip
		Alpha

	vax_lynx.zip
		VAX

You can unpack them with INFO-ZIP (unzip), which should also be on the
cdrom.

You should read the INSTALLATION file from the source distribution.  But
just to see things run, this is the minimum you have to do:

	+ define a logical variable LYNX_DIR

	+ copy lynx.cfg from the source distribution to LYNX_DIR:lynx.cfg

	+ define a foreign command to point to the executable, e.g.,
	  (assuming you have unzip'd the executable in your login
	  directory):

		lynx :== "$ sys$login:lynx.exe"

	+ run it (to test) on the current directory:

		lynx []

	  To run it over the network, of course, you'll need a network
	  connection.

But read the INSTALLATION file for more details.
