ALPHAPATCH, MISCELLANEOUS, Making VAX PATCH run on Alpha

  Copyright ©1999, TECSys Development, Inc.

  Have you ever been puzzled by the absence of PATCH/ABSOLUTE on the alpha?
  Since we don't actually have a 'patch' for alpha, the next best thing would
  be to VEST vax patch to the alpha. Unfortunately, this is not exactly as
  easy as it sounds.

  This article shows how to make it happen....

BISON, UTILITIES, GNU bison -- parser generator (alternative to yacc)

aug-1995 Sheldon Bishov, Compaq
feb-2000 revised

The source for files was Free Software Foundation, ftp from
anonymous@prep.ai.mit.edu

MMS (Module Management System) is the easiest way to rebuild the tool
since there is already a DESCRIP.MMS file provided.  To rebuild, simply
$ SET DEFAULT to the directory where you unzipped the source files,
then type  $ MMS and press return.

To (optionally) load help into user library, set default to the source
directory and enter the following commands:
    $ library/help/create bison.hlb
    $ library bison.hlb/help bison.hlp
    $ @install_help bison.hlb

Other requirements for installation:

Assign a rooted directory logical gnu_bison; for example,

$ assign /trans=concealed WORK215:[TOOLS.BISON-A2_3.] gnu_bison

Either build bison.exe using the information in *readme*.* and install.;
files, or use the version from the [.VAX] or [.ALPHA] subdirectory.
Move the .exe file to the gnu_bison:[000000] directory. Then be sure to
move a copy of the file bison.simple and (for VAX only) vmshlp.obj to
this same directory.  Note that the VAX version was built under OpenVMS
V6.1, the Alpha version under OpenVMS V6.2.

If you use a name for the executable file other than bison.exe, edit
the bison.cld file.  For example if you want to use the name bison.exe_vax,
change the "IMAGE" line to:
        IMAGE   GNU_BISON:[000000]BISON.EXE_VAX

Read other *readme*.* files, and install.; for further installation
instructions.

To process bison input files, and compile the code generated by bison,
you can use build-bison.com.  P1 is the name of the file, without the
.bison or other extension.  A sample input file, calc.bison, is provided
in the source directory.  When built it functions as a simple
(non-graphical) calculator.

The DCL command,
 $ set command bison
should be executed to update the DCL tables using bison.cld prior to
executing build-bison.com.


Following changes in code:

build.com: Update cc_option

build-bison.com: New procedure, makes easier build of .exe using bison

install_help.com: new procedure for optional installation of help file.

vmsgetargs.c: Remove redundant extern int declarations

DISK$FREEWARE50_1:[BOOTSYNC]FREEWARE_README.TXT;2
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
BOOTSYNC, UTILITIES, Cluster Satellite Bootstrap Sequencer

The purpose of BOOTSYNC is to prevent too many satellite systems from trying
to boot at the same time.

The theory of BOOTSYNC is to run this program as early in the system startup 
as is reasonable; in SYCONFIG, early in SYSTARTUP, or in SYLOGICALS.  The 
program will use the lock manager to synchronize with other copies of itself 
running on other systems in the cluster.

Some logical names can be defined to control BOOTSYNC:

BOOTSYNC$COUNT	(Required) Count of the number of systems to boot at the
		same time.  (Maximum of 32, controlled by a literal.)

BOOTSYNC$NAME	(Optional) Arbitrary string to be added to the resource
		name for the lock manager (usually use boot node name).
		Clusters with more than one boot node can allow each boot
		node to boot the specified number of systems.

BOOTSYNC$RUN	(For debugging) If defined (as anything) force BOOTSYNC
		to run.  Normally, BOOTSYNC will not run unless all the
		following are true:
		· process name is STARTUP (AUTOGEN executes SYCONFIG, which
		  may execute BOOTSYNC)
		· system is a satellite (votes = 0, member of cluster)
		If BOOTSYNC decides not to run, it exits taking no action.
		These tests allow BOOTSYNC to be run as part of a common
		system startup.

Installation instructions:

1.  Place BOOTSYNC.EXE in SYS$MANAGER:, or any other location.
2.  Decide where in the system startup to run BOOTSYNC.
    Recommendation:  SYCONFIG.COM
    Alternatives:    SYSTARTUP_V5.COM, SYLOGICALS.COM
3.  Decide how many systems may boot at the same time.
    Recommendation:  6 to 8 per boot node is a reasonable start.
4.  Insert something like the following into the file you picked in step 2:
	$ DEFINE BOOTSYNC$COUNT 6
	$ DEFINE BOOTSYNC$NAME 'F$GETDVI("SYS$SYSDEVICE","HOST_NAME")
	$ RUN SYS$MANAGER:BOOTSYNC

Building instructions:

BOOTSYNC is in 2 modules, BOOTSYNC.BLI (Bliss) and HANDLER.MAR (Macro32
kernel-mode code for VAX).  Compile the modules, and link them.

HANDLER.MAR may or may not bugcheck the system, and may not be immediately
portable over to OpenVMS Alpha without requiring code modifications.

BYACC, UTILITIES, Parser generator
Yacc reads the grammar specification in the file filename and generates an
LR(1) parser for it.  The parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) parsing tables
and a driver routine written in the C programming language.  Yacc normally
writes the parse tables and the driver routine to the file y_tab.c

This is a port of Berkeley yacc (BYACC) to OpenVMS.  The code has been changed
from K&R form to ANSI C, and generates ANSI C.

CircleMUD, GAMES, Multi-user Dungeon Game

"CircleMUD is a multi-user dungeon game system (MUD) written by Jeremy Elson,
originally at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science (I
graduated in May of 1996). CircleMUD is a derivative of DikuMUD Gamma 0.0, which
was written in 1990 at DIKU, the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Copenhagen, by Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen, Hans Henrik Staerfeldt,
Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer. 

A MUD (Multiple User Dimension or Multiple User Dungeon) is a computer program
which allows Internet users from around the world to connect to it, create
fictional characters for themselves, and then interact with other real users as
well as computer-generated entities in a virtual environment. Users can explore
their virtual world, talk to or perform actions with other human players, roam
through dangerous monster-infested areas, solve puzzles, and seek treasures.
DikuMUD is a particular class of MUD which tends to be combat-oriented with a
look and feel similar to some (non-computerized) role-playing games. CircleMUD
is a derivative of DikuMUD. While Circle still retains the "look and feel" of
the original DikuMUD, it has dozens of additional features and bug fixes, and
much of the code has been rewritten to be more flexible, efficient, easy to
understand, and easy to extend. 

CircleMUD is freeware! You can download all of Circle's source code, libraries
and documentation absolutely free. The code compiles under most versions of UNIX
(including Solaris, SunOS 4.x, Ultrix, Linux, AIX, and HP/UX), Microsoft Windows
(Windows 95 and Windows NT), IBM OS/2, Mac System 7/8, OpenVMS, and the Amiga."

CVTLIS, UTILITIES, Convert .LIS files back to source files

                                 CVTLIS V3.4
                   Copyright © 1994,1999, Hunter Goatley.
                            All rights reserved.

CVTLIS converts .LIS files from the VMS Source Listings on CD back to the
appropriate source files.  The following file types are recognized:

	Language	Type		Output file type
	---------	----		----------------
	MACRO-32	(VAX)		.MAR
	AMACRO-32	(Alpha)		.MAR
	BLISS-32	(VAX)		.B32
	BLISS-32E	(Alpha)		.B32E
	BLISS-64	(Alpha)		.B64
	MACRO-64	(Alpha)		.M64
	VAX C		(VAX)		.C
	DEC C		(VAX/Alpha)	.C
	SDL		(VAX/Alpha)	.SDL
	CDU		(VAX/Alpha)	.CLD
	MESSAGE		(VAX/Alpha)	.MSG
	VAX PL/I	(VAX)		.PLI
	DEC PL/I	(Alpha)		.PLI
	VAX Pascal	(VAX)		.PAS
	DEC Pascal	(VAX/Alpha)	.PAS

CVTLIS is written in BLISS and will compile and run on both OpenVMS VAX
and OpenVMS Alpha.

CVTLIS is highly dependent on the .LIS format produced for the source
listings CDs.  Fortunately, most of the VMS programmers follow rigorous
source code formats, so this program will successfully convert most
listing files.

To build an executable, either execute @LINK.COM or go to the [.SOURCE]
subdirectory and rebuild it using MMK.

To use CVTLIS, define a foreign symbol to run the program and supply a
.LIS file name on the command line:

	$ cvtlis :== $dev:[dir]cvtlis.exe
	$ cvtlis [v61.dcl]recallsub.lis

DCLHolidays, SYSTEM_MGMT, Calculation of holidays in OpenVMS DCL

The sample DCL procedure HOLIDAYS.COM uses a special form auf the
Gaussian Easter Algorithm (see reference in the procedure itself) to
calculate the date of Easter sunday and from there the dates of other
holidays depending on it. Included is the handling of holidays with
fixed dates, christmas for example.

This procedure has been written in Germany with respect to the local
holidays; it may and will require some modifications for other
countries. It uses _only_ DCL and _no_ other programming language so
it can be used on any OpenVMS system without a need for a separate
compiler and its license.

This procedure may be usefull if backup or similar operations have to
be skipped on such days. (No operator available to handle tape
cartridges, for example.)

Usage: Include the "check_date" subroutine in your main procedure,
call it with the date to be checked as a parameter (OpenVMS absolute
date format) and evaluate the value of the symbol(s) $STATUS and/or
$SEVERITY. The possible return codes are listed in the subroutine
itself.

FORMAT

        DCL_CHECK  is  a  DCL  command  procedure.   It is executed by the
        following DCL command:

            $ @[<disk>:][<directory>]DCL_CHECK.COM [<input> [<list>]]
            $ @[<disk>:][<directory>]DCL_CHECK.COM HELP [<topic>...]

        <disk>  and/or  <directory>  may  be omitted; the current defaults
        will be used.

        The   file   DCL_CHECK.HLB  must  be  in  the  same  directory  as
        DCL_CHECK.COM if you use the HELP function in DCL_CHECK. The files
        may be in any directory to which you have read access.

        If  you  use DCL_CHECK frequently, you may wish to assign a symbol
        in your LOGIN.COM file to execute DCL_CHECK.  For example, if  the
        DCL_CHECK.COM  and  .HLB files are in you LOGIN default directory,
        you might put the following in your LOGIN.COM:

Modifications

        You  can  modify  or  "customize" DCL_CHECK by editing the command
        procedure, DCL_CHECK.COM. However, DCL_CHECK.COM is a "compressed"
        version  of  the  procedure.   To  save  disk  space  and  improve
        performance,  all  comments  and  unnecessary  spacing  have  been
        removed  from  DCL_CHECK.COM.  This makes it difficult to read and
        understand the procedure.

        It  should  be  much easier to edit the file DCL_CHECK.COM_SOURCE,
        which contains commands  and  is  formatted  to  facilitate  human
        reading.   You can re-create a "compressed" version of the command
        procedure by using DCL_DIET.COM.

SPELL, UTILITIES, DECspell for OpenVMS Alpha

Unsupported DECspell kit for OpenVMS Alpha Systems

  This kit contains an unsupported kit and documentation that provides
  DECspell for OpenVMS Alpha systems -- this is a port of the former
  DECspell kit for OpenVMS VAX, a package that is itself no longer 
  supported.  This port looks and works similar to the VAX kit.

  Installation instructions (in HTML form) are in:

    DECSPELL_INSTALL.HTML

  The product installation kit (installed via VMSINSTAL) is:

    SPLAXP015.A

  Limitations:

     o The Houghton-Mifflin copyrights...

     o There is absolutely no support for this...

     o If this does not work, you are entirely on your own...

  FTP Warning:

    When a BACKUP saveset kit is transfered via FTP, you may (will?) 
    need to reset the OpenVMS file attributes via a tool such as:

      RESET_BACKUP_SAVESET_ATTRIBUTES.COM

    This tool is available on the OpenVMS Freeware distribution.

REMDECW, SOFTWARE, Remote DECwindows Application launching

These command files allow you to add menu items to a FileView
or Session Manager Menu that allow access to remote systems.

The advantage of these routines is that you can use them on a
FileView session that is running on a different host than
your X-Server display to launch programs on a third or more
hosts.

This is quite useful when your X-11 Server is not running on an
OpenVMS host.

When they are configured as a Session Manager or FileView
menu option with the "[] ..." option, they will bring
up dialog boxes to prompt for information that they
need.  The last entered values will be displayed.

For best results, use with DECNET and TCPIP proxies.

For non proxied systems, they will cache the username and
password internally to the FileView/Session manager
session.

Caveats:

1. They use undocumented logical names for deciphering the
   return IP address.

2. They are using VUE$* dcl routines that I have not found
   documented anywhere.

3. They have only been used where UCX or TCPIP in use and
   probably will need modifications to use any other
   TCP/IP program.

4. They are normally used with DECNET so use with TCPIP
   versions prior to 5.1 may have some unknown bugs.

The author will probably eventually respond to mail left
at either wb8tyw@qsl.net or malmberg@eisner.decus.org

DECxterm, UTILITIES, xterm key remapping (for use on UNIX Systems)

The procedure remaps the Sun Keyboard, IBM AIX PC type Keyboard, Linux PC type 
Keyboard and Tru64 Compaq Unix keyboards to mappings suitable for VMS
This program is designed to run on a Unix machine, create a terminal emulator
with VMS keyboard mappings and then telnet to a VMS machine.

USAGE: DECxterm [-option ...]
          which are identical to xterm. "#man xterm" for further details
   eg: DECxterm -e telnet yakka.ali.dec.com

Note 1: All keys in the same position are mapped to the standard
  VMS LKxxx ikeyboard except for the keys between the main keyboard
  keys and the Numeric/Application keys which remain as labelled.
  The keys on an DEC LKxxx Keyboard are marked on other keyboards as:-
  Find marked Home, Insert marked the same, Remove marked Delete,
  Select marked End, Previous marked Page-Up and Next marked Page-Down.

Note 2: Shift/F1 to Shift/F10 are mapped to F11 to F20

Note 3: Other Terminal Emulators such as dtterm or dxterm can be used
  by setting the variable DECXTERM_EMULATOR. The default is xterm.

Note 4: The default xterm qualiers are defined by the variable
  DECXTERM_OPTIONS and are set to:-
   -fn 9X15   Default font
   -sb        Enable scroll bars
   -sl 500    Number of lines saved that are scrolled off the top of window
   -cr red    Set the cursor color to red
   -tn vt100  Set the terminal type to vt100
   -132       Allow switching between 80 and 132 columns
  The default settings can be changed by defining this environment
  variable before running DECxterm.

xterm_options="${DECXTERM_OPTIONS:=-fn 9X15 -sb -sl 500 -cr red -tn vt100 -132}"

Note 5: To modify this program or to add further keyboard mappings edit out
  the C code from within DECxterm and follow the procedures documented in 
  DECxterm.

DQDRIVER, SOFTWARE, IDE/ATAPI Disk Driver Example for OpenVMS Alpha

    DQDRIVER is an IDE disk driver for OpenVMS Alpha.  The driver was 
    originally written and tested on an add-in IDE controller board as well
    as the on-board IDE controller found on the AlphaStation 400 4/233.  

    The driver has been substantially revised to include ATAPI CD-ROM
    support.  In addition, the driver has been incorporated in OpenVMS
    Alpha and is supported on recent 21264 (EV6) based platforms.

    A recent enhancement to DQDRIVER is the inclusion of the IO$_DIAGNOSE
    interface which can be used for CD-ROM audio, or potentially other
    unique ATAPI devices, such as CD-RW.  This enhancement is expected to
    be included in future OpenVMS Alpha releases and in future update
    patch kit for V7.1-2 and V7.2-1.

    The driver is provided as an example, and as with any hardware based
    tools, you should use at your own risk.  The latest version of the
    source code is provide here to update previous release of the code and
    to provide immediate access to CD-ROM audio support.  The driver can be 
    used in an unsupported fashion to access CD-ROM audio until official
    patch kits or new release are available with the new version of the
    driver. 

    A new version of DECW$CDPLAYER been included in the kit.  This version
    contains enhancements for ATAPI CD-ROM audio support via the new
    IO$_DIAGNOSE interface in DQDRIVER.  The new version of the CD player
    can be used to play CD-ROM audio from either ATAPI or SCSI CD-ROM
    drives.  The new version of DECW$CDPLAYER is expected to be include in
    future versions of the DECwindows kit.


    This package has the following source code:

	DQDRIVER.C		- IDE driver source file.
        DQDRIVER.COM		- Build file for DQDRIVER
        SYS$DQDRIVER.EXE	- Executable for V7.1-2
	ENABLE-IDE.C 		- tool to enable the built in IDE for the
			  	  AlphaStation 400 4/233 and load the IDE 
    				  driver.  DQDRIVER is now autoconfigured on 
    				  supported Alpha systems.
	ENABLE-IDE.COM 		- Build file for ENABLE-IDE.C
	IDE-INFO 		- tool to dump the identity page information 
    				  from an IDE drive.
	IDE-INFO 		- Build file for IDE-INFO.C

	DECW$CDPLAYER.C		- New version of DECwindows CD-ROM audio 
    				  player with support for ATAPI CD-ROMs.
    	DECW$CDPALYER.UIL	- Interface definition file for CD player
	DECW$CDPLAYER.EXE	- Excutable for V7.1-2 
    	DECW$CDPALYER.UIL	- Compiled Interface definition file.  Must be
                                  in same directory as EXE file.

    Also included in this directory is the procedure LOAD_DQ_INTEL_SIO.COM,
    which will connect and load DQDRIVER for operation with the Intel SIO
    peripheral controller found on some members of the Personal Workstation
    -au series Alpha systems.  (DQDRIVER is supported with and autoconfigures
    on and can boot via the Cypress IDE PCI Peripheral Controller found on
    various Personal Workstation -au series systems.  OpenVMS cannot boot
    from IDE devices connected via the Intel SIO PCI IDE adapter.)

    To determine which IDE controller you have, use the SRM console command
    SHOW CONFIGURATION.   If your controller is shown as:

             Bus 00 Slot 07: Cypress PCI Peripheral Controller

    You can directly use DQDRIVER, can boot from supported IDE devices,
    and do not require LOAD_DQ_INTEL_SIO.COM.  If your controller is:

             Bus 00 Slot 07: Intel SIO 82378

    You cannot bootstrap from IDE devices, and DQDRIVER will not configure
    automatically.  If you wish to use DQDRIVER with IDE devices connected
    via the Intel SIO, you will need LOAD_DQ_INTEL_SIO.COM.

DWREMTERM, SYSTEM_MGMT, Start X-Window displays on remote machines

This command procedure is designed to allow users flexability in using 
DECwindows across a large number of machines connected together by a 
Local Area Network. It allows users to create LAT, DECnet, Telnet and LDT
windows locally and connect to remote nodes or to create remote DECwindow
sessions using the RDT, RFV, RDW, DWRT and RSH commands. The remote
commands are actually network process's and therefore do not count as an
interactive login.

DWremterm can be run in two modes:
  MENU MODE: commands are entered from a Small Menu Window.
  COMMAND MODE: commands are entered from the DCL command line.

Valid command are:-
  HELP, DWHELP, LAT, DECNET, TELNET, LDR, RDT, RFV, RDW, RSH, DWRT and $.
Parameters listed are [] brackets is optional.
HELP: Gives details on how to receive Brief or Expanded Help
DWHELP: Provide detailed Help on DWremterm
LAT:    Creates a Local DECterm Window using a SET HOST/LAT command.
        LAT nodename
DECNET: Creates a Local DECterm Window using a SET HOST command.
        DECNET nodename
TELNET: Creates a Local DECterm Window using a TELNET command.
        TELNET nodename
LDT:    Creates a local decterm and then does an rlogin
        LDT nodename [init_state] [title]
RDT:    Creates a Remote Decterm Window.
        RDT nodename [init_state] [title] [dcl_command]
                     [display] [transport] [x:y]
RFV:    Creates a Remote Fileview Window.
        RFV nodename [init_state] [display] [transport]
RDW:    Runs a Remote Remote Decwindows Application.
        RDW nodename command [display] [transport]
RSH:    Runs RSH commands on a remote node.
        RSH nodename command
DWRT:   Starts a second DWremterm Window.
        DWRT nodename [init_state] [display] [transport]
$:      Executes a local DCL command

For further details refer to sys$library:dwremterm.hlb.

A unique window title and icon name is chosen by referencing the user's
process name. If the login sequence changes the process name then duplicate
window and icon names may occur.

Refer to SYS$HELP:DWREMTERM.HLP for further help by typing:-
@VUE$LIBRARY:DWREMTERM DWHELP.

DWremterm consists of two files:
SYS$COMMON:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]DWREMTERM.COM 
SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]DWREMTERM.HLB

The RDT, RDW, DWRT and RFV commands require DWREMTERM.COM to exist on the
both the local and remote node and requires the user to either specify node
access control or for the remote account to be set up for proxy access.
DWremterm can simply reside in sys$login on the remote node, which requires
each user to have their own copy -or- DWremterm can be defined as a DECnet
object, requiring each system to have only one copy.

DECNET:
To install DWremterm as a network object the system manager should enter the
following commands:
DECnet/IV:
 $ MCR NCP
 NCP> DEFINE OBJECT DWREMTERM NUMBER 0 FILE -
      SYS$COMMON:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]DWREMTERM.COM PROXY BOTH
 NCP> SET OBJECT DWREMTERM ALL
 NCP> EXIT
 $
DECnet/OSI:
 $@sys$startup:net$configure application_add dwremterm "" -
 "{name=dwremterm}||vue$library:dwremterm.com|true|true|true|true|true||||1"

If DWremterm is not installed as a network object then by default no other 
setups are required. However if the DECnet object task has been modified to 
disable proxy access then DWremterm will fail. In this case the system 
manager should enter the following commands:
 $ MCR NCP
 NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TASK PROXY BOTH
 NCP> SET OBJECT TASK ALL
 NCP> EXIT
 $

PROXY accounts allow one user direct access to another users account
 without having to specify username and password. The system manager
 can set up proxy account access from within AUTHORIZE. 
 Example:  $ MCR AUTHORIZE>
           UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL KINGSMILL/DEFAULT
           UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL OLSENK
           UAF> EXIT
           $
 This examples allows user KINGSMILL on node MVAX into the local KINGSMILL 
 and OLSENK account. The default switch enables you to specify just the 
 nodename when addressing this node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX::
 If Default access is not specified then you need to specify the 
 nodename and username when addressing this node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"OLSENK"::
 If you do not have proxy access then you need to specify the
 nodename, username and password when addressing a remote node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"SYSTEM password"::

LAT:
 VMS V5.5-2 is required for outgoing LAT. This is enabled as follows:-
 MCR LATCP> SET NODE/CONNECTION=BOTH.

TCPIP:
 To prevent the need to use passwords on the RSH command proxies can be
 set up to authorize remote user access. To set up remote user access
 on a UNIX machine, or TCPWARE/MULTINET under VMS you specify the remote
 node and username in the .rhosts file which resides in the users home
 directory. With UCX you use the "UCX> ADD PROXY command"
 In addition, if you don't want to specify a password on RSH and RLOGIN
 you may need to add the following:-
 UCX> set service rsh /flag=(proxy,case)
 UCX> set service rlogin /flag=(proxy,case)

DISPLAY SECURITY: 
 The Factory Defaults prohibit a remote users from displaying their
 output to your workstation. To authorize other users or remote
 nodes to use your workstation display you should:
   1. Choose Security... from Session Manager's Options menu.
   2. Type the nodename, the username, and the method of transport,
      of the user you want to authorize. Entering * * * will allow
      any user on any node with any transport to display output on
      your workstaton.
   3. Click on the Add button and the Clock OK.
 Refer to the DECwindows user guide for further information.
 
CONFIGURATION SETUPS:
  The following logicals can be used to alter default DWremterm behaviour.
  DWREMTERM_ENABLE_COPY gives the user the option of copying the latest
    version of DWREMTERM should there be a mismatch in versions between
    the local and remote node.
  The WINDOW POSITION and INITIAL STATE can be altered from the default
    by editing the resource file. Details on how to do this is given within 
    the following resource files. 
      Default DWremterm window:
      - decw$user_defaults:dwremterm$default_v*.dat 
      DWRT DWremterm window:
      - decw$user_defaults:dwremterm$dwrt_default_v*.dat 
        This is on the remote node/users account.
      You can also override the DWRT resource file window position by
      defining the logical names DWREMTERM_DWRT_X and DWREMTERM_DWRT_Y
      under your local user account. These values are then passed to
      the remote node/users account.
  LAT$DISCONNECT_CHARACTER defines the character that you can use to 
    disconnect from a remote session. Default character is Ctrl+\.
  SYS$SCRATCH - temporary files are written to sys$scratch. If you don't
    want the temporary files written to sys$login then define sys$scratch.

TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS:
o Ensure that Security has been set up to enable a remote node to
  display output on your workstation. See installation section above
  for further details.
o The following logicals can be used to aid in troubleshooting
  These can be defined before starting DWremterm or during a DWremterm 
  Session by using the $ command.
    DWREMTERM_VERBOSE to display the progress of both local and remote 
      events. If verbose is enabled then a full sized menu window will 
      be displayed. This can also be enabled by prefixing the version 
      with an "X".
    DWREMTERM_VERIFY to turn on verify and verbose.
o NETSERVER.LOG on the remote node may also aid in troubleshooting.
o DWREMTERM_'pid'*.COM temporary file on the remote node shows the created
    command file.
o DWREMTERM_'pid'_*.LOG temporary file on on the remote node showing the
    output from dwremterm_'pid'_*.TMP
o If you have problems creating DECterms then get the latest DECterm patch
    from your CSC.

TIPS:
o By default you cannot shutdown VMS from an RDT window when running
  DECnet/OSI or DECnet/Plus because the shutdown procedure stops DECnet,
  which aborts the DWremterm session and the shutdown procedure itself.
  You can workaround this by doing the following:-
  $ DEFINE NET$STARTUP_STATUS SHUTDOWN
  $ @SYS$SYSTEM:SHUTDOWN

EPM, UTILITIES, Collect and display disk I/O statistics

			EPM V2.0 Release Notes
                             March 26, 2000

Written by:
	Ed Heinrich
	The LOKI Group, Inc.
	ed@loki.com

Ported to Alpha, cleaned up, and a VAX bug fixed by:

	Hunter Goatley
	goathunter@PROCESS.COM


OVERVIEW:

The EPM package provides a means to collect statistics on disk I/O operations 
that VMS does not, by default, provide.  EPM is capable of providing a synopsis 
of the type of disk I/O's, the size of each I/O, and tracking which files are
accessed the most both for read/write operations and as a result of file
fragmentation.


DISCLAIMER:

EPM HAS NEITHER BEEN TOTALLY DEBUGGED NOR TESTED IN EVERY POSSIBLE
CONFIGURATION.

EPM is NOT a commercial product but, rather, is provided free of charge on an 
"as is" basis.  As such, neither Edward A. Heinrich nor The LOKI Group, Inc. 
make any guarantees about the usefulness of any part of this package nor take 
any responsibility for any damage, loss, or harm that may arise out of its 
execution.


PACKAGE CONTENTS:

EPM consists of two parts:

EPMDRIVER is a standard VAX/VMS device driver, that contains code to intercept 
disk I/O request packets, (IRPs), and collect statistics based upon the 
content of the IRP.  EPMDRIVER, which communicates to the display program
via the QIO interface, intercepts the STARTIO address of the disk(s) to be 
monitored.

EPM is the user-interface to EPMDRIVER. EPM.C is a command line driven
program that communicates with EPMDRIVER, via the QIO interface, to
establish the monitoring interval, number of files to collect statistics
for, and the disk devices to intercept.  EPM also provides a means to
display the collected statistics to the current terminal.


The EPM command accepts the following qualifiers:

	/INTERVAL
		time, in seconds, between updates.
		default=60

	/DEVICES
		one or more disk devices to be monitored.  

	/FILE_COUNT
		the number of files, with both the most accesses and the ones
		that incurred the most split I/O operations within the interval
		time period.
		default=10

Sample command:
	$ epm/dev=(dka300,dka100)/file=25/inter=120

	collects statistics for DKA300 and DKA100, 25 file entries for both
	most accessed and highest split I/O counts, updates display once every
	two minutes.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

To create the .EXE files, simply execute MMK or MMS in the EPM directory.

To load EPMDRIVER into memory:

VAX:

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

Currently there are no known bugs in EPM V2.0


RESTRICTIONS:

EPM has never been tested on a shadow set disk and, therefore, contains code 
to prevent monitoring of a disk that is a shadow set member.  Any site that 
cares to test EPM in that environment can remove the checks in the EPM_COLLECT
routine in EPMDRIVER.MAR.  Multiple copies of EPM can be run simultaneously
but a disk can only be monitored by one copy of EPM at any time.

ETAPE, UTILITIES, Reads EBCDIC ASCII and GCOS MagTapes


ETAPE is a general-purpose program for handling EBCDIC, ASCII, and Honeywell
GCOS BCD tapes. It allows the user to move around at will within the tape,
send output to different files, specify different blocksizes and record
lengths for different files on the tape, and combine multiple tape files
into a single output file.
Special translation can be performed on tapes which have embedded packed
decimal, floating-point, or binary fields.
The capability of writing EBCDIC or ASCII tapes from VMS ASCII files is also
included.  EBCDIC tapes can be written in FB of VB mode, and may span
several reels if necessary.

ETAPE removes all trailing blanks from tape records after reading them.
On output, records will be blank padded and blocked to create fixed length
tape blocks. A switch can be set to turn off the EBCDIC translation and
allow the translation (or writing) of ASCII tapes.



			Installation
			============

ETAPE is comprised of the following files:

	AAAREADME.TXT		This file
	ETAPE.CLD		Command language for ETAPE
	ETAPE.FOR		Source program & subroutines
	ETAPE.HLP		Help file for the program
	ETAPE.OBJ		Object from ETAPE (for re-linking)
				(Not distributed via MAILSERV)

				would like to fix it up, I'd love to have a
				copy -- Dale)
	ETAPE_INCLUDE.FOR	Include file for fortran code
	SAMPLE.TRANS		A sample directive file for special translation

Note: in binary distributions (i.e. NOT Mailserv), the following files are also
included for those folks that don't have a FORTRAN compiler.

	ETAPE.OBJ_VAX
	ETAPE.EXE_VAX

FLIST, UTILITIES, File and Directory Manager

FLIST V2.4-1  [ 8-JAN-1999]
Copyright © 1990, 1999, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

----------------------------------------
This code may be freely distributed and modified for non-commercial
purposes as long as this copyright notice is retained.  Modified
copies may not be redistributed.
----------------------------------------

FLIST is a file and directory manager written in VAX TPU and VAX C (DEC
C).  The program was originally written in 1987 by Hunter Goatley. 
FLIST v2.0 includes many new features, added by Hunter Goatley and Peter
Galbraith.  (Generic EVE and DCL code by Peter Galbraith is provided to
support a "kept" EVE subprocess.  This code is compatible with the code
used by EVEplus.)

Please forgive me for the bad code---I wrote it quickly and have never
had the time to go back and really do much with it.  It isn't as
pretty as I'd like, but it works.

There also isn't much documentation, but pressing "H" while in FLIST
will show you help on the commands available.

To build, simply execute LINK.COM.  FLIST runs on both OpenVMS
VAX and OpenVMS Alpha.

To use, you must define a logical and a symbol:

	$ define FLIST_TPU_SECTION device:[dir]FLIST.TPU$SECTION
	$ FLIST :== $device:[dir]FLIST.EXE

You can then type

	$ FLIST [file-spec]

The optional file-spec can contain wildcards.  Once inside of FLIST, you
can type H for a one-line description of some of the commands.  Pressing
PF2 will show you a list of all key definitions.

All of the FLIST commands consist of either single-key presses or
GOLD-key combinations; be careful which characters you type once inside
FLIST.  (If you use a DECwindows mouse for cut and paste between
DECterms, be careful that you don't paste into a DECterm running FLIST,
because each pasted character will be treated as an FLIST command.)

Known limitations:

  o  Long  file  names  get  truncated and can't be viewed; it's one of
     those little bugs I just haven't gotten to yet.

See AAAREADME.TOO for additional information on FLIST and KEPT EVE.

FRAGMENT, UTILITIES, Display the fragmentation of the free space on a disk

FRAGMENT originally came from Digital's DSIN (Digital Software Information
Network) back around 1987.  I've made a few changes over the years, including
some recent changes to support larger, modern disk drives.

To build it, execute MMK or do:

    $ macro fragment
    $ link fragment

To use it, just define a foreign symbol:

    $ frag :== $dev:[dir]fragment.exe
    $ frag dka100:

FRAGMENT runs on both VAX and Alpha.

FRONTPORT, SOFTWARE, Porting library for OpenVMS

The FRONTPORT library is a shared image that consists of
enhancements to the DEC C RTL to allow easier migration
of programs writen for the UNIX or LINUX operating systems.

It converts UNIX style file names into Pathwork's style
file names for ODS-2 volumes.

It is useful for programs that need fcntl() locking support
or for programs that need to have crypt() return a password
hash for a VMS username.

This library was developed to allow the building of SAMBA
for OpenVMS with as few patches to the source as possible.

Please read the FRONTPORT_DOCUMENTATION.TXT file for more
complete information.

The FRONTPORT library LINK procedure will not currently
work for versions of OpenVMS before 7.0 and has only been
tested on OpenVMS VAX 7.1 and OpenVMS Alpha 7.2.

By linking the FRONTPORT library with sys$share:decc$crtl.olb/lib
to produce the shared image, it may be possible to build it
with earlier versions.  The file sys$share:decc$crtl.olb is not
supplied with this kit.

Created September 21, 1994, by Dan Wing, TGV <dwing@Cisco.com>
Hacked a lot by Richard Levitte <richard@levitte.org>
Features added by Hunter Goatley <goathunter@goatley.com>
Features added by Dick Munroe <munroe@acornsw.com>

--------------------
FTP_MIRROR is a DCL command procedure that can be used to set up a local
"mirror" of a remote FTP site.  It automatically detects when new or updated
files are placed on the remote system and will FTP them to the local system.

Due to the different commands used by FTP Clients, only a few FTP Clients are 
supported.  Due to the different output generated by different FTP Servers,
parsing routines have only been written for a few FTP Servers.

  o one of the following FTP Clients (on your system):
      - MultiNet 
      - MadGoat FTP
      - TCPware

  o mirrored against one of the following FTP Servers (on the remote system):
      - MultiNet
      - MadGoat FTP
      - TCPware
      - UCX (Compaq TCP/IP Services)
      - Unix

Limitations

  - Does not detect when a file has been deleted from the remote site

  - Starting with release 17, the procedure uses a lot of DCL symbols if it
    needs to keep track of symbolic links.  This may cause you to run out
    of space for symbols (DCL_W_SYMOVF).  In this event, you may do one of
    three things:

    1.	Increase the number of CTLPAGES allocated for each process (use AUTOGEN)
	and set MIN_CTLPAGES to some "large" number.

    2.	Break the transfer into more than one job (which may result in
	duplicating some data).

    3.	Set DEREFERENCE_LINKS to NO.

Please send bug reports to <goathunter@goatley.com>.

browser and editor product);

Input modules (utilities) for reading a variety of raster formats,
including CMYK, GIF, JFIF (JPEG), MIFF, PBM/PGM/PPM, and PCX;  Output
modules (drivers) for a wide variety of window systems (including X
Windows and Microsoft Windows), raster file formats, and printers, as
well as a PDF output module that implements functions similar to
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product; and

The Ghostscript library, a set of procedures to implement the
graphics and filtering capabilities that are primitive operations in
the PostScript language and in PDF.

In simple terms, this means that Ghostscript can read a PostScript or
PDF file and display the results on the screen or convert them into a
form you can print on a non-PostScript printer. Especially together
with several popular previewers, with Ghostscript you can view or
print an entire document or even isolated pages, even if your
computer doesn't have Display PostScript and your printer doesn't
handle PostScript itself.

GMAKE, Build_Tools, the FSF GNU Make Tool for OpenVMS

  GNU Make provides the ability to selectively build part or
  all of an OpenVMS application, based on analysis of the
  source files and comparision with a user-created source
  code module dependency (makefile) module.

  Thanks to Hartmut Becker of Compaq, here is the OpenVMS/Alpha
  V7.2 image resulting from a port of the GNU Make. This image is
  based on the FSF 3.79.1 baselevel. The associated source files
  are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/. They can be used
  for other VMS versions, VAX and Alpha, as well. There are VMS
  specific instructions how to build the images. Unfortunately
  there is a regression in the VMS code. In the module VARIABLE.C

GNM, LANGUAGES, Common source tool for messages and documentation

The GNM tools allow you to have a common source file for both an 
OpenVMS message file and for DECdocument SDML documentation.

GEN_MSG converts a .GNM file into a standard OpenVMS message file,
which can then be processed by the MESSAGE compiler and (optionally)
with MESSAGE/SDL and the SDL tool to create language-specific
include files.

GEN_SDML converts the same .GNM file into a standard DECdocument
.SDML file for inclusion in documentation.

The .GNM file can be thought of as a series of directives:

   .NAME	    - The message symbol without the VDE$_
   .MESSAGE	    - The message text, it may be wrapped
   .EXPLANATION    - The description that appears in the document
   .USER_ACTION    - The recovery section that appears in the document.
   .BREAK	    - May be used to start a new paragraph in the
		      .explanation or .user_action
   .DESTINATION    - Which file the following appears in, parameters are
		      both, message
   .SEVERITY       - informational, success, warning, error, or fatal

The first 4 directives: .name, .message, .explanation, .user_action,
occur as a group in that order for each message.  .explanation and
.user_action are optional.  The FAO arguments within the .message
are contained within <>.  Within the <> there are 2 arguments, the
first is a word which will be emphasized in that position in the
document, the second is the FAO argument which will appear in the
message file in that position.  

The .destination directive must appear between message groups and is
in effect until another .destination directive occurs.  Thus, when
one message is to goto the message file only a .destination message
will precede the message group and a .destination both will follow
the group.  

.FACILITY and .END frame the contents of the GNM file.  The arguments
on the .FACILITY directive indicate the facility name and the facility
number, and the directive also accepts qualifiers to pass through to 
the MESSAGE file .FACILITY directive.

Use spaces for the indentation of the message text and explanations.

The following is an example of a GNM file:


.facility	facnam,facnum /PREFIX=prefix$_
!
! Success messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
!
.severity success
.destination message

.name	    SUCCESS1
.message	successful
.explanation	This message indicates success
.user_action	None required
!
! Informational messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
!
.base 500
.severity informational
.destination both

.name	    INFO1
.message	information <text, !AC> is displayed
.explanation	This message informs you of something, and shows how
		to include some text in the message using a standard
                FAO directive.
.user_action	None required

!
! Warning messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
! 
.base 1000
.severity warning
.destination both

.name	    WARNING1
.message	ambiguous '<text,!AC>'
.explanation	Cannot complete the command because '<EMPHASIS>(text)' 
		is ambiguous in the context of this command.
.user_action	None required

!
! Error messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
!
.base 1500
.severity error
.destination both

.name	    ERROR1
.message	whoops
.explanation	unknown mystery error
.user_action	Wave a rubber chicken over the application

!
! Fatal messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.  Very few messages should
! be of fatal severity.
!
.base 2000
.severity fatal
.destination both

.name	    FATAL1
.message	crash
.explanation	unknown fatal mystery error
.user_action	Wave a rubber chicken over the computer

GNUDIFFUTILS, UTILITIES, Unix-style file comparison utilities

1-Feb-2001	Craig A. Berry	     <craigberry@mac.com>
		Charles Lane         <lane@DUPHY4.Physics.Drexel.Edu>
		Martin Vorlaender    <mv@PDV-SYSTEME.de>

This is a port of GNU diffutils 2.7.2 for OpenVMS.  Some functionality is
not available and there are no guarantees of any kind about the performance
of the software.  Only cursory testing has been performed, but it seems to
work fine in a number of fairly complicated cases.  This work is based on
earlier work by Richard Levitte, but far fewer heroics are required now
than five years ago to work around deficiencies in the C compiler and
run-time library.  

The port is based on the 2.7.2 GNU sources, which are still in beta as of this
writing.  The beta sources were used because they obviate some VMS-specific
changes (such as a wrapper for read()) that would have been necessary with the
final-release 2.7 sources, and also because the GNU maintainer (Paul Eggert
<eggert@twinsun.com>) requested that patches required for VMS be submitted
against 2.7.2.  We submitted such a patch on 22-Feb-2000 and hope the next
GNU-released version will work out of the box on VMS.

The VMS additions may be distributed under the same terms as the GNU
General Public License.  We'd be happy to hear about things that need
fixing but can't promise to do anything about it.

INSTALLATION

Object libraries for both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha are included with
this distribution and were created under OpenVMS 6.2, so they should link
properly under that and later versions of OpenVMS.  To link, run the command
procedure LINK.COM in the main directory as follows:

    $ @LINK

Copy the executable files to a suitable location, set the protection on
them so whoever needs to can run them, and create symbols that can be
used as foreign commands.  The commands to do this look something
like:

    $ copy gdiff.alpha_exe dra0:[gnu]gdiff.exe
    $ set protection=(s:rwed,o:rwed,g:re,w:re) dra0:[gnu]gdiff.exe
    $ gdiff :== $dra0:[gnu]gdiff.exe  ! put this in LOGIN.COM or SYLOGIN.COM

You can do something similar for the subsidiary programs GCMP.EXE,
GDIFF3.EXE, and GSDIFF.EXE.  Be aware that GDIFF3 and GSDIFF spawn a
process to run GDIFF and must be in the same directory it is.  Also
note: you probably shouldn't use "diff" as a foreign command symbol
because that will conflict with the native DIFFERENCES command.

BUILDING FROM SOURCE

If you have a C compiler, the included descrip.mms in [.SRC.VMS] can be made
with MMS or the freeware MMK. It's doubtful the package will compile with DEC
C before 5.2 or VAX C, nor is it likely to run on OpenVMS versions prior to
6.2.  

RUNNING

For a quick start, you can run the programs using the --help option to get a
brief usage summary.  For more detailed documentation, see the file
[.SRC]DIFF.INFO, or the same information converted to OpenVMS help format in
[.SRC.VMS]GNUDIFFUTILS.HLP.  This latter file is suitable for insertion into
an OpenVMS help library, although the logical structure of the original
document is not ideally suited to that environment.  The help file was
created with a Perl script written by Martin Vorlaender and available at
<http://www.pdv-systeme.de/users/martinv/info2hlp>.

VMS-SPECIFIC USAGE NOTES

 o I/O redirection is built into the program. The redirection
   symbols recognized are

     <    redirect SYS$INPUT
     >    redirect SYS$OUTPUT
     >>   redirect SYS$OUTPUT, append mode
     2>   redirect SYS$ERROR
     2>>  redirect SYS$ERROR, append mode

   When redirecting SYS$ERROR, the special filename '&1' is recognized; 
   it redirects SYS$ERROR to SYS$OUTPUT.

 o The programs, where possible, exit with the same success statuses that
   the OpenVMS DIFFERENCES utility uses.

HGLOGIN, SYSTEM_MGMT, Log in to another account without a password

HGLOGIN (Hunter's LOGIN)
Copyright © 1997, 1998, 2000, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

------------------------------
HGLOGIN is a rewrite and enhancement of the GLOGIN utility written by
Anthony C. McCracken, Northern Arizona University, in 1992.

HGLOGIN uses the PTD$ routines supplied by VMS and may not work on
older versions of VMS.
------------------------------

HGLOGIN lets privileged users log in to a named account without having
to know the password for that account.  A process running under the
target username is created.  Its input and output are read from a
pseudo-terminal, which is controlled by HGLOGIN.

Unlike BECOME and SWAP, the process created by HGLOGIN is a full
process, with all the privileges, rights identifiers, quotas, DCL
symbols, logical names, etc., as well as anything else that is set up
in the target user's LOGIN.COM.

HGLOGIN requires the target username as a parameter.  If there is
other text on the line, HGLOGIN enters "single command mode." The
remaining text is passed to the new process to be executed by DCL. 
When the command execution completes, the process is automatically
logged out and control returns to the original process.

You can use HGLOGIN to log into DISUSERed accounts by specifying the
qualifier /NOUAF.


INSTALLING HGLOGIN
------------------
To build the executable:

* Execute the following command to produce HGLOGIN.EXE from the supplied
  binaries:

	$ @LINK.COM

* If you have the BLISS sources and the MMS description file available,
  use MMK to compile and link the executable.

* You can install the online help in a help library using a command like
  the following:

        $ LIBRARY/HELP/INSERT SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB HGLOGIN.HLP

Once you have the HGLOGIN.EXE file, you can set up a DCL foreign command
to run HGLOGIN:

	$ hglogin :== $disk:[directory]HGLOGIN.EXE

To log in as user SYSTEM, simply issue:

	$ hglogin system

The effect will be similar to using SET HOST 0 or TELNET to log in to
local system.

To execute a single command under the target username, issue a command
like:

	$ hglogin system mail

In the example above, you will be logged in as SYSTEM and the MAIL
command will be executed in the SYSTEM process.  When you QUIT or EXIT
MAIL, you're automatically logged out of the SYSTEM process.

HGLOGIN and SET TERM/INQUIRE
----------------------------
HGLOGIN's single-command mode will not work properly if either
SYLOGIN.COM or the target user's LOGIN.COM include the command SET
TERMINAL/INQUIRE.  Normally, the commands sent to the process are
purged when the SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE command executes.

In cases like this, you must use the /PROMPT qualifier to tell HGLOGIN
what the DCL prompt will be once the process is logged in.  HGLOGIN
will then wait for the given prompt (which defaults to "$") before
sending its commands to the process.

	$ hglogin/prompt="What?" system mail

There is also a /NOQUIET qualifier that can be given to override
HGLOGIN's "quiet mode" in single-command mode.  HGLOGIN/NOQUIET will
display all the output from the process.

IF you try to use single-command mode and never see any output, type
LOGOUT and then use HGLOGIN/NOQUIET to see the output and prompt.  You
can then use /PROMPT to force HGLOGIN to wait for the DCL prompt.

IMAKE, Build_Tools, makefile generator

I. Summary:

Imake is a port of an X Windows tool that generates Makefiles, a set 
of cpp macro routines, and an Imakefile input file from a single source 
file.  Imake permits the separation of the operating system dependencies 
from the build scripts.  Imake works in conjunction with -- it does not
replace -- a makefile tool such as MMS.

This freeware kit contains everything necessary to use Imake on OpenVMS 
systems.  Use the following command to restore this directory tree:

        $ BACKUP/LOG IMAKE.BCK/SAVE [...]*.*;

This BACKUP comand will duplicate the Imake directory tree starting at 
your current directory.  

After restoring the Imake.sav saveset, you will need to invoke the 
Imake_login.com command procedure.  This command file will establish
the necessary symbols and logical names used elsewhere in the Imake
environment.  The following command shows how this might be done:

        $ @imake_login

II. Directories:

    [IMAKE]
      This is the top level Imake directory.

    [IMAKE.BINARY]
      This subdirectory holds the finished Imake tools, executables, 
      and Imake configuration files for a OpenVMS environment.  The 
      Imake.Rules file is a monster file of slight variations of Imake 
      rules for building all sorts of program targets.  You only really 
      need a couple of these rules, but they exist in all their 
      splendor to show how you can create an Imake rule to build any 
      OpenVMS type program target that you might ever need.

    [IMAKE.CPP]
       This is the C preprocessor that Imake uses.

    [IMAKE.IMAKE 
       This is the build directory and documentation for Imake.

    [IMAKE.MAKEDEPEND]
       This is the build directory for the makedepend image.

    [IMAKE.MAKEINCLUDE]
       This directory holds a command file to process output
       from makedepend and insert it into an MMS makefile.

    [IMAKE.UTILS]
       This directory holds a command file to stream/lf an OpenVMS 
       text file that is not.  TPU creates files that by default 
       are not stream/lf.  You may be able to configure TPU to do so.
           
III. Prerequisite Software:

    OpenVMS VAX or Alpha
    MMS
    DEC C


IV. Conclusion:

    The object modules and executable images in this saveset were built 
    on an OpenVMS Alpha V7.2 system using DEC C V6.0.  Some adjustments
    of the compilation commands will be necessary, depending on the
    particular package.

    The CPP and IMAKE build areas have a bootstrap makefile.ini if you 
    can't happen to run the existing images.   You build CPP first then 
    Imake itself.  There are readme files in most of the build directories 
    to help you along.  These readme files describe some of the things 
    that had to be done to get Imake working.

    The license release for all this software is found in the Imake.c 
    module in [imake.imake.build]imake.c.  It is a very nice tool.  May 
    you find it useful!

JUMP, SYSTEM_MGMT, Become a different user exactly or in part

JUMP is a  program  which  allows  selected  users (Systems Programmers,
Operators and specifically authorised users) to change elements of their
process to those of another user, or to become *exactly* the target user
in  a pseudo-terminal.  Limitations are placed on Operators: they cannot
target users who have more than a certain set of privileges unless  they
are specifically authorised to do so.

All users are validated against an access file to determine any specific
access to be granted or denied  in  addition to any default access (e.g.
for  Operators).   The access file also may contain options relating  to
security monitoring of sessions.

Exact jumps can be monitored with secure log files.

For non-exact jumps, items which are changed to those of the target user
are:

  Username (Systems Programmers only, using the SETUSER or ALL qualifier)
  UIC, Default Directory, Default Disk, LNM$GROUP.

Privileges and process rights are NOT changed.

It is recommended that you thoroughly read the HELP file (JUMP.HLP) and
the example access file (JUMP_ACCESS.DAT) before installing JUMP.

To install JUMP:

  1. Re-link JUMP (NO Traceback) as directed in the build procedure.
  2. Define EXECUTIVE mode SYSTEM table logical names as required (see help).
  3. If required, create the JUMP_ACCESS rights ID.
  4. If required, grant the JUMP_ACCESS rights ID to authorised users.
  5. If the JUMP_ACCESS rights ID is *not* created, define the
        JUMP_DOUBLE_CHECK logical name to be "FALSE".
  6. If required, create/edit the access file (see example file).
  7. INSTALL JUMP with the following privileges:
	CMEXEC, CMKRNL, DETACH (or IMPERSONATE), SYSNAM, SYSPRV
  8. Set access rights on all files as appropriate.
  9. Define a foreign command: $ JUMP :== $device:[directory]JUMP
 10. Boing!

The author of JUMP is

    Jonathan Ridler,
    Information Technology Services,
    The University of Melbourne,
    Victoria, AUSTRALIA, 3010.

    Email: jonathan@unimelb.edu.au

Note: Some ideas in JUMP have been drawn from Eric Wentz's program BECOME.
      The code for pseudo-terminal creation is derived from Anthony
      McCracken's GLOGIN program.  Thanks to Bob Beckerhof for testing and
      helpful suggestions.  Special thanks to Jeremy Begg for code to create
      secure log files and other minor fixes.

JUMP is written entirely in  DEC  Pascal.   The current version has been
built and tested on OpenVMS VAX v7.1 (DEC Pascal v5.6) and OpenVMS Alpha
v7.1-2 (DEC Pascal v5.7).

The current version of JUMP is v3.4 (10-Nov-1999).

More-detailed descriptions:

CONTIG.COM

Creates or extends a system file in as contiguous a manner as possible.  System
files can only have one file header (no extension headers) because they are
accessed by primitive code.  In a Contiguous Best Try file extension, VMS will
find the three largest extents on the disk, but then gives up and proceeds to
allocates space arbitrarily for the rest of the file.  This means the file
header for a system file may fill up prematurely, sometimes before the desired
file size is reached, and a backup/restore of the entire disk is then required
to repack the file before it can be extended to the desired size. This DCL
procedure finds the largest free extent and enlarges the file by only that
amount each cycle, repeating this until the desired size is reached, thus
minimizing the degree of fragmentation for the resulting file, and minimizing
the number of extents used up in the file header. 

COMBINE_FEEDBACK.COM

Logically combines feedback data from multiple files.

Some systems (especially government systems) are not
allowed to run continuously for the 24 hours or more
that AUTOGEN wants for valid feedback data.  These
systems may run 8 hours per day, then be shut down and
have their disks removed and locked in a safe overnight.
This DCL procedure logically combines the data from
multiple AUTOGEN feedback files, so that if feedback
data is saved at the end of each uptime session, these
periods of data can effectively be combined together
and used as input to AUTOGEN as if they were contiguous.
The procedure basically works by adding the values from
cumulative counters together, finding the highest value
for peak values, and using the most recent data for any
data items which represent "current" data, and adding
the elapsed times together.

DECNET_LATENCY.COM

Sends 100 loopback packets using NCP, and measures the
average round-trip network latency.  Since it uses
the NCP> LOOP NODE command, it needs DECnet Phase IV.

FIXQUE.COM

Creates DCL code to re-create queues, jobs, forms, and
characteristics, based on output listing from $SHOW QUEUE.
Was developed to solve queue file corruption; still useful
to help in moving queues and jobs between systems or
setting up one cluster to have the same queue environment
as another.  Is also supplied in a "squeezed" version
(FIXQUE_SQZ.COM) for faster execution.

LANTRAF.COM

Display the LAN adapters enabled for SCS traffic and the relative amounts of
traffic SCS has sent to each 

NODE$TRACK.COM

Track cluster membership and notify someone by e-mail when things change, like
when a node leaves the cluster or joins the cluster.

REXMT.COM

Examines PEDRIVER's retransmitted-packet counters under SDA, to measure the
severity of LAN problems in an LAVc environment. ReXmt counter shows
re-transmitted packets (packet was lost or its Ack was lost).  ReRcv counter
shows duplicate packets received (Ack was lost on its way back to sender). 
Both indicate packet-loss problems in the LAN. 

SHAD.COM

Displays shadowset members which are in a shadow merge or shadow copy state, if
any. 

SHAD_TRACK.COM

Periodically displays shadowset members which are in a shadow merge or shadow
copy state, and degree of completion, to allow tracking copy or merge progress
over time.

SIFT_LAVC.COM

Sifts through OPERATOR.LOG files on all nodes in a cluster
and creates a time-sorted, consolidated list of all the %LAVC
console messages from SYS$EXAMPLES:LAVC$FAILURE_ANALYSIS.MAR
in the format of:
    dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.cc nodexx %LAVC-s-ident, text
This allows one to more easily determine the sequence of
events and timing in a failure of a cluster interconnect.

SHADOW$CONFIG.COM

Determine the existence, membership, and status of all shadowsets on the
system, and their member devices.  Stores results in either DCL symbols or
in logical names.

The following information is returned by the procedure:
SHADOW$CONFIG_set_count                     Number of shadowsets
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_LABEL                   Volume label for each shadowset
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_DEVICE_NAME             DSAn: device name for shadowset
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_MEMBER_COUNT            shadowset size (# of members)
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_MEMBER_m_DEVICE_NAME    Member device names
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_MEMBER_m_STATE          Member state: "ShadowMember",
                                            "FullCopying", or "MergeCopying"
There is also a timestamp logical name defined if the results are placed
into logical names:
SHADOW$CONFIG_TIMESTAMP                     Time of data-gathering

SHADOW$DISPLAY.COM

Display, in semi-graphical format, all the host-based volume shadowing
shadow sets, highlighting any anomalies (such as lack of redundancy
or full copies in progress) with the judicious use of color.

SHAD$DISPLAY.COM

Abbreviated version of SHADOW$DISPLAY.COM, taking less on-screen real estate. 

This version optionally supports a multi-site disaster-tolerant cluster
configuration (it does assume that disk allocation classes are $1$ at one site
and $2$ at the other site so it can tell which site a given disk is located
at).  Shadowsets without cross-site shadowing protection are then flagged as
unprotected, even if they have two or more members, if all are within a single
site.

SHADOW$TRACK.COM

Track shadowset membership and notify someone by e-mail when a member is added
or lost, when a new shadowset is created, or when a shadowset goes away. 

SHOW_PREF_PATH.COM

Show the preferred paths being used by PEDRIVER to each remote node in the
cluster.

LDDRIVER, SYSTEM_MGMT, OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Virtual Disk Driver

The logical disk utility is a system management tool available
to any user for controlling logical disk usage. It can also be used
for testing out things like volume shadowing, striping, host-based
raid, or software which does dangerous things to disks without disturbing
a real disk.

A Logical Disk is a file available on a Physical Disk, which acts as a
real Physical Disk. The Logical Disks can be created in any directory
of the Physical Disk.

A large disk can be divided into smaller sections, each a Logical Disk,
supporting the same I/O functions as the Physical Disk. By giving the
Logical Disk File a good  protection level and mounting it private or
with device protection, you are able to add a number of protection
levels to your file system.

Logical disks may be just a single disk, part of a volumeset, part of
a stripeset, part of a host-based shadowset, part of a host-based raid
set or any combination.

The file to be used for the logical disk may be placed on any physical disk,
in any directory. A backup can be made to protect the disk.

Another possibility is logging of all I/O requests for the driver, as well
as suspending/resuming I/O requests on certain conditions.

A physical device may be 'replaced' by a logical disk to enable logging of
all I/O of the physical disk. In that case we don't use any container file.

This driver can be used to create for example ODS-2 Cdrom's on a PC.
Just create a containerfile, hook it to a logical disk drive, mount it
and copy anything you like. Then take the container file to a pc, and
burn this file in raw format to a Cdrom.

The driver is now supported for both the VAX and the Alpha architectures.

The only limitation at present is that this tool needs at least OpenVMS
Version V5.4. Binaries are only supplied for version V6.2 and up for
OpenVMS VAX, and for V6.2 and up for OpenVMS Alpha. But since the full
sources are included a straight rebuild should be enough to get it
running on V5.4 and up. Be sure to read the releasenotes before an attempt
is made to rebuild from scratch.

The driver can be installed with VMSINSTAL. The LD062.B saveset contains
the sources, the other kits the binaries for various VMS versions.
After installation full help is available with HELP LD.

LPDDEVCTL, UTILITIES, LPD Print Symbiont Setup Modules

LPDDEVCTL is a set of text (postscript) modules for use with UCX$LPD_SMB
(untested on other lpd symbionts).

These modules are used as setups to form a postscript prefix to a text file for
printing: while many printers can autosense postscript or plain text/pcl,
there's no control over the layout of text. These modules allow you to specify
66 lines, 80 chars, portrait; 66 lines, 132 chars, landscape; various others,
or to create your own .stub file(s) with your own spec.

They provide a way to get text layout comparable to Pathworks (Mac) MSAP, or
the newer DCPS, but via the ubiquitous lpd protocol which neither supports.

Instructions: Unzip the kit. If you wish, look at the stub files & create your
own variations (& add them to LPDDEVCTL.COM). Execute LPDDEVCTL.COM to create
the text library. Create forms as necessary (assign your own numbers) - see
QUEUE-SETUP.TXT for details - if you use MSAP some may already exist. Modify
your lpd queues to use the library & forms.

If you know how to get the vms file/job/username or any other details from
postscript please tell me, or if you have any problems/complaints/suggestions.

LYNX283, Utilities, A Terminal-based Web Browser

Lynx V2.8.3 (a terminal driven Web browser)

Updated
  Tue May 2 20:04:01 2000

Author
  Lou Montulli et al.

Help
  http://lynx.browser.org/

Comment
  This re-packaged version includes Slang 1.4.1. Current distribution 
  includes an OpenVMS 7.2 Alpha executable linked with Slang and Multinet 
  TPIP. Usage of -color will (at last) make colors available for VMS Lynx.


--

Also provided is a version of Lynx V2.8.2 built by Dick Picard, with the
updated files and the file DIFFs for OpenVMS, in the OSU subdirectory.

"Enhancing LYNX's Web Crawling

Project

     I have modified LYNX 2.8.2 for more effective use with the VMSINDEX 
     software for creating keyword searchable indexes of Web sites, when 
     used with command lines such as: 

         $ CRAWL :== "$DISK9:[LYNX]LYNX -NOPAUSE -CRAWL -TRAVERSAL -REALM"
         $ CRAWL http://www.ohiou.edu/

     The changes include the following: 

       1.Enhancing the parsing of the META tags in the HEAD to use the 
         "keywords" and "description". 

       2.Writing the META-tagged keywords and description to the output 
         file immediately after the URL and TITLE when crawling. 

       3.Provided an environment variable for the number of subdirectories 
         to use for the output files when crawling. VMS exhibits seriously 
         degraded performance when more than about 1,100 files are in the 
         same directory, because the directory file exceeds 127 blocks. 

       4.Overloading the "-nopause" option to have it also prevent querying 
         for passwords. 

       5.The compiler complained because an unsigned int was being subjected 
         to a comparison "<= 0", so I changed it to "== 0" to avoid the 
         error message."

LYNX284, UTILITIES, Text Web Browser
This is Lynx version 2.8.4dev.14, snapshot November 3, 2000.

WHAT IS LYNX?

   Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
   cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100
   terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other
   character-cell display.  It will display Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system, as well
   as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp,
   finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to
   telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts.  Current versions of Lynx run on
   Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

   Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to establish
   information systems intended primarily for local access.  Lynx has been
   used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  Lynx can
   also be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

   Links to the current sources and support materials for Lynx are
   maintained at:
			  "Lynx links"
	     <URL:http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx.html>
   and at the Lynx homepage:
			"Lynx Information"
		  <URL:http://lynx.browser.org/>.
   View these pages for information about Lynx, including new updates.

   Lynx is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) without
   restrictions on usage or redistribution.  The Lynx copyright statement,
   "COPYHEADER", and GNU GPL, "COPYING", are included in the top-level
   directory of the distribution.  Lynx is supported by the Lynx user
   community, an entirely volunteer (and unofficial) organization.

   Certain portions of the Lynx source distribution were originally created
   by CERN and have been modified during the development of Lynx.  See
   WWW/Copyright.txt for copyright info regarding CERN products used in
   Lynx.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

   We believe Lynx works properly for the Year 2000 issues, since it does
   not store dates in 2-digit form.  Since it must communicate with a wide
   range of web servers, it interprets dates in a variety of formats.  In
   particular, if Lynx receives a date with a 2-digit year, it assumes that
   values less than 70 are in the range 2000-2069.

DOCUMENTATION

   A users guide is included in this distribution along with a man page for
   Unix systems and a help file for VMS systems.  All documentation is
   contained in the top directory and the docs, samples and lynx_help
   subdirectories.

   While running Lynx, type 'h', 'H', or '?' to invoke the help menu
   system.  From the help menu you may access several useful documents
   pertaining to Lynx and the World Wide Web.  The most important of these
   is the Lynx Users Guide.  By default, Lynx will use the Lynx Enhanced
   Pages, which includes http links for help and FAQs concerning Lynx.  It
   is recommended that you install your own help menu system at your site
   in order to lessen the load on http servers.  This also will allow you
   to customize the help menu system for your site and greatly speed up
   access for those using Lynx over a slow connection.

   For Unix and related systems which support the autoconf configure
   script, the help menu system is installed by the "make install-help"
   command.

   For other systems (such as VMS), copy COPYHEADER and COPYING into the
   lynx_help/ subdirectory.  Then copy the lynx_help subdirectory to a
   public place on your system, or into your $HOME directory if you are a
   single user.  Finally, edit the lynx.cfg file so that the HELPFILE line
   is defined as follows:

      HELPFILE:file://localhost/[public_path]/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html

   where [public_path] is the absolute path to the lynx_help directory.
   Customizing the help menu system is just a matter of editing a set of
   HTML files.  Additional information about installing and customizing
   the help file set is available at <URL:http://www.irm.nara.kindai.ac.jp/
   lynxdev/README.help>.

INSTALLING LYNX

   To install Lynx, follow the steps in the INSTALLATION file, which is
   located in the top directory of the source distribution.

PROBLEMS

   If you experience problems configuring, compiling or installing Lynx,
   please read Section VI.  "General installation instructions" in the
   INSTALLATION file.  Instructions are given there for reporting your
   problem to the "lynx-dev" mailing list, which is frequented by

MBX, UTILITIES, Work with mailboxes from DCL without programming

MBX is a utility that allows to work with mailboxes from DCL.
It features a new DCL command that can create, delete, attach,
detach, write to, and read from mailboxes.

MBX also features a callable interface (a.k.a. API) so that
programmers can use the same mechanism from within their
programs, without having to write cumbersome system calls.
This API is available as an upward-compatible shareable
image. The kit contains a definition of the six service calls
in pascal environment format, and in SDL syntax.

The package contains the DCL command definition, the executables,
an addition for the VMS help library, and documentation.

The MBX utility is packaged as a PCSI kit or VMSINSTAL save-set 
for OpenVMS Alpha, and as a VMSINSTAL save-set only for OpenVMS
VAX. The file MBX.MEM contains the installation instructions.
It can be printed on any ascii printer.

Program sources (Pascal, Macro, SDL, CLD, and Message) are in
the SRC subdirectory. To build the executables, copy the contents
of the SRC subdirectory to an empty directory of your system, set
default to this directory, and execute the procedure BUILD.COM.
For a successful build, you will need a full VMS installation
(i.e. with the library and optional components installed), the
DEC Pascal compiler (another one most probably won't work) and
the SDL V3.2 package from the freeware CD.

The build has been tested under OpenVMS Alpha V6.2 and under
OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2, with DEC Pascal V5.6. Earlier versions
might work but have not been tested. To use the package, the
base VMS only is enough; earliest possible versions are 
OpenVMS Alpha V6.2 or  OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2. More recent versions
have not been tested but should be OK.

Constructive comments and suggestions about this package are
welcome at Marc.Vandyck@Skynet.Be .

MenuFinder, UTILITIES, Tool to build menu-driven interfaces

                    MenuFinder for OpenVMS

1. What Is MenuFinder 
2. Main Characteristics
3. MenuFinder is free for OpenVMS/VAX systems
4. How to install MenuFinder


1. What Is MenuFinder

  MenuFinder is a menu generator for OpenVMS systems (VAX and AXP).
  It has been created to give a simple but effective answer to the
  requirement of presenting the user with a set of functions via a
  menu interface.
  In particular, MenuFinder is an ideal instrument to
  - build on-line guides for the users of the computing centre
  - document and utilise management procedures of the system 
    manager or the operator.


1. Main Characteristics

Types of option in the menus
  DCL commands, text files, data files, programs, batch files and 
  submenus can be associated with the options.

Association of programmes or commands to files.
  For example, the program used to write a document can be 
  associated with the letter: choosing the document from the menu, 
  activates that program to read or write the document.

Help text on the menu options
  A user may have to use many programs, although infrequently: it 
  is not easy therefore, to remember even the simplest functions 
  of a product. Often, shortcuts and contrivances are forgotten 
  after a while. MenuFinder allows the possibility to associate a 
  help text with each option of a menu, in which can be inserted 
  instructions, annotations and useful indications both for 
  oneself and other users.

The means of accessing the menus are particularly powerful.
  Apart from being able to use the classic hierarchical submenu 
  structure, it is also possible to jump from one menu to another
  specifying its name or supplying one or more words to search 
  for in the description of the options. 
  This capability is available not only from within MenuFinder, 
  but also from the OpenVMS prompt ($).

The navigation line
  Records the last 10 menus called-up, allowing an extremely 
  rapid means to recall them.

Rapid return to the last used menu
  In case it is necessary to exit MenuFinder and return 
  completely under the control of OpenVMS, it is still possible 
  to recall immediately the last menu used.

It's simple to construct a menu
  MenuFinder is an easy to use product: it is sufficient to know
  a few DCL commands, be able to use EDIT, the standard OpenVMS 
  editor and know the few (10 or so) instructions for the 
  generation of the menus. The construction  of a menu is 
  interactive and every change has an immediate effect on the 
  screen.

Logical Names
  The use of Logical Names both for the personalization of 
  MenuFinder and for the definition of logical directories, makes
  the management of the product extremely flexible and particularly
  suitable for a cluster environment.


3. MenuFinder is free for OpenVMS/VAX systems

  No licence fees are required for installing and using 
  MenuFinder for OpenVMS/VAX.

  Visit the site http://www.itre.com/mf/download.html to download
  the OpenVMS/AXP installation kit and a free temporary 
  Authorization Code for any number of OpenVMS/AXP systems.

4. How to install MenuFinder for OpenVMS/VAX

  - Read the file licence_terms_freeware.txt

  - Print the Administrator guide and the User guide: they are
    provided in PDF format for easy viewing/printing on any
    MSWindows, Apple Macintosh or Linux/Unix computer

    A TXT version is provided for occasional reference
    with a text based terminal

    A Postscript(tm) version is also provided for printing
    from OpenVMS

  - Read the Administrator guide in order to correctly 
    complete the installation.

   means that it works with virtually every implementation of TCP/IP for
   VMS.

   MGFTP started life as the CMU-Tek FTP client and server. Many
   thanks go to John Clement and Henry Miller, who made the CMU FTP much
   better than it used to be. The MadGoat version was modified to work
   with NETLIB and includes numerous enhancements and bug fixes. The
   MadGoat version was done by Darrell Burkhead and Hunter Goatley.

   UCX sites, in particular, should find MGFTP of interest. Some of
   the features include:

     * The client features a VMS CLI$ interface, with support for normal
       UNIX-style commands. For example, SET DEFAULT and CD both change
       the remote working directory. Unlike MultiNet's client, which
       offers a TOPS-20-style interface, MGFTP provides a VMS-style
       interface with the case preservation, etc., of a UNIX-style
       interface.

     * The MGFTP client and server support STRU O VMS. When both a
       server and a client support STRU VMS, VMS file attributes are
       retained when files are transferred.

       UCX does not support STRU VMS, making MGFTP ideal for UCX
       sites connecting to anonymous FTP sites running MultiNet.

     * The MGFTP server fully supports ANONYMOUS FTP accounts.
       Anonymous accounts can be restricted to certain directories, etc.,
       as you expect from an anonymous FTP server. The MGFTP server
       is running on ftp.wku.edu, if you'd like to see its output.

     * The MGFTP server implements the REIN command, which lets you
       log out of an account and log in to another without disconnecting
       from the remote server.

     * FTP/ANONYMOUS on the DCL command line automatically logs you in as
       an anonymous user.

     * The client automatically senses the file type, so you don't have
       to remember to say "Image" or "Ascii" before transferring a file.

     * May be started without the server, supplying a client-only option.

     * Works in batch mode.

   MGFTP installs using VMSINSTAL. It is distributed with full
   documentation in the form of on-line help, PostScript, ASCII text,
   HTML, and Bookreader files. The BLISS sources are also distributed
   with the software.

MINIPROC, UTILITIES, General-Purpose Text Preprocessor

Miniproc is a small general purpose text preprocessor.   Miniproc 
is intended to be a portable, and much simpler, alternative to perl 
and M4. Miniproc is written in ANSI C. Some possible applications are: 

  1. Preprocessor for languages which do not have their own
     standard preprocessor (ie, Fortran.)  For use in preparing a
     single standard presource which is processed through
     miniproc to result in platform specific final source
     file(s). 

  2. Make-like utility for batches of HTML files. Example,
     you have many documents which all include a standard
     disclaimer on the bottom.  Change the disclaimer, and run a
     miniproc script to update the final HTML files. Or it could
     be run periodically in a batch queue to update dates within
     documents. 

  3. Mailing lists.  That is, whenever you need to generate
     many similar files which are all variants on a single
     template.

MONITORS, SYSTEM_MGMT, System Monitors for OpenVMS Alpha

Monitors for OpenVMS Alpha

CPU-Monitor (CPUMON.EXE)

Shows the CPU-Ticks for each Mode. Following modes can be set or cleaned.
	Interrupt
	MPsync
	Kernel
	Executive
	Supervisor
	User

The interval is chooseable in seconds. Default is 3 seconds.
The foreground-color will be set to brown for the primary cpu. (label
widget)

The background color shows in which RAD the cpu belongs to (if there are
RADs).


Disk-Monitor (DSKMON.EXE)

IO-Count for each disk, where the top counter shows the IOs per second
and the bottom counter shows the accumulated IO-Count. The disks are 
sorted by the accumulated counter.

There are 3 entries in the Option-Menu.

	Rescale 100	because a disk can have more than 100 IOs per
			second the scale expand automatically. This action
			resets the scale to 100.
	All disk	lists all disk available so you can simply lock 
                        on or more disk (locking directly on display is 
                        also possible)
	Reset total	resets the accumulated counter to zero for all
                        disks. 

The interval is chooseable in seconds. Default is 3 seconds.


Process-Monitor (PRCMON.EXE)

Shows the top 16 processes on system, sorted by.
	CPU
	IO
	MEM
	Processname
	Username

There are 3 graphs per process.

	1. Graph	CPU-Ticks for each mode (see legend right above
                        corner)
	2. Graph	IO (Options are DIO, BIO, BOTH)
	3. Graph	Memory (Options are Private, Global, BOTH)

To see following process data, double-click on graph
	Processname
	Username
	Processid, UIC-Group
	Image
	Affinity	can be modified
	Priority	can be modified
	Suspend/Resume	can be modified

The following filters are availabe for collecting processes

	System		take each process
	Group		take process with the same UIC-Group as entered
	Process		take process with the same Processname as entered
	User		take process with the same Username as entered

Wilcard-Input is valid.

Locking processes on display is also possible thru simple click on the
process description.


	Shadow-Monitor (SHDMON.EXE)

You see all shadowsets which perform an shadow-merge or shadow-copy and on
which node that happens.

The interval is chooseable in seconds. Default is 5 seconds.

MPACK, UTILITIES, Encode and Decode MIME Mail messages

MPACK and MUNPACK are utilities for encoding and decoding (respectively)
binary files in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) format mail
messages.

This is based on Patrick Moreau's port of MPACK/MUNPACK to OpenVMS, enhanced
and polished for submission to the OpenVMS Freware CD by Martin Vorlaender.

The files [.SRC]README.VMS and [.SRC]README.UNIX carry further information.

The supplied object and image files were built under OpenVMS/VAX 5.5-2 using
VAX C 3.2 and OpenVMS/Alpha 6.2-1H3 using DEC C 5.7.

I must admit that the code to parse VMS SMTP addresses (SMTP%"user@domain"
or MX%"..." or whatever) is a bit simple - please don't stress it too much.

The really bad message is that sending by VMS mail (via the callable
interface, as implemented) will not yield a usable MIME message because
the header lines MPACK generates are not recognized as such and sent as
part of the body.  The good message is the "MPACK -o" works and MUNPACK
will correctly decode such messages.

Also, MUNPACK only stores fixed-length 512 byte record files. When MPACKing
any other type of file (e.g. object files), restoring the correct record
format must be left to some other tool, e.g. by first ZIPping the file
(which is a good idea anyway).


To install:
===========

Copy MPACK.EXE and MUNPACK.EXE from the appropriate subdirectory ([.VAX]
or [.ALPHA]) to some convenient location.  Define - e.g. in LOGIN.COM -
foreign symbols that point at them:

  $ MPACK   :== $dev:[dir]MPACK.EXE
  $ MUNPACK :== $dev:[dir]MUNPACK.EXE

Then you can call them as described in the online help file MPACK.HLP
and MUNPACK.HLP.  These must be assembled into a help library to be
useful, e.g.

  $ LIBRARY /CREATE /HELP TOOLSHELP.HLB
  $ LIBRARY /REPLACE TOOLSHELP.HLB MPACK.HLP,MUNPACK.HLP

Online help can then be called by

  $ HELP @dev:[disk]TOOLSHELP MPACK


To build from object files:
===========================

To link the executable images from the supplied object files, just enter

  $ @LINK

in the top-level directory.


To build from sources:
======================

The source files are supplied in the [.SRC] subdirectory.  A MMS/MMK
description file is supplied.  To build, just enter

  $ MMS  ! or MMK

Using macros, the build process can be directed: Define
__VAXC__=1         to build using the VAX C compiler instead of Compaq C
__DEBUG__=1        to build a debug version
USE_GETOPT=1       if your C RTL doesn't define getopt()
USE_GETHOSTNAME=1  if your C RTL doesn't define gethostname()

You can safely ignore any %MMS-W-GWKACTNOUPD messages.  Recent versions
of Compaq C are known to throw a %CC-I-INTRINSICINT message which is
harmless as well.

MMK is available from http://www.madgoat.com/ .

The build process has been successfully tested under
OpenVMS/VAX 5.5-2 (VAX C 3.2) and 6.2 (DEC C 5.7),
OpenVMS/Alpha 6.2-1H3 (DEC C 5.7), 7.1 (DEC C 5.6) and 7.2-1 (Compaq C 6.2).

MTOOLS, UTILITIES, UNIX mtools utilities for OpenVMS Alpha

This is port of Unix mtools utilities for OpenVMS Alpha (I didn't test it
with OpenVMS VAX).

Now mtools has CLI interface for following commands (check MMD.CLD):
mcd, mdir, mdel, mread, mwrite, mcopy, mlabel, minfo, mattrib, mmd, mrd,
mmove, mren, mbadblocks, mformat

The old interface via symbols should work too:
copy mtools.exe as separate mXXXXX.exe files
msetup.com contains example of symbol definitions

Compilation:

If you have MMS installed on your machine, just type MMS to build
optimized/non-debug version of mtools and MMS/MACRO=(DEBUG=1) -
if you want to know how it works. ;)

For users without MMS there are two command procedures to build mtools:
COMP.COM and LINK.COM. You would need to modify first line of each
file to select proper build command.

I successfully built mtools on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1, DEC C V5.7-006
(included mtools.exe) and tested with floppy drive on AlphaStation 200/233.

By default, drive A: assigned to DVA0:. You can modify mtools.conf config
file to point to correct device.

VMS FOREVER!

MULTIA, SYSTEM_MGMT, Tools for booting OpenVMS on Multia systems

  Unsupported files for use of OpenVMS on Multia Alpha Systems

  Complete instructions are included IN the kits.  

  PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE PROCEEDING.

  This directory includes various versions of files that will likely
  allow OpenVMS hobbyists to bootstrap OpenVMS on the Multia (Alpha)
  system.

  Limitations:

     o Many; please read the instructions in the kit for details.

     o There is absolutely no support for OpenVMS on Multia.

     o If the kit does not work, you are entirely on your own.
       Reading the instructions might help, but there is NO support.

     o Kits are highly version-specific, and are available only for 
       specific OpenVMS releases.  As of this writing, all available 
       kits are included here and no other kits are planned, nor is 
       there any expectation of any new kits for any other OpenVMS 
       releases.

     o The PCMCIA support was completely removed, because the Intel
       chip on the Multia was not compatable with the Cirrus chip on
       the Alphabook.

       This means, of course, that you will not see and cannot use
       any PCMCIA cards on a Multia.

     o The Multia uses shared interrupts, and as a result, a special
       ZLXp-E series graphics device driver -- one that does not use
       interrupts -- is needed.  This driver is provided in the kit.

     o The serial lines don't work.

     o If you have a Multia with a PCI slot, you can't use any PCI
       card that requires interrupts.

     o The SRM console on this system is very old and very fragile.
       (This SRM console was designed only and strictly for diagnostic
       use, and was not particularly tested or used with OpenVMS.)

       YOU MUST USE THE PROVIDED SRM CONSOLE.

     o If things don't work for you, don't expect to see any OpenVMS
       updates, nor SRM console updates, nor any support.

  That said, these files have been occasionally found to work, and
  even to permit the operation of DECwindows on Multia.

  Pointers to Multia information are included in the OpenVMS FAQ.

NIST_SET, SYSTEM_MGMT, Coordinate system clock with NIST-ACTS time

This program sets the system clock from or compares it with NIST-ACTS, the
National Institute of Standards and Technology Automated Computer Time Service. 
It uses modem commands given by the user to dial the service, then reads and
responds to the messages that are sent by NIST-ACTS.  NIST-ACTS will compute
the actual round trip delay and if it receives four consecutive echos that fall
within a certain range of variation, it will calculate the round trip time and
divide by two, then send a special character in a final message to indicate
that time synchronization has been achieved.  If synchronization can be
achieved, and if the SYS$SETIME service is enabled, the program will set the
clock.  In any case, it logs all data traffic along with the difference between
the system time and NIST time.

SYS$SETIME service may be disabled on your system if it is part of a cluster or
it uses a time service like DTSS.  The program must run with both OPER and
LOG_IO privileges.

This program has worked with both a direct-connect line (TTA1 on an AS1200 and
an ES40, TTA0 on a DEC3000/600S) and with a LAT line through a terminal server
(a DS200MC) to an outgoing modem.  The LAT line synchronizes less often than the
direct-connect line because the terminal server is another source of variable
delay (the DS200MC adds its own delay of approximately 20 milliseconds).  Of
course, any connection can fail to synchronize if any resource (system, terminal
server, telephone line) is subject to variable loads.

Files in the saveset:

FREEWARE_README.TXT	This file

NIST_SET.COM		Sample com file to set the clock
NIST_SET_A.EXE		Alpha executable built on VMS v7.1-1h2

NIST_SET_DIAL.PAR	Sample modem command file
NIST_SET_HIST.LIS	Sample history list
NIST_SET_LOG.LIS	Sample data traffic log
[.SRC]NIST_SET_A.FOR	Fortran90 source

Suggested usage:

0. Look at the comments in [.SRC]NIST_SET_A.FOR.  There are explanations of all
  input and output files, messages, and suggested usage (also reproduced in
  1 - 6 below).

1. Make sure the SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL is set properly.  (See
  SYS$MANAGER:UTC$CONFIGURE_TDF.COM.)

2. Run the program with DF_SETTIME set to N.  Look at the log file to
  determine the difference between the system time and the NIST time.  If the
  difference is too large, check your system setup.

3. When you are satisfied, run the program with DF_SETTIME set to Y.

4. If you are not achieving synchronization, it's probably because the
  program is not running at a high enough priority, or, if using a LAT line,
  because the terminal server is too busy.

5. The program should work with both direct-connect and LAT terminal lines.

6. Suggested com file:
  $ on error then goto error_exit
  $ if p1 .eqs. "" then p1 := <default terminal line, for example TTA1>
  $ if p2 .eqs. "" then p2 := N

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
OUTPUT_LOGGER, UTILITIES, Capture output from multiple sources to a single file

   Applications that generate a number of small log files (detached or batch
   server processes, for example) may end up creating a large number of files
   that can fill disks and directories and make management of the information
   difficult.  These many files, in turn, are difficult to search and
   maintain and are a minimum of the disk cluster factor in size.

   By sending the contents of all of the log files to a single, common log,
   the number of files and the amount of I/O used to write and manage the logs
   can be significantly reduced.  By using a single writer to the log file
   I/O can be effectively reduced (in some cases from hundreds of I/O per
   second to less than 10 per minute).

   This module contains the routines to open and write records to a common log
   file.  This program is written in BLISS32 and works on OpenVMS VAX or
   Alpha.  Get the BLISS compiler from the OpenVMS freeware CD if you have not
   already installed it.

   This program creates a system-wide permanent mailbox called
   LOG_OUTPUT_MAILBOX.  All write I/O to that mailbox will be captured,
   stamped with the current time, the writer's PID and process name, and the
   data itself.  Every minute, if there has been any write activity to the log
   file, the file is $FLUSHed to make sure that all the data made it to disk.

   All RMS I/O is done asynch with deferred writes to the sequential file.
   Multiple writers (in a cluster for example) are allowed.

   The mailbox created by this program is allowed records up to 2048 bytes
   long.  The mailbox is created to be large enough to hold 250 records at
   maximum size.

   All I/O is done at AST level.  This program hibernates most of the time and
   just responds to write requests to the mailbox and then reads those records
   and writes them to the log file.

   If a message in the mailbox is read with the 20 byte string
   "<<>>REOPENLOGFILE!<>", the log file will be closed and a new one created.

   Privs required to run this program:	PRMMBX, SYSNAM

   Example commands to run this program:

	    $DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC LOG_OUTPUT_LOGFILE SYS$MANAGER:OUTPUT_LOGGER.TXT
	    $RUN SYS$SYSTEM:OUTPUT_LOGGER -
		    /DETACHED -
		    /AST_LIMIT=100 -
		    /BUFFER_LIMIT=100000 -
		    /ENQUEUE_LIMIT=1000 -
		    /ERROR=SYS$MANAGER:OUTPUT_LOGGER.LOG -
		    /EXTENT=1000 -
		    /FILE_LIMIT=100 -
		    /IO_BUFFERED=100 -
		    /IO_DIRECT=100 -
		    /MAXIMUM_WORKING_SET=1000 -
		    /OUTPUT=SYS$MANAGER:OUTPUT_LOGGER.LOG -
		    /PAGE_FILE=50000 -
		    /PRIORITY=10 -
		    /PRIVILEGES=(PRMMBX, SYSNAM) -
		    /PROCESS_NAME="OutputLogger" -
		    /UIC=[1,4] -
		    /WORKING_SET=1000

   Compile and Link instructions for VAX or Alpha:

	    $ BLISS/LIST/OPTIMIZE OUTPUT_LOGGER
	    $ LINK/MAP/FULL/CROSS OUTPUT_LOGGER
	    $ COPY OUTPUT_LOGGER.EXE SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]

   Example of how to re-open the log file while the output logger is running:

	    $ OPEN/WRITE/SHARE OLMBX LOG_OUTPUT_MAILBOX:
	    $ WRITE OLMBX "<<>>REOPENLOGFILE!<>"
	    $ CLOSE OLMBX

   Consider this module a template; feel free to modify as needed for your own
   uses.  No support is, however, expressed or implied.

PasLib, LANGUAGES, DEC Pascal declarations not in STARLET

PASLIB has been  developed  to  allow  Pascal  programmers  to take full
advantage of many Digital library and system routines which increase the
ease  of use, and scope of application of the language.  In  combination
with  the  Digital-supplied  programming  language  facilities  such  as
STARLET,  PASLIB  provides  the  Pascal  programmer with a comprehensive
environment for both application  and  systems programming.  It is usual
to  INHERIT environment files which contain the appropriate declarations
for the programming  environment  concerned.   The  files  available  in
STARLET are detailed in the HELP sub- topic entitled Source_Code.

Most  Run-Time  Library  and  Utility  routines  that  are  not  already
available  in  Digital-supplied software are declared in  PASLIB.   Some
routines have been omitted where the same functionality is available  in
intrinsic Pascal functions.  These intrinsic functions should be used in
preference to any equivalent RTL or Utility routines.

PERSONA, UTILITIES, Become another user using identifiers

PERSONA (Assume persona of another user)
Copyright © 1999 - Lyle W. West  All rights reserved.

------------------------------
PERSONA is a C rewrite and enhancement of the GLOGIN utility written by
Anthony C. McCracken, Northern Arizona University, in 1992.

PERSONA uses the PTD$ routines supplied by VMS and may not work on
older versions of VMS. Early in the image, if device FTA0: does not
exist, PERSONA will exit with appropriate error message.
------------------------------

PERSONA permits users to login to a named user account without having
to know the password for that account.  A process running under the
target username is created.  Its input and output are read from a
pseudo-terminal, which is controlled by PERSONA.

Unlike BECOME and SWAP, the process created by PERSONA is a full
process, with all the privileges, rights identifiers, quotas, DCL
symbols, logical names, etc. as well as whatever else that is set up
in the target user's LOGIN.COM.

PERSONA requires the target username as a parameter.  Logging out
of the PERSONA account returns the terminal device and user to the
process which originally invoked PERSONA.

You must set up a DCL foreign command to run PERSONA (since I use a
modified version of Joe Meadows CLI routines):

	$ persona == "$DISK:[DIRECTORY]PERSONA.EXE"

To log in as user SYSTEM (assuming required idenifier), simply issue:

	$ persona system

The effect will be similar to using SET HOST 0 or TELNET to connect to
local system, except there will be no Username and Password prompts.

Help is available by entering PERSONA /HELP, which provides user info.
Users of PERSONA must have the privs described in the above help routine,
copy PERSONA.EXE to SYS$SPECIFIC: and use INSTALL.COM to install the 
image. Security is not a real issue because of the identifer requirement,
or the SysMgr password entry.

PERSONA was created to permit nonprivileged users the ability to assume
the PERSONA of another user, provided they have an identifier granted to
the invoking user in the form of PERS_xxxx, where xxxx is the target
username. If the identifier is not granted to the invoking user,
a message indicating user is not authorized to assume the target user's
persona. It is designed to be an installed image with associated privs.

The identifier can be circuvented by use of the /IGNOREID command line
qualifier, where the user is then prompted to enter the system
manager's password.

This release permits minimal logging of PERSONA usage in that if within 
the LNM$SYSTEM table, the logical name PERSONA_LOG is defined and the 
equivalence string is a valid filespec, then entry and exit stats will be
recoded in this file.

HGLOGIN bliss implementation, also based on GLOGIN.

PP, LANGUAGES, Pascal Pre-processor (or Pretty Pascal)

This is PP v3.0

PP - the Pascal Pre-processor (or "Pretty Pascal")

PP takes a  DEC  Pascal  source  file  and  performs  a  number  of text
standardization tasks on it.

PP identifies four different types of symbols (or "tokens"):

   - tokens that are identified as "Pascal reserved words";
       (these are specified in a vocabulary file)
   - tokens that contain a dollar sign ($);
   - tokens that are considered as user-declared identifiers;
   - all characters not included above.

Three contexts are identified:
   - in a comment;
   - in a quoted string;
   - not in either a comment nor a quoted string.

Tokens are only identified when they do not occur in a comment nor
a quoted string.

The Pascal Pre-processor is capable of performing the following tasks:

   - each of the token types (reserved symbol, identifier and dollar
     symbol) can be converted to one of the following lexical styles:
           . all letters uppercased;
           . all letters lowercased;
           . no change from current style;
           . the first letter and each first letter following an
             underscore or dollar sign are uppercased, all other
             letters are lowercased.
   - lines which have white noise beyond the last significant
     character of a line are unequivocally truncated to the
     last significant character;
   - lines may be re-formatted as necessary to maximize the use
     of TAB characters to eliminate SPACES where possible;
   - lines which are longer than the working screen-width (either
     80 or 132 characters) are identified;

  Progress of the processing can be watched with Control-W.

To install PP:

  1. Re-link PP (NO Traceback) as directed in the build procedure.
  2. Define EXECUTIVE mode SYSTEM table logical name as required (see help).
  3. Define a foreign command: $ PP :== $device:[directory]PP
  4. Pretty Pascal!

PP is written entirely in DEC  Pascal  and  has been built and tested on
OpenVMS  VAX v6.2 (DEC Pascal v5.4) and OpenVMS Alpha v6.2 and v7.1 (DEC
Pascal v5.5).

Suggestions, comments, criticisms, bug reports, bug fixes ... all welcome.

PQM, Utilities, Print Queue Manager for Users and Operators

       Written by Jeremy Begg, VSM Software Services Pty Ltd.
          Copyright © 2000, 2001 VSM Software Development.

PQM is a screen-based utility which presents a user-friendly interface
to the OpenVMS print queue system.  It is designed for ease-of-use by
users and operators who do not wish to learn, or have no direct access
to, the DCL commands which are relevant to printer queues.

It is intended for use in environments where there is a heavy printer
load (many queues and/or many jobs) and individual users wish to have
some control over their jobs and the queues those jobs are processed
in.

PQM does not attempt to display or control batch queues.  Allowing
inexperienced users to manipulate batch queues can easily lead to
major application problems and therefore most sites find that this is
best left to those who know and understand the relevant DCL commands.

Release Notes, Documentation, and a command procedure for building PQM
can be found in the [.SRC] directory.

PYTHON, LANGUAGES, Python for OpenVMS

From http://www.python.org/:

"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. 
It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. 

Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules,
classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing.
There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various
windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily
written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for
applications that need a programmable interface. 

The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX, on
Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't listed here, 
it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for it. Ask around on
comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python yourself. 

Python is copyrighted but freely usable and distributable, even for commercial
use."

WATCHDOG, SYSTEM_MGMT, Events monitor with system manager alerts

        This is WATCHDOG V2.0-2.

        WATCHDOG is a utility for OpenVMS that performs selected
        functions at repeated intervals to monitor system events and
        activities that require the attention of system managers. 
        Problem alerts that are triggered by WATCHDOG may be delivered
        to one or more system managers via any combination of pagers,
        MAIL, REPLY, and OPCOM.

        WATCHDOG was developed by Ergonomic Solutions as a freeware
        system management utility for customers of their RamPage paging
        software product.  However, this utility does not require the
        installation of RamPage for problem alerts to be delivered via
        the OpenVMS MAIL, REPLY, and OPCOM facilities.

        For RamPage customers, this utility is better known as the
        "RamPage Watchdog Dispatcher", and therefore, this document
        uses that name in the sections that follow.  They are:

		1. RamPage Watchdog Dispatcher Operation
		2. Designating Events to Watch
		3. Sample Configurations
		4. Real-Time Watchdog Monitor for Video Terminals
		5. Contacting the Author


	------------------------------------------------------------------
	Section 1 - RamPage Watchdog Dispatcher Operation
	------------------------------------------------------------------

        The RamPage Watchdog Dispatcher is provided in the form of an
        extensive Digital Command Language (DCL) command procedure
        called WATCHDOG.COM.  This file is a template which can be
        customized for your own use by selecting certain automated
        functions.

        These functions may be used in any combination to perform
        lights-out operations, system management, and housekeeping
        operations. You must customize your watchdog setup to enable
        the desired functions, described in Table 1:

                                       period must be specified as hours,
                                       minutes, and seconds in the format
                                       HH:MM:SS. The default interval
                                       period is 10 minutes.

                                       An optional refresh period may also
 				       be specified in the format
                                       HH:MM:SS. This value determines how
                                       frequently the countdown status is
                                       refreshed for viewing by RamPage
                                       Watchdog Monitor utility. The
                                       default refresh period is 5
                                       seconds. New values must not be
                                       greater than the interval period,
                                       and should be evenly divisible by
                                       it.

	------------------------------------------------------------------
	Section 2 - Designating Events to Watch
	------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. To setup the watchdog, use a standard text editor to edit the
	   template file WATCHDOG.COM. Specify one or more desired
	   functions via the PERFORM keyword using the following syntax:

     	   $ PERFORM function-1 [parameter1] [parameter2] [parameter-n]
     	   $ PERFORM function-2 [parameter1] [parameter2] [parameter-n]
               .
               .
               .
     	   $ PERFORM function-n [parameter1] [parameter2] [parameter-n]

           All PERFORM's must be created in the appropriate section of
           the template, indicated by the text "- Start Marker -" and
	   "- End Marker -".  For more information, refer to the sample
	   configurations in the next section.

        2. To start a watchdog process, execute a command similar to the
           following at the DCL level, or somewhere within the system
           startup procedures:

           $ RUN/DETACHED/UIC=[1,4]                                -
               /INPUT=device:[directory]WATCHDOG.COM               -
               /OUTPUT=NL:                                         -
               /ERROR=device:[directory]WATCHDOG.ERR               -
               /PROCESS_NAME="Watchdog"                            -
              SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT.EXE

        3. The watchdog owner process must have the following privileges
           to perform all functions: SECURITY, CMKRNL (intrusions),
           SYSPRV, OPER (queue queries).

        4. The interval period can't vary between functions, since the
           interval period pause occurs once at the end of the function
           list. However, to perform functions at different interval
           periods, simply run multiple watchdog processes with separate
           function lists and unique process names.

        5. A valid RamPage license is not required unless you specify
           RAMPAGE as the delivery method for the NOTIFY function.


	------------------------------------------------------------------
	Section 3 - Sample Configurations
	------------------------------------------------------------------

	Sample 1:

	$ ! - Start Marker -
	$ !
	$ PERFORM INTERVAL     00:05:00
	$ PERFORM NOTIFY       "FOX" "MAIL"
	$ PERFORM DISKS        80
	$ !
	$ ! - End Marker -

        The watchdog enabled by this sequence sets the interval to five
        minutes, and username FOX as the recipient of problem notices
        delivered via OpenVMS mail. The only function performed is a
        check for disks which exceed 80% of their capacity.


	Sample 2:

	$ ! - Start Marker -
	$ !
	$ PERFORM INTERVAL     00:10:00
	$ PERFORM NOTIFY       "TYLER,GARRISON" "MAIL,REPLY"
	$ PERFORM LICENSE
	$ PERFORM NODES        "STAR,SATURN,PISCES,VENUS"
	$ PERFORM NODES        "JUPITER,MARS,PLUTO,MERCURY"
	$ PERFORM NODES        "URANUS,EARTH"
	$ PERFORM DEVICE
	$ !
	$ ! - End Marker -

        The watchdog enabled by this sequence sets the interval to ten
        minutes, and usernames TYLER and GARRISON as the recipients of
        problem notices delivered via MAIL and REPLY. Functions checked
        include licensing, inactive nodes, and device errors.


	Sample 3:

	$ ! - Start Marker -
	$ !
	$ PERFORM INTERVAL     00:10:00
	$ !
	$ PERFORM NOTIFY       "WALKER" "MAIL"
	$ PERFORM QUEUE        "STOPPED" "INVOICE_PRINTER"
	$ PERFORM QUEUE        "STOPPED" "CHECK_PRINTER"
	$ PERFORM QUEUE        "STOPPED" "PO_PRINTER"
	$ PERFORM PROCESS      "Payroll_Update" "REPORT_PRESENT"
	$ !
	$ PERFORM NOTIFY       "GARRISON" "RAMPAGE"
	$ PERFORM SYSBOOT
	$ !
	$ PERFORM NOTIFY       "GARRISON" "RAMPAGE,OPCOM"
	$ PERFORM INTRUSIONS   "ALL"
	$ PERFORM DEVICE
	$ PERFORM DISKS        95
	$ PERFORM USERNAME     "FIELD,SYSTEM"
	$ PERFORM PROCESS      "OPCOM" "REPORT_MISSING"
	$ !
	$ PERFORM NOTIFY       "GARRISON" "MAIL,REPLY"
	$ PERFORM DISKS        75
	$ PERFORM LICENSE
	$ PERFORM NODES        "MICKY,MINNIE,PLUTO,DAFFY"
	$ !
	$ ! - End Marker -

        The watchdog enabled by this sequence sets the interval to 10
        minutes, and demonstrates how to monitor several functions, with
        changing recipients and delivery methods.


	------------------------------------------------------------------
	Section 4 - Real-Time Watchdog Monitor for Video Terminals
	------------------------------------------------------------------

        A Watchdog Monitor is provided to view the real-time operation
        of the Watchdog Dispatcher.  If you are licensed to use RamPage,
        you can invoke the monitor with following DCL command:

	$ RAMPAGE/MONITOR=WATCHDOG [Return]

        If you are using the freeware version of the Watchdog
        Dispatcher, you can invoke the monitor by executing the image
        RAMPAGEWDM.EXE directly:

	$ RUN device:[directory]RAMPAGEWDM.EXE [Return]

        ...or from a DCL symbol:
        
	$ WATCHDOGMONITOR :== device:[directory]RAMPAGEWDM.EXE [Return]
	$ WATCHDOGMONITOR [Return]

        The Watchdog Monitor requires OpenVMS/Vax V5.5-2H4 or higher,
        or OpenVMS/Alpha V6.1 or higher.

RCARD, UTILITIES, Read Cardfiler cards on VT terminal

RCARD V1.5 - Read DECwindows/Motif Cardfiler card files
PCARD V1.2 - Print DECwindows/Motify Cardfiler card files

Copyright © 1999, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

RCARD is a program that will read a DECwindows CardFiler card file and
display it on non-DECwindows terminals using the SMG$ routines.  It works
with the files produced by DECwindows v5.4 and Motif v1.x (yes, the files
are different).

RCARD can be compiled with either VAX C or DEC C.  MMS or MMK should
be used to built it.

To use it, just define a symbol and give the name of the card file:

	$ rcard :== $dev:[dir]rcard.exe
	$ rcard phone			!Defaults to SYS$DISK:[].CARD

Once the file has been read into memory, a window will appear containing a
menu of card subjects.  You can scroll through the menu using up-arrow,
down-arrow, NextScreen, and PrevScreen.  When the cursor is positioned
on the subject for the card you want to see, press RETURN.  A new window
will pop up containing the text of the card.

You can scroll through the card's contents and press either "Q" or ^Z to
exit the card and go back to the subject menu.  You can also press "N" or
"P" to move to the next or previous card, respectively without closing the
card window.

CTRL-W repaints the screen.

Please note the following limitations:

  o  The file format was based on observation only; I didn't have access to
     the DECW$CARDFILER sources.  RCARD could break in the future.
  o  Card files containing DDIF images *cannot* be viewed using RCARD.  I
     never could figure out how the images were stored so that RCARD could
     skip over them.  Instead, the program bombs with a horrible access
     violation and stack dump.  So much for error checking.
  o  Card files cannot be created or modified by RCARD (the "R" stands for
     "read").  Since I couldn't identify all of the information in the
     files, I didn't want to claim to be able to write them.
  o  Really large files could crash the program.  The entire file is read
     into memory, so it is limited by whatever process limits are in
     effect.

I wrote the program because I was using the DECwindows CardFiler while at
work and didn't have any easy way to look at the information while I was
dialed in from home.  The program isn't very robust; I never store images
in the files, so it works well for me.

---------------
PCARD reads DECwindows/Motif Cardfiler card files and generates a TeX
output file that will produce two-column output showing the contents of
each card.  The TeX source file NEWSLETTER.TEX is required.

	$ pcard :== $dev:[dir]pcard.exe
	$ pcard phone		!Creates PHONE.TEX
	$ tex "\input newsletter   \input phone"

RESET_PASSWD, SYSTEM_MGMT, Helpdesk Password Change Utility 

  
    Permits non-priv'd user to change password for groups of users whose
    UAF group id is higher than the value of PWDMINGROUP which needs to
    defined in the system logical name table. User must enter the nonechoed
    password twice to complete successfully. In the event target user
    is DISUSER'ed, this image will exit with approriate message, and
    target password remains unchanged. Copy RESET_PASSWD.EXE to the system
    directory sys$sysroot:[sysexe] and change file protection to w:e to
    permit initial image activation. Then execute install.com. Define:
  
        DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC PWDMINGROUP 210
  
    where 210 represents (in octal) the minimum group number which the
    reset_passwd tool will permit setting of a users' password. As 
    distributed, RESET_PASSWD will exit with an error if the above logical
    name is not defined in the system logical name table. Also, define
    a foreign symbol to invoke the reset_passwd image:
  
        reset_passwd == "$reset_passwd.exe"
  
    Additionally, the invoking user is checked to see if rights identifier
    PWD_SETPASS has been granted. If not, the image will exit with an error.

    The provided images are VMS 7.2(-1) and DecC 6.2 but there should be no
    problem rebuilding in other environments. The utility checks for the
    required privs and identifiers, but use with approriate caution.

RWMBX, SYSTEM_MGMT, Identifies which mailbox caused RWMBX

Identifies which mailbox is causing an RWMBX process state. 
 
A process enters an RWMBX state when it attempts to write a message that is 
bigger than the remaining space in a mailbox.  The writer remains in RWMBX 
until another process frees up sufficient room in the mailbox by reading 
messages that are already qued there.  RWMBX is typically caused by a reader 
that has unexpectedly terminated, faulty logic in the reader process or 
overwhelming mailbox thruput generated by several writers.  In the case of 
multiple writing processes, the writer with the smallest message gets priority. 
Processes with larger messages may find themselves stuck in RWMBX. 
 
Short of learning SDA fairly well, it is difficult to determine which mailbox 
is causing the problem.  RWMBX attempts to identify the offending mailbox by 
providing information that is currently not visible using VMS utilities. 
Specifically, the initial mailbox buffer, the remaining buffer and a count of 
queued messages is displayed for every mailbox.  On a well tuned system, 
initial buffer is equal to remaining buffer and the qued message count is zero.  
In other words all messages are being instantly read.  Conversely, a mailbox 
causing an RWMBX state will have a nonzero qued message count and a remaining 
buffer near zero (or at least smaller than the message the writer is attempting 
to send).   
 
 
			RUNNING RWMBX 
 
First define RWMBX as a foreign image. 
	$ RWMBX:==$[disk]:[directory]RWMBX.EXE 
 
 
Invoke RWMBX to display information on all mailboxes on the screen: 
	$ RWMBX 
 
To direct RWMBX output to a file and not to the screen: 
	$RWMBX >filename 
 
To monitor a single mailbox continously: 
For example to monitor mailbox MBA99 once a second, 
	$RWMBX <99 
 
 
Please note the EXE provided is Alpha only produced under VMS 6.2.  If you 
need to run RWMBX under VMS 7.1, the object will have to be relinked. 
See the source file RWMBX.C for compile and link instructions.

"Safety V1.5
Comprehensive Data Safety for your VMS systems.

from General Cybernetic Engineering

Executive Summary:

There are many perils your data faces, and loss of data can cost
time, money, and jobs. Intruders, disgruntled insiders, or
hidden flaws in installed software can destroy records. What is
more, mistaken losses occur constantly.

Safety protects your system and your critical data in three
ways:

1. A comprehensive security system adds extra checks for access
to VMS files so that access by intruders or by people in
non-job-required ways can be regulated or prevented. This allows
your business - critical data to finally be protected against
misuse, tampering, or abuse. Access from programs doing
background dirty work (viruses, Trojans, worms, and the like, or
even programs with security holes which can be exploited
remotely (like Java browsers)) can also be blocked without
damaging normal use. This active protection works three ways: by
checking integrity    of your files against tampering, by
preventing of  untrusted images from  gaining privilege, and by
regulating what other parts of the system an image may access.

2. A deletion protection system provides a way to undelete files
which were deleted by mistake and to optionally copy deleted
files to backup facilities before removal. Unlike all other VMS
"undelete" programs on the market, this facility does not rely
on finding the disk storage that contained the file and
reclaiming it before it is overwritten. Rather, it changes the
semantics of the file system delete to use a "wastebasket"
system and captures the file intact. Thus, this system works
reliably. No others do. This facility is also useful where you
have a requirement to keep all files of a certain set of types,
since the backup function can be used to capture such files
while permitting otherwise normal system function. The shelving
or linking functions are also available for moving copies
offline if this is desired. The  Safety protection features are
fully integrated with the DPS subsystem, so that deletion
protection does not involve destroying file security.

3.  When space runs out, hasty decisions about what to keep
online often must be made, and the risk of accidentally losing
something important is high.   Safety protects you from running
out of space. Space can be monitored and older items in the
wastebasket deleted if it is becoming low, without manual
intervention. In addition, Safety  is able to "shelve" files so
that they are stored anywhere else desired on your system, and
they are brought back automatically when accessed. Thus no
manual arrangements need be made for reloading them.  Safety can
also keep the files on secondary storage, keeping a "soft link"
to the files at their original site so they will be accessed on
the secondary storage instead. Also,    Safety can store files
compressed, or can store them on secondary storage so that read
access is done on the secondary storage, but write access causes
the file to be copied back to its original site. Standard VMS
utilities are used for all file movement, and moved files are
also directly accessible in their swapped sites with standard
VMS utilities. The VMS file system remains completely valid at
all times."

SDCL, LANGUAGES, Structured DCL Preprocessor

03-Oct-2000, munroe@csworks.com

Many years ago, this preprocessor was written to provide
"structured programming" constructs (if-then-else, loops, etc.)
for DCL.  In many ways it is still more useful than "vanilla"
DCL, in particular for quickly building large, complex DCL
procedures.  It has been used here at Cottage Software Works (and
before that at Acorn Software) for many years and, despite it's
limitations, provides good duty when "non-trivial" DCL
programming needs to be done.

Dick Munroe

02-Jun-95 Dick Munroe munroe@acornsw.com

Changes:

1. added an on statusCondition { statements } block to sdcl.
2. Variable substitution ('varable') and quoted strings are preserved.
3. Loops emit $NEXT and $BREAK variables which are labels to be used
by DCL commands such as read which have /ERROR processing.

Use it in good health.

This directory contains the SDCL (Structured DCL) compiler files. These
include the source files and the documentation files. Here is what you
should have if the tape restore worked ok:

AAAREADME.TXT		The file you are reading

BUN.DCL			Example of structured DCL code

DEFS.H, LEX.C, OUTPUT.C, SDCL.C, STACK.C, STMT.C,
  TCODES.H		Files with C source of SDCL compiler

LASER.DCL,LASER.COM	another example of SDCL input and generated ouput.

MAKEFILE.COM		Command procedure that makes SDCL.EXE

SDCL.EXE		The executable file created under VMS 4.1

SDCLPROJ.DOC		A detailed documentation on the inner workings
			of SDCL compiler. Formatted with UNIX nroff.
			Can be printed on any printer.
SDCLPROJ.NR		UNIX nroff source of SDCL.DOC

SDCLPROJ.TEX            The detailed documentation in TeX input form.
MYFORMAT.TEX            File included in SDCL.TEX when latter is run
			through TeX

SDCL.MEM		A brief guide to SDCL and and how to invoke the
			compiler
SDCL.RNO		DSR source for SDCL.MEM

To get SDCL up and running, you need the DEC C compiler. If you have it,
run the command procedure in MAKEFILE.COM and then install SDCL as a
foreign command:

	$ @makefile
	$! now in your login.com, add the line
	$ sdcl :== $[directory-path]:sdcl
	$! replace "directory-path" with the complete directory
	$! path name to where the sdcl.exe resides.

If you donot have the C compiler, you can simply use the executable 
SDCL.EXE included. It was created under VMS 4.1. 

I have compiled the sources with the UNIX C compiler on the SUN workstation
and HP-UX. The program runs without any change. This implies that you donot 
have the DEC C compiler, try using the DECUS C compiler. This may, hopefully
work.

I will welcome any comments, bug reports, fixes and any other suggestions.
If you make any enhancements, please let me.

SDL, LANGUAGES, Data Structure/Interface Definition Language

  EV1-64

  This tool is a data definition language and is used to convert a 
  language-independent definition file (an SDL input file) into a 
  language-dependent definition file.  Alone or in conjunction with 
  mechanisms such as the OpenVMS MESSAGE/SDL command (a latent and
  undocumented qualifier which converts the .MSG file into an SDL
  file) and the Freeware GNM tool, the SDL tool can be used to 
  maintain common sources for a wide variety of language files.

  This version of SDL includes images for use on OpenVMS VAX systems 
  (in [.VAX_IMAGES]) and on OpenVMS Alpha (in [.ALPHA_IMAGES]) 
  systems.  These images were built with/for/on OpenVMS V7.3.

  The provided SDL.COM procedure will create logical names for the 
  correct set of images for the local system architecture, and will

SKEY, System_Mgmt, Secure one-time key login system for VAX and Alpha

S/Key is a login authentication method, using one-time key generation
in response to a "challenge".  The S/Key system is described in
RFC-1760 and RFC-1938.

The advantage of one-time keys is that such techniques as "packet
sniffing" cannot be used: each login requires a different key that is
derived in a secure fashion from a secret key that is never
transmitted during an authentication session.

Unlike Kerberos, S/Key does not require modification or special
versions of client programs such as Telnet, FTP, etc., and generally
it does not require connections to be made on special port numbers.

SKEY 0.9 for VMS provides a LGI$ callout to produce S/Key challenges,
and to verify logins.  S/Key authenticated logins are normally
optional, but can be user-configured to be default or manditory.  A
/[NO]SKEY qualifer on the login username can select or deselect S/Key
authentication when allowed by the configuration.

An SKEY command verb is provided for calculating S/Key responses as
well as allowing users to set up their S/Key logins.   Utility routines
are provided to aid in making application programs "S/Key capable".

Full source code is provided, along with object files compiled on VMS 6.2.

SOCKETSHR, NETWORKING, TCP/IP socket library

SOCKETSHR is a TCP/IP package independent socket library for OpenVMS (VAX and
Alpha).  All TCP/IP packages come with their own socket library, why do we need
another one?

The advantage of SOCKETSHR is that it is implemented as a shared image which
can be used with all well known TCP/IP packages.  Programs linked to it may run
on all of them *without relinking*.

This makes it possible to use only one executable if different TCP/IP packages
are used in a network.  It makes it much easier to distribute a program in
binary form to the public.  Many programs like ARCHIE, GOPHER, MOSAIC, FINGER,
TALK, etc.  may benefit from being linked against SOCKETSHR and distributed as
binaries.

SOCKETSHR also supports the standard i/o routines like fputs() etc.

TELL, NETWORKING, Executes DCL Commands on Remote Nodes via DECnet

 This command procedure will execute commands on a remote node.

 The command syntax for tell is :-
 @TELL[/output=filename] NODENAME[,...] DCL-COMMAND [&] [|...]

   P1 - NODENAME:
    More than one nodename can be specified, each being seperated by a comma.
    Nodename can be a symbol 
    Nodename can be a file containing a list of nodes (one node per line)
      specified by an @ prefix (@file). The default extension is .dat.
      Comments should start with a ! or #.
    A double colon (::) after the nodename is optional and specifies
      decnet transport. 
    A single colon (:) after the nodename specifies tcpip transport.
    "0" can be used to specify the local nodename.
    If you do not have proxy access then you can specify access control 
      information as part of the nodename specification (node"user password")
    You can force a routing path by specifiy nodename of the from
      nodename::nodename::
    If in command mode and two or more nodenames are specified then on 
      completion TELL displays a summary listing of unreachable nodes. This 
      feature can be disabled by defining the logical name as follows:-
      $ DEFINE/PROCESS/NOLOG TELL_INHIBIT_SUMMARY TRUE
    If node not specified then the symbol tell_default_nodes is used if
      defined.

   P2 to P8 - DCL COMMAND:
    INTERACTIVE MODE:
      If no DCL command is specified then you will be in interactive mode.
      At that point you will have a DCL session in the context of the remote
        node. The standard EXIT command will return you to your local node.
      If a decnet nodename is specified then the tell decnet object will be 
        used to process the command on the remote node.
      If a tcpip nodename is specified then an rlogin command is used
        used to process the command on the remote node. A password can
        be specified but will not be used.
    COMMAND MODE:
      Here the DCL commands are specified in P2 to P8 and are separated 
        by a vertical bar "|". Quotes are optional and are only required to
        reduce the number of P parameters.
      If a decnet nodename is specified then the tell decnet object will be 
        used to process the command on the remote node.
      If a tcpip nodename is specified then an rsh command is used
        used to process the command on the remote node. 
    DETACHED MODE:
      Jobs can be run in the background as a detached process by 
      suffixing the & (unix background command) to any command.
      This can be done from either Interactive or Command Mode.

    Note that you cannot issue commands that require terminal input such as 
    EDIT etc. This is a restriction of the DECnet task-task software and not
    of TELL itself. Some of these restrictions can be overcome by defining 
    the verb as a foreign command. This allows many commands to be entered on 
    a single line.
        eg. $ AUTHORIZE :== $AUTHORIZE
            $ AUTHORIZE SHOW KINGSMILL
     
   QUALIFIERS:
    /Output can be used to direct the output to a filename.


   EXAMPLES:

   $ TELL :== @SYS$MANAGER:TELL.COM
        All the following examples assume that the tell symbol is defined.
        Place this in your login.com.

   $ TELL MVAX,UNIXA"geoffk":
        This command will allow you to interactively enter commands
        on both MVAX and UVAX. Default proxy access is used to MVAX
	  and the geoffk account will be used on UNIXA (unix machine).

   $ TELL MVAX SHOW ERROR
        This command relies on proxy access to MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX.

   $ TELL UNIXA: "date"
        This command relies on proxy access to UNIXA. 
        It does an "$RSH UNIXA date" command.

   $ TELL_DEFAULT_NODES == "MVAX"
   $ TELL "" SHOW ERROR
        This command uses the symbol tell_default_nodes to obtain the
 	  nodename and relies on proxy access to node MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX.

   $ TELL/OUTPUT=SYS$LOGIN:TELL.OUT MVAX SHOW ERROR
        This command relies on proxy access to MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX with the output
           directed to the file sys$login:tell.out

   $ TELL MVAX"KINGSMILL PASSWORD":: SHOW ERROR
        this command supplies access control to accounts that do not have 
        proxy access

   $ TELL MVAX"KINGSMILL":: SHOW ERROR
        Under VMS V5.x you can have a number of different proxy users pointed
        to one account. This example show how to gain access to a non-default
        proxy account. Note that only the username needs to be specified.

   $ TELL MVAX,TVAX,SVAX SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ DECA_CLUSTER :== MVAX,TVAX,SVAX
   $ TELL 'DECA_CLUSTER' SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ TYPE DECA_CLUSTER.DAT
   MVAX
   TVAX
   SVAX
   $ TELL @DECA_CLUSTER SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ TELL MVAX,UVAX: "SHOW ERROR"|"SHOW NET"
        this command will do both a show error and a show net on 
        MVAX (using DECnet) and UVAX (using TCPIP [RSH]).

   $ TELL MVAX,TVAX "SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=MAXPS1" | "CREATE/TERM &"
        this command will create a detached decterm on both MVAX and TVAX

   $ TELL MVAX
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> SHOW ERROR
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> SET PROC/PRIV=OPER
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> MCR NCP SHOW EXEC
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> EXIT
   $
        This is an example of an interactive session. The prompt indicates
        the remote nodename and username, whilst the ">>" is used to
        distinguish between a local and remote session. 
    
   $ TELL MVAX TELL TVAX SHOW ERROR
   $ TELL MVAX::TVAX:: SHOW ERROR
        Both of these commands perform the same function. 
        The first performs a nested TELL, ie. TELL node MVAX to TELL node
          TVAX to do a $ show error. Only command mode is valid with 
          this syntax and you must specify the command as TELL not @tell.
        The second example show how to do the same thing using Poor Mans
          Routing (PMR). This is far more efficent than the first examples
          and it supports both command and interactive modes.

   CONFIGURATION SETUPS:
     This file needs to exist on the local node and the remote node if a decnet
     nodename is specified. It requires the user to either specify node access 
     control or for the remote account to be set up for proxy access. TELL can 
     simply reside in sys$login on the remote node, which requires each user to 
     have their own copy -or- TELL can be defined as a DECnet object, requiring 
     each system to have only one copy.
   
     To install TELL as a network object the system manager should enter the
     following commands:
   DECnet/IV
     $ MCR NCP
     NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TELL NUMBER 0 FILE SYS$MANAGER:TELL.COM PROXY BOTH
     NCP> SET OBJECT TELL ALL
     NCP> EXIT
     $
   DECnet/OSI
     $@sys$startup:net$configure application_add tell "" -
     "{name=tell}||sys$manager:tell.com|true|true|true|true|true||||1" 

    If TELL is not installed as a network object then by default no other setups
    are required. However if the DECnet object task has been modified to disable
    proxy access then tell will fail. In this case the system manager should 
    enter the following ncp command or equivalent ncl command.
     $ MCR NCP
     NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TASK PROXY BOTH
     NCP> SET OBJECT TASK ALL
     NCP> EXIT
     $

     PROXY accounts allow one user direct access to another users account
     without having to specify username and password. 
   DECNET
     The system manager can set up proxy account access from within AUTHORIZE. 
     Example:  $ MCR AUTHORIZE>
               UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL KINGSMILL/DEFAULT
               UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::OLSENK KINGSMILL
               UAF> EXIT
   TCPIP:
     To prevent the need to use passwords on the RSH command proxies can be
     set up to authorize remote user access. To set up remote user access
     on a UNIX machine, or TCPWARE/MULTINET under VMS you specify the remote
     node and username in the .rhosts file which resides in the users home
     directory. With UCX you use the "UCX> ADD PROXY command"
      Example:  [TCPWARE/MULTINET]
                 $type sys$login:.rhosts 
                 mvax kingsmill
                 mvax olsenk
                 $
               [UNIX]
                 #more .rhosts 
                 mvax kingsmill
                 mvax olsenk
               [UCX]
                 UCX> ADD PROXY KINGSMILL/HOST=MVAX/REMOTE_USER=KINGSMILL
                 UCX> ADD PROXY KINGSMILL/HOST=MVAX/REMOTE_USER=OLSENK

     This examples allows remote user KINGSMILL and OLSENK on node MVAX
     into the local KINGSMILL account. The default switch enables you to
     specify just the nodename when addressing this node:-
       eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX::
     If Default access is not specified then you need to specify the 
     nodename and username when addressing this node:-
       eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"KINGSMILL"::
     If you do not have proxy access then you need to specify the   
     nodename, username and password when addressing a remote node:-
       eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"KINGSMILL password"::

     The following logicals can be used to alter the default TELL behaviour.
     TELL_INHIBIT_SUMMARY to disable the statistics printout.
     SYS$SCRATCH - temporary files are written to sys$scratch. If you don't
       want the temporary files written to sys$login then define sys$scratch.

   TROUBLESHOOTING:
     The following logicals can be used to aid in troubleshooting.
     TELL_VERBOSE to display the progress of both local and remote events.
       This can also be enabled by setting the version prefix from "V" to "X"
     TELL_VERIFY to turn on verify and verbose.
     Netserver.log on the remote node may also aid in troubleshooting.
     TELL_'pid'_*.TMP temporary file on the remote node shows the created
       command file if detached qualifier was specified.
     TELL_'pid'_*.LOG temporary file on on the remote node showing the output
       from tell_'pid'_*.tmp

TELNETSYM, UTILITIES, Example of modifying OpenVMS Print Symbiont

   This program is an example of how the standard VMS print symbiont can be 
customized to support printers over TCP/IP networks.  The program
replaces two of the VMS symbiont routines, "output" and "job setup", you
may wish to replace other routines based on your specific requirements.
This code is designed for use with DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (UCX),
though it should also work with the third-party products providing a
BGDRIVER emulation facility.

   This code has been evaluated and tested for its intended purpose, however 
all possible scenarios have not been exercised.  I would suggest complete 
and thorough testing appropriate for your application if you plan to use
this in any type of "production" environment.

     About this Symbiont:

	o PostScript support is limited - PostScript banner pages
          are not generated, and no special functionality to
          recognize PostScript files and place the printer in
          PostScript mode is included
	
        o Error/Log messages are written to the file pointed to by 
	  the logical TELNETSYM_LOGFILE.  If this logical is not 
	  defined then messages are written to SYS$SYSTEM:TELNETSYM.LOG

        o If a host is unreachable then connection attempts will
          be performed every 3 minutes.  (This is presently hardcoded)

 	o links to the remote host are disconnected if idle for more
	  than 2 minutes.

	o The symbiont has been tested with the CISCO STSX10 and 
	  DECSERVER 300 terminal servers.
	

 Using the Print Symbiont:

     Build the symbiont and copy the image to sys$system:

       $ CC TELNETSYM        (use /STANDARD=VAXC if compiling with DEC C)
       $ LINK TELNETSYM, SYS$SHARE:UCX$IPC/LIB, SYS$SHARE:VAXCRTL/LIB
       $ COPY TELNETSYM.EXE SYS$SYSTEM:

     To start a queue using the symbiont do the following:

       $ INIT/QUE/PROCESS=TELNETSYM/START/ON="server_ip_nodename:port_number" 
  

     For example, the command to start the queue "TCP_PRINTER" which should
     send output to a printer connected to a DECserver 300 with 
     an IP node name of TCPSERVER listening on port 2007 would be:  

       $ INIT/QUE/PROCESS=TELNETSYM/START/ON="TCPSERVER:2007" TCP_PRINTER

TeX, MISCELLANEOUS, TeX Typesetting

This is the OpenVMS version of Donald Knuth's TeX typesetting
package.

There were some discussions about the availability of TeX on VMS.
Especially one user sent me a mail where he told me that the TeX
version on the Freeware 4 CD was dated 1995 and that he got the
actual version from the US DECUS site. This was surprising to me 
since I thought that the 1997 version, which I submitted to DECUS
Germany, made it to the US chapter and onto the Freeware CD. So
here is the VMS TeX as of 1997. All images have been compiled on
VMS 6.2 and should work on later versions. If not one may at first
relink the images before recompiling them. Some of the supplied
utilities are now out-of-date, but this is not important. Any
installation will of course update the LaTeX and other macro packages.
This should be no problem if one reads the VMS_TEX_MGR.GUIDE in the
manager directory. Since I now have some more time and resources
available (incl. a DS10 at home) I can work more extensive on the
next version.

Ralf G"artner , 2001

gaertner@cthulhu.westfalen.de , gaertner@decus.decus.de



P.S.  TeX is Y2K compliant, the only "bug" is in one of the output
      routines, where only two digits are used.


============================================================================

 To install TeX on OpenVMS perform the following steps:

 0) copy the distribution (either the ZIP archive or the save-sets)
    to the root directory of the disk that shall hold TeX

 1.1) if you got the CTAN archive (TEX97_CTAN.ZIP) extract the archive
    with UNZIP 5.x into TEX97_CTAN.BCK and restore the save-set with
    the BACKUP utility; this will create the TeX tree under
    <disk>:[TEXMF...]
    The ZIP archive has the OpenVMS record attributes included so one
    really needs the OpenVMS version of UNZIP.

 1.2) if you got the DECUS archives (TEX97_%%%.BCK) restore at least
    TEX97_EXE.BCK and TEX97_FNT.BCK with the BACKUP utility; this will
    create the TeX tree under <disk>:[TEXMF...]

 2) delete any the directories starting with two underscores, __*.DIR . 
    these directories should be empty and have been used during the
    development. if they contain some files, please notify us, since
    you found a bug in the distribution procedure.

 3) define the basic logicals by

      DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC                        TEX_DISK   <disk>
      DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC/TRANSLATION=CONCEALED  TEX_ROOT   TEX_DISK:[TEXMF.]
      DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC                        TEX_USAGE  CLD 

    in your SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGICALS.COM

 4) define the remaining logicals after <disk> has been mounted in
    SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM or your local startup procedure by

      @TEX_ROOT:[EXE.COMMON]TEX_LOGICALS.COM

 5) add the following to SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM or the login procedure
    defined by SYS$SYLOGIN:

      @TEX_EXE:TEX_COMMANDS.COM

 After a reboot TeX will be available. For other installation opportunities
 see TEX_ROOT:[MGR]VMS_TEX_MGR.GUIDE .

 One may find some objects/images in the [SRC...] and [EXE...] tree. Those
 in the [EXE..] tree have been recompiled; those in the [SRC...] tree have
 been fetched from other archives. To save space, one may delete some of the. 

 The file LAST_MINUTE.BUGS in [TEXMF.MGR] describes some bugs found prior
 to the creation of the distribution. All these bugs and oddities will
 (hopefully) be fixed in the next release.

 Important:
 ---------
 Sites who fetched TeX from CTAN will have a basic TeX installation. These
 sites should read the whole TEX_ROOT:[MGR]VMS_TEX_MGR.GUIDE . They will
 need additonal files CTAN (for example Metafont sources). A complete
 file list is given by [MGR]FILES.LIST . 

 Sites who got TeX from DECUS will have a complete installation if they
 installed TEX97_SRC.BCK and TEX97_DOC.BCK. Even if these save-sets have
 not been restored, they will have a complete run-time version.


 Bug reports should be send to one of the addresses below.

    README.TXT

  The TMS_PAK.COM file will register and load a License Management
  Facility (LMF) Product Authorzation Key (PAK) for TSM. You may or
  may not need to execute this VMS command file, depending on the 
  availability of a TSM license in LMF.

    $ @tsm_pak.com

  The TSM021.DCX_VAXEXE file is an OpenVMS / VAX executable file.
  To extract the contents on a VAX system, run it .  

    $ run tsm021.dcx_vaxexe 

  The TSM021.DCX_AXPEXE file is an OpenVMS / AXP executable file.
  To extract the contents on a Alpha system, run it .  

    $ run tsm021.dcx_axpexe

  You will get a resultant file (name dependent on what you told 
  the decompression utility to use for an output file name), which
  is an Open VMS SAVESET.

    e.g. TSM021.SAV

  Create a working directory, for example:

    $ create /directory [.tms]

  Don't do this in an area (default directory) that is a VMS 
  LOGICAL that uses those funky VMS search lists.  Examples of 
  this are:

    SYS$MANAGER: and SYS$UPDATE:
        
  Extract the saveset into the working directory:

    $ backup tsm021.sav /sav [.tsm...]

  Then execute the OpenVMS installation procedure in the normal 
  fashion:

    $ @sys$update:vmsinstal

  The location of the kit directory should be the fully specified
  path to the [.KIT] subdirectory in the working directory you
  created (e.g. DKA100:[JOE.TSM.KIT]).  Don't specify the path
  using system logicals for the disk; use the disk device name.

  The softcopy manuals are to be found in the [.DOCUMENTATION]
  subdirectory of the working directory that you created
  (e.g. DKA100:[JOE.TSM.DOCUMENTATION]).

  Enjoy!

The GET_MY_SERVER_SETUP.COM is a modified version of the
GET_SERVER_SETUP.COM that shipped with the Terminal
Server Manager (TSM) product.

The modifications allow it to save services defined on
the server, and also to save parameters LANTRONIX
EPS-1 terminal servers.

Please note that the command file does not save the
LAT license key on a LANTRONIX terminal server.


The UPLOAD_ALL_SERVERS.COM will go through the TSM

							*VMS* *vms*
This file contains the particularities for the VMS version of Vim.

2. Download files	|vms-download|
3. Compiling		|vms-compiling|
4. Problems		|vms-problems|
5. Deploy		|vms-deploy|
6. Practical usage	|vms-usage|
7. GUI mode questions	|vms-gui|
8. Useful notes		|vms-notes|
9. Authors 		|vms-authors|

==============================================================================
1. Getting started					*vms-started*

VIM (Vi IMproved) is a vi-compatible text editor that runs on nearly every
operating system known to humanity.  Now use Vim on Open VMS too, in character
or X/Motif environment.  It is fully featured and absolutely compatible with
VIM on other operating systems.
==============================================================================
2. Download files					*vms-download*

You can download the VIM source code by ftp from the official VIM site:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/
Or use one of the mirrors:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/MIRRORS

You will need both the Unix and Extra archives to build vim.exe for VMS.
For using VIM's full power you will need the runtime files as well.

You can download precompiled executables from:
	http://www.polarfox.com/vim/

==============================================================================
3. Compiling						*vms-compiling*

Unpack the Unix and Extra archives together into one directory.  In the <.SRC>
subdirectory you should find the make file OS_VMS.MMS.  By editing this file
you may choose between building the character, GUI and debug version.

You will need either the DECSET mms utility or the freely available clone of
it called mmk (VMS has no make utility in the standard distribution).  I found
a binary of 'mmk' which worked well.

If you have MSS on your system, the command
>	MMS /DESCRIP=OS_VMS.MMS
will start building your own customized version of VIM.

==============================================================================
4. Problems						*vms-problems*

The code has been tested under Open VMS 6.2-7.1 and with the DECC compiler.
It should work without bigger problems.  If it happened that your system does
not have some include libraries you can tune up in OS_VMS_CONF.H file.
Note: Under VAX it should work with DECC compiler without problem, but the
code is not compilable with the old VAXC compiler.
==============================================================================
5. Deploy						*vms-deploy*

Vim uses a special directory structure to hold the document and runtime files:

   vim (or wherever)
    |- tmp
    |- vim56
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax

Use:
>	assign/nolog dev:[leading-path-here.vim56] vimruntime
>	assign/nolog dev:[leading-path-here.vim56.tmp] tmp

to get vim.exe to find its document, filetype, and syntax files, and to
specify a directory where temporary files will be located.  Copy the "runtime"
subdirectory of the vim distribution to vimruntime.

==============================================================================
6. Practical usage					*vms-usage*

Copy all VIM runtime directory structure to the deployment position.
Add the following things to your LOGIN.COM (in SYS$LOGIN directory).
Set up logical $VIM as:

>	$ define vim device:<path>

Set up some symbols:

>	$ ! vi starts vim in chr. mode.
>	$ vi*m  :== mcr device:<path>VIM.EXE

>	$ gvi starts vim in GUI mode.
>	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait mcr device:<path>VIM.EXE -g

>	$ ! normal vt300-80 is not defined. let us use ansi instead.
>	$ define term "ansi"

Create .vimrc and .gvimrc files in your home directory (SYS$LOGIN).
The easiest way is just rename example files.  You may leave the menu file
(MENU.VIM) in the original $VIM directory.

It should work without any problem. Example LOGIN.COM:

>	$ vi*m  :== mcr RF10:[UTIL.VIM]VIM.EXE
>	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait mcr RF10:[UTIL.VIM]VIM.EXE -g
>	$ define vim RF10:[UTIL.VIM]
>	$ define term "ansi"
>	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159/trans=tcpip

==============================================================================
7. GUI mode questions					*vms-gui*

VMS is not a native X window environment so you can not start VIM in GUI mode
"just like that".
1) If you are working on the VMS X console:
   Start VIM with the command:
>	$ mc device:<path>VIM.EXE -g
   or type :gui as a command to the VIM command prompt.

2) If you are working on other X window environment
   Set up display to your host with:
>	$ set disp/create/node=<your IP address>/trans=tcpip
   and start VIM as in point 1.

3) If you are working on MS Windows or other non X window environment
   You need to set up one X server and run VIM as in point 2.
   For MS Windows there are available free X servers as MIX , Omni X etc.

==============================================================================
8. Useful notes						*vms-notes*

8.1 backspace/delete.

There are backspace/delete key inconsistencies with VMS.
:fixdel doesn't do the trick, but the solution is:

>	" for terminal mode
>	inoremap ^? ^H

>	" for gui modE
>	inoremap <Del> ^H

(Bruce Hunsaker <BNHunsaker@chq.byu.edu> VIM 5.3)

8.2 Filters.

VIM supports filters; ie. if you have a sort program that can handle
input/output redirection like Unix (<infile >outfile), you could use

>	map \s 0!'aqsort<CR>

(Charles E. Campbell, Jr. <cec@gryphon.gsfc.nasa.gov> VIM 5.4)

8.3 VMS file version numbers.

If you want VIM to save into a new file with the next higher file version
number, try these settings.
>	set nobackup
>	set nowritebackup

(Claude Marinier <ClaudeMarinier@xwavesolutions.com> VIM 5.5 )

8.4 Directory conversion.

VIM will internally convert any unix-style paths and even mixed unix/VMS
paths into VMS style paths. Some typical conversions resemble:

	/abc/def/ghi	      -> abc:[def]ghi.
	/abc/def/ghi.j	      -> abc:[def]ghi.j
	/abc/def/ghi/jkl/mno  -> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	abc:[def.ghi]jkl/mno  -> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	  ./				-> current directoty
	  ../				-> relative parent directory
	  <.def.ghi>		-> relative child directory

(David Elins <delins@foliage.com>, Jerome Lauret
<JLAURET@mail.chem.sunysb.edu> VIM 5.6 )

VNCVIEWER, NETWORKING, A VNC viewer client for OpenVMS

A new version of the VNC Viewer for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha is now
available. The VNCviewer lets you connect to a VNC server running on
another system.

VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing.  It is, in essence, a remote
display system which allows you to view a computing "desktop"
environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from
anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine
architectures.

In particular, I use VNC on my AlphaStation to control my
PCs---essentially, I get a PC in an X window, with my VMS keyboard and
mouse movements used to control the PC.  What you see in the PC window
is an exact replica of your PC screen.

You can find out more about VNC, and download viewers and servers for
other platforms (in particular, to control a PC from VMS, you'll need
to download the VNC Server for Windows), check out the original AT&T
VNC site:

http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/index.html

The VNC333R1VMS011 package contains V1.1 of the VMS VNC Viewer, which
is based on VNC V3.3.3r1.  The port to VMS was performed by Hunter
Goatley and David North.  It comes as a VMSINSTAL kit, and provides
VNCVIEWER and VNCPASSWD images for both VAX and Alpha.  Note that a
VNC server for VMS is not included, though I hope to look into the
possibility of adding it sometime.

You can get the VMS VNC Viewer using one of the following URLs:

WATCH_MAIL, UTILITIES, Automatically reply to (and/or copy) new mail


  --- DESCRIPTION ---

The purpose of this procedure is to automatically reply to new mail
with a specified message for a specified time interval, and possibly
also copy that mail to one or more other users.  For example, if you
are on vacation or away on business, the replies can be used to let
others know that you won't be able to respond to their mail for some
period of time, and also possibly inform them of other people they
might consider contacting in your absence.  The copies (if enabled)
might be checked by someone else to see if something urgent comes up
in your absence.

  --- INSTALLATION ---

Simply copy the procedure to a private or shared directory:

    $ COPY/LOG  FREEWARE$CD:[WATCH_MAIL]WATCH_MAIL.COM  <destination>

The advantage of a shared location is that it allows multiple people
to use the procedure without incurring the disk space costs of multiple
copies.  The procedure provides several features for facilitating the
use and management of such a shared copy.

  --- USAGE ---

Invoke the procedure interactively (e.g., @WATCH_MAIL), answering the
questions and providing input files as requested.  A batch job will
then be submitted to perform some additional checking and subsequent
mail processing.

Have a nice vacation (or whatever)!

Upon your return, new mail that has been successfully processed by
this procedure will be found in your WATCH_MAIL mail folder.  You may
also have new mail that has come in since the last time the batch job
ran, or to which the procedure has had difficulty replying.

  --- ADVANTAGES ---

The procedure is installed by simply copying the command file, and no
privileges are required to install or use it.  It allows group- and
system-specific tailoring of some default parameters, as may be desired
by a system manager.

There are several features to "delight" the user and system manager,
as detailed in the internal documentation (e.g., specify dates using
weekday notation ("Monday+8:00"), create or edit the reply file after
supplying its specification ("/EDIT"), etc.).

  --- LIMITATIONS ---

The chief limitation is that system crashes and batch queue-related
problems may result in the batch job disappearing, and hence the loss
of automatic replies to and copies of your new mail.

  --- MORE INFORMATION ---

See the extensive documentation contained in the comments within the
command file.  In particular, see the section on known restrictions
and bugs.

On-line help is also available by entering a question mark (?) in
response to one of the procedure's prompts.

XEphem, Motif_Toys, An interactive astronomy program for Motif Window systems

This is XEphem v3.2.3

XEphem (v3.2.3) is an interactive astronomy program for Motif Window systems.

It provides many graphical views as well as quantitative heliocentric,
geocentric and topocentric information for Earth satellites, solar system
and celestial objects.

XEphem contains extensive context-sensitive on-line help. Virtually none
of that help is duplicated here so go ahead and run XEphem to learn more.

The Main window of XEphem provides control and display of three basic
services: observing circumstances, looping, and access to additional
displays. Observing circumstances includes location, date, time and
atmospheric conditions (used for the refraction model). Looping refers to
the ability to set up XEphem so that it automatically increments time at
a desired step size and rate. Additional displays provide all of the
graphical and quantitative information available, and always refer to the
circumstances defined in the main menu.

  center.  These graphics consist of a reduced size image of the module
  you were viewing, the name of the user who executed xlock, and
  password prompt field, and some short instructions.

  At this point, you can either click on the graphic to return to xlock,

  DOWN THE X SERVER.  That's what makes it a lock.

xpdnt, utilities, eXpedient Process Default Notification/Navigation Tool

TMESIS xpdnt V1.1 is a utility to will display the current process default
as the user moves about the system.  The default can be displayed in three
different locations: DCL's command prompt, 25th host-writable status line,
or a DECterm title bar.  In addition, <CONTROL><N> at the DCL command line
will invoke a "navigation" tool which allows the user to move about in the
their default history.

xpdnt V1.1 is provided as a VMSINSTALlable kit.  For additional information
on the features and use of TMESIS xpdnt V1.1 consult the $$$README.TXT file

XTERM, Utilities, X Windows terminal emulator

The xterm program is a terminal emulator for the X Windows system. This
terminal emulator provides DIGITAL VT102 and Tektronix 4014 compatible 
terminal emulations for programs that cannot use the X Windows system 
directly.

This is an OpenVMS port of xterm version 1.22, originally from:

  http://www.clark.net/pub/dickey/xterm/xterm.html

This 1.22 version is rather more recent than the previously available and
rather old OpenVMS port of xterm -- though that version of xterm had the 
confusingly higher version 2.01.

You can also acquire a current full distribution, along with compatible 
XMU and XAW3D library files from:

  http://seqaxp.bio.caltech.edu/pub/SOFTWARE/

This distribution includes a binary for OpenVMS 7.2-1 with DECwindows V1.2-5.

The following features all seem to work (at least "mostly"):

  VT emulation 80 chars and 132 chars
  Tek emulation
  PRINT screen
  cut/paste

There is currently no command logging enabled and the XMU and XAW3D bits
are linked into the image statically.  It should be possible to get the 
X11KIT to work if you can figure out why the _XA_ bits aren't showing up 
in the shared library.

Copy the XTERM.DAT file for your SYS$SYSROOT:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] directory
to pick up reasonable fonts.

Caution:  if you turn on num_lock it blocks the application keypad!
