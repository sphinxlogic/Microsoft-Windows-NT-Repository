XFlame is a cool little graphics hack originally made by the Rasterman
and modified by me, Rahul Jain (rahul@rice.edu).

It does what you would expect it to do, draw a flame on the screen.

FEATURES

* User-settable window size
* User-settable color spectrum
* Frame rate limiting so you can still crack RC5 keys in the background :)
  (default 10 fps)
* Option to draw to the root window
* Single pass, 2 pass (default), and 4 pass interlacing
* Option to draw only the changed portion of the image to the screen in 8
  bit color only, resulting in a massive increase in speed w/ large windows
  (e.g., root window).
* Colormap niceness options
* Swallow-able into FVWM2's Button Bar

BUGS

* Delta drawing only works in 8 bit color
* Drawing to the root window is not too reliable. Does anybody really want
  this feature? My system's too slow for it...
* Along the same lines, delta drawing only works in 8 bit color. Since it's
  only really useful for root window drawing, I haven't added support for
  higher depths.
* Backing store and save unders not implemented
  (Is this necessary? We're drawing to the screen often enough that it
  shouldn't matter.)
* The GNOME panel either hangs or doesn't do anything when it tries to swallow
  xflame.
* FVWM1's GoodStuff sometimes swallows it, sometimes crashes. Maybe it's
  only under Solaris... Maybe I put too much crack into that joint...
* May not work too well with strange color modes

TODO

* Fix the bugs
* Add support for Xrm
* Stop the program from wasting CPU cycles when it's not even visible
* Anybody want any more features?
