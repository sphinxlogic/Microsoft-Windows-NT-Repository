Under Linux, you should have no problems compiling xflame, just use these
commands:

xmkmf
make
make install

Most other Unices should work the same way, here are the ones that need some
extra work:

SOLARIS (probably many other commercial Unices)

Imake does not include -lposix4, you'll have to add that parameter by hand
to the Imakefile. Edit the line that defines the LOCAL_LIBRARIES (near the
bottom of the Makefile) to look like this:

LOCAL_LIBRARIES = $(XLIB) -lposix4

Then continue as above.

Does anyone know how to specify this in the Imakefile so that platforms that
need it will link with libposix4?
