			VMS DIRECTORY
			-------------

This directory contains (hopefully) all of the VMS-specific code
for the X11 kit. It is important to read the file VMS_PORT.TXT
and also to execute the command procedure X11_SETUP.COM before
attempting to compile any of the clients.

Changes have been made to the (R3) clients using #ifdef VMS so
that they will run under VMS. However, they have not been subjected
to rigorous testing, so it is possible that there may be some bugs.
