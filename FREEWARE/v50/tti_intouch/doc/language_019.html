<a name="heading_16.4.6"><h2>16.4.6 Field length</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1185"></a>

<p>
Enter the length of this field.  The length should be the number of character 
positions this field will contain.  Fields can be any length.  The length must 
be given as an integer number. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_1186"></a>
You can also enter the ending position for the field length.  You enter 
"P" followed by the ending position.  For example:  P5 

<p>
<i>Variable Length Fields</i>
<a name="index_x_1187"></a>
<a name="index_x_1188"></a>

<p>
If a CH or UN data type field has a first position that starts at or before 
the end of a logical record, that field will have its length adjusted upon 
reference.  The new length will reflect the actual end of the logical record. 

<p>
For example, a field could start in position one, and have its length set to 
the maximum record length.  When the field is referenced, its length will be 
adjusted to the actual record length.  This field is variable length. 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.7"><h2>16.4.7 Number of occurrences</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1189"></a>

<p>
Enter the number of times that this field occurs in the data record. 
The default number of occurrences is "1". 

<p>
<a name="index_x_1190"></a>
<a name="index_x_1191"></a>
If the field being defined is an array, enter the number of elements 
in the array. 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.8"><h2>16.4.8 Semantics</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1192"></a>
<a name="index_x_1193"></a>

<p>
Enter the semantics (attributes) that apply to this field.  The semantics 
describe what type of data will be in the field.  For example, if this is 
a dollar amount field you would select NUM:2 which means that this is a 
numeric field with two decimal places. 

<p>
The semantics are entered as a list of descriptors separated by commas. 
When you have completed your list, enter GOLD/F (i.e. press <kbd>PF1</kbd> and 
then the <kbd>F</kbd> key). 

<p>
The valid semantics are: 

<p>
<a name="index_x_1194"></a>
<a name="index_x_1195"></a>
<table border>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>NUM </td>
    <td>Indicates a numeric field which allows only numbers. The semantic <i>RJ</i>, right-justified, is automatically appended when NUM is selected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>NUM:scale </td>
    <td>SCALE specifies the scale factor---how many decimal places to use. Scale factors can be positive or negative (from -99 to 99).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>RJ </td>
    <td>The data will be right-justified in the field.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>UC </td>
    <td>All letters will be stored in upper-case format. Additionally, field comparison data will be upper-cased prior to any comparison.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>ZF </td>
    <td>The data will be zero filled.</td>
  </tr>

    <td> </td>
    <td>ZS </td>
    <td>Causes all leading zeros to be suppressed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>DATE[:YMD|MDY] </td>
    <td>This field contains a date. The field must be six or eight digits long. The default date format is YMD. You can enter DATE or optionally, specify the date format. The date format is currently only used by applications. INTOUCH does NOT automatically switch date values into or out of the format specified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>FULLTIME </td>
    <td>Indicates that the field contains a date-time stamp and the time value is to be preserved. By default, INTOUCH stores/retrieves only the date portion of a date stamp field.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>APPLICATION:name </td>
    <td>This is a user defined semantic and is not used by INTOUCH. A user can assign a name to indicate that the field is related to a specific application (i.e. accounting). Application programs can then ask for the application name and perform some action based on the data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>DBFLD:fieldname </td>
    <td>This is a special semantic for augmented definition files only. The DBFLD semantic is used to associate an augmented field definition with an actual database field. Fieldname is the actual name of the field in the database.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
If you do not want any of the semantics, you can enter NONE. 

<p>
If you are modifying an existing field, the default will be the semantics 
you have previously specified. 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.9"><h2>16.4.9 Prompt text</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1196"></a>
<a name="index_x_1197"></a>

<p>
Enter the prompt text for this field.  The prompt text will be used when 
data is entered for this field.  The prompt text: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li>can be any characters on the keyboard. 
  <li>can be up to 30 characters long. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
If you are adding this field, the default will be the <i>description</i>
you entered for this field.  

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.10"><h2>16.4.10 Report heading</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1198"></a>
<a name="index_x_1199"></a>

<p>
Enter the heading you want to appear on reports.  This heading will appear 
at the top of the report column containing this field's data.  If you are 
adding a new record, the default report heading is the <i>field name</i>
you entered. 

<p>
The heading can be up to 30 characters long. 

<p>
To make a multi-line heading, separate the heading for each line with a 
comma (i.e. Cust,No). 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.11"><h2>16.4.11 Print mask</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1200"></a>
<a name="index_x_1201"></a>

<p>
Enter a print mask for this field.  The print mask is used to display 
information entered into this field.  The print mask will be used whenever 
<a name="index_x_1202"></a>
you use INTOUCH's PRINT statement to print this field's information, or 
when you use one of the INTOUCH programs such as Guided Query Language. 

<p>
Print masks are created with the #, @ and % characters.  SETUP will 
automatically provide the tilde (~) character for any literal (non-masking) 
characters found in the entered mask.  Some examples: 

<p><pre>
                                Example 1               Example 2 
                                ----------------        ------------- 
        Data to be masked:      AB1234XY                AB1234XY 
        Data to print as :      (AB-1234-XY)            AB 1234 XY 
        Mask you enter   :      (##-####-##)            ## #### ## 
        SETUP displays   :      (##~-####~-##~)         ##~ ####~ ## 
</pre>

<p>
You can refer to the chapter "Printing and Displaying Data" for more 
information on print masks. 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.12"><h2>16.4.12 Screen mask</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1203"></a>
<a name="index_x_1204"></a>

<p>
The screen mask is used by applications to enter data into this field.  
A program can ask for the screen mask and use it in whatever manner 
that is desired.  The format should be the same as for the print mask. 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.13"><h2>16.4.13 Help text</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1205"></a>
<a name="index_x_1206"></a>

<p>
HELP text can be entered for this field.  The help text can be displayed 
during data entry if the user types "HELP" or presses the <kbd>Help</kbd> key 
at this field prompt when in <b>MAINTAIN</b>.  Custom applications 
can also display this help text. 

<p>
The help text: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> can be up to 60 characters long. 
  <li> can consist of any characters on the keyboard. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.14"><h2>16.4.14 Access rules</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1207"></a>
<a name="index_x_1208"></a>

<p>
Enter the access rules for this field.  The access rules determine who 
will have access to this field.  NORMAL allows users to read, add and 
change field information. 

<p>
Access rules have the following formats: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> READ:read_access, WRITE:write_access 
  <li>          <li> NORMAL
</ul>

</dl>
where <i>read_access</i> and <i>write_access</i> are each 
represented by a single letter from (A-Z). 

<p>
<i>NORMAL</i> denotes READ:N, WRITE:N. 

<p>
<b>A</b> is the most restricted access level.  <b>Z</b>
is the least restricted access level.  

<p>
The access_rules are used in conjunction with the structure security 
level to determine whether or not a user can access the field. 

<p>
When a user attempts to access a field, the structure security level is 
compared to the read or write access level defined for the field.  If the 
field's access level is lower than the structure security level, access 
is allowed.  For example: 
<dl>
<dd>

<p>
If the structure READ access is J and the field READ access is T, the 
field data CAN be read.  However, if the structure WRITE access is J 
and the field WRITE access is E, the field CANNOT be written to or 
changed. 
</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.15"><h2>16.4.15 Validation rules</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1209"></a>
<a name="index_x_1210"></a>

<p>
You can enter validation rules for this field.  The validation rules will 
be used to validate data entered by a data entry program. 

<p>
The data entry program can access these validation rules to make sure 
that the data entered is valid prior to storing the data into the field. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_1211"></a>
Any rule that is valid to the INTOUCH VALID function can be entered here. 

<p>
The validation rules are entered as a list of items separated by semicolons. 
For example: 

<p><pre>
                required; digits; minlength 10 
</pre>

<p>
When you have completed your list, enter GOLD/F (i.e. press <kbd>PF1</kbd> and 
then the <kbd>F</kbd> key).  

<p>
<a name="index_x_1212"></a>
Please refer to Appendix A of this manual for detailed information on the 
VALID function. 

<p>
When you have answered all the field prompts, the field definition will be 
added to the data dictionary.  The screen will clear and you can define 
the next field or enter "\" or "EXIT" to return to the SETUP procedures menu. 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.4.16"><h2>16.4.16 Field Definitions and Key Fields --- General Information</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1213"></a>

<p>
Normally, when you define the record fields, each defined field represents 
a single piece of data in the record.  This allows your programs access to 
all of the record data. 

<p>
There are times when you want to process two or more adjoining fields. 
For example, if you have a last name field, first name field and initial 
field and you want to sort the records by name, you would sort the three 
separate fields--last name, first name and initial. 

<p>
To simply this process, you can define an additional field, FULL_NAME, 
which can consist of the three fields.  When you define the FULL_NAME 
field, the starting position would be the first position of the last name 
and the length would be the total number of characters in the three fields. 
Then, when you want to sort or print the full name, you need only refer 
to one field, the FULL_NAME field. 

<p>
Redefining fields becomes very useful when you need to set up unique key 
fields for RMS indexed files. 

<p>
<h2>Key Fields</h2>

<a name="index_x_1214"></a>
<a name="index_x_1215"></a>
<a name="index_x_1216"></a>

<p>
If you are creating an RMS indexed file, you will be designating one or 
more fields as <i>key fields</i>.  RMS indexed files require at least 
one key field. 
<a name="index_x_1217"></a>
<a name="index_x_1218"></a>
When you use the CREATE procedure to create an RMS indexed file, you will 
be prompted for a <i>primary key</i> field and <i>alternate key</i>
fields. 

<p>
Key fields contain unique data which enables programs to locate 
records very quickly.  For example, the customer number field could be a key 
field because all the customer numbers in all the records would be different. 
<a name="index_x_1219"></a>
This type of key field is called a <i>unique key field</i>. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_1220"></a>
<i>Duplicate key fields</i> contain unique types of data but the data 
might be found in more than one record in the file. 

<p>
Any defined or redefined field can be designated as a key field.  However, 
it is best to use fields that normally will contain unique data as key fields. 
Common practice is to set up the first field as a key field. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_1221"></a>
A key field can be defined which consists of two or more fields.  If the 
fields which make up this key field are not adjoining (i.e. one after the 
other), this is called a <i>segmented key field</i>.  Key fields 
consisting of two or more fields, whether segmented or not, must have a 
length that equals the total length of all the segments that make up the 
key field. 

<p>

<a name="heading_16.5"><h1>16.5 SHOW Procedure</h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1222"></a>
<a name="index_x_1223"></a>

<ul>
  <li> The <b>Brief field display</b> creates a listing of the fields 
        showing some of the definition information. 
  <li> The <b>Full field display</b> creates a listing of the fields 
        showing all of the definition information. 
  <li> The <b>List fields</b> option creates a listing of the 
        defined fields. 
  <li> The <b>Structure</b> option displays information about the 
        structure file. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
SETUP creates the listings in report format so that you can display the 
field and structure information on your screen, print a hardcopy or save 
the information on disk. 

<p>
After a report is created, you can select an output option from the 
Output Options menu.  The default is <b>Screen</b> which 
will display the report to your screen.  The line under the Output Options 
menu tells you the name of the temporary report file that was created.

<h2>Structure security level</h2>

<a name="index_x_1239"></a>

<p>
Enter the security level associated with this structure. 

<p>
The security level is a single letter in the range of <b>A</b>
to <b>Z</b>. 

<p>
Security level <b>A</b> is the highest level of security. 
Security level <b>Z</b> is the lowest level of security. 

<p>
<h2>Read access level</h2>

<a name="index_x_1240"></a>

<p>
Enter the access level required to <i>read</i> a data record in this 
structure. 

<p>
The <i>read access level</i> is a single letter in the range 
<b>A</b> to <b>Z</b>. 
<b>A</b> is the most restricted access level.  <b>Z</b>
is the least restricted. 

<p>
When an attempt is made to read a record from this structure, INTOUCH will 
compare the structure security level to the read access level.  If the read 
access level is lower than the structure security level, the read request 
will be allowed. 

<p>
For example: 

<p><pre>
        Structure level         Read access level       Access 
        ---------------         -----------------       ------
