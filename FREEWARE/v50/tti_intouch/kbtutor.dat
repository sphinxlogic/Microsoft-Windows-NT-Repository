                        Introduction to Touch Typing

      You will be learning to touch-type on a standard keyboard. 
      You will be introduced to each letter on the keyboard, one
      at a time.  By the time you have completed this series, you
      will be able to touch type the entire alphabet, the
      numbers, and most of the punctuation keys.

      If you have never taken any lessons in typing before,
      please be patient.  Typing is not difficult -- but it does
      take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to look down at
      your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is
      hard to break later.  If you press the wrong key, the
      terminal will "beep", and if possible, give helpful tips.\T

      If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will
      have an even harder time keeping yourself from looking at
      the keyboard.  Don't be surprised if you initially find
      touch typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower
      when you first start -- but, touch typing is far faster
      once you get the hang of it!

      If you can already touch type, you should be able to go
      through these lessons fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to
      go directly to the speed practice series.\T

                        The HOME Keys

      In order to press the correct keys by touch alone, you must
      always know where your fingers are.  The way to do this is
      to have a special place for each finger.  This key is
      called the {HOME} position.

      Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key. 
      Now, place your second finger on the K-key, your third
      finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on the ;-key
      (the one with the : and ; on it).\T

      Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the
      F, D, S, and A-keys. Place your right thumb over the SPACE
      bar.  (Henceforth, always press the SPACE bar with this
      thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they
      are poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just
      barely touching its home key.  This is an electronic
      keyboard and does not take much pressure to accidentally
      press the key down.

      Learn these positions well.  Whenever you are about to type
      a line, look at your fingers and make sure they are in the
      {HOME} position.  Then don't look at them again.\T

                        Drill Patterns

      For the rest of this lesson, a line of text will be
      displayed in the middle of the screen and instructions at
      the top of the screen.

      All you have to do is type in the characters that you see
      in the middle of the screen.  If you make a mistake, the
      terminal will "beep" and possible hints will be displayed.

      When you have finished typing the line, press the {RETURN}
      key.  To do this, extend the little finger of your right
      hand over to the {RETURN} key.  Press the {RETURN} key and
      zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not
      to let your other fingers move far from their home
      positions in the process.  Also, be careful not to type an
      extra space at the end of the line.

      If you made no mistakes on the line, the next drill pattern
      will be displayed.  If you did make a mistake, you will be
      asked to try the line again.  Don't forget to use your
      {right thumb} for the {SPACE BAR}.\T

Press the F-key four times with the first finger of your left hand.\I
ffff\D
Alternately, press the F-key and the SPACE bar.\I
fff fff fff ff ff ff f f f\D
Don't look at your hands!\B

Press the J-key with the first finger of your right hand.\I
jjj jjj jjj jj jj jj j j j\D

Use the left hand for the F and the right hand for the J.\I
fff jjj fff jj ff jj f j f j\D

Now intermix them.\I

                             Level 2

      In this lesson, you will review the letters that you have
      already practiced and will add the letters E, G, and H and
      the period.

      When you reach for any of these keys, be sure to return
      your finger to its home position.  For example, to press
      the H-key, move the first finger of your right hand (the
      J-finger) slightly to the left.  Tap the H-key and
      immediately bring your finger back over the J.

      If you lose track of where your fingers are -- guess! 
      Don't look!\T

      The next key you are going to practice is the right shift
      key.

      Whenever you want to capitalize a key on the left side, you
      must use the right shift-key.  To do so, follow these
      steps:

      a.  Without moving your first finger from the J-key, swing
          the fourth finger of your right hand over to the SHIFT-key
          and hold it down.

      b.  Press the key that you want to type with your left
          hand.

      c.  Immediately bring your fourth finger back to the
          ;-key.\T

Don't look at your fingers!\I

                        Speed Exercises

      From now on, you will be mixing speed exercises in with the
      lessons.  In a speed exercise, the text will only be
      displayed once.

      From the moment you type the first letter of the line until
      you press the final carriage return, you will be timed. 
      When you finish, your typing speed in words per minute
      (WPM) will be displayed.  The number of errors you made
      will also be displayed.

      If you make a mistake, the terminal will beep and the
      letter that you should have typed will be highlighted. 
      Just keep going and try to make as few errors as
      possible.\T 

Try this sentence:\I 
Sarah has liked knitting all her life.\P

                        Numeric Keys

      The terminal has two sets of numeric keys.  One
      set--directly above the alphabetic keys--conforms to the
      standard for typewriter keyboards.  The other set--to your
      right--resembles a calculator keypad.  In this typing
      series you will be concerned only with the standard numeric
      keys on the main keyboard.  (If you would like to learn to
      touch type on a numeric keypad, use the N-series lessons
      instead.)

      NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a
      separate keypad

      The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning
      from now on, vary somewhat from machine to machine.  The 2
      through 0 keys are always in exactly the same place on all
      typewriter keyboards.  (On keypunch machines and some
      terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O, J,
      K, L, M, comma and period keys.  You will not be concerned
      with these layouts in this series.) Even if a typewriter or
      terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it may not have
      a 1 key.  If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2. 
      If it does not, you will have to use the L-key.\T

Let's start by using the 1-key, since you have one.  (Use your A-finger.)\I
aaa a1a aaa 111 aaa a1a\D
a1q qa1 qz1 az1 aq1 a1z\D

1 plus 2 is 3.  11 plus 22 is 33.  111 plus 222 is 333.\D

The last number you will practice today is the 4-key.  (Use your F-finger.)\I

Dear Sirs:  The 10:00 meeting on March 10 has been postponed until 10:30.\D
The 10:30 meeting was moved to 11:00 in Room 302.\D
But, Room 302 can only hold 10 people.  We will need Conference Room 10.\D

Let's try some paragraphs.\I
Zip codes are arranged so that the first 3 digits
designate the regional office and the last 2
digits designate the local branch.  The numbering
is roughly east to west.  That is, numbers
starting with 0 are in New England, numbers
starting with 1 are the New York area, etc.
There are notable exceptions to this rule,
however.  The Virgin Islands are south of
Florida, but their Zip Codes start with 00.\P

The new nine digit zip codes have upset quite a
few people.  It was bad enough being referred to
as 73218.  But now, we will have to remember
numbers like 73218-4208.  The worst press will be
the companies whose mailing list programs were
poorly designed.  Those unstructured programs
will be very difficult to change.\P

      In this lesson you will be practicing the shifted numeric
      keys on the numeric keypad.  You will get practice in the
      keystroke motions.  Very few sentence drills or speed
      exercises are included, since these keys are used so
      infrequently.

      If you are typing something which includes one of these
      special characters and you cannot remember where a key is,
      look.  But, always make sure to press the key with the
      correct finger.  (If you do use the key often, you will
      eventually learn where it is without looking.)  Since these
      keys are used infrequently and are in different places on
      most other keyboards or are totally missing, speed is not
      important.\T

                                The End

      You have now completed the Touch Typing lessons.  If you
      have not already done so, you should now start the Numeric
      Keypad Series or the Speed Test Series.

      There are a few keys which you have not studied.  If you
      decide to touch-type these keys, use the closest finger. 
      Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL keys use the
      A-finger.  And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE,
      DELETE, LINE FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger. 
      The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are not usually touch typed
      as the reach is too far.  If you can, fine.

      The CONTROL key is difficult to touch type, but is treated
      like the SHIFT keys whenever possible.  Certain command
      sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way. 
      Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their
      A-finger and then press the other key with whatever finger
      is convenient (usually the F-finger in this case).\T

                    Introduction to Numeric Keypads

      The Numeric keypad lessons are provided for practice with
      the numeric keys.  You do not need to know how to touch
      type on the standard keyboard in order to learn touch
      typing on a calculator keypad.  So, you can begin this
      series right away.

      When entering numeric values, accuracy is usually more
      important than speed. Take these lessons very slowly. 
      Speed will come naturally later.

      As with the standard keypad, you must start in the {HOME}
      position.  Place the first three fingers of your right hand
      over the 4, 5, and 6 keys of the keypad. (Your thumb and
      fifth finger are not used.)  Your fingers should be poised
      just over the keys gently brushing them.  Use the thumb or
      any finger of your left hand for other keys, such as the
      SPACE bar.

      After entering each line, press the ENTER key with the
      6-finger (the third finger of your right hand). 
      Immediately return your finger to the 6 key.  It is very
      important that you bring the finger back without looking.\T

                     Introduction to Speed Drills

      The Speed Practice Series of lessons is designed to help
      you improve your typing speed and accuracy.  It is assumed
      that you have already learned how to touch type either from
      a previous course in touch typing or from the Touch Typing
      Series of these lessons.

      You can use this series even if you do not know how to
      touch type.  But, it is recommended that you at least learn
      to touch type most of the letters of the alphabet before
      starting this series.  When you encounter a letter or
      symbol which you have not learned, you will have to look. 
      This is a very bad habit to get into and is hard to break. 
      (You needn't worry if you only need to glance down for
      unusual keys, like the dollar sign.)\T

                        Speed Practice Instructions

      A paragraph will be displayed on the screen.  You should
      then type the entire paragraph as quickly and as accurately
      as possible.  As you type each character, it will be
      checked for accuracy.  

      From the moment you type the first letter of the paragraph
      until you press the final carriage return, you will be
      timed.  When you finish,  your typing speed in words per
      minute (WPM) will be displayed.  The number of errors you
      made will also be displayed.

      If you make a mistake, the terminal will beep and the
      letter that you should have typed will be highlighted. 
      Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

      If you made too many mistakes, try the next paragraph
      slower.  If you made no mistakes or only one or two, try
      typing the next paragraph faster.\T

First, a quick warm-up.\I

Dear Sirs:

I have just purchased a Digital personal computer system and would
like to order two boxes of floppy disks for it.  This system uses
5 1/4 inch, hard-sectored, ten-sector, single-sided, single-density
diskettes.

Enclosed is my check for $45.00.  Please rush this order, as I
can not use my system before they arrive.

Sincerely,

Mr. Smith\P
Dear Sirs:

Thank you for sending the diskettes so promptly.  However, 
the diskettes which you sent are for soft-sectored
drives.  As I stated in my original letter my system
accepts only ten-sector, hard-sectored diskettes.

I will return these two boxes as soon as I receive the
correct ones.

Sincerely,

Mr. Smith\P
!
Dear Mr. Smith:

Thank you for informing us that the diskettes which you purchased 
from us are not satisfactory.  We are sorry for the
inconvenience you have been caused in this transaction.

We shall be glad to replace the diskettes you now have or to
allow you to select a different brand.  If you will let us know
your wishes we shall be glad to give the matter our immediate
attention.

We hope you will give us the opportunity to prove to you that
this incident is most unusual and that we do strive to render
to our customers an efficient and courteous service at all
times.\P

      In this lesson you will be given several excerpts from the
      classics. Take your time and type them carefully.\T

A Christmas Carol, Stave One, Marley's Ghost\I
Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular 
about the knocker on the door, except that it
was very large.  It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge has as little of what
is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
London, even including--which is a bold word--the
corporation, aldermen, and livery.  Let it also be
borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
seven year's dead partner that afternoon.  And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate 
process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's 
face.\P

Gulliver's Travels, Chapter One, A Voyage to Lilliput\I
When I awaked it was just daylight.  I attempted to rise, but I
found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to
the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied to the
ground in the same manner.  I likewise felt several slender
ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs.  I
could only look upward; the sun began to grow hot, and the
light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me;
but in the posture I lay could see nothing except the sky.  In a
little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg,
which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up
to my chin; when bending my eyes downward as much as I could, I
perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a
bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.  In the
mean time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I
conjectured) following the first.\P

Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.\I
I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that
I knew, and perhaps should have told her long before,
and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous
position.  Some of the man's money--if he had any--was
certainly due to us; but it was not likely that our
captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by
me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to
give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts.
The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Dr.
Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected,
which was not to be thought of.  Indeed, it seemed
impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the
house:  the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very
ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms.\P

Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.\I
The neighborhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
approaching footsteps; and what between the dead
body of the captain on the parlor floor, and the thought
of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand,
and ready to return, there were moments when, as the
saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror.  Something
must speedily be resolved upon; and it occurred to us at
last to go forth together and seek help in the neighboring 
hamlet.  No sooner said than done.  Bareheaded as we
were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and
the frosty fog.\P

Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene II (Capulet's Garden).\I

But, soft!  what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!  Arise, 
fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady; O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing:  what of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:\P
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing, and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!\P

Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene II (The Forum).\I

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar:  The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,
For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men,
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.\P
He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse:  was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.\P
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once,--not without cause:
What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.\P

The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I (A Court of Justice).\I
The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His scepter shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\P
But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,
It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice.  Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea consider this
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy.  I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.\
