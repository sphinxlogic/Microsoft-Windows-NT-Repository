VERB, Utilities, Extract .CLD definitions of DCL verbs

	VERB is a utility to make it possible to modify (or simply look
at) command definitions. This is the "new" version, rewritten in C.
No known bugs are present... The COMPILE.COM procedure has been updated
to support Alpha (it has not been tested however).
