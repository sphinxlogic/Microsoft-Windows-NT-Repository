NAME
       pdftops  -  Portable  Document  Format (PDF) to PostScript
       converter (version 0.91)

SYNOPSIS
       pdftops [options] [PDF-file [PS-file]]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdftops converts Portable Document Format (PDF)  files  to
       PostScript so they can be printed.

       Pdftops  reads  the  PDF  file,  PDF-file,  and  writes  a
       PostScript file, PS-file.  If PS-file  is  not  specified,
       pdftops converts file.pdf to file.ps (or file.eps with the
       -eps option).  If PS-file is '-', the PostScript  is  sent
       to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -f number
              Specifies the first page to print.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to print.

       -paperw size
              Set the paper width, in points.

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height, in points.

       -level1
              Generate   Level   1   PostScript.   The  resulting
              PostScript files will be significantly  larger  (if
              they  contain  images),  but  will print on Level 1
              printers.  This also converts all images  to  black
              and  white.   The  default  behavior is to generate
              Level 2 PostScript.  In particular,  Level  2  sup-
              ports color images and image compression.

       -eps   Generate an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file.  An
              EPS file contains a single image,  so  if  you  use
              this  option  with  a multi-page PDF file, you must
              use -f and -l to specify a single page.

       -opi   Generate OPI comments  for  all  images  and  forms
              which  have  OPI information.  (This option is only
              available if pdftops was  compiled  with  OPI  sup-
              port.)

       -noemb By  default, any Type 1 fonts which are embedded in
              the PDF file are copied into the  PostScript  file.
              This option causes pdftops to substitute base fonts
              instead.   Embedded  fonts  make  PostScript  files
              larger, but may be necessary for readable output.

       -form  Generate a PostScript form which can be imported by
              software that understands forms.  Only one page  is
              converted  (since  forms  cannot  contain  multiple
              pages) and the -l option is ignored.   The  -level1
              option cannot be used with -form.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help is equivalent.)

BUGS
       No support for TrueType and Type 3 fonts.
