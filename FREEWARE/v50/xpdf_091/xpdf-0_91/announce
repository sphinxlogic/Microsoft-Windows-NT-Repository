Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.91 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components of the package (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32
systems.

Noticeable changes:

* Added TrueType font rendering, using FreeType.
* Support for (some) Chinese fonts.
* Decryption code is included with the main distribution (now that the
  US export regulations are a little bit less irrational).
* Added (very basic) support for generating PostScript with Japanese
  fonts.
* Added support for generating EPS files (pdftops -eps).
* Much-improved image filtering in xpdf.
* Implemented a basic full-screen (presentation) mode (xpdf
  -fullscreen).

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
    ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
the incoming directory, but they will be moved to:

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X
