XPDF091, Software, X11 Reader for Adobe PDF files

    Xpdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
    (These  are  also  sometimes  also called 'Acrobat' files,
    from the name of Adobe's PDF software.)  Xpdf  runs  under
    the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and OS/2.

    For this Freeware CD Demo, there are two Alpha executables, 
    one for OpenVMS v6.2 and one for v7.1.
