XEphem (v3.2.3) is an interactive astronomy program for Motif Window systems.

It provides many graphical views as well as quantitative heliocentric,
geocentric and topocentric information for Earth satellites, solar system
and celestial objects.

XEphem contains extensive context-sensitive on-line help. Virtually none
of that help is duplicated here so go ahead and run XEphem to learn more.

The Main window of XEphem provides control and display of three basic
services: observing circumstances, looping, and access to additional
displays. Observing circumstances includes location, date, time and
atmospheric conditions (used for the refraction model). Looping refers to
the ability to set up XEphem so that it automatically increments time at
a desired step size and rate. Additional displays provide all of the
graphical and quantitative information available, and always refer to the
circumstances defined in the main menu.
