This directory is empty now but this is where you might want to put the
named pipes (fifos) used by xephem. The sample XEphem.ad resource settings
are set up to look here for the fifos. For reference, these resources are:

XEphem.DBFIFO: fifos/xephem_db_fifo
XEphem.SKYOUTFIFO: fifos/xephem_out_fifo
XEphem.SKYINFIFO: fifos/xephem_in_fifo
XEphem.SKYLOCFIFO: fifos/xephem_loc_fifo
