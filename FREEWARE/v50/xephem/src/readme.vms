Welcome to XEphem, an interactive astronomy program for UNIX and OpenVMS
systems.  (Note:  The original author does not offer any OpenVMS support,
so please don't bother Elwood with OpenVMS-related issues!)

Start with the DESCRIP.MMS file.  If you don't have MMS, please consider
getting it :), or look into the free clone, MMK from the MadGoat Software
group (URL: http://www.madgoat.com/)
