<H3><BR><U>20.1 - Echo Facility</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Ever had to go to extraordinary lengths to find out exactly what your
browser is sending to the server?&nbsp; The server provides a request echo facility.&nbsp;
This merely returns the complete request as a plain-text document.&nbsp; This can be
used for for checking the request header lines being provided by the browser,
and can be valuable in the diagnosis of POSTed forms, etc.&nbsp;

<P> This facility must be enabled through a mapping rule entry.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  script /echo/* /echo/*
</PRE></FONT>

<P> It may then be used with any request merely by inserting &quot;/echo&quot; at
the start of the path, as in the following example.&nbsp;

<A NAME="281">
<H3><BR><U>20.2 - Where Facility</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Need to locate where VMS has the HTTPd files?&nbsp;  This simple facility maps
the supplied path then parses it to obtain a resulting VMS file specification.&nbsp;
<B>This does not demonstrate whether the path actually exists!&nbsp;</B>

<P> This facility must be enabled through a mapping rule entry.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  script /where/* /where/*

<H3><BR><U>20.3 - Xray Facility</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The Xray facility returns a request's complete response, <B>both
header and body</B>, as a plain text document.&nbsp;  Being able to <I>see</I>
the internals of the response header as well as the contents of the body
rendered in plain text can often be valuable when developing scripts, etc.&nbsp;

<P> This facility must be enabled through a mapping rule entry.&nbsp;

<A NAME="283">
<H3><BR><U>20.4 - Scrunch Utility</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The &quot;scrunch&quot;er is used to decrease the processing overhead of
Server-Side Includes (SSI) files.&nbsp;  See the &quot;Environment Overview&quot; for
more detail on this utility.&nbsp;

<P> A <I>scrunched</I> SSI file is a variable length record file, where
each record  either comprises a single SSI directive, with the
&quot;&lt;!--#&quot; beginning on the record boundary, or a record of
other text to be output (i.e. not beginning with &quot;&lt;!--#&quot;).

<P> Why do this?&nbsp;  Well, if all SSI directives begin on a record boundary you
only have to check the first five characters of each record to establish
whether it should be interpreted or directly output!&nbsp;  This <B>saves
checking every character of every record</B> for the opening
&quot;&lt;&quot; and the following &quot;!--#&quot;.

<P> Files that have been scrunched are basically unsuitable for editing (only
due to the often inappropriately sized records).&nbsp;  Previously scrunched files
may be returned to something (often exactly) resembling their original
condition using the /UNSCRUNCH qualifier.&nbsp;

<A NAME="284">
<H3><BR><U>20.5 - StreamLF Utility</U></H3>
</A>

<P> This utility converts VARIABLE format files to STREAM_LF.&nbsp; The WASD HTTPd
server access STREAM_LF files in block/IO-mode, far more efficiently that the
record-mode required by variable-record format files.&nbsp; Use
&quot;STREAMLF/HELP&quot; for some basic usage information.&nbsp;

<P> <B>NOTE: </B> The server can also be configured to automatically
convert any VARIABLE record format files it encounters to STREAM_LF.&nbsp;

<A NAME="285">
<H3><BR><U>20.6 - HTTPd Monitor</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The HTTP server may be monitored in real-time using the HTTPDMON utility.&nbsp;

<P> This utility continuously displays a screen of information comprising three
or four of the following sections: 
<OL>

<LI> <B>Process Information</B>

<BR>
HTTPd process information includes its up-time, CPU-time consumed (excluding 
any subprocesses), I/O counts, and memory utilization.&nbsp;  The &quot;Servers:&quot;
item shows how many servers are currently running on the node/cluster.&nbsp;  Changes
in this count are indicated by the second, parenthesized number.&nbsp;
<LI> <B>General Server Counters</B>

<BR>
The server counters keep track of the total connections received, accepted, 
rejected, etc., totals for each request type (file transfer, directory 
listing, image mapping, etc.).
<LI> <B>Proxy Serving Counters</B>

<BR>
The server counters keep track of proxy serving connections, network and cache
traffic, cache status, etc.&nbsp;
<LI> <B>Latest Request</B>

<BR>
This section provides the response status code, and some transaction
statistics, the service being accessed, originating host and HTTP request.&nbsp; 
Note that long request strings may be truncated (indicated by a bolded
elipsis).&nbsp;
</OL>

(provided the system has stayed up).&nbsp;  To reset the counters use the on-line
server administration menu (see <A HREF="htd_1500.html#236" TARGET="_self">15 - Server Administration</A>).&nbsp;

<P> If [DNSlookup] is disabled for the HTTP server the HTTPDMON utility
attempts to resolve the numeric address into a host name.&nbsp; This may be disabled
using the /NORESOLVE qualifier.&nbsp;

<P> This server stress-test and benchmarking tool, as used in the Apache
Distribution, is included with the WASD package (sourced from
http://webperf.zeus.co.uk/ab.c), within
<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/doc/misc/apache_group_licence.txt">license</A>
conditions.&nbsp;

<P> <B>ApacheBench will only compile and run for Alpha or VAX systems
with VMS 7.<I>n</I> or greater available.&nbsp;</B>  It is a simple but
effective tool, allowing a single resource to be requested from a server a
specified number of times and with a specified concurrency.&nbsp;  This can be used
to benchmark a server or servers, or be used to stress-test a server
configuration's handling of variable loads of specific resquests (before
exhausting process quotas, etc.)

<P> A small addition to functionality has been made.&nbsp;  The WASD ApacheBench
displays a count of the HTTP response categories received (i.e. the number of
2<I>nn</I>s, 4<I>nn</I>s, etc.)  This allows easier assessment of
the relevance of results (i.e. measuring performance of some aspect only to
find the results showed the performance of 404 message generation - and yes, an
annoying experience of the author's prompted the changes!)

<P>The following examples illustrate it's use.&nbsp;

<A NAME="287">
<H3><BR><U>20.8 - qdLogStats</U></H3>
</A>

<P> <B>Quick-and-Dirty LOG STATisticS</B> is a utility to extract
very elementary statistics from Web server common/combined format log files.&nbsp; 
It is intended for those moments when we think &quot;I wonder how many times
that new archive has been downloaded?&nbsp;&quot;, &quot;How much data was transfered
during November?&nbsp;&quot;, &quot;How often is <I>such-and-such</I> a client
using the authenticated <I>so-and-so</I> service?&nbsp;&quot;, &quot;How much has
the mail service been used?&nbsp;&quot; ... and want the results in a matter of
seconds (or at least a few tens of seconds ;^)

<P> A number of filters allow subsets of the log contents to be selected.&nbsp; 
These filters are simple &quot;sort-of-regular&quot; expressions, not
case-sensitive (deliberately), can contain wildcards (such as asterisks (*),
question marks (?), and percent signs (%)) as well as &quot;semi-regular&quot;
expressions (such as the range [a-z]).  THERE IS NO WAY (that I know of) TO
ESCAPE THESE RESERVED CHARACTERS!&nbsp; (This functionality uses decc$match_wild()
function.)   All matches are made by string pattern matching, hence a query
/AFTER=01-NOV cannot be done.&nbsp;  Of course date pattern matching can!&nbsp;

<P> Special constructs allow more complex expressions to be built up.&nbsp; 
Combinations of required and excluded strings may be specified in the one
expression.&nbsp;  When a string begins with a &quot;+{&quot; it must be present for the
record not to be filtered out.&nbsp;  If it begins &quot;-{&quot; then it must not be
present.&nbsp;  Such specifications must be terminated with a matching closure
&quot;}&quot;.

<P> A knowlege of the format and contents of the <I>common</I> and
<I>combined</I> log formats will assist in deciding which and to what
purpose filters should be used.&nbsp;  Record filtering is done in the same order as
is finally displayed, so <I>method</I> would be processed before
<I>user-agent</I> for instance.&nbsp;  Normally a record match terminates on the
first non-matched filter (to expedite processing).&nbsp;  To compare and report each
filter for every record apply the /ALL qualifier.&nbsp;  To view records as they are
processed use the /VIEW qualifier.&nbsp;  This by default displays all matched
records, but the optional =ALL or =NOMATCH parameters will display all records, 
or all those but the matches.&nbsp;

<A NAME="288">
<H3><BR><U>20.9 - Server Workout <I>(stress-test)</I></U></H3>
</A>

<P> The WWWRKOUT (&quot;World Wide Web Workout&quot;) utility exercises an HTTP
server, both in the number of concurrent connections maintained and in the
number of back-to-back sequential connection requests and data transfers.&nbsp;

<P> This utility can be used to <I>stress-test</I> the WASD VMS HTTP
server (or any other), or to make comparisons between it and other servers.&nbsp;
When stress-testing a server, evaluating performance or just using it to try
and break a test-bed server, it is best used from multiple, autonomous systems
concurrent.&nbsp;

<P> It sets up and maintains a specified number of concurrent connections to 
a server.&nbsp;  It reads a buffer of data from each connection in turn, where data 
is waiting (does not block), until the document transfer is complete and the 
connection closed by the server.&nbsp;  It then closes the local end and immediately 
reuses the now-free socket to initiate another sequence.&nbsp;  If enabled (it is by 
default), the utility attempts to reflect the real-world in varying the data 
transfer rate for each connection, by setting the number of bytes read during 
each read loop differently for each connection.&nbsp;  All transfered data is 
discarded.&nbsp; 

<P> The data transfer rate for each connection is displayed at connection
close.&nbsp; It is by default it is the effective transfer rate, that is the rate
from opening the connection to closing it, and so includes request processing
time, etc.&nbsp; If the &quot;/NOEFFECTIVE&quot; qualifier is employed it measures the
document data transfer rate only.&nbsp; 

<P> Although a single document path may be specified on the command line it 
is preferable to supply a range of document paths, one per line in a plain 
text file.&nbsp;  Each document path and/or type specified should be different to 
the others, to exercise the server and file system cache.&nbsp;  Any number of paths 
may be specified in the file.&nbsp;  If the file is exhausted before the specified 
number of connections have been established the file contents are recycled 
from the first path.&nbsp;  If a path or a file of paths is not specified the 
utility just continually requests the welcome document.&nbsp; 

<P> To assess a server's total throughput choose paths that lead to large
documents (&gt; 50K), where the overhead of connection setup, rule
processing and transfer initiation are less significant than the data transfer
itself.&nbsp; The buffer size variation functionality should be disabled using the
&quot;/NOVARY&quot; qualifier when assessing data transfer rates.&nbsp; Responsiveness
is better assessed using small documents (&lt; 2K), where the overhead
of the non-data-transfer activities is more significant.&nbsp;
