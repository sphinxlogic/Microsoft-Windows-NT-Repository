as described in the next paragraph.&nbsp; To show the version of the current UNZIP
utility, use

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ UNZIP -v

<H3><BR>Existing Installations</H3>
</A>

<P> When installing either a full archive or to a lesser extent an update
archive &quot;over the top&quot; of an existing installation consider the
following.&nbsp;
<UL>

<LI> Some <I>insurance</I> on the directory tree is recommended in case
the update should fail or otherwise be unusable or problematic (of course, this
is good advice whenever about to make major changes to anything!)  This may be
in the format of a regular site backup, special pre-update backup, or special
pre-update ZIP archive of the directory tree.&nbsp;  The latter two could be
accomplished using commands similar to the following:

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ BACKUP HT_ROOT:[000000...] location:HTROOT.BCK/SAVE/VERIFY
 
  $ ZIP "-V" location:HTROOT.ZIP device:[HT_ROOT...]*.*
  $ ZIP "-T" location:HTROOT.ZIP
</PRE></FONT>
 If using ZIP then ensure that a previous version of the target ZIP file
does not already exist.&nbsp;  If it does then that version is updated, a new
version is not created.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> For existing files a new version is created (the first time this is about
to occur the UNZIPper requests permission - either &quot;A&quot; for all, or
&quot;y&quot; or &quot;n&quot; or a per-file basis).&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> It is possible to <I>selectively</I> extract portions of a tree if
something has become damaged.&nbsp;  This would be accomplished by specifying what
needs to be extracted from the archive (instead of the default
<I>all</I>), as illustrated by the following example where only the Alpha
object modules are extracted.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ SET DEFAULT device:[000000]
  $ UNZIP "-V" device:[dir]archive-AXP.ZIP ht_root/src/httpd/obj_axp/*.*
</PRE></FONT>
</UL>


<A NAME="38">
<H3><BR><U>4.1 - Source Archive, Object Module Archives</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The complete package, source code, documentation, examples, etc., is
provided in a single main archive.&nbsp;  Installation and other build procedures
allow the entire package to be compiled and linked from this if prefered.&nbsp;  This
requires a later version of DEC C (preferably v5.<I>n</I> or greater).&nbsp; 
VAX C is no longer supported.&nbsp;

<P> In addition, for those unable or not wishing to fully build the
distribution, two other platform-specific archives are available, AXP (Alpha)
and VAX, containing a complete set of object modules, allowing the package to
be built via a link operation only.&nbsp;

<P> If a complete build is planned then only the main archive is required.&nbsp;  If
a link-only build then an additional archive for each architecture must be
UNZIPped as described above.&nbsp;  This applies to both full installations and
subsequent updates.&nbsp;  The archives will be clearly identified with the
architecture type, as illustrated in this example.&nbsp;

<P> The WASD server has been successfully installed on and used from ODS-5
(extended file specification) volumes.&nbsp;  Note that the installation procedures
and file system organisation of the package tree has been designed for ODS-2
compliance.&nbsp;  As long as this is maintained there should be no issues with
actually having it resident on an extended file system compliant volume.&nbsp;  (Of
course the issue of installing WASD on an ODS-5 volume is completely separate
from it's ability to serve the contents of an ODS-5 volume!)

<P> This implies the executables require re-linking for your particular version
of VMS.&nbsp;  This can be accomplished quite simply, perform the linking section
only of the update DCL procedure, <A HREF="htd_0400.html#41" TARGET="_self">4.4 - Update DCL Procedure</A>.&nbsp;

<H3><BR><U>4.7 - VMS 5.5-2</U></H3>
</A>

<P> WASD is only officially supported for VMS V6.0 or greater.&nbsp;  However it has
been known to successfully build and run under V5.5-2.  It will, in all
probability, require the AACRTL060 kit (which is part of DECC for this version
of VMS, or can be obtained and installed separately).&nbsp;

<P> One issue was a difficulty in using the CGI-BIN logical.&nbsp;  This was isolated
to the hyphen it contains and resolved by changing the definition of this in
STARTUP.COM, using instead &quot;CGI-BIN&quot;.&nbsp;  This is now the default for the
example startup procedure, allowing both 5.5-2 and later VMS versions to
function correctly.&nbsp;

<A NAME="46">
<H3><BR><U>4.8 - Local Setup Suggestions</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Package updates <B>will never</B> contain anything in these three
directories:
<UL>

<LI> HT_ROOT:[HTTP$SERVER]
<LI> HT_ROOT:[LOCAL]
<LI> HT_ROOT:[SCRIPT_LOCAL]
</UL>


<P> To prevent the overwriting of local configuration files it is suggested
these be placed in the HT_ROOT:[LOCAL] directory.&nbsp;  Startup files will most
probably be placed where-ever the local site manages system startup.&nbsp; These
could be placed in the HT_ROOT:[LOCAL] directory if there is nowhere more 
appropriate.&nbsp;  Authentication databases could also be placed in the [LOCAL]
directory.&nbsp;  The server account's support files (LOGIN.COM, etc.) may be
copied from the HT_ROOT:[EXAMPLE] directory into HT_ROOT:[HTTP$SERVER] and
customized as necessary.&nbsp;

<P> In like manner, local DCL scripts or DCL <I>wrappers</I> for
executable scripts should be placed in HT_ROOT:[SCRIPT_LOCAL]. Executables
should continue to be placed in HT_EXE:

<P> Changes that are made in package configuration files, etc., can then be
propagated to the local areas as appropriate.&nbsp;

<A NAME="47">
<H3><BR><U>4.9 - Organizing Documents</U></H3>
</A>

<P> It is recommended that the server distribution tree and any document and
other Web-specific data areas be kept separate and distinct.&nbsp; The former in
HT_ROOT:[000000], the latter in something like <B>WEB:[000000]</B>.&nbsp;
This logical device could be provided with the following DCL introduced into
the server startup procedures:

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ DEFINE /SYSTEM /TRANSLATION=CONCEALED WEB DSA811:[WEB.]
</PRE></FONT>

<P> The logical organisation of served data is largely hierarchical, organised
under the Web-server path root, and is achieved via two mechanisms.&nbsp; 
<OL>

<LI> The natural tree structure provided by a hierarchical file system.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> The logical hierarchy possible using rules within the mapping file to 
place disparate physical areas into a single logical structure (see 
<A HREF="htd_1000.html#120" TARGET="_self">10 - Mapping Rules</A>).&nbsp; 
</OL>


<P> WASD has a single section of the file system for the core Web files, such
as the Division home page, help areas, Web documentation, etc., it can be
accessed using the logical device WEB:[000000]. Incorporated with this are
other subdirectories providing storage for specific collections of data, such
as committee minutes, administration announcements, etc.&nbsp;

<P> Physically distinct areas are used for good physical reasons (e.g. the
area can best be hosted on a task-local disk), for historical reasons (e.g.
the area existed before any Web environment existed) or for reasons of
convenience (e.g. lets put this where access controls already allow the
maintainers to manage it).&nbsp; 

<P> Reasons for an area being physically integrated with the core Web data
area can be legitimate (e.g. there is really nowhere else it reasonably
belongs), convenience (e.g. let's quickly put it here) or by logical necessity
(it really does below as part of the core Web enviroment, e.g. documentation
on HTML, etc.)

<A NAME="48">
<H3><BR>Guidelines</H3>
</A>

<P> In general, only Web-related files need to go into the core physical Web
file area.&nbsp; All other groupings should, if possible, be decentralised into the
portion of the file system they represent and logically placed in the server's
path using rules in the mapping file.&nbsp; That is, a given project's Web files
should be located in the project's part of the file system.&nbsp; If it doesn't have
any then it may be a candidate for location in the core area.&nbsp; 

<P> When locating a Web area in a physically distinct area it is possible the
maintainers of that data will already have the correct access controls.&nbsp; If
locating an area in the core hypertext environment it will be necessary to
give the mantainer ownership of the directory area (and possibly disk quota),
or provide ACL access if multiple maintains are involved.&nbsp; 

<P> When locating Web-accessable data in a physically distinct area it will be
necessary to update the mapping file with a new rule (see
<A HREF="htd_1000.html#120" TARGET="_self">10 - Mapping Rules</A>).&nbsp; If located within the core Web area the
rules do not need to be adjusted.&nbsp;

</A>

<P> This package, as is generally the case with freeware, is mainly developed
and supported outside of the author's main occupation and working hours.&nbsp; 
Reports of problems and bugs (while not necessarily welcome :^), as well as
general queries, are responded to as soon as practicable.&nbsp;  If the documentation
is inaccurate or could benefit from clarification in some area please advise of
this also (the better the documentation the less queries you have to field
personally ... or so the theory goes).&nbsp;

<P> With all reports please include the version of the server or script, and
the hardware platform, operating system and TCP/IP package and version in use.&nbsp;

<P> If a server error message is being generated please examine the HTML source
of the error page.&nbsp;  The &quot;&lt;META...&gt;&quot; information contains
version information as well as valuable source code module and line
