<P> The most fundamental component of the WASD VMS Hypertext Services 
environment is the <B>HTTPd</B>, or HyperText Protocol Transport
Daemon, or HTTP server.&nbsp;  It has a single-process, multi-threaded, asynchronous
I/O design.&nbsp;

<A NAME="18">

<A NAME="19">
<H3><BR><U>2.2 - Server Behaviour</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The HTTPd executes permanently on the server host, listening for client
connection requests on TCP/IP port 80 (by default).&nbsp; It provides concurrent
services for a (technically) unlimitted number of clients (constrained only by
the server resources).&nbsp; When a client connects the server performs the
following tasks: 
<OL>

<LI> creates a <I>thread</I> for this request
<LI> reads and analyzes the HTTP request sent,

<BR> depending on the nature of the request ...
<UL>

<LI> transfer of a file (possibly from cache)
<LI> processing of an SSI HTML file
<LI> processing of a clickable-image mapping file
<LI> directory listing
<LI> file/directory create/update
<LI> server administration
<LI> web file-system update
<LI> interpretation of a menu file
<LI> spawn a subprocess to to provide a CGI scripting environment:
<UL>

<LI> standard CGI
 
<LI> WASD CGIplus
</UL>
 
<LI> connects to a DECnet object to provide a scripting environment:
<UL>

<LI> standard CGI
 
<LI> OSU (DECthreads) emulated
</UL>
 
</UL>
 
<LI> closes the connection to the client and disposes of the thread data 
structures 
</OL>


<P> For I/O intensive activities like file transfer and directory listing, the 
AST-driven code provides an efficient, multi-threaded environment for the 
concurrent serving of multiple clients.&nbsp; 

<P> For scripts, the technique of using multi-threaded, concurrent, spawned
subprocesses or network processes, attached to standard input/output streams,
provides a versatile, extensible, powerful scripting environment.&nbsp; Any DCL
procedure or image executing within the process can behave essentially as an
HTTP server.&nbsp; This capability is employed to easily extend the basic services
provided by the core daemon code.&nbsp; An HTTP script/server for this environment
does not need to concern itself with network activities, it merely reads and
writes from the standard I/O streams.&nbsp; 

<A NAME="20">
<H3><BR><U>2.3 - VMS Versions</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The WASD server is officially supported on any VMS version from V6.0
upwards, on both Alpha and VAX architectures.&nbsp;  Obviously no guarantees can be
made for yet-to-be-released versions but at a worst-case these should only
require relinking.&nbsp;  WASD has also been known to compile and run successfully
under V5.5-2 (see <A HREF="htd_0400.html#45" TARGET="_self">4.7 - VMS 5.5-2</A>).

<P> Note that the non-server account scripting requires a minimum VMS V6.2, to
support the $PERSONA services required for this functionality.&nbsp;

<P> The WASD distribution and package organisation fully supports
mixed-architecture clusters (both Alpha and VAX in the one cluster) as one
integrated installation.&nbsp;

<A NAME="21">
<H3><BR><U>2.4 - TCP/IP Packages</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The WASD server uses the Compaq TCP/IP Services (UCX) BG $QIO interface.&nbsp; 
The following packages support this interface and may be used.&nbsp;
<UL>

<LI> Compaq TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (Compaq Computer Corporation), any
version 
<LI> Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (aka UCX), any version
<LI> MultiNet for OpenVMS (Process Software Corporation), any version
<LI> TCPware (Process Software Corporation), any version
</UL>


<A NAME="22">
<H3><BR><U>2.5 - International Features</U></H3>
</A>

<P> As of version 4.4 the HTTP server has undergone a limited degree of
<I>internationalization</I>.&nbsp;  The impetus for this development was the use
of the package in some European countries where English is not the first
language.&nbsp;

<P> As this was not within the original critera while building the server it
has meant an extensive rewrite of some functionality within the code (I hope
it's appreciated ;^) The objective is to provide users of the server with a
more familiar and therefore more comfortable environment.&nbsp; Unfortunately the
server administrators are still confronted by an English-language interface
and documentation, but then the package doesn't pretend to be
<I>international software</I>!&nbsp;

<A NAME="23">
<H3><BR>Aspects</H3>
</A>

<P> The international features only apply to the server, not necessarily to any
scripts!&nbsp;
<UL>

<LI><B>Server Messages</B>

<P> The server uses an administrator-customizable database of messages that
can contain multiple language instances of some or all messages, using the
Latin-1 character set (ISO8859-1). Although the base English messages can be
completely changed and/or translated to provide any message text required or
desired, a more convenient approach is to supplement this base set with a
language-specific one.&nbsp;

<P> One language is designated the prefered language.&nbsp; This would most commonly
be the language appropriate to the geographical location and/or clientele of
the server.&nbsp; Another language is designated the base language.&nbsp; This must have a
complete set of messages and is a fall-back for any messages not configured
for the additional language.&nbsp; Of course this base language would most commonly
be the original English version.&nbsp;

<P> More than just two languages can be supported.&nbsp; If the browser has
<I>prefered languages</I> set the server will attempt to match a message
with a language in this preference list.&nbsp; If not, then the server-prefered and
then the base language message would be issued, in that order.&nbsp; In this way it
would be possible to simultaneously provide for English, French, German and
Swedish audiences, just for example.&nbsp;

<P> For message configuration information see <A HREF="htd_0900.html#116" TARGET="_self">9 - Message Configuration</A>.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>Server Dates</B>

<P> Dates appearing in server-generated, non-administrative content (e.g.
directory listings, not META-tags, which use Web-standard time formats) will
use the natural language specified by any SYS$LANGUAGE environment in use on
the system or specifically created for the server.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>Virtual Services</B>

<P> Virtual-server-associated mapping, authorization and character-sets allow
for easy multiple language and environment sites.&nbsp;  Further per-request
tailoring may be deployed using conditional rule mapping described below.&nbsp;

<P> For virtual services information see <A HREF="htd_0600.html#74" TARGET="_self">6 - Server Configuration</A>.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>Conditional Rule Mapping</B>

<P> Mapping rules map requested URL paths to physical or other paths (see
<A HREF="htd_1000.html#120" TARGET="_self">10 - Mapping Rules</A>).&nbsp;  Conditional rules are only applied if the
request matches criteria such as prefered language, host address (hence
geographical location to a certain extent), etc.&nbsp;  This allows requests for
generic documents (e.g. home pages) to be mapped to language versions
appropriate to the above criteria.&nbsp;

<P> For conditional mapping information see
<A HREF="htd_1000.html#143" TARGET="_self">10.7 - Conditional Mapping</A>.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>Character Sets</B>

<P> Generally the default character set for documents on the Web is ISO-8859-1
(Latin-1). The server allows the specification of any character set as a
default for text document responses (plain and HTML).&nbsp;  In addition, text
document file types may be modified or additional ones specified that have a
different character set associated with that type.&nbsp; Furthermore, specific
character sets may be associated with mapping paths.&nbsp;  A site can therefore
relatively easily support multiple character set document resources.&nbsp;

<P> Major WASD scripts also use the server default character set and/or any
request determined character set (based on request path with conditional
mapping to language or character set preferences) via CGI variable contents.&nbsp;

<P> For further information see
[CharsetDefault] and [AddType] in <A HREF="htd_1000.html#133" TARGET="_self">10.3.5 - SET Rule</A>.&nbsp;

<A NAME="24">
<H3><BR><U>2.6 - HTTP Methods Usage</U></H3>
</A>

<P> This section describes WASD-specific characteristics of the available
HTTP/1.0 request methods.&nbsp;

<A NAME="25">
<H3><BR><U>2.6.1 - GET</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Of course, the GET method is used to access documents supplied by the
server.&nbsp;  There is nothing WASD server-specific about this method.&nbsp;

<A NAME="26">
<H3><BR><U>2.6.2 - POST &amp; PUT</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The WASD HTTPd does not differentiate between POST and PUT methods, both
are handled identically.&nbsp;

<A NAME="27">
<H3><BR>Script Handling</H3>
</A>

<P> The &quot;normal&quot; usage of the POST method is to return data from a
&lt;FORM&gt;..&lt;/FORM&gt; construct to a script running on the server.&nbsp;  In
this regard WASD is no different to other any web server; the form data is
delivered to the script's standard input as a stream of URL-encoded text.&nbsp;  For
example:

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  name=Fred+Nurk&amp;address=Fred%27s+House%0D%0A0+Nowhere+Lane&amp;submit=Submit
</PRE></FONT>

<P> Note that WWW_CONTENT_LENGTH will be the length of the form data.&nbsp;  See
&quot;Scripting Environment&quot; document for further information.&nbsp;

<A NAME="28">
<H3><BR>File Creation/Upload</H3>
</A>

<P> If the client sends data back to the server using either the POST or
the PUT methods, without a script being mapped to be executed in response to
that data, the WASD HTTPd will create a file corresponding to the specified
path.&nbsp;  The data stream may be text or binary.&nbsp;

<P> <B>Of course, for the server to accept POST and PUT data in this
manner, authentication and authorization must be enabled and allow such access
to the request path.&nbsp;</B>

<P> The data stream is processed according to MIME content-type:
<UL>

<LI><B>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</B>

<P> The server specially processes &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;
POSTS (i.e. those generated by &lt;FORM&gt;...&lt;/FORM&gt;, allowing files to
be created directly from HTML forms.&nbsp;  The processing eliminates any field names
from the URL-encoded data stream, placing only field values into the file.&nbsp; 
This capability can be quite useful and is demonstrated in the Update HTTPd
module

(<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/httpd/upd.c">UPD.C</A>).

<P>
<LI><B>multipart/form-data</B>

<P> This server can process a request body according to RFC-1867,
&quot;Form-based File Upload in HTML&quot;.&nbsp;  As yet it is not a full
implementation.&nbsp;  It will not process  "multipart/mixed" subsections.&nbsp; The
implementation is basic, providing a facility to allow the upload of a file
into the server administered file system.&nbsp;  The ACTION= parameter of the
&lt;FORM&gt; tag must specify the directory (as a URL path) in which the
uploaded file will be created.&nbsp;

<P> The following example HTML illustrates how a form may be used to upload a
file from the browser host file system:

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  
  &lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="/web/directory/" ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data"&gt;
  &lt;INPUT TYPE=submit VALUE=" Upload document ... "&gt;
  &lt;INPUT TYPE=file SIZE=50 NAME=uploadfile&gt;
  &lt;/FORM&gt;

</PRE></FONT>

<P> Again, the <B>Upd</B>ate module
(<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/httpd/upd.c">UPD.C</A>)
illustrates the use of this facility.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>NOTE</B></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE>

This capability has only been tested against Netscape Navigator versions 2 and
3.  VMS Netscape Navigator 3.0b5 hangs if an upload of a variable-record format
file is attempted.&nbsp;  Stick to STREAM-LF or fixed, or convert the file to 
STREAM-LF.&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<LI><B>text/html</B>

<BR><B>text/plain</B>

<P> Text file created according to the path, VMS record type is STREAM-LF.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>image/gif</B>

<BR><B>application/octet-stream</B>

<BR><B>etc., etc., etc.&nbsp;</B>

<P> Any other MIME type is considered <I>binary</I> and the created file
is made an UNDEFINED record type.&nbsp;
</UL>


<A NAME="29">
<H3><BR>Directory Creation</H3>
</A>

<P> A directory will be created by the HTTPd if a directory path is provided
with the POST or PUT methods.&nbsp;  For example:

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /dir1/dir2/dir-to-be-created/
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="30">
<H3><BR>File Deletion</H3>
</A>

<P> A file will be deleted by the HTTPd if the file path ending with a
wildard version specification is provided with the POST or PUT methods.&nbsp;  For
example:

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /dir1/dir2/file-to-be.deleted;*
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="31">
<H3><BR>Directory Deletion</H3>
</A>

<P> A directory will be deleted by the HTTPd if a directory path ending with a

example:

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /dir1/dir2/dir-to-be-deleted/;*
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="32">
<H3><BR><U>2.6.3 - DELETE</U></H3>
