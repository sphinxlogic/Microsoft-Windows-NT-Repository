<P> For subprocess scripting the raw TCP/IP socket can be made available for
scripts to transfer data directly to the client.&nbsp;  The socket
BG<I>nnnn</I>: device name is made available via the CGI variable
WWW_GATEWAY_BG.&nbsp;  This is enabled using the [DclGatewayBg] configuration
directive.&nbsp;  As it is a completely raw stream it cannot be used, and is not made
available for SSL (&quot;https:&quot;) encrypted requests.&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>NOTE</B></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE>

Although one might imagine this direct transfer to be significantly more
efficient than the standard script mailbox the test-bench indicates that to all
purposes it provides a negligable improvement in throughput, even under high
load.&nbsp;  It probably only translates into measurable benefits for scripts
producing large quantities of output (for instance hundreds of thousands or
millions of bytes).&nbsp;  For the average script the overhead of opening a stream to
the raw TCP/IP device (which is not insignificant) and complications of the
callout requirements isn't worth the effort.&nbsp;  Still, it's there if someone
wants or requires it.&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P> The socket is created shareable between processes, and so a
channel may be assigned by the script subprocess and have data written to it.&nbsp; 
The data is raw, in the sense the script must provide all carriage control,
etc.&nbsp;  All data transfered this way is outside of the server and so may not be
WATCHed, etc.&nbsp; 

<P> The script must supply a full HTTP response.&nbsp;  This means a NPH-style header
(see <A HREF="scripting_0200.html#52" TARGET="_self">2.2.2 - Non-Parsed-Header Output</A>) and body, with full carriage-control as
required, etc.&nbsp;  The server <U>must</U> be notified that the script is
using the gateway device, by providing a CGI callout (see
<A HREF="scripting_0500.html#73" TARGET="_self">5 - CGI Callouts</A>) before any script output and after
output is concluded.&nbsp;  The first callout provides the response HTTP status code,
the second the number of bytes transfered.&nbsp;  These are also required for correct
logging of the request.&nbsp; If a channel to the BG: device is opened it should
always be closed when it is finished with.&nbsp;  Failure to do so could lead to
resource starvation for the server.&nbsp;

<P> The

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/cgi-bin/gateway_bg_example">HT_ROOT:[SCRIPT]GATEWAY_BG_EXAMPLE.COM</A>

example script demonstrates the use of the raw socket from DCL.&nbsp;  The priciples
can be applied to any scripting laguage.&nbsp;

<P> The following code fragment shows the essential requirements using the C
language.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  int  byteCount;
  char  *gatewayBg;
 
  /* see if there's a raw socket available */
  if (gatewayBg = getenv ("WWW_GATEWAY_BG"))
  {
     /* yes, begin a callout */
     fputs (getenv("CGIPLUSESC"), stdout);
     fflush (stdout);
 
     /* notify of script response and HTTP status */
     fprintf (stdout, "GATEWAY-BEGIN: %d", 200);
     fflush (stdout);
 
     /* reopen &lt;stdout&gt; to the raw TCP/IP device */
     if ((stdout = freopen (gatewayBgPtr, "w", stdout, "ctx=bin")) == NULL)
        exit (vaxc$errno);
  }
 
  byteCount = fprintf (stdout,
  "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n\
  Content-Type: text/plain\n\
  \n");
 
  ... <I>processing to &lt;stdout&gt;
     e.g. byteCount += fprintf (stdout, "Hello world!\n");</I>
 
  if (gatewayBg)
  {
     /* reopen &lt;stdout&gt; so that it's communicating via the mailbox again */
     if ((stdout = freopen ("SYS$OUTPUT:", "w", stdout, "ctx=rec")) == NULL)
        exit (vaxc$errno);
 
     /* continue callout, notify of request data transfered */
     fprintf (stdout, "GATEWAY-END: %d", byteCount);
     fflush (stdout);
 
     /* end the callout */
     fputs (getenv("CGIPLUSEOT"), stdout);
     fflush (stdout);
  }

<H3><BR>Not Supported?&nbsp;</H3>
</A>

<P> Not all vendor's TCP/IP package BG drivers, or not all older versions, may
support the C_SHARE option when creating sockets.&nbsp;  Symptoms may range from it
being ignored (and the script being unable to open a channel to the
BG<I>nnnn</I>: device) to an error being reported as the socket is being
created (and the server being unable to start at all).&nbsp;  If this occurs merely
disable the [DclGatewayBg] configuration option.&nbsp;  Script output is of course
still available via the standard script output mailbox.&nbsp;

<P> For portability scripts that use the raw socket for output should always
use a construct similar to the above example code so only to redirect output
when the GATEWAY_BG device is indicated as available.&nbsp;
