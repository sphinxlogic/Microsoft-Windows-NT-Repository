<P> A Run-Time Environment (RTE) is a persistant scripting environment with
similar objectives to CGIplus ... reducing script response time,
increasing server throughput and reducing system impact.&nbsp;  In fact the RTE
environment is implemented using CGIplus!&nbsp;  There is very little difference in
the behaviour of CGIplus scripts and RTEs.&nbsp;  Both are activated by the server,
process multiple requests (reading the request CGI environment from a data
stream supplied by the server), persist between requests in a quiescent state,
and may be removed by the server if idle for a specified period or when it
wishes to use the process for some other purpose.&nbsp; <B>Like CGIplus an
RTE must be purpose-written for the environment!&nbsp;</B>  What is the difference
then?&nbsp;

<P> With CGIplus the script itself persists between uses, retaining all of it's
state.&nbsp;  With an RTE the script does not persist or retain state, only the RTE
itself.&nbsp;

<P> A RTE is intended as an environment in which a script source is interpreted
or otherwise processed, although it is not limited to that.&nbsp;  The essential
difference between an RTE and a CGIplus script is this script source.&nbsp;  In
CGIplus the SCRIPT_NAME and SCRIPT_FILENAME CGI variables reflect the script
itself, and remain constant for each activation of the script, with PATH_INFO
and PATH_TRANSLATED providing the additional &quot;location&quot; information for
the script processing.&nbsp;  With an RTE the SCRIPT_NAME and SCRIPT_FILENAME can
vary with each activation.&nbsp;  This allows the RTE to process multiple, successive
different (or the same) scripts, each with it's own PATH_INFO and
PATH_TRANSLATED.&nbsp;  Hence, it is not unreasonable to consider the two
environments to be the same, with a slight difference in the mapping of
resources passed to them.&nbsp;

<P> This might be best illustrated with examples.&nbsp;

<A NAME="66">
<H3><BR>CGIplus Example</H3>
</A>

<P> Consider the mapping rule

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  exec+ /cgiplus-bin/* /cgi-bin/*
</PRE></FONT>
 applied to the following CGIplus request

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /cgiplus-bin/xyz/the/path/information?and=a&amp;query=string
</PRE></FONT>

<P> If the script was an executable it would be activated as

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  CGI-BIN:[000000]XYZ.EXE
</PRE></FONT>
 with script CGI information

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /cgiplus-bin/xyz
  CGI-BIN:[000000]XYZ.EXE
</PRE></FONT>
 and the request path information and query string supplied as

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /the/path/information
  THE:[PATH]INFORMATION
  and=a&amp;query=string
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="67">
<H3><BR>RTE Example</H3>
</A>

<P> By contrast with a request to activate an RTE the following mapping rule

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  exec /xyz-bin/* (CGI-BIN:[000000]XYZ.EXE)/ht_root/src/xyz/*
</PRE></FONT>
 (note the RTE executable specified inside parentheses) and request

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /xyz-bin/an_example/the/path/information?and=a&amp;query=string
</PRE></FONT>
 would activate the scripting environment (perhaps interpreter)

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  CGI-BIN:[000000]XYZ.EXE
</PRE></FONT>
 supplying it with per-request script name and file information 

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /xyz-bin/an_example.xyz
  HT_ROOT:[SRC.XYZ]AN_EXAMPLE.XYZ
</PRE></FONT>
 and path and query string information

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /the/path/information
  THE:[PATH]INFORMATION
  and=a&amp;query=string
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="68">
<H3><BR>Summary</H3>
</A>

<P> As can be seen the script information is constant for each request to a
CGIplus script, while with RTE the script information could vary with each
request (although of course it would be the same if the same script is
requested).&nbsp;  In the case of CGIplus the <I>process what?&nbsp;</I> request
information is provided only by path information, however with RTE both script
and path information are used.&nbsp;

<A NAME="69">
<H3><BR><U>4.1 - RTE Programming</U></H3>
</A>

<P> <B>The RTE interface is still CGI</B>, with all the usual
environment variables and input/output streams available, just in a CGIplus
environment!&nbsp;  Hence when coding a Run-Time Environment the same considerations
involved in CGIplus programming apply.&nbsp;  See
<A HREF="scripting_0300.html#58" TARGET="_self">3 - CGIplus</A>.&nbsp;

<P> In particular it is important a RTE should explicitly close files, free
allocated memory, etc., after processing a request (of course it cannot rely on
image  run-down to clean-up after itself).&nbsp; It is particularly important that
all traces of each script's processing are removed after it concludes.&nbsp;  This
does not mean for example that databases need to be completely closed, etc.,
which might defeat the purpose of using a persistant environment, just that
great care must be exercised by the programmer to prevent one script
interfering with another!&nbsp;

<A NAME="70">
<H3><BR>Examples</H3>
</A>
<UL>

<LI> An example RTE,

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/CGIplus/RTE_example.c"> HT_ROOT:[SRC.CGIPLUS]RTE_EXAMPLE.C</A>

provides the basics of the environment.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> WASD's own Perl RTE,

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/perl/PerlRTE*.C">HT_ROOT:[SRC.PERL]PERLRTE.C/PERLRTENG.C</A>, 

can also serve as an implementation example.&nbsp;
</UL>


<A NAME="71">
<H3><BR>CGI Function Library</H3>
</A>

<P> A source code collection of C language functions useful for processing the
more vexing aspects of CGI/CGIplus/RTE programming.&nbsp;  See
<A HREF="scripting_0100.html#38" TARGET="_self">1.7 - Scripting Function Library</A>.&nbsp;  The example RTE implementations use this library.&nbsp;

<A NAME="72">
<H3><BR><U>4.2 - Server Configuration</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The following configuration information uses the supplied Perl RTE as the
example.&nbsp;

<P> The following rule in HTTPD$MAP maps the /pl-bin/ location to where the
site wishes to locate it's CGI Perl scripts (not necessarily the same as in the
example).&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  exec /pl-bin/* (CGI-BIN:[000000]PERLRTE.EXE)/ht_root/src/perl/*
</PRE></FONT>

<P> With this rule Perl scripts may be accessed using 

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  http://host.name.domain/pl-bin/an_example
</PRE></FONT>

<P> A DCL procedure can be specified in place of an executable.&nbsp;  Merely prefix
the specification with a &quot;@&quot;.

<P> This HTTPD$CONFIG rule ensures Perl scripts could be activated via
the Perl RTE even if the HTTPD$MAP rule did not exist (see
<A HREF="scripting_0100.html#31" TARGET="_self">1.3 - Script Run-Time</A>).&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  [DclScriptRunTime]

</PRE></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>NOTE</B></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE>

The server makes no check of the RTE executable (or procedure) before
attempting to activate  it using DCL for processing the script.&nbsp;  If it does not
exist or is not accessable due to incorrent file protections the DCL of the
subprocess will report the problem.&nbsp;
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P> It does by default however, check that the file used as the script source
exists as with other scripting environments.&nbsp;  If it does not this is reported
as a &quot;script not found&quot;.&nbsp;  For RTEs that wish to report on this
themselves, or that possibly construct their own script specification via some
internal processing, this server behaviour may be suppressed for the script
activation path using the HTTPD$MAP path SETting &quot;script=nofind&quot; as in
the following example.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  set /xyz-bin/* script=nofind
  exec /xyz-bin/* (CGI-BIN:[000000]XYZ.EXE)/ht_root/src/xyz/*
</PRE></FONT>
