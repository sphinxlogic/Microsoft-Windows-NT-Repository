<P> This document is <B>not a general tutorial on
authoring scripts</B>, CGI or any other.&nbsp; A large number of references in the
popular computing press covers all aspects of this technology, usually quite
comprehensively.&nbsp;  The information here is about the specifics of scripting in
the WASD environment, which for CGI and ISAPI is generally very much like any
other implementation.&nbsp;  (Although there are always annoying idiosyncracies, see
<A HREF="scripting_0100.html#38" TARGET="_self">1.7 - Scripting Function Library</A> for a partial solution to smoothing out some of
these wrinkles.)

<P> <I>Scripts</I> are mechanisms for creating simple HTTP services,
sending data to (and sometimes receiving data from) a client, extending the
capabilities of the basic HTTPd.&nbsp; Anything that can write to SYS$OUTPUT can be
used to generate script output.&nbsp; A DCL procedure or an executable can be the
basis for a script.&nbsp; Simply TYPE-ing a file can be provide script output.&nbsp;
Scripts execute in processes separate from the actual HTTP server but under
it's control and interacting with it.&nbsp;

<P> WASD manages a script's process environment either as a dependent
subprocess or independent detached process created by the HTTP server, or as a
network process created using DECnet.&nbsp;  By default it supports subprocess CGI
scripts without further configuration.&nbsp;

<P> WASD scripting can deployed in a number of environments.&nbsp;  Other chapters
cover the specifics of these.&nbsp;

<A NAME="15">
<H3><BR><U>1.1 - Scripting Processes</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Process creation under the VMS operating system is notoriously slow and
expensive.&nbsp; This is an inescapable overhead when scripting via child processes.&nbsp;
An obvious strategy is to avoid, at least as much as possible, the creation of
these processes.&nbsp;  The only way to do this is to share processes between
multiple scripts/requests, addressing the attendant complications of isolating
potential interactions between requests.&nbsp; These could occur through changes made
by any script to the process' enviroment.&nbsp; For VMS this involves symbol and
logical name creation, and files opened at the DCL level.&nbsp; In reality few
scripts need to make logical name changes and symbols are easily removed
between uses.&nbsp; DCL-opened files are a little more problematic, but again, in
reality most scripts doing file manipulation will be images.&nbsp;

<P> A reasonable assumption is that for almost all environments scripts can
quite safely share processes with <U>great</U> benefit to response
latency and system impact (see &quot;Technical Overview, Performance&quot;) for a
table with some comparative performances).&nbsp; If the local environment requires
absolute script isolation for some reason then this process-persistance may
easily be disabled with a consequent trade-off on performance.&nbsp;

<A NAME="16">
<H3><BR>Zombies</H3>
</A>

<P> The term <I>zombie</I> is used to describe processes when
persisting between uses (the reason should be obvious, they are neither
&quot;alive&quot; (processing a request) nor are they &quot;dead&quot; (deleted) :^)
Zombie processes have a finite time to exist (<I>non-</I>life-time?)
before they are automatically purged from the system (see see &quot;Technical
Overview, Configuration&quot;).&nbsp; This keeps process clutter on the system to a
minimum.&nbsp;

<A NAME="17">
<H3><BR><U>1.1.1 - Detached Process Scripting</U></H3>
</A>

<P> With WASD it is possible to execute scripts in processes created completely
independently of the server process itself.&nbsp;  This offers a significant number
of advantages over subprocesses
<UL>

<LI> pooled quotas are no longer a consideration
<LI> cannot directly affect the server process
<LI> can be created with more appropriate process priorities
<LI> can be executed under accounts different to that of the server

<BR> (available via the $PERSONA services of VMS V6.2 and later)
<LI> allows secure but yet full-featured user scripting
<LI> processes created through the full account login process
</UL>

 without too many disadvantages
<UL>

<LI> process management is a little more complex

<BR> (particularly with server process deletion)
<LI> processes created through the full account login process

<BR> (yes, it's both an advantage and disadvantage ;^)
</UL>


<P> Creation of a detached process is slightly more expensive in terms of
system resources and initial invocation response latency (particularly if
extensive login procedures are required), but this quickly becomes negligable
as most script processes are used multiple times for successive scripts and/or
requests.&nbsp;

<A NAME="18">
<H3><BR>Enabling Detached Processes</H3>
</A>

<P> By default the server uses subprocesses for scripting (also the historical
method by which WASD executes scripts).&nbsp;  The HTTPD$CONFIG directive
[DclDetachProcess] when enabled has the server create (almost) completely
independent detached processes to execute scripts.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  [DclDetachProcess]  enabled
</PRE></FONT>

<P> When using detached processes, during shutdown the server must
explicitly ensure that each scripting process is removed from the system (with
subprocesses the VMS <I>executive</I> provides this automatically).&nbsp; 
This is performed by the server exit handler.&nbsp;  With VMS it is possible to
bypass the exit handler (using a $DELPRC or it's equivalent $STOP/ID= for
instance), making it possible for &quot;orphaned&quot; scripting processes to
remain - and potentially accumulate on the system!&nbsp;

<P> To address this possibility, during startup the server scans the system for
candidate processes.&nbsp;  These are identified by a <I>terminal</I> mailbox 
(SYS$COMMAND device), and then further that the mailbox has an ACL with two
entries; the first identifying itself as a WASD HTTPd mailbox and the second
allowing access to the account the script is being executed under.&nbsp;  Such a
device ACL looks like the following  example.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  Device MBA335:, device type local memory mailbox, is online, record-oriented
    device, shareable, mailbox device.
 
    Error count                    0    Operations completed                  0
    Owner process                 ""    Owner UIC             [WEB,HTTP$SERVER]
    Owner process ID        00000000    Dev Prot              S:RWPL,O:RWPL,G,W
    Reference count                1    Default buffer size                2048
    Device access control list:
      (IDENTIFIER=WASD_HTTPD_80,ACCESS=NONE)
      (IDENTIFIER=[WEB,HTTP$SERVER],ACCESS=READ+WRITE+PHYSICAL+LOGICAL)
</PRE></FONT>

<P> This rights identifier is generated from the server process name and is
therefore system-unique (so multiple autonomous servers will not
accidentally cleanup the script processes of others), and <B>is created
during server startup</B> if it does not already exist.&nbsp;  For example, if the
process name was &quot;HTTPd:80&quot; (the default for a standard service) the
rights identifier name would be &quot;WASD_HTTPD_80&quot; (as shown in the example
above).&nbsp;

<A NAME="19">
<H3><BR><U>1.1.1.1 - Non-Server Account Scripting</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Generally when a script executes it is within a process owned by the
server account.&nbsp;  There are often advantages to running a script under
another account.&nbsp;  The most obvious of these is the security isolation it
offers with respect to the rest of the Web and server environment.&nbsp;  It also
means that the server account does not need to be resourced especially for any
particularly demanding application.&nbsp;

<P> <B>Non-server account scripting requires detached processes be
enabled, and the $PERSONA system services available with VMS V6.2 and later.&nbsp; 
Non-server account scripting is not available under earlier versions of
VMS.&nbsp;</B>

<A NAME="20">
<H3><BR>Enabling Non-Server Scripting</H3>
</A>

<P> The $PERSONA functionality must be explicitly enabled at server startup
using the /PERSONA qualifier (see &quot;Technical Overview, Server Account
and Environment&quot;).&nbsp;  The ability for the server to be able to execute  scripts
under any user account is a very powerful (and potentially dangerous)
capability, and so is designed that the site administrator must explicitly
and deliberately enable the functionality.&nbsp;  Configuration files need to be
rigorously protected against unauthorized modification.&nbsp;

<P> A specific script or directory of scripts can be designated for execution
under a specified account using the HTTPD$MAP configuration file SET
<I>script=as=</I> mapping rule.&nbsp;  The following example illustrates the
essentials.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  # one script to be executed under the account
  SET  /cgi-bin/a_big_script*  script=as=BIG_ACCOUNT
  # all scripts in this area to be executed under this account
  SET  /database-bin/*  script=as=DBACCNT
</PRE></FONT> 

<A NAME="21">
<H3><BR>User Account Scripting</H3>
</A>

<P> In some situations it may be desirable to allow the average Web user to
experiment with or implement scripts.&nbsp;  If the &quot;script=as=&quot; mapping rule
specifies a circumflex character then for a user request the mapped SYSUAF
username is substituted.&nbsp;

<P> The following example shows the essentials of setting up a user environment
where access to a subdirectory in the user's home directory, [.WWW] with
script's located in a subdirectory of that, [.WWW.CGI-BIN].

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  SET   /~*/www/cgi-bin/*  script=as=~
  UXEC  /~*/cgi-bin/*  /*/www/cgi-bin/*
  USER  /~*/*  /*/www/*
  REDIRECT  /~*  /~*/
  PASS  /~*/*  /dka0/users/*/*
</PRE></FONT> 
 To enable user CGIplus scripting include something like

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  UXEC+  /~*/cgiplus-bin/*  /*/www/cgi-bin/*
</PRE></FONT> 

<A NAME="22">
<H3><BR>Authenticated User Scripting</H3>
</A>

<P> If the &quot;script=as=&quot; mapping rule specifies a dollar then a request
that has been SYSUAF authenticated has the SYSUAF username substituted.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  SET   /cgi-bin/cgi_process  script=as=$
</PRE></FONT> 

<A NAME="23">
<H3><BR><U>1.1.1.2 - Restricting Non-Server Scripting</U></H3>
</A>

<P> By default, activating the /PERSONA server startup qualifier allows all the
modes described above to be deployed using appropriate mapping rules.&nbsp;  Of
course there may be circumstances where such broad capabilities are
inappropriate or otherwise undesirable.&nbsp;  It is possible to control which user
accounts are able to be used in this fashion with a rights identifier.&nbsp;  Only
those accounts granted the identifier can have scripts activated under them.&nbsp; 
This means <U>all</U> accounts ... including the server account!&nbsp;

<P> This is enabled by specifying the name of a rights identifier as a
parameter to the /PERSONA qualifier.&nbsp;  This may be any identifier but the 
one shown in the following example is probably as good as any.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ HTTPD /PERSONA=WASD_SCRIPTING
</PRE></FONT> 

<P> This identifier could be created using the following commands

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
  $ MCR AUTHORIZE
  UAF&gt; ADD /IDENTIFIER WASD_SCRIPTING
</PRE></FONT>
 and granted to accounts using

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  UAF&gt; GRANT /IDENTIFIER WASD_SCRIPTING HTTP$SERVER
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="24">
<H3><BR><U>1.1.1.3 - Process Priorities</U></H3>
</A>

<P> When detached processes are created they can be assigned differing
priorities depending on the origin and purpose.&nbsp;  The objective is to give the
server process a slight advantage when competing with scripts for system
resources.&nbsp;  This allows the server to respond to new requests more quickly
(reducing latency) even if a script may then take some time to complete the
request.&nbsp;

<P> The allocation of base process priorities is determined from the
HTTPD$CONFIG [DclDetachProcessPriority] configuration directive, which takes
one or two (comma-separated) integers that determine how many priorities lower
than the server scripting processes are created.&nbsp;  The first integer determines
server processes.&nbsp;  A second, if supplied, determines user scripts.&nbsp;  User
scripts may never be a higher priority that server scripts.&nbsp;  The following
provides example directives.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  [DclDetachProcessPriority]  1
  [DclDetachProcessPriority]  0,1
  [DclDetachProcessPriority]  1,2
</PRE></FONT>

<P> Scripts executed under the server account, or those created using a mapped
username (i.e. &quot;script=as=<I>username</I>&quot;), have a process
priority set by the first/only integer.&nbsp;

<P> Scripts activated from user mappings (i.e. &quot;script=as=~&quot; or
&quot;script=as=$&quot;) have a process priority set by any second integer, or
fall back to the priority of the first/only integer.&nbsp; 

<A NAME="25">
<H3><BR><U>1.1.2 - Subprocess Scripting</U></H3>
</A>

<P> WASD's default (and historical) scripting environment is with subprocesses
created by the server.&nbsp; 

<P> With persistent subprocess scripting the pooled-resource BYTLM can become a
particular issue.&nbsp;   After the first subprocess-based script is executed the
WATCH report provides some information on the BYTLM required to support both
the desired number of incoming network connections and script subprocess IPC
mailboxes.&nbsp;  When using these numbers to resource the BYTLM quota of the server
account keep in mind that as well as server-subprocess IPC consumption of BYTLM
there may be additional requirements whatever processing is performed by the
script.&nbsp;

<P> For a standard configuration 15,000 bytes should be allowed for each
possible script subprocess, 1,000 bytes for each potential client network
connection, an additional 20,000 bytes overhead, plus any additional
requirements for script processing, etc.&nbsp;  Hence for a maximum of 30 scripts
and 100 network clients, a BYTLM of approximately 260,000 minimum should be
allowed.&nbsp;

<A NAME="26">
<H3><BR>Subprocess Environment</H3>
</A>

<P> When the subprocess is spawned by the server none of the parent's
environment is propagated.&nbsp;  Hence the subprocess has no symbols, logical names,
etc., created by the site's SYLOGIN.COM, the server account's LOGIN.COM, etc.&nbsp; 
This is done quite deliberately to provide a pristine and standard
default environment for the script's execution.&nbsp;  For this reason all scripts
must provide all of their required environment to operate.&nbsp;  In particular, if a
verb is made available via a SY/LOGIN.COM this will not be available to the
script.&nbsp;  Verbs available via the DCLTABLES.EXE or DCL$PATH of course will be
available.&nbsp;

<P> There are two basic methods for supplying a script with a required
environment.&nbsp;
<UL>

<LI> Create a DCL <I>wrapper</I> procedure that explicitly sets up the
required environment, assigns required foreign verbs, etc.&nbsp;  If a request does
not specify a script type (i.e. a .EXE, .COM, .PL, etc.) the server always
searches for a .COM first.&nbsp;  Hence a script DCL wrapper procedure with the same
name as the script itself will always be found and executed first.&nbsp;  It can set
up the required environment and then activate the actual script itself (see
<A HREF="scripting_0100.html#30" TARGET="_self">&quot;Wrapping&quot; Local or Third-Party Scripts</A>).&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> Use the HTTPD$LOGIN procedure to establish a standard environment for all
scripts (see <A HREF="scripting_0100.html#33" TARGET="_self">1.4 - Scripting Logicals</A>).&nbsp;
</UL>


<A NAME="27">
<H3><BR>Caution!&nbsp;</H3>
</A>

<P> When scripts are executed within unprivileged subprocesses created
by the HTTP server, the processes are owned by the HTTP server account
(HTTP$SERVER).&nbsp;  Script actions could potentially affect server behaviour.&nbsp; For
example it is possible for a script to issue an &quot;HTTPD/DO=EXIT=NOW&quot;
command, or for subprocesses to create or modify logical name values in the JOB
table (e.g.  change the value of LNM$FILE_DEV altering the logical search
path).&nbsp; Obviously these types of actions are undesirable.&nbsp;  In addition scripts
can access any WORLD-readable and modify any WORLD-writable resource in the
system/cluster, opening a window for information leakage or
mischievous/malicious actions (some might argue that anyone with important
WORLD-accessable resources on their system deserves all that happens to them -
but we know they're out there :^)  Script authors should be aware of any
potential side-effects of their scripts and Web administrators vigilant against
possible malicious behaviours of scripts they do not author.&nbsp;

<A NAME="28">
<H3><BR><U>1.2 - Script Mapping</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Scripts are enabled using the <I>exec</I>/<I>uxec</I> or
<I>script</I> rules in the mapping file (also see &quot;Technical
Overview, Mapping Rules&quot;).&nbsp; The script portion of the <I>result</I> must be
a URL equivalent of the physical VMS procedure or executable specification.&nbsp;

<P> All files in a directory may be mapped as scripts using the
<I>exec</I> rule.&nbsp;  For instance, in the HTTPD$MAP configuration file can
be found a rule

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  exec /cgi-bin/* /cgi-bin/*
</PRE></FONT>
 which results in request paths beginning &quot;/cgi-bin/&quot; having the
following path component mapped as a script.&nbsp;  Hence a path
&quot;/cgi-bin/cgi_symbols.com&quot; will result in the server attempting to
execute a file named CGI-BIN:[000000]CGI_SYMBOLS.COM.&nbsp;

<P> Multiple such paths may be designated as <I>exec</I>utable, with their
contents expected to be scripts, either directly executable by VMS (e.g. .EXEs
and .COMs) or processable by a designated interpreter, etc., (e.g. .PLs,
.CLASSes).&nbsp; See <A HREF="scripting_0100.html#31" TARGET="_self">1.3 - Script Run-Time</A> below.&nbsp;

<P> In addition individual files may be specified as scripts.&nbsp;  This is done
using the <I>script</I> rule.&nbsp;  In the following example the request path
&quot;/help&quot; activates the &quot;Conan The Librarian&quot; script.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  script /help* /cgi-bin/conan*
</PRE></FONT>

<P> Of course, multiple such rules may be used to map such abbreviated or
self-explanatory script paths to the actual script providing the application.&nbsp;

<A NAME="29">
<H3><BR>Mapping Local or Third-Party Scripts</H3>
</A>

<P> <B>It is not necessary to move/copy scripts into the server
directory structure to make them accessable.&nbsp;</B>  In fact there are probably
good reasons for not doing so!&nbsp;  For instance, it keeps a package together so
that at the next upgrade there is no possibility of the
&quot;server-instance&quot; of that application being overlooked.&nbsp;

<P> To make scripts provided by third party packages available for server
activation two requirements must be met.&nbsp;
<UL>

<LI> The server account must have read/execute access to any and all images and
other resources required to use the application.&nbsp;
<LI> Mapping rules must exist to make the script and any required resources
accessable.&nbsp;
</UL>


<P> Most packages having such an interface for Web server access would
provide details on mapping into the package directory.&nbsp;  For illustration the
following mapping rules provide access to a package's scripts (assuming it
provides more than one) and also into a documentation area.&nbsp;

<P> The hypothetical &quot;Application X&quot; directory locations are

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  APPLICATIONX_ROOT:[DOC]
  APPLICATIONX_ROOT:[CGI-BIN]
</PRE></FONT>

<P> The required mapping rules would be

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  pass /applicationX/* /applicationX_root/docs/*
  exec /appX-bin/* /applicationX_root/cgi-bin/*
</PRE></FONT>

<P> Access to X's scripts would be using a path such as

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  http://the.host.name/appx-bin/main_script?plus=some&amp;query=string
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="30">
<H3><BR>&quot;Wrapping&quot; Local or Third-Party Scripts</H3>
</A>

<P> Sometimes it may be necessary to provide a particular non-WASD, local, or
third-party script with particular environment in which to execute.&nbsp;  This can
be provided by <I>wrapping</I> the script executable or interpreted script
in a DCL procedure (of course, if the local or third-party script is already
activated by a DCL procedure, then that may need to be directly modified).&nbsp; 
Simply create a DCL procedure, in the same directory as the script executable,
containing the required environmental commands.&nbsp;

<P> For example, the following DCL procedure defines a scratch directory and
provides the location of the configuration file.&nbsp;  It is assumed the script
executable is APPLICATIONX_ROOT:[CGI-BIN]APPX.EXE and the script wrapper
APPLICATIONX_ROOT:[CGI-BIN]APPX.COM.&nbsp;

</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="31">
<H3><BR><U>1.3 - Script Run-Time</U></H3>
</A>

<P> A script is merely an executed or interpreted file.&nbsp; Although by default VMS
executables and DCL procedures can be used as scripts, other environments may
also be configured.&nbsp; For example, scripts written for the Perl language may be
transparently given to the Perl interpreter in a script subprocess.&nbsp; This type
of script activation is based on a unique file type (extension following the
file name), for the Perl example this is most commonly &quot;.PL&quot;, or
sometimes &quot;.CGI&quot;.&nbsp; Both of these may be configured to automatically
invoke the site's Perl interpreter, or any other for that matter.&nbsp; 

<P> This configuration is performed using the HTTPD$CONFIG [DclScriptRunTime]
directive, where a file type is associated with a run-time interpreter.&nbsp; This
parameter takes two components, the file extension and the run-time verb.&nbsp; The
verb may be  specified as a simple, globally-accessable verb (e.g. one embedded
in the CLI tables), or in the format to construct a <I>foreign-verb</I>,
providing reasonable versatility.&nbsp; Run-time parameters may also be appended to
the verb if desired.&nbsp; The server ensures the verb is foreign-assigned if
necessary, then used on a command line with the script file name as the final
parameter to it.&nbsp;

<P> The following is an example showing a Perl interpreter being
specified.&nbsp;  The first line assumes the &quot;Perl&quot; verb is globally
accessable on the system (e.g. perhaps provided by the DCL$PATH logical) while
the second (for the sake of illustration) shows the same Perl interpreter being
configured for a different file type using the foreign verb syntax.&nbsp;

<A NAME="32">
<H3><BR>Script File Extensions</H3>
</A>

<P> The WASD server does not require a file type (extension) to be explicitly
provided when activating a script.&nbsp; This can help hide the implementation
detail of any script.&nbsp; If the script path does not contain a file type the
server searches the script location for a file with one of the known file
types, first &quot;.COM&quot; for a DCL procedure, then &quot;.EXE&quot; for an
executable, then any file types specified using script run-time configuration
directive, in the order specified.&nbsp;

<P> For instance, the script activated in the Perl example above could have
been specified as below and (provided there was no &quot;EXAMPLE.COM&quot; or
&quot;EXAMPLE.EXE&quot; in the search) the same script would have been executed.&nbsp;

<P> Two logicals provide some control of and input to the DCL subprocess
scripting environment (which includes standard CGI, CGIplus and ISAPI,
DECnet-based CGI, but excludes DECnet-based OSU).&nbsp;
<UL>

<LI><B>HTTPD$LOGIN - </B> Specifies the location of a command
procedure that can be executed <U>immediately</U> before the script
procedure/image/script-file is activated.&nbsp;  This is intended for the provision
of a common per-site environment, etc., but could be used for any purpose.&nbsp;
Activate using a system-wide logical as in the following example.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ DEFINE /SYSTEM HTTPD$LOGIN HT_ROOT:[LOCAL]HTTPD$LOGIN.COM
</PRE></FONT>

<P> Note that each layer of execution added to the scripting environment
increases both system overhead and response latency.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>HTTPD$VERIFY - </B> Activates DCL verify for the DCL
subprocess scripting environment.&nbsp;  This shows the DCL commands used to support
script activation.&nbsp;  Intended for problem investigation.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ DEFINE /SYSTEM HTTPD$VERIFY 1
</PRE></FONT>
</UL>


<P> Note that most WASD scripts also contain logical names that can be set for
debugging purposes.&nbsp;  These are generally in the format
<I>script_name</I>$DBUG and if exist activate debugging statements
throughout the script.&nbsp;

<A NAME="34">
<H3><BR><U>1.5 - Scripting Scratch Space</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Scripts often require temporary file space during execution.&nbsp;  Of course
this can be located anywhere the scripting account (most often HTTP$SERVER) has
appropriate access.&nbsp;  The WASD package does provide a default area for such
purposes with permissions set during startup to allow the server account full
access.&nbsp;  The default area is located in

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  HT_ROOT:[SCRATCH]
</PRE></FONT>
 as is accessed by the server and scripts using the logical name

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  HT_SCRATCH:
</PRE></FONT>

<P> The server provides for the routine clean-up of old files in HT_SCRATCH:
left behind by aborted or misbehaving scripts (although as a matter of design
all scripts should attempt to clean up after themselves).&nbsp;  The HTTPD$CONFIG
directives

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  [DclCleanupScratchMinutesMax]
  [DclCleanupScratchMinutesOld]
</PRE></FONT>
 control how frequently the clean-up scan occurs, and how old files need to
be before being deleted.&nbsp;  Whenever script processes are active the scratch area
is scanned at the maximum period specified, or whenever the last script process
is purged from the system by the server.&nbsp;

<P> Of course there is always the potential for interaction between scripts
using a common area for such purposes.&nbsp;  At the most elemetary, care must be
taken to ensure unique file name are generated.&nbsp;  At worst there is the
potential for malicious interaction and information leakage.&nbsp;  Use such common
areas with discretion.&nbsp;

for many uses including the type extension of temporary files.&nbsp;  The following
