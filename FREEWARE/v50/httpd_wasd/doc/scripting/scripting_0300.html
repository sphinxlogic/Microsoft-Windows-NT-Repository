<P> I know, I know!&nbsp;  The term <U>CGIplus</U> is a bit <U>too
cute</U> but I had to call it something!&nbsp;

<P> CGIplus attempts to eliminate the overhead associated with creating the
subprocess and then executing the image of a CGI script.&nbsp;  It does this by
allowing the subprocess and any associated image/application to continue
executing between uses, eliminating any startup overheads.&nbsp;  This reduces both
the load on the system and the request latency.&nbsp;  In this sense these advantages
parallel those offered by commercial HTTP server-integration APIs, such as
Netscape NSAPI and Microsoft ISAPI, without the disadvantages of such
proprietory interfaces, the API complexity, language dependency and server
process integration.&nbsp;

<P> Existing CGI scripts can rapidly and elegantly be modified to
additionally support CGIplus.&nbsp; The capability of scripts to easily
differentiate between and operate in both standard CGI and CGIplus
environments with a minimum of code revision offers great versatility.&nbsp;  Many
WASD scripts operate in both environments.&nbsp;

<A NAME="59">
<H3><BR>CGIplus Performance</H3>
</A>

<P> A simple performance evaluation indicates the advantage of CGIplus.&nbsp;  See
&quot;Techncial Overview, Performance&quot; for some test results comparing the
CGI and CGIplus environments.&nbsp;

<P> Without a doubt, the subjective difference in activating the same script
within the standard CGI and CGIplus environments is quite startling!&nbsp;

<A NAME="60">
<H3><BR><U>3.1 - CGIplus Programming</U></H3>
</A>

<P> <B>The script interface is still CGI</B>, with all the usual
environment variables and input/output streams available, which means a new API
does not need to be learned and existing CGI scripts are simple to modify.&nbsp;

<P> See examples in
<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/CGIplus/*.*">HT_ROOT:[SRC.CGIPLUS]</A>


<P> Instead of having the CGI variables available from the environment
(generally accessed via the C Language <I>getenv()</I> standard library
call) a CGIplus script must read the CGI variables from CGIPLUSIN.&nbsp; They are
supplied as a series of records (lines) containing a CGI variable name (in
upper-case), an equate symbol and then the variable value.&nbsp; The format may be
easily parsed and as the value contains no encoded characters may be directly
used.&nbsp;  The quantity of characters in each record depends on the size of the
variable name and the length of the associated value.&nbsp;  The value can vary from
zero, to tens, hundreds, even thousands of characters.&nbsp;  It is limited by the
size of the CGIPLUSIN mailbox, which is in turn set by the
[BufferSizeDclCgiPlusIn] configuration directive.&nbsp;

<P> Requirements when using:
<UL>

<LI> The read will block between subsequent requests and so may be used to
coordinate the application.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> The first record read in any request can always be discarded.&nbsp;  This is
provided so that a script may be synchronized outside of the general CGIplus
variable read loop (the DCL and Perl examples use this feature).&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> The CGIplus variable stream should be completely read (up until the blank
line, see below) before beginning any request processing.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> The CGIplus variable stream should ALWAYS BE COMPLETELY READ (up until the
blank line, see below).&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> An empty record (blank line) indicates the end of a single request's
CGIplus variable stream.&nbsp; Reading MUST be halted at this stage.&nbsp;  Request
processing may then commence.&nbsp;
</UL>


<P> After processing, the CGIplus script can loop, waiting to read the details
of the next request from CGIPLUSIN.&nbsp;

<P> Request output (to the client) is written to SYS$OUTPUT
(&lt;stdout&gt;) as per normal CGI behaviour.&nbsp; <B>End of output
MUST be indicated by writing a special EOF record to the output stream.&nbsp;</B> 
A unique EOF sequence is  generated for each use of DCL via a zombie or CGIplus
subprocess.&nbsp; A non-repeating series of bits most unlikely to occur in normal
output is employed ... but there is still a very, very, very small
chance of premature termination of output

(one in 2^<SUP>224</SUP> I think!)
See <A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/httpd/cgi.c">CGI.c</A> for how the value is
generated.


<P> The CGIplus EOF string is obtained by the script from the logical name
CGIPLUSEOF, defined in the script subprocess' process table, using the
scripting language's equivalent of F$TRNLNM(), SYS$TRNLNM(), or a getenv()
call (in the C standard library).&nbsp; This string will always contain less than 64
characters and comprise only printable characters.&nbsp; It must be written at the
conclusion of a request's output to the output stream as a single record
(line) but may also contain a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; or just
&lt;LF&gt; trailing carriage-control (to allow for programming language
requirements).&nbsp; It only has to be evaluated once, as the processing begins,
remaining the same for all requests over the life-time of that instance of the
script.&nbsp;

<P> HTTP input (raw request body stream) is still available to a CGIplus script.&nbsp;

<A NAME="61">
<H3><BR>CGI Function Library</H3>
</A>

<P> A source code collection of C language functions useful for processing the
more vexing aspects of CGI/CGIplus/RTE programming.&nbsp;  See
<A HREF="scripting_0100.html#38" TARGET="_self">1.7 - Scripting Function Library</A>.&nbsp;

<A NAME="62">
<H3><BR><U>3.2 - Code Examples</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Of course a CGIplus script should only have a single exit point and should
explicitly close files, free allocated memory, etc., after processing a
request (i.e. not rely on image run-down to clean-up after itself).&nbsp; It is
particularly important when modifying existing scripts to work in the CGIplus
environment to ensure this requirement is met (who of us hasn't thought
&quot;well, this file will close when the image exits anyway&quot;?)

<P> It is a simple task to design a script to modify it's behaviour according
to the environment it is executing in.&nbsp; Detecting the presence or absence of
the CGIPLUSEOF logical is sufficient indication.&nbsp; The following C code fragment
shows simultaneously determining whether it is a standard or CGIplus
environment (and setting an appropriate boolean), and getting the CGIplus EOF
sequence (if it exists).&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  int  IsCgiPlus;
  char  *CgiPlusEofPtr;
 
  IsCgiPlus = ((CgiPlusEofPtr = getenv("CGIPLUSEOF")) != NULL);
</PRE></FONT>

<P> The following C code fragment shows a basic CGIplus request loop, reading
lines from CGIPLUSIN, and some basic processing to select required CGI
variables for request processing.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  if (IsCgiPlus)
  {
     char  *cptr;
     char  Line [1024],
           RemoteHost [128];
     FILE  *CgiPlusIn;
 
     if ((CgiPlusIn = fopen (getenv("CGIPLUSIN"), "r")) == NULL)
     {
        perror ("CGIplus: fopen");
        exit (0);
     }
 
     for (;;)
     {
        /* will block waiting for subsequent requests */
        for (;;)
        {
           /* should never have a problem reading CGIPLUSIN, but */
           if (fgets (Line, sizeof(Line), CgiPlusIn) == NULL)
           {
              perror ("CGIplus: fgets");
              exit (0);
           }
           /* first empty line signals the end of CGIplus variables */
           if (Line[0] == '\n') break;
           /* remove the trailing newline */
           if ((cptr = strchr(Line, '\n')) != NULL) *cptr = '\0';
 
           /* process the CGI variable(s) we are interested in */
           if (!strncmp (Line, "WWW_REMOTE_HOST=", 16))
              strcpy (RemoteHost, Line+16);
        }
 
        <I>(process request, signal end-of-output)</I>
     }
  }
</PRE></FONT>
 CGI scripts can write output in record (line-by-line) or binary mode
(more efficient because of buffering by the C RTL).&nbsp;  When in binary mode the
output stream must be flushed immediately before and after writing the CGIplus
EOF sequence (note that in binary a full HTTP stream must also be used).&nbsp; This
code fragment shows placing a script output stream into binary mode and the
flushing steps.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /* reopen output stream so that the '\r' and '\n' are not filtered */
  if ((stdout = freopen ("SYS$OUTPUT", "w", stdout, "ctx=bin")) == NULL)
     exit (vaxc$errno);
 
  do {
 
     <I>(read request ...)</I>
 
     /* HTTP response header */
     fprintf (stdout, "HTTP/1.0 200 Success\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n");
 
     <I>(other output ...)</I>
 
     if (IsCgiPlus)
     {
        /* the CGIplus EOF must be an independant I/O record */
        fflush (stdout);
        fprintf (stdout, "%s", CgiPlusEofPtr);
        fflush (stdout);
     }
 
  } while (IsCgiPlus);
</PRE></FONT>
 If the script output is not binary (using default &lt;stdout&gt;) it
is only necessary to ensure the EOF string has a record-delimiting new-line.&nbsp; 

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  fprintf (stdout, "%s\n", CgiPlusEofPtr);
</PRE></FONT>
 Other languages may not have this same requirement.&nbsp;  DCL procedures are
quite capable of being used as CGIplus scripts.&nbsp;

<P> See examples in

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>Hint!&nbsp;</B></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE>

Whenever developing CGIplus scripts/applications (unlike standard CGI) don't
forget that after compiling, the old image must be purged from the server
before trying out the new!!!  (I've been caught a number of times :^) 

<P> Scripting subprocesses may be purged or deleted using (see
&quot;Techncial Overview, Server Command Line Control&quot;):

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ HTTPD /DO=DCL=DELETE
  $ HTTPD /DO=DCL=PURGE
</PRE></FONT>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE></BLOCKQUOTE>


<A NAME="63">
<H3><BR><U>3.3 - Other Considerations</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Multiple CGIplus scripts may be executing in subprocesses at any one time.&nbsp;
This includes multiple instances of any particular script.&nbsp;  It is the server's
task to track these, distributing appropriate requests to idle subprocesses,
monitoring those currently processing requests, creating new instances if and
when necessary, and deleting the least-used, idle CGIplus subprocesses when
configurable thresholds are reached.&nbsp;  Of course it is the script's job to
maintain coherency if multiple instances may result in resource conflicts or
race conditions, etc., between the scripts.&nbsp;

<P> The CGIplus subprocess can be given a finite life-time set by configuration
parameter (see &quot;Technical Overview, Server Configuration&quot;).&nbsp;  If this
life-time is not set then 
the CGIplus will persist indefinitely (i.e. until purged due to soft-limits
being reached, or explicitly purged/deleted).&nbsp;  When a life-time has been set the
CGIplus subprocess is automatically deleted after being idle for the specified
period (i.e. not having processed a request).&nbsp;  This can be useful in preventing
sporadically used scripts from cluttering up the system indefinitely.&nbsp;

<P> In addition, an idle CGIplus script can be terminated by the server at any
time the subprocess soft-limit is reached (the subprocess SYS$DELPRC()ed) so
resources should be largely quiescent when not actually processing.&nbsp; Of course a
CGIplus subprocesses may also be manually terminated from the command line
(e.g. STOP/ID=).

<P> Some CGIplus scripting information and management is available via the
server administration menu, see &quot;Technical Overview, Server Reports&quot;.&nbsp;

<A NAME="64">
<H3><BR>CGIplus Rule Mapping</H3>
</A>

<P> CGIplus scripts are differentiated from standard CGI scripts in the
mapping rule configuration file using the &quot;script+&quot; and &quot;exec+&quot;
directives.&nbsp;  See &quot;Technical Overview, Mapping Rules&quot;.&nbsp;

<P> Scripts capable of operating in both standard CGI and CGIplus environments
may simply be accessed in either via rules such as

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  exec /cgi-bin/* /cgi-bin/*
  exec+ /cgiplus-bin/* /cgi-bin/*
</PRE></FONT>
 while specific scripts can be individually designated as CGIplus using

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  script+ /cgiplus_example* /cgi-bin/cgiplus_example*
</PRE></FONT>

<P> <B>Caution!&nbsp; </B> If changing CGIplus script mapping it is
advised to restart the server rather than reloading the rules.&nbsp;  Some conflict
is possible when using new rules while existing CGIplus scripts are executing.&nbsp;
