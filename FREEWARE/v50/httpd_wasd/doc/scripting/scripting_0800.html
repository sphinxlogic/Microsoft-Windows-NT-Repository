<P> WASD supports Perl scripting in the CGI, CGIplus and RTE environments.&nbsp; 
Generally no source changes are required to use standard CGI Perl scripts!&nbsp;
Information in this section pertains specifically to VMS Perl 5.6 and
following.&nbsp;  Earlier versions may have some limitations.&nbsp; VMS Perl 5.6 is a
relatively complete Perl implementation and standard distributions contain
some VMS-specific functionality.&nbsp;  In particular the VMS::DCLsym and VMS::Stdio
can make life simpler for the VMS perl developer.&nbsp;

<P> Users of VMS Perl are directed to the &quot;VMS Perl FAQ (Unofficial)&quot;

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/perl/VMS.html">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/perl/VMS.html</A>,

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.sidhe.org/vmsperl/">http://www.sidhe.org/vmsperl/</A>,

<H3><BR><U>8.1 - Activating Perl</U></H3>
</A>

<P> There are a number of ways to activate a Perl script under VMS.&nbsp;  Any of
these may be used with the WASD server.&nbsp;  If the script file is accessable via
the <I>exec</I> or <I>script</I> rules of the HTTPD$MAP configuration
file it can be activated by the server.&nbsp;  The simplest example is to place the
scripts somewhere in the CGI-BIN:[000000] path and execute via /cgi-bin/,
although in common with other scripts it may be located anywhere a rule
provides a path to access it (see <A HREF="scripting_0100.html#28" TARGET="_self">1.2 - Script Mapping</A>).&nbsp;

<A NAME="102">
<H3><BR>Directly</H3>
</A>

<P> When Perl is available from the command-line, either as a DCLTABLES defined
verb, a DCL$PATH available verb, or as a <I>foreign</I> verb.&nbsp;  The script
(the file containg the Perl source) is provided to the Perl interpreter as a
parameter to the Perl verb.&nbsp;

<A NAME="103">
<H3><BR>DCL Procedure Wrapped</H3>
</A>

<P> If DCL pre-processing, or some other specific environment needs to be set
up, the activation of the Perl script can be placed inside a DCL
<I>wrapper</I> procedure.&nbsp;  This is often used to allow the transparent
activation of Perl scripts via the DCL$PATH mechanism.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ PERL = "$PERL_ROOT:[000000]PERL.EXE"
  $ DEFINE /USER PERL_ENV_TABLES CLISYM_GLOBAL,LNM$PROCESS
  $ PERL <I>perl-script-file-name</I>
</PRE></FONT>

<A NAME="104">
<H3><BR>DCL Procedure Embedded</H3>
</A>

<P> The Perl source is embedded as in-line data within a DCL procedure.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ DEFINE /USER PERL_ENV_TABLES CLISYM_GLOBAL,LNM$PROCESS

<H3><BR><U>8.2 - CGI Environment</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Due to changes in environment handling sometime between versions 5.0 and
5.6 it was impossible to access DCL symbols via the %ENV hash, making CGI-based
scripts impossible to use under VMS Web servers without modification.&nbsp;  Version
5.6 addresses this issue by providing a versatile mechanism for controlling
where the environment variables are manipulated.&nbsp;  The logical name
PERL_ENV_TABLES specifies this location, or if defined as a search list, the
locations.&nbsp;

</CENTER><BR>


<P> For WASD Perl scripting it is recommended that this be defined as
CLISYM_GLOBAL,LNM$PROCESS.&nbsp;  The CLISYM_GLOBAL allows access to the CGI variable
environment, and LNM$PROCESS to significant logical name definitions for the
subprocess (e.g. HTTP$INPUT and callout sequences).&nbsp;  This can be done on a
system-wide basis (i.e. for all Perl scripting) using

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ DEFINE /SYSTEM PERL_ENV_TABLES CLISYM_GLOBAL,LNM$PROCESS
</PRE></FONT>
 during system startup, or by defining a user-mode logical in a DCL
procedure <I>wrapper</I> immediately before activating the Perl
interpreter (as show in the examples in this section).&nbsp;

<A NAME="106">
<H3><BR><U>8.3 - POSTed Requests</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Requests using the POST method contain all the content in the body of the
request.&nbsp;  In particular, requests generated via HTML &lt;FORM&gt;
contructs do not deliver the form data via the request query string, it is
provided in a URL-form-encoded body.&nbsp;  This requires some explicit processing
to recover the form elements.&nbsp;  A number of Perl CGI modules exist to ease this
chore, including the most popular CGI.pm.&nbsp;  All of these should work in the VMS
environment, and of course then with WASD.&nbsp;

<P> For POSTed requests it is necessary for the script to have access to the
request body.&nbsp;  In Unix environments this is available via the
&lt;stdin&gt; stream, and under Perl via STDIN, &lt;&gt;, etc.&nbsp;  This
equates to SYS$INPUT under VMS.&nbsp;

<P> With WASD, when activating the .PL script file directly via a
[DclScriptRunTime] entry (i.e. without a DCL procedure wrapper) STDIN is
directly available without further issues.&nbsp;

<P> If the script has a DCL wrapper procedure the DCL CLI has control of the
SYS$INPUT stream and it becomes  necessary to temporarily redirect this for the
duration of the script.&nbsp;  WASD provides the HTTP$INPUT process-level logical
name to identify the script body stream (along with WWW_IN and APACHE$INPUT
names for easing script portability).&nbsp;  The redirection is simply done, as shown
in the following example.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  $ DEFINE /USER PERL_ENV_TABLES CLISYM_GLOBAL,LNM$PROCESS
  $ DEFINE /USER SYS$INPUT HTTP$INPUT
  $ PERL <I>perl-script-file-name</I>
</PRE></FONT>

<P> If the script is embedded in a DCL procedure the DCL CLI is using SYS$INPUT
to provide the script source to the Perl interpreter and so is completely
unavailable for use.&nbsp;  The request body is still available to the script however
but must be explicitly read from HTTP$INPUT.&nbsp;  This example provides the basics.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>
  $ DEFINE /USER PERL_ENV_TABLES CLISYM_GLOBAL,LNM$PROCESS
  $ PERL
  $ DECK /DOLLARS="__END__"
  # start of Perl script
  print "HTTP method is \"$ENV{'WWW_REQUEST_METHOD'}\"\n";
  # read POSTed body stream
  open (HTTPIN, $ENV{"HTTP\$INPUT"})
     or die "Could not open $ENV{'HTTP\$INPUT'}\n";
  while (&lt;HTTPIN&gt;)
  {
    chop;  # remove trailing newline
    print "&lt;HTTPIN&gt; |$_|\n";
  }
  __END__

<A NAME="107">
<H3><BR><U>8.4 - Reducing Latency</U></H3>
</A>

<P> Perl is an interpreter, meaning scripts are provided and activated as
source form, the interpreter processing the program &quot;on-the-fly&quot;.&nbsp; Perl
actually translates the entire script into an intermediate form before
beginning execution.&nbsp;  This has the advantage of discovering and reporting
syntax errors before beginning any actual processing, and also improves the
final run-time performance.&nbsp;

<P> While having Perl an interpreter eases development and portability it does
incur a performance penalty, particularly in activation latency, due to both
interpreter image activation, and script  and associated Perl module
preprocessing.&nbsp;  With standard CGI, where each request processed is handled as
an autonomous activation, this becomes quite noticable and can have significant
system impact.&nbsp;

<P> WASD provides two solutions for this and other persistent scripting issues.&nbsp;

<A NAME="108">
<H3><BR><U>8.4.1 - CGIplus</U></H3>
</A>

<P> CGIplus substantially eliminates the overhead associated with CGI
processing by allowing the subprocess and any associated image/application to
continue executing between uses.&nbsp;  For detailed information see
<A HREF="scripting_0300.html#58" TARGET="_self">3 - CGIplus</A>.&nbsp;  The good news is, CGIplus is
relatively simple to support, even using Perl.&nbsp;  The great news is,
<B>CGIplus can reduce latency and improve performance by some
twenty-fold!!</B>

<P> With CGIplus the Perl script remains active for the life of the subprocess.&nbsp; 
That is it persists!&nbsp;  Read the general philosphy and implementation details in
the above reference.&nbsp;  Note that it is still substantially CGI!&nbsp;  The notable
differences are two.&nbsp;  CGI variables are obtained by reading a stream, not using
the %ENV hash.&nbsp;  The end-of-script is indicated by writing a special byte
sequence (detected and used by the server).&nbsp;  Of course the request body is
still available via the usual stream.&nbsp;

<P> Using the basic principles described in the CGIplus Chapter a Perl CGIplus
script would be relatively simple to build from scratch.&nbsp;  To assist in
deploying CGIplus Perl scripting a CGIplus.pm Perl module has been provided.&nbsp; 
This allows a function reference to be passed to a module function and
then using the module's own <I>environment</I> hash CGI variables may be
simply accessed.&nbsp;  The module also provides other functionality to ease the
sending of binary response streams (which can be a problem with the VMS perl
interpreter).&nbsp;

<P> Examples for this may be found in the

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/perl/">HT_ROOT:[SRC.PERL]</A>

directory.&nbsp;

<A NAME="109">
<H3><BR><U>8.4.2 - Run-Time Environment</U></H3>
</A>

<P> A Run-Time Environment (RTE) is almost identical to CGIplus.&nbsp;  It allows an
environment to persist between requests, substantially improving response
latency and reducing system impact.&nbsp;  For information see
<A HREF="scripting_0400.html#65" TARGET="_self">4 - Run-Time Environments</A>.&nbsp; There is a significant difference between
RTE and CGIplus scripts.&nbsp;  With CGIplus the script itself persists between uses,
retaining all of it's state.&nbsp;  With an RTE the script does not persist or retain
state, only the RTE itself.&nbsp;

<P> WASD provides an RTE Perl interpreter.&nbsp;  This contains an embedded Perl
engine and an associated Perl module that allows multiple scripts to be
activated, preprocessed once and remain loaded <I>read-to-run</I>.&nbsp;  This
eliminates the overhead associated with activating the interpreter and Perl
script with each request.&nbsp;  This mechanism parallels the Apache
<I>perl_mod</I> module and works on substantially unmodified CGI scripts.&nbsp; 
<B>The test-bench indicates an improvement of some twenty-five
fold!&nbsp;</B>

<P> Examples for RTE Perl may be found in the

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/perl/">HT_ROOT:[SRC.PERL]</A>

directory.&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>NOTE</B></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=70% ALIGN=center NOSHADE>

The Perl RTE is new to WASD 7.1 and to this extent has not received any wide
and general deployment.&nbsp;  There may still be issues to be resolved, particularly
with script isolation within the interpreter.&nbsp;  Please experiment with this
environment - it's potential for improving performance is substantial - and
provide feedback to the author on any successes or problems in use.&nbsp;
