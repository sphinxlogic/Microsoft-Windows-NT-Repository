<P> During CGI or CGIplus processing (though not DECnet-based CGI) it is
possible to suspend  normal script  output to the client and for the script to
interact directly with the server, then resume output to the client.&nbsp;  This may
done more than once during processing.&nbsp;  During the <I>callout</I> the
script makes a request of the server and receives a response.&nbsp;  These requests
are to perform some server function, such as the mapping of a path to a file
specification, on behalf of the script.&nbsp;  Naturally, this makes the script no
longer portable, but may be extrememly useful in some circumstances.&nbsp;

<P> It is this general callout mechanism that allows specific authentication
agents (see &quot;Technical Overview, Authorization&quot;) to be implemented as
standard CGIplus scripts.&nbsp;

<P> The mechanism is quite simple.&nbsp;
<OL>

<LI> The script suspends normal output by writing a record containing a
unique <I>escape</I> sequence.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> It then writes a record containing a formatted request.&nbsp;  The server
interprets the request, performs the action and returns a success or error
response.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> The script concludes the callout by writing a record containing a
unique <I>end-of-text</I> sequence.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI> The script reads the server's response and continues processing.&nbsp;  In
reality the response read could occur immediately after the request write (i.e.
before the concluding end-of-text sequence).&nbsp;
</OL>


<P> This is a basic callout.&nbsp;  Between the callout escape and end-of-text
sequences multiple request/responses transactions may be undertaken.&nbsp;

<A NAME="74">
<H3><BR><U>5.1 - Requests and Responses</U></H3>
</A>

<P> The request record is plain text, comprising a request key-word
(case-insensitive), full-colon, and following optional white-space and
parameter(s).&nbsp;  It is designed not to be implementation language specific.&nbsp;

<P> The response record is also plain-text.&nbsp;  It begins with a three-digit
response code, with similar meanings and used for the same purpose as HTTP
response codes.&nbsp;  That is 200 is a success status, 500 a server error, 400 a
request error, etc.&nbsp;  Following the response code is white-space and the plain
text result or error message.&nbsp;  A response to any given callout request may be
suppressed by providing a request record with a leading &quot;!&quot; or
&quot;#&quot;.
<UL>

<LI><B>AUTH-FILE:</B> <I>file specification</I>

<P> If the specialized /PROFILE capability is enabled (see
&quot;Technical Overview, Security Profile&quot;) this can determine whether the
specified file name is allowed access by the request's username.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>GATEWAY-BEGIN:</B> <I>integer</I>

<P> When using the raw TCP/IP socket for output (see
<A HREF="scripting_1000.html#113" TARGET="_self">10 - Raw TCP/IP Socket</A>) this callout is used to notify the server that
the script will be using the gateway device and the HTTP status code (e.g. 200,
302, 404, etc.)
<P>
<LI><B>GATEWAY-END:</B> <I>integer</I>

<P> When using the raw TCP/IP socket for output (see
<A HREF="scripting_1000.html#113" TARGET="_self">10 - Raw TCP/IP Socket</A>) this callout is used to notify the server of
the quantity of data transfered directly to the client by the script.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>LIFETIME:</B> <I>integer</I>

<P> Sets/resets a script subprocess' lifetime (in minutes).&nbsp;  For instance, use
to give frequently used  CGIplus scripts an extended lifetime before being
rundown by the server (override the [DclCgiPlusLifeTime] configuration
parameter).&nbsp;  Specifying &quot;none&quot; (or -1) gives it an <I>infinite</I>
lifetime, zero resets to default.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>MAP-FILE:</B> <I>file specification</I>

<P> Map the supplied file specification to it's URL-style path equivalent, and
against the server's mapping rule.&nbsp;  This does not check the file name is legal
RMS syntax.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>MAP-PATH:</B> <I>URL-style path</I>

<P> Map the supplied URL-style path against the server's rule database into a
VMS file specification.&nbsp;  Note that this does not verify the file name legaility
or that the file actually exists.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>NOOP:</B>

<P> No operation.&nbsp;  Just return a success response.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>TIMEOUT-OUTPUT:</B> <I>integer</I>

<P> Sets/resets a script request lifetime (in minutes, overrides the
[TimeoutOutput] configuration parameter).&nbsp;  Specifying &quot;none&quot; (or -1)
gives it an <I>infinite</I> lifetime, zero resets to default.&nbsp;
<P>
<LI><B>TIMEOUT-NOPROGRESS:</B> <I>integer</I>

<P> Sets/resets a script request no-progress (in minutes, overrides the
[TimeoutNoProgress] configuration parameter).&nbsp;  The <I>no-progress</I>
period is the maximum number of seconds that there may be no output from the
script before it is aborted.&nbsp;  Specifying &quot;none&quot; (or -1) gives it an
<I>infinite</I> lifetime, zero resets to default.&nbsp;

<P> The record-oriented callout sequences and request/response makes
implementation quite straight-forward.&nbsp;  The following C language and DCL
procedure code fragments illustrate the basics.&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#333333"><PRE>  /* C language */
  CgiPlusIn = fopen ("CGIPLUSIN:", "r");
  printf ("%s\nMAP-FILE: %s\n%s\n",
          getenv("CGIPLUSESC"), FileNamePtr, getenv("CGIPLUSEOT"));
  fgets (CalloutResponse, sizeof(CalloutResponse), CgiPlusIn);
 
  $! DCL procedure
  $ open /read CgiPlusIn CGIPLUSIN
  $ write sys$output f$trnlnm("CGIPLUSESC")
  $ write sys$output "MAP-PATH: " + PathPtr
  $ read CgiPlusIn Response
  $!(no need to read a response for this next request, it's suppressed)
  $ write sys$output "#TIMEOUT-OUTPUT:10"
  $ write sys$output f$trnlnm("CGIPLUSEOT")
