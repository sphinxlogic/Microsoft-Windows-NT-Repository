Mesa3D, Utilities, The Mesa 3-D Graphics Library

This directory contains Mesa 3.4.1 for OpenVMS

"Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that 
of OpenGL.* To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command syntax or 
state machine, it is being used with authorization from Silicon Graphics, 
Inc(SGI). However, the author does not possess an OpenGL license from SGI, 
and makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a compatible replacement for 
OpenGL or associated with SGI. Those who want a licensed implementaion of 
OpenGL should contact a licensed vendor. 

While Mesa is not a licensed OpenGL implementation, it is currently being 
tested with the OpenGL conformance tests. For the current conformance status 
see the CONFORM file included in the Mesa distribution. Despite these 
technical/legal terms, you may find Mesa to be a valid alternative to 
OpenGL. Most applications written for OpenGL can use Mesa instead without 
changing the source code.

Please do not refer to the library as MesaGL (for legal reasons). It's just 
Mesa or The Mesa 3-D graphics library. 

* OpenGL is a trademark of Silicon Graphics Incorporated."
