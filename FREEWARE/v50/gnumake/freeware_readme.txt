GNUMAKE, Build_Tools, FSF GNU make tool

  GNU Make provides the ability to selectively build part or
  all of an OpenVMS application, based on analysis of the
  source files and comparision with a user-created source 
  code module dependency (makefile) module.

  Thanks to Hartmut Becker of Compaq, here are OpenVMS V7.1
  images resulting from a port of the GNU Make, as well as
  the associated source files.  This is a "special version"
  based on the FSF 3.78.1 baselevel, and a higher version 
  number will be awarded by FSF when this code is integrated
  and available in the FSF distribution.
