1. What Is MenuFinder

  MenuFinder is a menu generator for OpenVMS systems (VAX and AXP).
  It has been created to give a simple but effective answer to the
  requirement of presenting the user with a set of functions via a
  menu interface.
  In particular, MenuFinder is an ideal instrument to
  - build on-line guides for the users of the computing centre
  - document and utilise management procedures of the system 
    manager or the operator.


1. Main Characteristics

Types of option in the menus
  DCL commands, text files, data files, programs, batch files and 
  submenus can be associated with the options.

Association of programmes or commands to files.
  For example, the program used to write a document can be 
  associated with the letter: choosing the document from the menu, 
  activates that program to read or write the document.

Help text on the menu options
  A user may have to use many programs, although infrequently: it 
  is not easy therefore, to remember even the simplest functions 
  of a product. Often, shortcuts and contrivances are forgotten 
  after a while. MenuFinder allows the possibility to associate a 
  help text with each option of a menu, in which can be inserted 
  instructions, annotations and useful indications both for 
  oneself and other users.

The means of accessing the menus are particularly powerful.
  Apart from being able to use the classic hierarchical submenu 
  structure, it is also possible to jump from one menu to another
  specifying its name or supplying one or more words to search 
  for in the description of the options. 
  This capability is available not only from within MenuFinder, 
  but also from the OpenVMS prompt ($).

The navigation line
  Records the last 10 menus called-up, allowing an extremely 
  rapid means to recall them.

Rapid return to the last used menu
  In case it is necessary to exit MenuFinder and return 
  completely under the control of OpenVMS, it is still possible 
  to recall immediately the last menu used.

It's simple to construct a menu
  MenuFinder is an easy to use product: it is sufficient to know
  a few DCL commands, be able to use EDIT, the standard OpenVMS 
  editor and know the few (10 or so) instructions for the 
  generation of the menus. The construction  of a menu is 
  interactive and every change has an immediate effect on the 
  screen.

Logical Names
  The use of Logical Names both for the personalization of 
  MenuFinder and for the definition of logical directories, makes
  the management of the product extremely flexible and particularly
  suitable for a cluster environment.
