Additional information/changes in PSPLOT and/or its documentation.

Plotting units in PSPLOT are arbitrary. The default is in inches. This
can be changed by setting the variable conver in subroutine PSINIT.
This is in contrast to the hardcopy manual, which states units must be
in inches.

There's an error in the documentation for subroutines arohed and farohed.
The values of locxy should read 0,1, and 2, instead of 1,2, and 3.
