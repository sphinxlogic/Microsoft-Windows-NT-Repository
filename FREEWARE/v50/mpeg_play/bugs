KNOWN BUGS
o IDCT sometimes doesn't generate IEEE-compliant values for sparse blocks 

o seg faults when running more than one mpeg_play -loop with shared memory
  on a multiprocessor machine w/Solaris 2.4. workaround: use -shmem_off

o The control panel sometimes gets confused at the end, knowing it is done 
thus the "end" button, but still having a play state (and play button
highlighted), so a "rewind" instantly plays from start.

o -position ignores - offsets  (ie -position -1-1)

o -position should be -geometry

o sometimes crashes on SPARC-10s under tvtwm, try -controls none

o If you compile with -DNDEBUG and some mpegs cause mpeg_play to crash, check
them out with mpeg_stat -verify

o The argument parsing is very shaky for more than one mpeg to play
