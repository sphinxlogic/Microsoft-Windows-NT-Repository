This file contains notes on compiling the code for different platforms.

The Makefile contains comments to support many platforms.  You should
modify it to set the parameters for your platform.  Some common problems
people run into are discussed below.

On RS6000s libXext does not seem to support shared memory, remove -DSH_MEM

On an SGI IRIX 4, make sure to set the environment variable SGI_IRIX4
to 1, and remove none of the commented out CFLAGS.

On VMS: the standard way for building images is to use mms.  if you compile
without mms, the following variables must be defined(at least for dec c
4.0, i did not try any other compiler):
   NO_LRAND48 NO_RANDOM SIG_ONE_PARAM NO_GETTIMEOFDAY
