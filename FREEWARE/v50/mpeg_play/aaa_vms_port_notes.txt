1.  Built on linux, put build commands into make_vms.com, copied
    to VMS system, edit into DCL script.

2.  Missing #include <string.h> in various modules, needed for 
    memset.  Put it in "dither.h".  Probably not the ideal location,
    but one picked up by all program modules that had this problem.

3.  $ mycc  gdith.c

      wpixel[i*2] |= wpixel[i*2] << 32;
.....................^
%CC-W-SHIFTCOUNT, In this statement, the shift count "32" is negative or is 
greater than or equal to the promoted size of the operand "wpixel[i*2]".

That's within an ifdef for SIXTYFOUR_BIT.  Why is it set?
Ah, in video.h there's 

#ifdef __alpha__
#define SIXTYFOUR_BIT
#endif

which apparently assumes that "long" is 64 bits.  Not on VMS it isn't! 
(SHAME on COMPAQ for having "long" have different meanings on different
Alpha platforms.)  Put an addition #if !defined(__VMS) around this
in video.h.

4.  $ mycc  readfile.c

      if (startCode == EOF) {
..........^
%CC-I-QUESTCOMPARE1, In this statement, the unsigned expression "startCode" 
is being compared with an equality operator to a constan
t whose value is negative.  This might not be what you intended.

Same type of error at 622.

This is a bug.  Put in (int) casts for the two lines that trigger this, but
it may not fix it (depends on what the code that sets the value is doing.) 
I think that this only shows up if the input file is bad though. 

5.  mycc  main.c

  signal(SIGINT, int_handler);
.................^
%CC-W-PTRMISMATCH, In this statement, the referenced type of the pointer 
value "int_handler" is "function () returning void", which
is not compatible with "function (int) returning void".
at line number 688 in file PRGDISK:[SHARED.PROGRAMS.MPEG_PLAY]MAIN.C;1

Fixed by defining SIG_ONE_PARAM

6.  Copy over mpeg_play.opt from old one and modify slightly to take
out old VAX C bits.

Done.
