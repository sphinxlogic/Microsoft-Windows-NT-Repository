 Changes since last version:

1.1
o Fixed -dither color option to find best 24 bit or greater visual
  for most machines.
o Fixed recursive loop in Makefile. 
o Added entries for R6000 and SGI's in Makefile
o Fixed declaration of j_rev_dct.
o Does initial sequence start code check to confirm validity of mpeg stream.
o Changed or's in ordered dither to add's to allow more flexible
  allocation of color ranges.
o Uses shared memory.
o Lots of little bugs fixed.

1.2
o Fixed shared memory problem (freeing memory twice on exit).
o Added entries for Sony NEWS machines
o Added monochrome support.
o Unrolled loops for optimization.
o Variety of small bugs.

2.0
o Added ability to use private colormap.
o Display name can now be given as part of command line.
o Fixed green artifacts problem
o Fixed sequence end code cutoff problem.
o Lots of performance tweaks.
o Other bugs.

2.1
o Fixed frame dropping problem.
o Supports MPEG system layer (tosses audio)
o 16, 32 bit color modes (thanks to: Erik Corry erik@kroete2.freinet.de)
o Added -owncm to guarantee a private colormap
o Added gray256 to get 256 shades of grey (and added gray/grey no diff)
o Fixed leaving of shared memory buffers when shared memory crashes
  (in the common case of running from the wrong display)
o Instructions for IRIX4 Cflags in PLATFORMS.
o Added -step, -start, and -end
o Fixed insanely subtle readfile bug
o Added color2 true color doubling dither, provided by garyo@avs.com (thanks!)
o Added ppm dither, provided by Jef Poskanzer <jef@acme.com> (thanks!)
o Added bzero.c for silly SOLARIS
o -no_display doesnt put up a window now.
o -gamma float, raises the luminance of each pixel to float (a
   floating point number),  thus -gamma 0.8 darkens, -gamma 1.2 lightens
o Fixed ycc to rgb conversion block assignment mixup.
  (thanks to John Toebes <toebes@unx.sas.com> for pointing this out)
o Added frame rate limiting (-framerate)
o Doesn't skip initial B frames (after an I) if the GOP is closed.
o Auto-determines RGB order of server (well, RGB vs BGR anyway).
o Fixed a few grainy blocks appearing due to bugs in sparse IDCT function.
o -nop now implies -nob (doesnt make sense to have B's w/o P's)
o -seek indexes into files
o Added chroma averaging in color and color2 dithers (thanks to
	tristan@tcela.la.tce.com (Tristan 'RAMBO' Savatier))
o Added -quality option, which, when turned on, 
  o correctly implements halfpel motion vector averaging
  o uses a very time-consuming but accurate IDCT
o Sped up player a little by using lookup tables for y/cr/cb values
o Minor, unreported bugs.

2.2
o added controlbar (thanks: "Michael J. Donahue" <donahue@ulexite.nist.gov>)
o made -step work AFTER the picture display
o made default state be to play the video (in control panel)
o fixed bug in -start w/o -end
o fixed color equn's more (thanks tristan@cauliflower.la.tce.com (Tristan 'RAMBO' Savatier))
o made INTERPOLATE the default in color2
o made gamma_correction abstracted and in greyscale too, (thanks Tristan)
o made includes happier for VMS

2.3
o added -position (thanks to jingo@VNET.IBM.COM)
o fixed bug in parseblick.c, lower bit of level handled wrong
o extensive changes in moving variables around to make as a
  reentrant library (thanks to Loring Holden <lsh@cs.brown.edu>)
o added (then removed) -xid to have it play in an established window.
  Doesn't seem to work with the reentrant changes.  Ideas anyone?
o -ppm{width,height,skip} for scaling/subsampling in 
	-dither ppm (thanks legalize@xmission.com)
o -nob bug fixed
o now skips until it finds a start code...  Slower on bad files (like 
   mpeg_play /kernel   but works with sliced up MPEGs
o -no_display / -dithe rppm fixed (Jason Patterson <jason@reflections.com.au>)
