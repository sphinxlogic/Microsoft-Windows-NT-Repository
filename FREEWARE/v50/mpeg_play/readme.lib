It is probably best to get the updated library patches from
 http://www.cs.brown.edu/software/ooMPEG/
Here are the implementor's notes.....
--------------------
MPEG Changes for Reentrancy (plus)

Sun compiler commands to use code as a library:
-DBSD -DNONANSI_INCLUDES -DSIG_ONE_PARAM -DDEFAULT_FULL_COLOR -DNOFRAMECOUNT
-DNOCONTROLS -DDISABLE_DITHER

SGI compiler commands to use code as a library:
+w -cckr -DDEFAULT_FULL_COLOR -DNOFRAMECOUNT  -DNOCONTROLS -DDISABLE_DITHER

HP compile commands for use code as a library:
-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -DDEFAULT_FULL_COLOR -DNOFRAMECOUNT -DDISABLE_DITHER

Most changes just involved making sure that previous global information
(or static function variables) are passed down the call path to those
functions that need the information.

Changes not involving reentrancy (also mentioned in source files):
	do not define INTERPOLATE, add #ifdef INTERPOLATE (16bit.c)
	Do prototyping for static function (ctrlbar.c)
	Now can name and position each movie window individually (gdith.c, main.c)
	DISABLE_DITHER cpp define - do not include dither code if defined
	   (gdith,main.c, util32.c video.c video.h)
	NOFRAMECOUNT cpp define - do not count frames when running without
	   controls (gdith.c)
	Short circuit InitColorDisplay if not displaying anything (gdith.c)
	Ability to play >1 movie (w/out CONTROLS) (main.c, et al)
	Make sure we do a full frame for each movie (main.c)
	Changes to deal with non-MPEG streams (main.c)
	Now deals with NO_DITHER, PPM_DITHER and noDisplayFlag==1 (main.c)
	get rid on ANSI C complaints about shifting (readfile.c)
	only call DestroyVidStream up in mpegVidRsrc, not in correct_underflow
	   (util.c)
	fix parameter types for XCreateWindow call (util32.c)



Further changes that might (should?) be made:

statics that should be "de-globalized":
	gdith.c: ExecuteDisplay rate_deal, one_frame_time, tftarget, tfnow
		(when framerate=0, these aren't used)
	video.c: No_[PB]_Flag
		(effects how the movies are decoded)

globals that should be de-globalized
	main.c, gdith.c: framerate 
		(set framerate=0 for multiple movies - no waiting)
	video.h: quietFlag, qualityFlag, gammaCorrectFlag,
	   chromaCorrectFlag, chromaCorrect
		(quietFlag=0 - don't print stuff out)
		(qualityFlag=0 - don't do high quality)
		(correctFlag's - same for all movies)
	gdith.c,video.h: startFrame,endFrame
		(startFrame=endFrame=-1 - don't do any frame weirdness)

Note - my development Makefile is included in the tar file, but it uses
gnu-make and depends on:
	UGA_ARCH environment variable set to: sgi, hp, or sol (architecture
	type)
        File system location is hardcoded in, including binary directories for
	each architecture and compile type (controls, dithering, shared
	memory)
