1 DELTREE
 Syntax:  DELTREE[/qualifier] DirectorySpecification

 Delete  directory utility.  This command will delete the directory and
 its tree  (files  and  directories  if  any)  starting  from  the  top
 DirectorySpecification.   It's  much  faster than a usual command file
 using a sequential algorithm.

2 DirectorySpecification
  DirectorySpecification can be of any of the following form

    DirName[.dir]       local directory (.dir is optional)
    [.XXX.YYY]          relative path syntax. Deletes [.XXX]YYY.DIR
    DISK:[XXX.YYY]      would remove DISK:[XXX]YYY.DIR
    x,y,z               a comma separated list of the above

2 Qualifier
/ALLDIR
 /[NO]ALLDIR
 Controls  whether  or  not DELTREE/CONFIRM request confirmation before
 sub-directory deletion.  Default is /NOALLDIR.

/CONFIRM
 /[NO]CONFIRM

 Controls  whether  DELTREE  request  confirmation  for DIRector{y|ies}
 deletion.  Only the TOP directory  confirmation  is  requested  unless
 /ALLDIR is used.  Default is /CONFIRM.

/DETACH
 /DETACH

 Detach   deltree   with  all  the  other  parameters  and  qualifiers.
 /NOCONFIRM is forced in  a  detached  process.

 DELTREE  detach mode creates temporary files in SYS$SCRATCH.  They are
 named Dtree'pid'X (X currently being a number between 0 and 15).  File
 extension  are  .LOG  (output  result)  .ERR  (errors) and a temporary
 (which should not remain) .COM file.  Note that the .ERR  file  should
 not be created unless you are using the GCC compiled version.

/HELP
 /HELP

 Quick help summary.

/LOG
 /[NO]/LOG

 Prints out operation failure i.e.  protection change and file deletion
 failure.  At the end, DELTREE also prints out a CPU statistics and the
 number of files deleted. Default is /NOLOG

/NOTIFY
 /NOTIFY={MAIL|SEND}

 This qualifier can be used with /DETACH only.

 Controls  whether  a message is sent back to you upon completion.  The
 default mode MAIL sends it by mail, SEND can be used where available.

 MAIL  send the message via the MAIL program.  Only the subject will be
 used.

 If SEND symbol is defined, DELTREE will use it to send the message. If
 you are using Multinet  TCPIP,  DELTREE  will  automatically  use  the
 MULTINET  SEND program.  Otherwise, "SEND" will be assumed to be known
 and the assumed usage is of the form
	$ SEND 'username' "Message"

/PRIORITY
 /PRIORITY[=n]

 This qualifier can be used with /DETACH only.

 Use priority 'n' for the detached process. Default is n=4.

/PRIVILEGES
 /PRIVILEGES={[NO]BYPASS|[NO]READALL|[NO]GRPPRV|[NO]SYSPRV}

 This qualifier can be used with /DETACH only.

 Enables  one of the above specific privileges (we assume you have been
 granted those privileges).

 BYPASS         allows   to   delete  any  files  regardless  of  their
                protection.

 READALL        will  allow you to read and scan all files from a tree.
                This does NOT imply that you will  be  able  to  delete
                them  but only to bypass sub-directories protection and
                be able to go deeper in the  tree,  deleting  what  you
                can.

 SYSPRV         allows you file control through SYSTEM protection. This
                does NOT imply that you will  be  able  to  delete  the
                files.   If  the  SYSTEM protection mask does not allow
                you to delete/control the file, nothing will be done.

 GRPPRV         As above but through GROUP protections.

/TOP
 /[NO]TOP

 Controls  whether  or  not  DELTREE  preserve  the TOP directory.  The
 default is /TOP.

/VERSION
 /VERSION

 Shows the current DELTREE version.

2 ExitStatus
 DELTREE  has  a  full  MSG  interface and may return some error status
 depending on the severity of the problem.

 Most of the messages displayed when /LOG is used are informational or
 success messages.

 [4mWarning[0m  level  are  displayed whenever the specified directories does
 not exist or when a file protection or deletion operation has failed.

 [4mError[0m  level  are  __returned__  if  DELTREE  has failed to delete the
 tree(s) or if you are trying to make DELTREE  crash  with  some  funky
 arguments.  You will also be warned in case of privilege violation.

 [4mFatal[0m  level  will  happen  only if serious problem occurs and prevent
 DELTREE to  continue.

 $ DELTREE/LOG/NOCONFIRM/NOTOP CACHE.DIR
 %DELTREE-I-PRSRVD, top directory /sys_user4/jlauret/scratch/cache preserved

 %DELTREE-S-STAT, 21 files deleted in 0.4 seconds

 $ DELTREE/NOCONFIRM/LOG TEST
 %DELTREE-I-DEEPDIR, dealing with deep directory /disk$test/jlauret/apps_dev/
 projects/deltree/test/blip/blup
 %DELTREE-S-DELETED, /disk$test/jlauret/apps_dev/projects/deltree/test.dir.
 %DELTREE-S-STAT, 108 files deleted in 0.9 seconds

2 PROBLEMS_&_WARNINGS
 By  nature,  DELTREE  IS  A  DANGEROUS  PROGRAM.   Always think before
 pressing RETURN :)

 DELTREE  __DOES__NOT__  understand  hard-linked  directory entries the
 Unix way i.e.  ALIAS  directories  created  with  the  SET  FILE/ENTER
 command  will  be  followed  and file within those directories deleted
 !!!! BE AWARE that you should determined the list of ALIASES prior  of
 running deltree and the consequence for such deletion.

 Use  /DETACH/PRIV=BYPASS  with  care and pay attention to what you are
 doing. If you press return by mistake, you may cause great dammage  to
 your system :  time to figure out how to kill the detached process and
 the damage  may  be  unrecoverable.   So,  BEWARE  OF  THE  CONVENIENT
 FEATURE.

 This command will not give you a detailed list of the file deleted. We
 have chosen this for processing speed purposes.  Use /ALLDIR for  each
 sub-directory deletion confirmation.

 If  the  directory  from where you have issued the command disappears,
 DELTREE will abort.
