Pcal is simple to use.  After setting up a foreign symbol for the
program, the default action is to produce a PS file (called Calendar.ps)
for the current month.  I will have simple boxes for each day and you can
easily mark whatever is appropriate.

With the creation of a Calendar.dat file, you can customize the output
for individual dates with extream easy and incredible complexity.

Pcal can also be used to generate HTML or even setup as a CGI script for
dynamic web server use.  Note, the CGI aspect is not configured for use
in an OpenVMS environment.

Included are three other stand-alone calendar-related PS files for printing
3D style-calendars and one simple program for printing 132-column
calendars on Z-fold paper the "old fashioned way".

    Deskcal.ps will generate an octogon shaped calendar for the current
               year which can be cut-out and glued together to form the
               3D calendar.

    Century.ps will generate a perpetual-style calendar for 1950-2049
               that can be cut-out and assembled.

    Sundial.ps will generate a calendar appropriate for use as a sundial

    Calen.c     will generate ASCII text style calendar to 132-column
                paper
