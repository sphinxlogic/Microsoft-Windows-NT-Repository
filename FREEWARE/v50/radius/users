#
#	This file contains security and configuration information
#	for each user.  The first field is the user's name and
#	can be up to 8 characters in length.  This is followed (on
#	the same line) with the list of authentication requirements
#	for that user.  This can include password, comm server name,
#	comm server port number, and an expiration date of the user's
#	password.  When an authentication request is receive from
#	the comm server, these values are tested.  A special user named
#	"DEFAULT" can be created (and should be placed at the end of
#	the user file) to specify what to do with users not contained
#	in the user file.  A special password of "UNIX" can be specified
#	to notify the authentication server to use UNIX password (/etc/passwd)
#	authentication for this user.
#
#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#	line indicate the configuration values to be passed back to
#	the comm server to allow the initiation of a user session.
#	This can include things like the PPP configuration values
#	or the host to log the user onto.
