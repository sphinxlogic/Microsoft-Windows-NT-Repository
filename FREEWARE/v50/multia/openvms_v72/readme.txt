MULTIA, SYSTEM MANAGEMENT, Tools for booting OpenVMS on Multia systems

Unsupported OpenVMS V7.2 files for Multia Systems

  This directory includes various versions of files that will likely
  allow hobbyists to bootstrap OpenVMS on the Multia system.

  Unpack the BACKUP saveset onto a floppy disk, and then check the
  release notes included on the floppy for additional details.

    $ BACKUP MULTIA_V72.BCK/SAVE DVA0:/IMAGE/VERIFY


  Limitations:

     o There is absolutely no support for OpenVMS on Multia.

     o If this does not work, you are entirely on your own.

     o There is no PCMCIA support.

     o There has been no testing with the sound board.

     o Each set of files is specific to an OpenVMS version.

     o Files for OpenVMS releases other than those included
       here may or may not exist, or ever be made available.

  That said, these files have been occasionally found to work, and
  even to permit the operation of DECwindows on Multia.
