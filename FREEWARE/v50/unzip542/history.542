UnZip, version 5.42 beta, 14 January 2001

Features added (or removed):

5.42a (08 May 00):
 - Acorn RISCOS: disabled MORE functionality [Darren Salt]
 - MS-DOS, DJGPP 2.x: added compile time options USE_DJGPP_ENV and
    USE_DJGPP_GLOB to allow disableing the 'null' replacements for DJGPP
    CRT's extended env variables handling and command line globbing support
    [Frank Donahoe]

5.42b (15 May 00):
 - VMS: added "real" single-char-nonecho input function tt_getch() for
    MORE and CTRL-S functionality [SPC]

5.42c (17 Jul 00):
 - general: replaced the copyrighted source file 'unreduce.c' by a dummy module
    under Info-ZIP license; the original code is available separately [SPC]
 - general: support -LL option to force conversion to lowercase for every
    filename, regardless of the case handling properties of the originating
    file system [Chris Herborth]

5.42d (30 Jul 00):
 - general: zipinfo recognizes extra-fields created by SmartZIP for Macintosh
    [Dirk Haase]

5.42e (31 Dec 00):
 - general (extract.c, inflate.c): added preliminary (Alpha status!) support
    for PKWARE's extended Deflate64(tm) algorithm (conditional code controlled
    by USE_DEFLATE64) [SPC]

Bugs fixed:

5.42a (08 May 00):
 - Amiga: updated/extended screensize detection to report screenwidth
    for the enhanced paging functionality of UnZip 5.41 [Paul Kienitz]
 - generic (match.c): fixed and extended WILD_STOP_AT_DIR variant - matching
    "*" at end of pattern should also stop at dir separators - two consecutive
    star characters "**" match across directory separators [Darren Salt]
 - inflate.c, Uzinflate(): fixed calculation of windowBits for initialization
    of zlib's inflate service (USE_ZLIB was broken since UnZip 5.40) [SPC]
 - changed extension of most plaintext documentation files from .doc into
    .txt (for better support of Windows environments) [SPC]
 - changed default configuration of crypt support to disable decryption
    for SFX executable stubs, to minimize their size [Greg Roelofs, SPC]
 - MORE paging code: fixed and cleaned up macros and code for retrieving
    text window dimensions (was broken for DOS/OS2/WIN32 in 5.41) [SPC]
 - win32: added static library targets to MSC and gcc makefile [SPC]

5.42b (15 May 00):
 - process.c, free_G_buffers(): fix memory leak, G.extra_field might still
    point to an allocated buffer [M. Toeller, Mike White]
 - macos/source/macos.c: changed a ioFlXFndrInfo struct member name to follow
    an (idiotic) Apple system header modification [Dirk Haase]
 - win32/win32.c, win32/w32cfg.h: fixed typo-like bugs in the modified
    screensize retrival code introduced by 5.42a [K.U. Rommel, S. Salisbury]
 - os2/os2data.h: the new screensize retrival code added with 5.41(release)
    requires enabling the VIO section in the OS/2 system headers [K.U. Rommel]
 - msdos, 16-bit: completely separated UnZipSFX and UnZip compilations; use
    small memory model for SFX stub; use large model for TC++/BC++, medium
    model needs too much memory when compiling zipinfo.c [SPC]
 - msdos/msdos.c, version(): report correct version info for the now freely
    available ancient Turbo C++ 1.01 compiler [SPC]

5.42c (17 Jul 00):
 - man/unzip.1: removed two superfluous ".TP" directives in front of "-P ..."
    and "-/ ..." option entries (caused additional line feed and broke man page
    formatting on DECompaq True64 OSF/1 v4.0 [Stefan A. Deutscher]
 - AMIGA: removed time_lib.c module due to its copyright restrictions; replaced
    minimal tzset() and localtime() functions in filedate.c by fully functional
    versions derived from the public domain timezone library [Paul Kienitz]
 - updated COPYING: removed references to unreduce.c and amiga/time_lib.c
    copyright terms [SPC]
 - win32/makefile.bc: extended to build DLL, static library, GuiSFX stub
    (not yet complete) [SPC]

5.42d (30 Jul 00):
 - MacOS: miscellanous small updates for MacZip 1.06 [Dirk Haase]
 - win32: added workaround for MSC RTL "feature" of lacking TZ evaluation
    for European rules (switch off TZ recognition completely; rely on Win32
    system setting in registry, only) [SPC]
 - renamed doc file "COPYING" into "COPYING.OLD" for clarity [SPC]

5.42e (31 Dec 00):
 - AMIGA: moved all (generic) time related functions replacing faulty RTL
    support from filedate.c into timezone.c, added mktime() [Paul Kienitz]
 - proginfo/extra.fld: corrected typo, updated NTFS extra field description
    from PKWARE's newest appnote.txt, some more cosmetic changes [SPC]
 - ttyio.c: corrected typo in VMS-specific getch() function (IO$READVBLK should
    be written as IO$_READVBLK) [Mike Freeman, Hunter, SPC]
 - vms/vms.c - screensize(): corrected typo (missing ;) [Mike Freeman]
 - msdos, win32: modified FAT mapping for "leading dot" file names, added
    special handling for DOS reserved device names [Juan Manuel Guerrero, SPC]
 - msdos/msdos.c: fixed malicious truncation of volume labels to 8 chars for
    the no-LFN case [SPC]
 - win32/w32cfg.h: ensure that UNIX is not defined (newest versions of CygWin
    introduced this problem...) [SPC]
 - win32, windll: removed ttyio.c from the list of unzip32.{dll|lib} source
    files, updated dll and lib targets in win32 makefiles [SPC]
 - tandem/tanunz.c: fixed typo (superfluous comma) in ef_scan_for_tandem()
    declaration [Doug Schuessler]
 - explode.c, unreduce.c: modified check for extracted uncompressed size to
    allow use of unsigned variables, removes special 2GB limit on uncompressed
    archive member size for these compression modes [SPC]
 - generic: modified amiga/timezone.c into a generic RTL time&tz handling
    replacement, moved into top-level directory, added timezone.h header,
    moved amiga specific tz interface code into amiga/filedate.h, modified
    amiga/amiga.h and Amiga makefiles accordingly [SPC]
 - generic timezone.c: added optional function _isindst() (for use with
    win32 port) [SPC]
 - win32/win32.c, win32/w32cfg.h: added GetPlatformLocaleInfo() callback
    for timezone.c, reading tzinfo from Win32 API; Info-ZIP's timezone.c
    can be used by defining W32_USE_IZ_TIMEZONE (for use with statically
    linked C rtl ONLY!) [SPC]

5.42f (08 Jan 01):
 - amiga/filedate.c: added missing "timezone.h" include [Paul Kienitz, SPC]
 - msdos/msdos.c, win32/win32.c: maskDOSdevice() - enclosed debugging message
    code in DEBUG conditionals [Kai-Uwe Rommel, SPC]
 - disabled alpha state option USE_DEFLATE64 for fUnZip [SPC]
 - updated generic README [SPC]

5.42 (14 Jan 01):
 - VMS: added prototype for screenlinewrap() to unzpriv.h [Hunter Goatley, SPC]
 - WHERE: some updates (unreduce.c archive, new PKWARE versions)
 - TANDEM: updates to allow for WIDE memory model, sync with Zip [Dave Smith]
 - WinCE: corrected "UNICODE & ASCII" string mismatches in DlgProcAbout()
    (winmain.cpp), changed all copyright notes to Info-ZIP, some updates in
    help source and WinCE README [SPC]
 - MSDOS: corrected object list for unzipsfx in makefile.msc, added hint for
    upx exe file packer to makefile.msc and makefile.bc
 - msdos/msdos.c - mapname(): handle compile time options that do not define
    the local variable last_dot [SPC]
 - WIN32: minor Makefile corrections for gcc and lcc; win32/w32cfg.h defines
    WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN to reduce potential mismatching doubled declarations
    and increase compiling speed [SPC]
 - removed BETA notes for release ... [SPC]

These changes occurred in beta versions 5.42a to 5.42f.  This list may have
left out some bugfixes and even some features...void where prohibited, your
mileage may vary, etc., etc.
