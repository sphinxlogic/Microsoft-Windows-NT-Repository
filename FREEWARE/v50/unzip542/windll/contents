If you want to build the UnZip DLL or the WinGUI SFX stub from the command
line, you mai use the MSC Makefile supplied in the subdirectory of the
Win32 command line port.

Note that Borland C++ 5.0 is full of bugs; version 4.5 or 5.01 is recommended
instead.  If you must use Borland C++ 5.0, using the Intel optimizing compiler
is required to avoid crashes (possibly due to a bug in the stat() function in
the normal Borland compiler).  This does have the advantage of giving you a
smaller code size than the 4.52 compiler.  Borland C++ 5.01 has resolved many
of the problems seen with 5.0 and can be used reliably.
