.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

The \fR\&\f(CWmmd\fR command is used to make an MS-DOS subdirectory. Its
syntax is:

\&\fR\&\f(CWMmd\fR makes a new directory on an MS-DOS filesystem. An error occurs
if the directory already exists.
