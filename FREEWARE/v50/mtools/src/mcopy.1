.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

The \fR\&\f(CWmcopy\fR command is used to copy MS-DOS files to and from
Unix. It uses the following syntax:
.PP
 
.nf
.ft 3
.in +0.3i
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcopy [\fR\&\f(CW-tnvmoOsSrRA] \fIsourcefile\fR\&\f(CW \fItargetfile\fR\&\f(CW
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcopy [\fR\&\f(CW-tnvmoOsSrRA] \fIsourcefile\fR\&\f(CW [ \fIsourcefiles\fR\&\f(CW\&... ] \fItargetdirectory\fR\&\f(CW
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcopy [\fR\&\f(CW-tnvm] \fIMSDOSsourcefile\fR\&\f(CW
.fi
.in -0.3i

\&\fR
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMcopy\fR copies the specified file to the named file, or copies
multiple files to the named directory.  The source and target can be
either MS-DOS or Unix files.
.PP
The use of a drive letter designation on the MS-DOS files, 'a:' for
example, determines the direction of the transfer.  A missing drive
designation implies a Unix file whose path starts in the current
directory.  If a source drive letter is specified with no attached file
name (e.g. \fR\&\f(CWmcopy a: .\fR), all files are copied from that drive.
.PP
If only a single, MS-DOS source parameter is provided (e.g. "mcopy
a:foo.exe"), an implied destination of the current directory
(`\fR\&\f(CW.\fR') is assumed.
.PP
A filename of `\fR\&\f(CW-\fR' means standard input or standard output, depending
on its position on the command line.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMcopy\fR accepts the following command line options:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWQ\fR\ 
When mcopying multiple files, quits as soon as one copy fails (for
example due to lacking storage space on the target disk)
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWt\fR\ 
Text file transfer.  \fR\&\f(CWMcopy\fR translates incoming carriage
return/line feeds to line feeds.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWn\fR\ 
No confirmation when overwriting Unix files.  \fR\&\f(CWMcopy\fR doesn't warn
the user when overwriting an existing Unix file.  In order to switch off
confirmation for DOS files, use \fR\&\f(CW-o\fR.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWm\fR\ 
Preserve the file modification time. If the target file already exists,
and the \fR\&\f(CW-n\fR option is not in effect, \fR\&\f(CWmcopy\fR asks whether to
overwrite the file or to rename the new file (\(ifname clashes\(is) for
details).
.PP
.SH Bugs
Unlike MS-DOS, the '+' operator (append) from MS-DOS is not
supported. However, you may use \fR\&\f(CWmtype\fR to produce the same effect:
 
.nf
.ft 3
.in +0.3i
mtype a:file1 a:file2 a:file3 >unixfile
mtype a:file1 a:file2 a:file3 | mcopy - a:msdosfile
.fi
.in -0.3i
