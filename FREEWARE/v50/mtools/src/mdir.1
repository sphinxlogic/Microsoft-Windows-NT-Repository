.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

.SH Description
.iX "p mdir"
.iX "c Read-only files (listing them)"
.iX "c Listing a directory"
.iX "c Directory listing"
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmdir\fR command is used to display an MS-DOS directory. Its
syntax is:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmdir\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-w\fR] \fImsdosdirectory\fR
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmdir\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-f\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-w\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-a\fR] \fImsdosfile\fR [ \fImsdosfiles\fR\&...] 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMdir\fR
displays the contents of an MS-DOS directory.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMdir\fR supports the following command line options:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWw\fR\ 
Wide output.  With this option, \fR\&\f(CWmdir\fR prints the filenames across
the page without displaying the file size or creation date.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWa\fR\ 
Also list hidden files.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWf\fR\ 
Fast.  Do not try to find out free space.  On larger disks, finding out
the amount of free space takes up some non trivial amount of time, as
the whole FAT must be read in and scanned.  The \fR\&\f(CW-f\fR flag bypasses
this step.  This flag is not needed on FAT32 filesystems, which store
the size explicitely.
.PP
An error occurs if a component of the path is not a directory.
