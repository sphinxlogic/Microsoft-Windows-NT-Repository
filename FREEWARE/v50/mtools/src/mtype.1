.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.

.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmtype\fR command is used to display contents of an MS-DOS
file. Its syntax is:
.PP
.(l I
\&\fR\&\f(CWmtype\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-ts\fR] \fImsdosfile\fR [ \fImsdosfiles\fR\&... ]
.)l
 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMtype\fR displays the specified MS-DOS file on the screen.
.PP
In addition to the standard options, \fR\&\f(CWMtype\fR allows the following
command line options:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWt\fR\ 
Text file viewing.  \fR\&\f(CWMtype\fR translates incoming carriage
return/line feeds to line feeds.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\fR\ 
\&\fR\&\f(CWMtype\fR strips the high bit from the data.
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmcd\fR command may be used to establish the device and the
current working directory (relative to MS-DOS), otherwise the default is
\&\fR\&\f(CWA:/\fR.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMtype\fR returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on partial
failure.
.PP
Unlike the MS-DOS version of \fR\&\f(CWTYPE\fR, \fR\&\f(CWmtype\fR allows multiple
arguments.
