.SH Note
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, this items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific
to each command have been translated, and the general information about
mtools has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise
you to use the original texinfo doc.

The \fR\&\f(CWmformat\fR command is used to add an MS-DOS filesystem to a
low-level formatted diskette. Its syntax is:

.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMformat\fR adds a minimal MS-DOS filesystem (boot sector, FAT, and
root directory) to a diskette that has already been formatted by a Unix
low-level format.
.PP
The following options are supported: (The S, 2, 1 and M options may not
exist if this copy of mtools has been compiled without the USE_2M
option)
.PP
.SH Options
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWt\fR\ 
The number of cylinders.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWh\fR\ 
The number of heads (sides).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\fR\ 
The number of sectors per track. If the 2m option is given, number of
512-byte sector equivalents on generic tracks (i.e. not head 0 track 0).
If the 2m option is not given, number of physical sectors per track
(which may be bigger than 512 bytes).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWl\fR\ 
An optional volume label.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWS\fR\ 
The sizecode. The size of the sector is 2 ^ (sizecode + 7).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW2\fR\ 
2m format. The parameter to this option describes the number of
sectors on track 0, head 0. This option is recommended for sectors
bigger than normal.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW1\fR\ 
don't use a 2m format, even if the current geometry of the disk is a 2m 
geometry.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWM\fR\ 
software sector size. This parameter describes the sector size in bytes used
by the MS-DOS filesystem. By default it is the physical sector size.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWa\fR\ 
If this option is given, an Atari style serial number is generated.
Ataris store their serial number in the OEM label.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWX\fR\ 
formats the disk as an XDF disk. See section XDF for more details. The
disk has first to be low-level formatted using the xdfcopy utility
included in the fdutils package.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWC\fR\ 
creates the disk image file to install the MS-DOS filesystem on
it. Obviously, this is useless on physical devices such as floppies
and hard disk partitions.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWH\fR\ 
number of hidden sectors. This parameter is useful for formatting hard
disk partition, which are not aligned on track boundaries (i.e. first
head of first track doesn't belong to the partition, but contains a
partition table). In that case the number of hidden sectors is in
general the number of sectors per cylinder. This is untested.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWn\fR\ 
serial number
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWF\fR\ 
Format the partition as FAT32 (experimental).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWI\fR\ 
Sets the fsVersion id when formatting a FAT32 drive.  In order to find
this out, run minfo on an existing FAT32 drive, and mail me about it, so
I can include the correct value in future versions of mtools.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWc\fR\ 
Sets the size of a cluster (in sectors).  If this cluster size would
generate a FAT that too big for its number of bits, mtools automatically
increases the cluster size, until the FAT is small enough.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWr\fR\ 
Sets the size of the root directory (in sectors).  Only applicable to 12
and 16 bit FATs.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWB\fR\ 
Use the bootsector stored in the given file or device, instead of using
its own.  Only the geometry fields are updated to match the target disks
parameters.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWk\fR\ 
Keep the existing boot sector as much as possible.  Only the geometry
fields are updated to match the target disks parameters.
.PP
To format a diskette at a density other than the default, you must supply
(at least) those command line parameters that are different from the
default.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMformat\fR returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.
.PP
It doesn't record bad block information to the Fat, use
\&\fR\&\f(CWmkmanifest\fR for that.
