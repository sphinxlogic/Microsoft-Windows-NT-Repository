Release notes for V1.1-00	28-Dec-2000

    This is the first public release of PQM so these notes constute more of
    a feature summary than a list of bugfixes or new features.  For more
    documentation on PQM, e.g. how to run it, please see DOCUMENTATION.TXT.

    * Displays OpenVMS printer queues as a browsable list; the "current"
      queue is indicated by reverse video text.  The list shows the queue
      name, status and formtype of each queue.  If a job is currently being
      processed by the queue, that job is displayed instead of the
      formtype.  A panel at the top of the screen displays the node on
      which the queue is running, the description, the device to which the
      jobs are directed, and counts of various job types in the queue.

    * Pressing <Return> displays the jobs in the currently queue (if any).
      This screen also shows the formtype for the current job and queue,
      the first file in the job, and the date/time at which the job was
      submitted.  Press <Return> in the Jobs display returns to the Queues
      display.

    * On-screen Help is available by pressing "?" in the Queues and Jobs
      displays.
