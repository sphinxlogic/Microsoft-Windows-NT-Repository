Documentation for PQM V1.1-00	28-Dec-2000
===========================================

1.  Installing PQM
------------------
PQM is supplied with executable images for VAX and Alpha which have been
linked against OpenVMS V6.1.  Simply copy the appropriate image to
suitable location then define a foreign command for it, e.g.

	$ PQM :== $dev:[dir]PQM.EXE

where 'dev:[dir]' is the location to which you copied PQM.  You might like
to put the above in your site-wide login command procedure (e.g.
SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM).

Installing PQM with privileges is entirely optional and will depend on your
site-specific requirements:

    - OPER privilege will be required if you wish to allow PQM to manipulate
      all jobs and all queues regardless of ownership and job/queue
      protection.  Alternatively, use ACLs to provide finer control over
      access to queues and jobs.

    - ALTPRI privilege will be required if you wish to allow PQM to raise
      job priorities above the SYSGEN paramenter MAXQUEPRI (normally 100).


2.  Running PQM
---------------
The PQM command accepts the following optional qualifiers:

	/BROWSER="DCL-command"

		Specify a DCL command to invoke a program which will be used
		to display the contents of files in printer queues.  The
		command should accept a single parameter, the file to
		display.

		If not specified, PQM will attempt to translate the logical
		name PQM_BROWSER to find the DCL command.

	/INITIAL_SCREEN=QUEUE=queue

		Begin with the Queue display, highlighting the specified
		queue.

		If /INITIAL_SCREEN is not specified, PQM begins by
		displaying on the Queues display with the first queue
		highlighted.

	/INITIAL_SCREEN=JOBS=queue

		Being by displaying the Jobs display for the specified
		queue.

		If /INITIAL_SCREEN is not specified, PQM begins by
		displaying on the Queues display with the first queue
		highlighted.

	/NOSERVER_SYMBIONTS

		Do not display server symbiont queues, i.e. symbiont queues
		which process files without sending them to an output
		device.

	/UPDATE=n

		Automatically update the screen every 'n' seconds.
		If this qualifier is not specified, the screen will be
		updated every 15 seconds.

	/NOUPDATE
	
		Do not automatically update the screen.

3. Queue Display
----------------
The Queue Display lists the print queues on the system.  The top part of
the screen shows detailed information about the currently highlighted queue.

The following table shows the actions which are available in the Queues
display.

     Prev Screen	Select the queue which appears approximately 2/3 of
    			the way up the screen.

     Next Screen	Select the queue which appears approximately 2/3 of
    			the way down the screen.

     Up Arrow		Select the queue which appears immediately above the
    			current queue.

     Down Arrow		Select the queue which appears immediately above the
    			current queue.

     Do or PF4		Display a menu of operations appropriate to the
    			current queue.  (See below for menu details.)

     Return/Enter	Display the jobs in the current queue.

     Space bar		Update the display.  (This is useful if /NOUPDATE
    			was specified when starting PQM, or if an update is
    			required now.)

     Letter "F"		Display the file currently being printed by each
    			queue (if any).

     Letter "J"		Display the job currently being printed by each
    			queue (if any).

     Letter "Q"		Quit PQM.

     Question Mark	Display on-screen Help.

     Ctrl/W		Redraw the screen.

     Ctrl/Z		Quit PQM.

Pressing the Do key or the PF4 key displays a menu of actions which are
appropriate to the currently highlighted queue.  These actions include:

     Set Formtype	Change the queue's formtype.  By default it
			will be set to match that of the first job
			in the queue, so that the job will start
			printing.

     Pause Queue	Suspends output to the printer, but the job
			stays on the queue.

     Stop Queue		Lets the job which is currently printing
			(if any) finish, but prevents any other jobs
    			from starting.

     Reset Queue	Causes the queue to stop immediately; no
			more jobs will be printed.  This is the
			same as "Stop Queue" but aborts the current
			job mid-stream and causes that job to remain
			in the queue.

     Start Queue	Starts a Paused or Stopped queue.

     Abort Job		Kill the currently executing job, and
			remove it from the queue.

     SHOW QUEUE/FULL	Runs the DCL command SHOW QUEUE/FULL.

     Exit this menu	Exits the menu without changing anything.

Within the above menu you can use the Up and Down arrow keys to move around.
Pressing PF1-Up will jump to the top of the menu; PF1-Down will jump to the
bottom of the menu.  Pressing Up or Down at the top or bottom of the menu
(respecively) will take you to the bottom or top of the menu.  Pressing
Ctrl/Z exits the menu without doing anything.  Pressing Help will attempt
to display some help text but this isn't working just yet and instead you
get some garbage.  Press Ctrl/W to redraw the screen.


4. Jobs Display
---------------
This shows the jobs in the selected queue.  The top part of the screen shows
detailed information about the currently highlighted job.

The list of jobs is presented in the order that the VMS queue manager supplies
them to PQM, with the exception that jobs which are retained in the queue are
listed in reverse order of completion: those jobs which printed most recently
are listed first.  In effect this means that jobs are listed in the following
order:

	1.  The job which is currently printing (if any).
	2.  Jobs which are waiting their turn to print, i.e. Pending.
	3.  Jobs which are waiting until a particular time before they
	    start printing.
	4.  Jobs which are Holding (and therefore must be manually released).
	5.  Jobs which have recently completed printing (or failed).
	6.  Jobs which completed printing (or failed) less recently.

For groups 2-4, within each group, the order of jobs is usually the order in
which they were submitted for printing.  However, VMS allows a priority to
be assigned to a job thus altering its position in the queue.  Also, depending
on the printer queue definition, jobs might be ordered in reverse size order
-- large jobs are printed after small jobs.

The following table shows the actions which are available in the Queues
display.

     Prev Screen	Select the job which appears approximately 2/3 of
    			the way up the screen.

     Next Screen	Select the job which appears approximately 2/3 of
    			the way down the screen.

     Up Arrow		Select the job which appears immediately above the
    			current job.

     Down Arrow		Select the job which appears immediately above the
    			current job.

     Do or PF4		Display a menu of operations appropriate to the
    			current job.  (See below for menu details.)

     Return/Enter	Return to the Queues display.

     Space bar		Update the display.  (This is useful if /NOUPDATE
    			was specified when starting PQM, or if an update is
    			required now.)

     Letter "Q"		Return to the Queues display.

     Question Mark	Display on-screen Help.

     Ctrl/W		Redraw the screen.

     Ctrl/Z		Quit PQM.

The Do and PF4 keys display a menu of actions which are appropriate to the
highlighted job:

     Display File	Uses the command specified by the /BROWSER qualifier
			or the PQM_BROWSER logical name to display the file
			currently being printed or the first file in the job
			(if the job is not currently printing).

     Pause		Pauses the queue; suspends output to the
			printer until the queue is started.

     Stop & Retain	Aborts execution of the current job but
			retains that job in the queue so that it
			can be reprinted.  The queue is not stopped;
			it will begin to print the next job if there
			is one.

     Abort Job		Aborts (kills) the current job and removes it
			from the queue.

     Release Job	Changes a Holding job so that it will print
			immediately (or as soon as the printer can
			print it) or reprints a Completed or Failed
			job.

     Hold Job		Force the job into the Holding state, so that it
			must be manually released before it will be printed.

     Move to Queue	Allows you to move a job to another queue.

     Raise Job Priority	Increase the job priority by 5.

     Lower Job Priority	Decrease the job priority by 5.

     Delete Job		Removes the job from the queue.

     Set Job Formtype	Changes the form type of the job.  By default
			it will change the job's form to match the
			queue's.

     Set Queue Formtype	Changes the form type of the queue.  By
			default it will be set to match the current
			job.

     Stop Queue		Stops the queue, i.e. waits for the queue to
			finish the current job (if any) and doesn't
			start the next job in the queue.

     Reset Queue	Immediately stops the queue; the currently
			printing job is aborted but remains on the
			queue.  No more jobs are started.

     SHOW ENTRY/FULL	Runs the DCL command SHOW ENTRY/FULL to
			display as much information as possible about
			the job.

     Exit this menu	Does nothing.
				
Within the menu the arrows and other keys behave as they do for the Queue
action menus.


5. Known Bugs
-------------
There are a couple of bugs or behavioural "features" which I have not yet
been able to fix.

  - if the Help screen is pressed in an action menu the screen displays a
    traceback dump; press Ctrl/W to remove it

  - the completion time and/or failure reason for a job is not displauyed
    (use SHOW ENTRY/FULL to display this information)

  - the program will eventually crash with an "insufficient dynamic memory"
    error in SYS$GETQUI.
