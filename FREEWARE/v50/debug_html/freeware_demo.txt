HTML DEBUG
----------
Why validate your HTML? Basically it prevents browser frustration and 
search engine dead ends. It also gives you an alternate way of viewing your 
web pages.

The freeware demo allows you to run the whole HTML validator suite against a
directory you select. 

It will expect to find all the HTML web files with a .HTML extension, images 
will be either .GIF or .JPG. 

It will copy a file called debug.htm to the directory you are checking, 
load this in your browser to link to the files which are created by the 
remainder of the procedure. A full explanation of the purpose of the files 
is included in the AAAREADME.TXT file and modifying the files to scan 
for other types of file should be quite straight forward.

It will state which phase it is currently executing (but no other messages) 
however you can use CTRL/Y to safely interrupt the current phase to move 
onto the next. 

For an average set of homepages (20 HTML pages, 50 images and other files)
it should take about 2 minutes to complete on a 200 TPS machine, bear in
mind it repeatedly uses SEARCH and DCL level file scans, the more files,
the longer it will take. Note that you will see a couple of file access
conflict errors, these are normal and should be ignored. 

What you will be left with is a convenient set of HTML files to cross
reference your site and check the accuracy of internal and external links. 

No existing files are altered or changed in any way.
