DEBUG HTML FUTURES
------------------
In order to speed up the repeated inefficient execution of some procedures, 
it is proposed that a temporary indexed database is formed at each run.

Checkpointing would allow the procedures to be interrupted and restarted 
particularly if the run is taking a long time.

Teach the procedures about other HTML syntax so they can test and check 
more.
