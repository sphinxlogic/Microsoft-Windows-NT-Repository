Here's the list of stuff that should be added to VMSTAR:

Short term (please concentrate on this first):

	* Changing VMSTAR so GMT time is stored in the .tar file,
	instead of local time.  The UTC routines should be used for
	this, but I still have to learn how to use them.

Long term:

	* Capability to mount the device to which the tar dump will be
	written, if it isn't already mounted.

	* Capability to tell the user to mount a new tape if the tar
	dump takes more than one.

More things could be added with time.
