SRH_EXAMPLES, PROGRAMMING, Hoffman's source code example collection
 
    SRH_EXAMPLES contains a variety of OpenVMS programming examples
    accumulated over the years -- most I've written, a few are based
    on code I've helped debug or otherwise worked on over the years.
    Most are written in C, with some written in the older VAX C dialect 
    while the more recent examples are written in the ANSI C dialect 
    of DEC C.

    Some of the interfaces used here are documented, some are not.

    Some of the code has been adjusted to compile under DEC C,
    some has not.

    Some of the examples are commented, some are not.
