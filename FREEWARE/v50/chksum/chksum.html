chksum - Computes the file checksum of a file or files.

<EM>chksum</EM>  provides most of the capabilities of the Unix <EM>sum</EM> and <EM>cksum</EM>
programs. It also implements the MD5 checksum based on the GNU MD5 code
implementation all in one package.

</A></H1>
<EM>chksum</EM>  command can be used to compare a suspect file copied or communicated over
noisy transmission lines, internet or unpacked from an archive against an
exact copy of a trusted file. The comparison made by the command may not be
cryptographically secure ; however, it is unlikely that an accidentally
damaged file will produce the same checksum as the original file.


<P>

<EM>chksum</EM>  was initially written to offer to OpenVMS Users an exact equivalent tool
than what already exists (or available as freeware) under Unix system.
However, <EM>chksum</EM> can be compiled on Unix system and provides the same functionality across
platform since the available cksum and sum programs seems to give different
results and their options have different meaning.

<PRE> -b     Computes the BSD checksum, computation with BUFSIZ blocks
 -r     Computes the BSD checksum, computation with 1Kb blocks
 -s     512-byte blocks SYSV compatible
 -o     1Kb blocks SYSV compatible
 -c     Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) checksum and number of bytes
        (according to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 and X/Open CAE)
 -m     Compute MD5 checksum of files according to the definition
        of MD5 in RFC 1321 from April 1992.

Default is <CODE>-b</CODE> unless overwritten by the environment variable CHKSUM_OPTION. This variable
should be set to one of ``b'',``r'',``s'',``o'',``c'' or ``m''.

There are differences between the natice Digital Unix <EM>cksum</EM> program and the GNU <EM>cksum</EM> program. <EM>chksum</EM> is compatible with the GNU version of <EM>cksum</EM>.

The default option is non-portable (depends on your OS BUFSIZ). It has been
preserved for backward compatibility purposes only. To change the default
option, define the environment variable CHKSUM_OPTION as described in the <CODE>Options</CODE> section.


<P>

Currently, only the last version of a file can be checksum-ed under VMS OS.

<H1><A NAME="ReturnValue">ReturnValue

</A></H1>
<EM>chksum</EM>  returns a EXIT_SUCCESS status if no error was found, each +10 correspond to
one file open/close error and +1 for each read-error.

Return value


<P>

This return value will produce a VMS cli message which relevance is
doubtful AND misleading. We maintained the initial scheme for
cross-platform portability reasons i.e. regardless of where you are running
chksum, the value returned to the shell can be tested within a script.


<P>


Caveat


<P>

How did I test this program and what are the caveat ? Well, first, I have
tested on both Digital Unix and Linux for consistent results.


<P>

Then, I went to the Seti homepage at 
<CODE>http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/</CODE>  and looked at the different checksum given in <CODE>http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/unix.html</CODE> for alpha_openvms_bck.exe downloaded on a Digital Unix machine. I could
reproduce the checksums given there using  <CODE>-m</CODE>,  <CODE>-r</CODE>  and <CODE>-c</CODE>
options.


<P>

The preceding test failed when the same package was downloaded under an
OpenVMS node. U&lt;Don't panic&gt; ! This is normal as explained below.


<P>

This missmatch comes from the VMS RMS file attributes and specifically, the
missmatch between the 2 OS produced 'Record Format'.


<P>

<PRE> OSF1 downloaded file : Stream_LF, maximum 0 bytes, longest 0 bytes
 VMS downloaded file  : Fixed length 512 byte records
</PRE>

<P>

For a fair comparison, you MUST convert your file to Stream_LF format
before using <EM>chksum</EM>. This can be done by using (OpenVMS 6.2 and above) the following command :


<P>

<PRE> $ set file/attribute=RFM:STMLF file.ext
