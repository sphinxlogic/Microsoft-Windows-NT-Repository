<descrip>
<tag/BF(filename)/
   The name of the file to be displayed.
   The file ending SQ(.ps) may be omitted.
   SQ(filename) may point to a compressed file 
   (gzipped, zipped or compressed).
   Viewing PDF files requires at least ghostscript version 4.x.
<tag/BF(-ad IT(ANGLED(resource file)))/
   Read and use additional resources from the file
   IT(ANGLED(resource file)).
   These resources have higher priority than those provided
   in the context of the IT(-style ANGLED(resource file)) option.
<tag/BF(-antialias), BF(-noantialias)/
   Whether to use antialiasing.
<tag/BF(-arguments IT(ANGLED(arguments)))/
   Start GS_NAME with additional options as specified by the
   string IT(ANGLED(arguments)).
<tag/BF(-center), BF(-nocenter)/
   Whether the page should be centered automatically.
<tag/BF(-dsc), BF(-nodsc)/
   Determines if IT(document structuring convention) (DSC) comments
   should be respected or ignored.
   If IT(-nodsc) is used GV_NAME will not attempt to examine
   the structure of the document but will pass the file
   to the GS_NAME interpreter as a whole. In this case no page numbers
   are shown and freely moving around in the document is not possible.
   This option may help when viewing files not conforming
   to the IT(document structuring conventions).
<tag/BF(-eof), BF(-noeof)/
   Defines the behaviour of the postscript scanner used to
   examine the structure of the document.
   If IT(-noeof) is used the scanner will ignore end of file (EOF)
   comments. This may help when viewing documents which import other
   documents without enclosing them within the proper
   "BeginDocument" and "EndDocument" comments.
   If IT(-eof) is used, the scanner treats an EOF comment as
   marking the end of the file.
<tag/BF(-pixmap), BF(-nopixmap)/
   If IT(-pixmap) is used gv tries to maintain off-screen regions
   of the displayed page by allocating a sufficiently large pixmap.
   If IT(-nopixmap) is used the IT(X Server) is responsible for
   maintaining obscured portions of the displayed page
   (see also the SQ(useBackingPixmap) resource).
<tag/BF(-v) /

   Selects the scale entry IT(ANGLED(n)) relative to the scale 1.0.
   IT(ANGLED(n)) must be an integer.
<tag/BF(-scalebase IT(ANGLED(n)))/
   Selects the scale base IT(ANGLED(n)).
<tag/BF(-monochrome), BF(-grayscale), BF(-color)/

   Sets the orientation.
<tag/BF(-quiet), BF(-noquiet)/
   Whether to start GS_NAME with the IT(-dQUIET) option.
<tag/BF(-resize), BF(-noresize)/
   Whether GV_NAME is allowed to automatically fit the
   size of its window to the size of the displayed page.
<tag/BF(-safer), BF(-nosafer)/
   Whether to start GS_NAME with the IT(-dSAFER) option.
<tag/BF(-spartan)/
   This is a shortcut for SQ(-style gv_spartan.dat).
<tag/BF(-style IT(ANGLED(resource file)))/
   Read and use additional resources from the file IT(ANGLED(resource file)).
   These resources have  lower priority than those provided
   in the context of the IT(-ad ANGLED(resource file)) option.
<tag/BF(-swap), BF(-noswap)/
   Whether to interchange the meaning of the orientations
   landscape and seascape.
<tag/BF(-watch), BF(-nowatch)/
   The IT(-watch) option causes GV_NAME to check the document
   periodically. If changes are detected GV_NAME will
   automatically display the newer version of the file.
   The document is by default checked once every second. 
   This can be changed via the IT(watchFileFrequency) resource.
   Note that sending GV_NAME the IT(SIGHUP) signal also causes
   an update of the displayed document. This method
   may be used by document creators to trigger GV_NAME
   remotely.

   Resources
#####################################################

SECTION Resources LABEL(Resources)
<p>
BF(Resource files)
<p>
In general GV_NAME does not depend on any external resource files.
However, when starting GV_NAME, preferences are read from

<itemize>
<item> BF(a system specific resource file).
   The name of this file is as described by the SQ(XFILESEARCHPATH)
   environment variable, or, if this variable is not defined,
   implementation dependant. In most cases it is  
   SQ(/usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults/GV).
   Administrators may want to modify this file in order
   to set up GV_NAME according to the local needs of their system.
<item> BF(a user specific resource file).
   The name of this file is either SQ(&tilde/.gv) or as described
   by the SQ(XUSERFILESEARCHPATH) environment variable.
</itemize>

The files GV_USER_AD and GV_SYSTEM_AD (located in the library directory
of GV_NAME, which is most probably either 
SQ(/usr/local/lib/gv/) or SQ(/usr/lib/gv/) may serve as a basis
for constructing the user and system specific resource files.

Note that the user and system specific resource files are not the only
sources of preferences taken into account when GV_NAME is started.
However, in practice these are the most important.
<p>
BF(Resources of GV_NAME)
<p>
The following describes some of the resources of GV_NAME.
The precise syntax of some of the resource values may be 
inferred from the appended default system specific resource file.

<descrip>
<tag/antialias/
   Whether antialiasing should be used.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/autoCenter/
   Whether the displayed page should automatically be centered 
   (for instance when opening a new file).
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/autoResize/
   Whether GV_NAME is allowed to resize the main window
   according to the size of the current page.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/confirmPrint/
   Whether printing requires an extra confirmation.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/confirmQuit/
   Whether leaving GV_NAME requires extra confirmation.
   Valid values are SQ(0) (Never), SQ(1)
   (When processing) and SQ(2) (Always).
   The default value is SQ(1), which causes
   a confirmation request when trying to leave GV_NAME
   in the presence of pending PDF to Postscript conversions.
<tag/scrollingEyeGuide/
   If this resource is SQ(True) scrolling via the
   keyboard causes a temporary border to be drawn around the
   previously visible area of the page.
   Allowed values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).   
<tag/ignoreEOF/
   Defines the behaviour of the postscript scanner as described
   in the REF(Options) section.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).   
<tag/respectDSC/
   Determines whether GV_NAME should attempt to respect document 
   structuring comments.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/reverseScrolling/
   Defines the interpretation of directions when
   scrolling with the mouse.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/swapLandscape/
   Whether the meaning of SQ(landscape) and SQ(seacape)
   should be interchanged.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/scratchDir/
   Specifies a directory used to store temporary data.
<tag/defaultSaveDir/
   Specifies the default destination directory for files to be saved.
<tag/useBackingPixmap/
   If the value of this resource is SQ(False) the IT(X Server)
   is advised that saving off-screen pixels of the displayed page
   would be beneficial (maintaining backing store). In this case gv 
   does not actively maintain the contents of the page but relies
   on the IT(X Server). The server is, however, always free to stop 
   maintaining backing backing store.
   If the value of this resource is SQ(True) the IT(X Server)
   is advised that maintaining backing store is not useful.
   In this case gv attempts to allocate a sufficiently large pixmap
   to store the contents of the displayed page.
<tag/watchFile/
   Whether the document should be checked periodically and updated
   automatically if  changes are detected.
   Valid values are SQ(True) and SQ(False).
<tag/watchFileFrequency/
   Defines the time in milliseconds elapsing between successive
   checks of the document when IT(watchFile) is set to SQ(True).
   Allowed values must be larger than 500.
<tag/printCommand/
   The command used for printing a file.
   The command may contain multiple '%s' wildcards
   which will be replaced by the name of the file to be 
   printed.
<tag/gsInterpreter/
   The command used to start the GS_NAME interpreter.
<tag/gsCmdScanPDF/
   The command used to extract document structuring comments
   from a PDF file.
<tag/gsCmdConvPDF/
	The command used to convert a PDF file to PostScript.
<tag/gsX11Device/
   The GS_NAME command line option which activates the
   SQ(X11) device. 
<tag/gsX11AlphaDevice/
   The GS_NAME command line option which activates the
   SQ(X11) device with antialiasing enabled. 
<tag/gsSafer/
   Determines whether GS_NAME should be started with the
   SQ(-dSAFER) command line option.
<tag/gsQuiet/
   Determines whether GS_NAME should be started with the
   SQ(-dQUIET) command line option.
<tag/gsArguments/
   May be used to provide additional command line options for the
   GS_NAME interpreter.
   Starting GV_NAME with the SQ(-arguments IT(ANGLED(arguments)))
   option will override this resource setting.
<tag/magMenu/
   Describes the menu that pops up when preparing to
   to zoom an area of the displayed page.
<tag/dirs/
   Defines a list of directories accessible via the IT(Directories)
   menu in the file selection window.
   The special value SQ(Home) corresponds to the users home directory,
   the value SQ(Tmp) corresponds to the scratch directory as defined
   by the IT(scratchDir) resource.
<tag/filter/
   Defines the default filter to be used when displaying a directory
   contents in the file selection window.
   A filter is specified according to the syntax
<verb>
   <filter>    := [<filespecs>] [no <filespecs>]
   <filespecs> := <filespec> [<filespecs>]
   <filespec>  := filename possibly including wildcards '*'
                  which match any character.
</verb>
   Example: The filter
<verb>
   GV*filter: *.ps *.pdf no .*
</verb>
   screens out all files with names starting with a dot
   and keeps of the remaining ones only those which end
   on SQ(.ps) or SQ(.pdf).
<tag/filters/
   Defines a list of filters offered in the IT(Filters)
   menu of the file selection window.
   The filter SQ(None) has a special meaning
   causing all files to be displayed when the corresponding
   menu entry is selected.
<tag/miscMenuEntries/
   Describes the menu that pops up when clicking with the 
   third mouse button on the displayed page. 
   The value of this resource is a list of menu entries.
   Allowed entries are
   SQ(update),
   SQ(redisplay),    
   SQ(toggle_current),    
   SQ(toggle_even),    
   SQ(toggle_odd),    
   SQ(unmark),    
   SQ(stop),    
   SQ(print_all),    
   SQ(print_marked),    
   SQ(save_all),    
   SQ(save_marked) and
   SQ(line).
<tag/showTitle/
   Whether the name of the displayed document should be shown in the
   title bar of the window. The name of gv's icon will also change
   accordingly if this resource is set to SQ(True).
<tag/maximumWidth, maximumHeight/
   When resizing GV_NAME will not attempt to exceed the size specified
   by these resources.
   These resources may be specified as a positive integer
   or as SQ(screen), optionally combined with
   a positive or negative offset.
   The default values listed above provide examples for this syntax.
   SQ(screen) will automatically be replaced by the size of the
   screen.
<tag/minimumWidth, minimumHeight/
   Defines a minimum size for the main window.
   Valid values for both resources are positive integers larger
   than 200.
<tag/scale/
   Sets the initial scale. The value of this resource is the offset
   of the scale to be selected relative to the scale 1.0 in the
   the SQ(Scale) menu.
<tag/scaleBase/
   Selects the initial scale base. The value of this resource should 
   be a positive integer.
<tag/scales/
   Defines the available scales bases and scales in the SQ(Scale)
   menu.   
<tag/orientation/
   Sets the initial orientation. Valid values are 
   SQ(portrait), SQ(landscape),SQ(seascape),
   SQ(upside-down) and
   SQ(automatic).
   SQ(automatic) causes GV_NAME to attempt
   to derive the correct orientation from document structuring
   comments.
<tag/fallbackOrientation/
   Defines the paper-size to be used when automatic orientation
   detetction fails.  Valid values are 
   SQ(portrait), SQ(landscape),SQ(seascape) 
   and SQ(upside-down).
<tag/medias/
   A list describing the page medias known to GV_NAME.
   List entries starting with SQ(!) or SQ(#) will not appear in the
   SQ(Media) menu but will still be used for automatic paper size 
   detection.
<tag/pagemedia/
   Sets the paper size. 
   Allowd values are as given in the above list of paper-sizes.
   Specifying
   SQ(automatic) causes GV_NAME to attempt
   to derive the correct paper-size from document structuring
    comments.
<tag/fallbackPageMedia/

<tag/BF(Scales)/

The SQ(Scale) menu which allows to view the document
at different sizes is divided into two parts. The first part
shows a list of available scale bases, the second part,
separated by a line, lists the relative scales which are applied
with respect to the selected scale base.
<p>
By default two scales bases are available, the SQ(Natural size)
and the SQ(Pixel based) base.
When choosing the SQ(Pixel based) scale base a relative scale 
of 1.0 causes one postscript point to correspond to one pixel on the 
screen.
<p>
When viewing a document at a relative scale of 1.0
using the SQ(Natural size) base the page should appear in its
real size, as if printed on paper.
For the SQ(Natural size) base to work properly GV_NAME has to know
the correct size of the root window. Automatic detection
of this size unfortunately only provides approximate results, therefore
it is best if it is provided by the user. To do so the resource
<verb>
   GV.screenSize:  <width> x <height>
</verb>
should be added to the SQ(SCREEN_RESOURCES) property of the screen
the document is viewed on, with IT(ANGLED(width)) and IT(ANGLED(height))
describing the width and height of the root window in units of millimeters.
For instance by using the command
<verb>
   echo "GV.screenSize: 396 x 291" | xrdb -override -screen
</verb>
a width of 346 mm and a height of 291 mm will be used for the
SQ(Natural size) scale base.
Alternatively the resource
<verb>
   GV.screenSize_<machine>_<disp>_<scr>:  <width> x <height>
</verb>
may be added to a resource file read by GV_NAME. Here
IT(ANGLED(machine)) ,IT(ANGLED(disp)) and IT(ANGLED)) describe
the display on which GV_NAME displays the document.
For instance, if the display is set to SQ(tic.tac.toe.wo:0.1)
the resource should be specified as
<verb>
   GV.screenSize_tic_0_1: 396 x 291
</verb>
Note that this method doesn't work on VMS.
As a last alternative the resource
<verb>
   GV.screenSize:  <width> x <height>
</verb>
may be added to one of the resource files. However, for obvious reasons
this method should be used only on single user machines.

<tag/BF(Scrolling)/
<p>
It is probably a IT(de facto) standard for user interfaces
that windows are supposed to be scrolled by means of
scrollbars attached to their sides.
However, for various reasons the use of scrollbars
has been minimized in GV_NAME.
<p>
Instead, in all windows with obscured data, scrolling
may be performed by
<quote>
   pressing button1, moving the mouse, then releasing button1
</quote>
directly in the window. This includes the displayed page,
zoom popups, the table of contents and the file and 
directory lists displayed in the file selection popup.

<tag/BF(Displaying new versions of a document)/
<p>
During document creation it is usually desirable to
always display the newest version of the document in work.
<p>
Instead of explicitly loading it via the file selection
popup the most recent version can be displayed by
pressing the SQ(Redisplay) button in the main window
(VMS users should use the SQ(Update File) entry in the
SQ(File) menu).
Choosing the SQ(Redisplay) entry in the menu that pops
up when clicking with the third mouse button anywhere on the
displayed page certainly has the same effect.
<p>
More comfortable is the "Watch File" feature which may
be switched on by selecting the corresponding entry in the
SQ(State) menu. If activated GV_NAME will check
every now and then if a new version of the displayed
file exists. If so it will be displayed automatically.
By default the file is checked about once every
second.
<p>
Finally it may also be left to the document creating program
to trigger GV_NAME to update its display. To do so the
program should send the SIGHUP signal to GV_NAME.
For instance at the end of a shell script generating a
postscript file from latex sources the line
<verb>
   kill -SIGHUP <gv_pid>
</verb>
may be added (here TT(&lt;gv_pid&gt;) is the process id of
GV_NAME). Executing the script and thereby creating a new
version of the document will then also cause the
result to be displayed instantaneously.
Please note that this feature is available only on X11 R6
based systems.

<p>
Tim Theisen created GHOSTVIEW, which was the starting point of GV_NAME.

Peter Deutsch is the author of the GS_NAME interpreter, without which
GV_NAME would be not more than an empty hull.

Kaleb S.Keithley turned IT(Xaw) into the extremely nice XAW3D widget set. 

Keith Packard invented the IT(Layout) widget, the heart of GV_NAME's
widget tree.

Finally I'd like to thank Jim Jennis 
(James_H_Jennis@mail.mmmg.com) for 
carefully testing all versions of GV_NAME.
If there is something like the notion of a 'chief-beta-tester'
he deserves this attribute for his careful and devoted work.
