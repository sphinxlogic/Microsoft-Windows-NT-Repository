# Bugfix: The command line option "-geometry" didn't work correctly
  (neither did the GV.Geometry resource).

# Bugfix: Use a LabeledLineTextField instead of a LabeledTextField
  for the "Screen Size" in the "Setup Options".

# Keep the number of the displayed page "in sight" in the table
  of contents if the geometry of the main window changes.

# Automatically use "Fixed Size" if a fixed window width or height
  is prescribed by the "-geometry" command line option or the
  "GV.geometry" resource.

# Kill ghostscript processes in zoom windows immediately after the
  page is rendered and not when the window is closed.

# Disallow the "Misc Menu" in zoom windows.

# Define and change the default resources "GV*dirs", "GV*filter" and 
  "GV*filters" in source/Imakefile and source/descrip.mms since they

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 3.5.2  (7 June 1997) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Bugfix: Zooming didn't work for large magnifications.

# Bugfix: "Redisplay" still jumped back to the first page when the
  file changed. How funny ...

# Bugfix: "Auto Center" didn't work as it should.

# Bugfix: Removed a debugging printf(...) call from the zoom code. 

# Bugfix: Removed some drawing flaws in the Vlist widget (table of
  contents).

# Bugfix: Show caret in the print confirmation dialog and set the
  insert position to the end of the print command.

# Bugfix: Action GV_Resizing() didn't work.

# Bugfix: File Selection Popup allowed weird things after not being 
  able to access a directory.

# Added a keyboard scrolling "Eye Guide": when scrolling a temporary 
  border is drawn around the previously visible area. The feature may 
  be disabled in the "Setup Options".

# Changed the keyboard bindings in the main window.
  This was necessary to fully take advantage of the capabilities of
  the new action GV_Page() which is now responsible for navigating 
  with keyboard events through the document.
  People will hate me for doing that, but it was overdue ...
  Some examples:
   - Allow to move through a document by using a single key.
     For instance the key "Space" scrolls in vertical strips and 
     jumps to the next page if the bottom/right edge of a page is 
     reached. ("BackSpace" reverses this operation).
   - Allow to move to a page by typing its page number on the keypad, 
     followed by pressing "Enter" on the keypad.
     Pressing (Keypad +) or (Keypad -) followed by (Keypad Enter)
     does the obvioys thing.

# Clicking on the ">>" button in the main window with mouse 
  button 1,2,3 jumps +1,+5,+10 pages.
  Analogously for the "<<" button ...
  
# Take care that the mark highlighting the current page in the
  table of contents always remains visible.

# Added command line option "-v" to display version information.

# Highlight the "Dismiss" button in zoom windows and let pressing
  "Return" close the window.

# Let the table of contents not become to broad for exorbitantly long
  page labels.

# Removed the action GV_HandleEOF() and its key binding to key "E".

* Changed resource syntax "*.Translations" to "*.baseTranslations" to
  allow overriding event bindings in user resource files.

* Made USE_FALLBACK_STYLES the default.

* Replaced the actions GV_Scroll(),GV_Next(),GV_Previous(),GV_Show(),
  GV_Center() and GV_Redisplay() by the more flexible action GV_Page().

* Bugfix: Correct header "error.h" for Linux/Alpha.

* Bugfix: Corrected a typo in source/Imakefile that caused the 
  "fallbackPageMedia" not to be recognized correctly.

* Added possibility to install documentation via "make install.doc".

* Removed the directory 'old' from the distribution.

# Replace the concept of "magsteps" by "scales" and "scale bases".
  This also caused the "-dpi", "-xdpi" and "-ydpi" option to
  vanish.

# Allow to specify additional scales, scale bases and paper sizes
  in the option popups.

# Allow to provide the screen size to view documents in their natural
  size.

# Change the way how gv handles resource files.
  A full set of required resources is now always compiled into the
  executable, system and user specific resource files contain by
  default only the very limited set of resources which may be 
  interesting to change by non gv-developers.
  This has the side effect that
    - the chance of gv complaining about no or incompatible
      resources is minimized.
    - security sensitive resources (those of type 'GVintern') can
      now be treated in a unified way without loss of security
      and may also be specified in the system specific resource file.

# When opening/saving a file pressing 'Return' now rescans the 
  directory if the provided path doesn't seem to be a file but
  a directory.

# Add the command line otions '-pixmap' and '-nopixmap' to trigger
  the value of the 'useBackingPixmap' resource (which, in this turn,
  became a resource of gv).

# Remove the "-letter", "-a4" etc. page media options.
  Instead the option "-media <media>" should be used.

# Allow to compile style files into the executable (currently this only
  affects gv_spartan.dat).

# The 'Uncompress' text field in the options window didn't show a 
  cursor.

# For a given papersize or bounding box the displayed area was a little
  too small; one or two postscript points were omitted.

# Tim Adye (adye@v2.rl.ac.uk) and William Bader (william@nscs.fast.net)
  sent me a large patch which has been merged into this version.
  Their changes include:
    - an excellent improvement to the postcript scanner which allows
      to ignore bogus 'End of File' (EOF) comments.
      The main effect is that if you have a document which embeds
      other documents without the proper 'BeginDocument', 'EndDocument'
      comments then the chances are good that they can still be 
      previewed.
      And believe me, there are many such documents ....
      This feature can be turned on/off by means of the '-eof' and
      '-noeof' command line option or via an entry in the 'State'
      menu or via ... .
    - a 'confirm quit' popup which (by default) shows up when trying
      to leave gv while PDF to PS conversions are still in progress.
    - a signal handler to clean up ghostscript subprocesses when
      gv receives a SIGQUIT, SIGINT or SIGTERM signal.
      SIGHUP causes gv to display a new version of the current
      if it exists.
    - an FAQ which is now part of the documentation.
    - better name suggestions when saving data.
    - and about 3681 other improvements which are not mentioned here.

# More work on the postscript scanner: increase initial buffer size
  and adjust its size increment when reallocation is needed.
  Also increase the anumber of bytes read in one turn.
  This reduces memory reallocation and memory shifting to a minimum.

# Fix a bug in the postscript scanner which caused faulty behaviour
  when reading lines longer than about 100kB.

# Add a "Next Page" and "Previous Page" button to the main window.

# Further extend the "Options" menu.

# Add a "Watch file" feature which checks the displayed file
  periodically if activated. If the document changes the new version
  is displayed.

# Add a menu "State" to the main window which holds entries
  previously found in the "File" menu without having anything to do 
  with any file.

# Add Mouse bindings for two button mice: actions bound to the third
  button can be accessed by using the second button while pressing
  the Shift key.

# Include some 'memmove()' replacement for systems which don't
  provide this function. The code will be activated by defining
  'USE_MEMMOVE_CODE' in the configuration file 'confg.Unix'.

# Use the 'Vlist' widget (instead of the 'List' widget) to display files
  and directories in the file selection popup.

# Add scrolllbars to the file selection popup.
  They are not needed since scrolling can be done directly
  in the windows of the file and directory lists by using the
  event sequence 'button down, move mouse, button release'.
  However, the scrollbars reappeared since the mails
  asking why the lists cannot be scrolled start to fill my hard disc.

# Fix the 'A' key (for antialiasing) which stopped working recently.

# *Try* to provide some more helpful message when gv detects 
  incompatible resources.

# Change the format of the manpage.

* Change 'ifdef _DECC' to 'if defined (__DECC) && defined (VMS)'
  in error.c.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 3.0.4  (1 April 1997) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Allow to choose and save a default filter from within the options 
  menu.

# Add the filter 'GV*filter: no .*' to the user resource file.
  This defines the filter 'no .*' as default when opening the file
  selection popup.

# Fix the 'two-pixel' bug that caused the page marks to overlap with 
  the indicator for the current page.

# Correct syntax in Imakefile which was not understood by non-'GNU makes'.

* Avoid unnecessary drawing of shadows in the table of contents.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 3.0.0  (31 March 1997) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Provide a new 'Look and Feel' by using
  - 'feather touch' buttons, toggles and menus instead of the standard
    ones with raised shadows.
  - a new table of contents. Apart from looking better this has the side
    effect that the table of contents can now be scrolled in the same 
    way as the main window, the zoom window and the file and directory
    lists in the File Selection popup (it should be clear now that
    I don't like Scrollbars :-).

# Redo the File Selection popup. Changes include but are not limited to
   - the addition of a menu with pre-definable directories.
   - the removal of the 'Tmp' and 'Home' buttons. The functionality
     offered by these two buttons is now available via the 'Directories'
     menu.
   - the addition of a menu with pre-definable filters.

# Add all relevant preferences to the 'Options' popup so that users
  don't have to mess around with resource files in order to change
  some options.

# Add an 'Antialias' entry to the 'File' menu.

# Allow for multiple wildcards '%s' in the print command. Each such 
  wildcard will be replaced by the file to be printed.

# Add a bugfix for the bugfix added to cure some problems when
  scanning postscript files with incorrect structuring comments.
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.9.4  (20 March 1997) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Add another mouse binding in the main window.
  A double click with the left mouse button in the left/right half
  of the shown page causes the previous/next page to be displayed.

# Add yet another mouse binding in the main window.
  A click with the right mouse button pops up a small menu offering
  a few standard action.

# Allow gv to either respect or ignore document structuring comments
  when opening a file. This should be helpful when viewing documents
  with faulty structuring comments.
  To toggle between these two states a new menu entry has been added to 
  the 'File' menu.
  A keyboard binding to toggle DSC parsing on and off has beem added as
  well. By default the key is 'I'.
  Alternatively the new command line options '-dsc' and '-nodsc' may be
  used.

# Keep the point located in the center of the visible area of the 
  displayed page centered when changing the magnification or
  orientation.

# Add resources 'minimumWidth' and 'minimumHeight' to allow users
  to specify a size beyond which gv will never shrink so that all
  controls and titles remain accessible when changing the magnification
  or the page media or ...
  For both resources the default value is 400.

# Merge in a few patches enlarging and correcting the set of allowed
  papersizes.
  [ thanks to Andreas Schott (schott@rzg.mpg.de) ]
 
# Add Keyboard binding to toggle antialiasing on and off.
  By default the key 'A' is used.

# Add Keyboard binding to toggle the resize behaviour of the main window
  between 'Fixed Size' and 'Variable Size'.
  By default the key 'Z' is used.

# Update the documentation. The new sections mainly cover resources
  and key and mouse bindings.

# Fix a bug that causes gv to crash when the current page media
  is 'Bounding Box' and the user disables automatic page media
  selection.

# Fix a bug that causes wrong page media selection when changing
  from a document with document specific papersizes to one without
  document specific papersizes (or vice versa).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GV 2.7 b1  (2 June 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This version

  # offers an improved PDF capability:
    a) Page numbers are shown, allowing to freely move through the
       document.
    b) Saving marked pages of a PDF file (or the whole file) is now a
       valid operation. The file will first be converted to postscript,
       then the pages are extracted and saved to the destination file.
       Since the PDF->PS conversion takes a considerable amount of time
       it is done "in the background" to not block the user interface.
    c) Printing marked pages of a PDF file (or the whole file) is now 
       also a valid option. The marked pages are first saved in
       postscript format, then they are printed. Printing is also done
       "in the background" due to the involved PDF->PS conversion.

  # provides an additional layout of the main window for those who want
    to minimize the on-screen-area consumption of gv. To use it start
    gv by executing
      $ gv -style gv_spartan.dat
    The file gv_spartan.dat contains a layout description which omits
    some of the buttons shown in the standard version and which uses
    a different on-screen arrangement of the remaining widgets.

  # provides an option to reverse the scrolling behaviour in the main
    window.

  # widens the class of previewable postscript documents by
    a) removing the constraint that lines shouldn't have more than 
       255 characters.
    b) allowing LF, CR and CR LF as line terminators.

  # removes the concept of a "forced" orientation and media. Instead the
    orientation and papersize menus offer the "Automatic" entry, which,
    if selected, advices gv to use the orientation and media extracted
    from the DSC comments.

  # uses a different algorithm for smoothing the scrolling process in the
    main window. The new method is based on taking an average of the last
    few motion events.

  # handles some resources more restrictive for security reasons.
    Those resources are prefixed by "GVintern" and may only be set
    via a command line option or in the resource file "~/.gv" 
    (or "DECW$USER_DEFAULTS:GV.DAT" on VMS).
    Affected are, for instance, "GVintern.printCommand" and 
    "GVintern.gsArguments". After installation the file "gv_intern_res.dat"
    contains a complete list of these resources.

  # uses by default a Pixmap instead of requesting Backing Store from
    the X Server (GV*useBackingPixmap: True).

  # uses an improved version of the FileSelection Widget.

  # fixes a bug in the file selection widget which causes a crash
    on OpenVMS VAX.

  # doesn't show tons of String-to-Pixmap conversion warnings on
    Motif displays anymore.

  # corrects a bug in the layout of the main window which caused a wrong
    horizontal scaling behaviour.

  # fixes a bug which caused the comment '%%Pages: 0" to appear in saved
    postscript files.

  # fixes problematic file inclusion macros in "paths.h" which caused
    errors for a lot of people.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GhostView-VMS 2.3   (1 March 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) New platform (linux)
2) New widgets: Clip,Frame,Aaa
3) New Layout
4) New method to define regions to be magnified by zoom popups.
5) New Zoom Popups (scrollable)
6) New Bugfixes
7) New Bugs

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GhostView-VMS 2.1   (18 January 1996) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) added "basic" PDF support. PDF files are handled in the same way
   as unstructured PS files now.

2) fixed a quite large memory leak which appeared in the VMS_DIR.C code.

3) added the -landscape,-portrait, -seascape and -upsidedown options
   which somehow got lost in previous versions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% GhostView-VMS 2.0.3 (1 February 1995) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1) callback 'cb_moveSlider' in file CALLBACKS.C calls 'XtCallActionProc'
   which is buggy in the VMS/X11R4 implemetation and causes a crash
   at startup -> fixed
   Related problem appears in ACTIONS.C when in action_panner
   XtRemoveCallback(pageview,XtNreportCallback,...) is called.
   Also a problem only on R4 ... -> fixed
   (thanks to Martin Zinser who provided an account on an X11R4 machine,
   so that the tests could be made).

2) color specifications of type 'rgb:x/y/z' do not work on VMS/X11R4.
   They got replaced in the resource files by specifications of 
   type 'grayX'.

3) some ps-formatters include the 'end' command in the last page,
   not in the trailer. These may cause ghostscript to break if
   switching from the last page to another page.
   Therefore the compile time option 'GV_RESTART_IF_BUSY' has been
   introduced (see CONFIG.H).
   Enabling this option may help but will slow down performance for
   many correctly formatted files also.
   By default this options is not activated.
