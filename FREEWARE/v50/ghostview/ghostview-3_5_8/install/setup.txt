Description of the setup procedure [.COMMAND]SETUP.COM

February 1996, Johannes Plass

##################################################################

SETUP.COM accepts the following parameters:

 MINIMAL : Provide a minimal configuration, just to run the executables.
 COMPILE : Set up additional logicals and symbols needed during
           compilation of this package.   
 DISTRIB : Set up symbols and logicals only for the software included
           in this package. It is not recommended to leave
           this parameter away.
 INSTALL : Define most logicals in the system table and INSTALL the
           libraries.
 NOLOG   : Suppress messages.

Parameter parsing is not case sensitive and is order independant. Unknown
parameters are ignored without warning, white space and tabulators are
eliminated before parsing. All parameters are optional.

SETUP.COM first defines a minimal set of logicals required at run time:

 X11_ROOT 		concealed logical pointing to the top directory
			of this X11 tree.
 BITMAP_DIRECTORY	X11_ROOT:[BITMAPS]
 X11_LIBRARY		X11_ROOT:[EXE]       on OpenVMS VAX
			X11_ROOT:[EXE_ALPHA] on OpenVMS AXP         
 XMULIBSHR		X11_LIBRARY:XMULIBSHR.EXE
 XAW3DLIBSHR		X11_LIBRARY:XAW3DBSHR.EXE

#####

In case the MINIMAL parameter is not present the following logicals
are defined:

 X11_DIRECTORY		DECW$INCLUDE
 XAW_DIRECTORY		X11_ROOT:[XAW3D]
 XMU_DIRECTORY		X11_ROOT:[XMU]

They may be needed during the compilation of Xaw3D clients.

#####

SETUP.COM proceeds by (re)defining DECW$USER_DEFAULTS in the process table as
the list of translations that results from appending "X11_ROOT:[DEFAULTS]" to
the list of all translations of DECW$USER_DEFAULTS in the logical name table
returned by F$TRNLNM("DECW$USER_DEFAULTS",,,,,"TABLE_NAME").

In presence of the COMPILE parameter, the following foreign commands
will be defined:

 XMMK   A low-level command used to build particular parts of the software.
        XMMK invokes either MMS or MMK with some platform dependant macros.
        For instance XMMK may be defined as
          $MMK_DIR:MMK/MAC=("__DECC__=CC/DECC",X11R5=1)
        or as
          MMS/MAC=(__VAX__=1,"__VAXC__=CC/VAXC",X11R4=1)
        or as
          MMS/MAC=(__ALPHA__=1,"__DECC__=CC/DECC",X11R5=1)
        The macros X11R4 and X11R5 are used in the makefiles as flags for
        X11 R4 and X11 R5 environments. The decision about the X11 release is
        based on the (non)presence of the library DECW$XTLIBSHRR5.EXE
        in SYS$SHARE.
        The macros __VAX__ and __ALPHA__ indicate the platform.
        The macros __DECC__=CC/DECC and __VAXC__=CC/VAXC specify the compiler
        and its invocation command.
        XMMK may be used from within a particular source directory to build
        the software that resides in it. XMMK does not place the resulting
        libraries or executables in the correct destination directories.
        XMMK should be used if problems are encountered when using XMAKE.
        XMMK will not copy resulting executables, libraries etc. into
        X11_LIBRARY.
 XMAKE  The high-level command used to build particular or all parts of this
        software. For help about XMAKE type
         $ XMAKE 
        on the command line.

#####

SETUP.COM also defines all necessary logicals and foreign commands to
invoke any client that is part of this package.
