                              CHAPTER 1

                    INTRODUCTION AND REQUIREMENTS



1.1  Introduction

You install DECspell  using  the  VMSINSTAL  command  procedure.   The
installation procedure only requires you to:

      .  Set up proper conditions for the installation

      .  Load the media

      .  Respond to any queries and prompts that are output during the
         installation procedure


1.2  Hardware Requirements

DECspell is installed on  an OpenVMS Alpha system  configuration  having  a
minimum  of  3000  disk  blocks  available  on the system disk.  

1.3  Software Requirements

The following software is required:

     1   OpenVMS Alpha V6.1 or later

1.4  The Kit

The DECspell software is distributed online via a backup saveset to be
used with the SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL procedure.

There are two types of kit, basic and  update.   The  basic  kits  are
complete  products.   An  update  kit  adds  an  extra dictionary to a
previously installed basic kit.

The DECspell kit contains both the American English and British dictionary.


                              CHAPTER 2

                     PREPARATION AND INSTALLATION

2.1  Preparing for Installation

Before you begin installing DECspell do the following:

     1   Check the distribution  kit.

     2   Make sure there are:

          .  3000 free blocks on the system disk for a DECspell  basic
             kit, and

          .  a further 1100 blocks  if  an  additional  dictionary  is
             being installed.


     3   Back up the system disk.

     4   Make sure there are no users logged into the system.

2.2  Installing DECspell

Take note of the following points before you install DECspell:

      .  During this installation procedure  a  number  of  cautionary
         messages  and  general  information  messages,  which are not
         documented here,  may  display.   Please  read  all  messages
         carefully and follow the advice they offer.

      .  If the following error messages display at any  time,  during
         the  installation,  you  may need to increase the global page
         table.   Otherwise,  reboot  your  machine  and  restart  the
         installation procedure:

         %SYSTEM-F-GPTFULL, global page table is full

         %VMSINSTAL-F-NOREINSTAL, Image VMI$ROOT:[SYSLIB]DCLTABLES.EXE;
                                  could not be re-installed

         %VMSINSTAL-F-UNEXPECTED, Installation terminated due to unexpected event


Now follow these steps to install DECspell:

1   Log in under the privileged VMS system manager's account.

2   Type the following command to initiate the installation:

    $ @VMSINSTAL SPLAXP015 <kit-location>

4   You will be asked a few questions about the installation options.


                              CHAPTER 3

                       ADVICE ON USING DECSPELL

This chapter contains information to help you and the  users  on  your
system  make  the  most  effective  use of DECspell.  It also contains
information that may help you in answering users' queries or problems.


3.1  Personal Dictionaries

Personal dictionaries are lists maintained by users.   The  words  and
names  contained  in  them  are  words  which  are  not  in the master
dictionary.  DECspell is easier to use when personal dictionaries  are
used  for  checking,  because  fewer  valid  words  are highlighted as
errors.

Users should  be  encouraged  to  make  full  use  of  their  personal
dictionaries.


3.1.1  Using DECspell for the First Time

The first  time  a  user runs DECspell he will not have a default personal 
dictionary.  This is
the personal dictionary that DECspell  always  uses  unless  the  user
specifies  otherwise.   DECspell  will  ask whether the user wants one
created.  If  the  user  answers  NO,  this  question  is  asked  each
subsequent  time  the  user  runs DECspell.  If the user answers YES a
default  personal  dictionary  is  created,   with   the   file   name
SYS$LOGIN:PERSONAL.LGP.

Personal dictionaries are ASCII files.  Users can create  and  add  to
other  personal  dictionaries using an editor, for example EDT.  There
can be more than one word per line; separate the  words  with  spaces.
The words can be in any order.

3.1.3  Sharing Personal Dictionaries with Other Users

You can specify additional personal
dictionaries with the /DICTIONARY qualifier.  Users  should  refer  to
their   own  dictionaries  by  name.   They  can  use  other  people's
dictionaries, but will need to specify the directory for  dictionaries
located  in  other  accounts.   For  example,  user  Brown  issues the
command:

$ SPELL/DICTIONARY=(TECHNICAL,[SMITH]COMPANY) NAME.TXT

This will cause DECspell to use the following dictionaries:

SYS$LOGIN:PERSONAL.LGP       (by default)
SYS$LOGIN:TECHNICAL.LGP      (one of user Brown's dictionaries)
[SMITH]COMPANY.LGP           (one of user Smith's dictionaries)

DECspell requires Read access to additional dictionaries in  order  to
use   them  for  verification.   DECspell  requires  Write  access  to
additional dictionaries if you wish to add words while using DECspell.

You can use this feature to set up a dictionary  that  can  be  shared
between  users.   You  can  set  up shared dictionaries with Read-only
access to prevent the addition of incorrectly  spelled  words.   (This
means that users cannot add any words to those dictionaries.)


3.1.4  System Messages Associated with Personal Dictionaries

When a user invokes  additional  dictionaries  at
the start of using DECspell (with the /DICTIONARY switch), a number of
messages may appear if he makes any one of these mistakes:

      .  Specifies the dictionary incorrectly

      .  Specifies the directory in which  the  dictionary  is  stored
         incorrectly

      .  Specifies the  device  on  which  the  dictionary  is  stored
         incorrectly

      .  Specifies a dictionary that is protected against Read access

The user is asked if he wishes to continue.  He can type Y to continue
without  using  the  incorrectly specified dictionary or type N, start
DECspell again and respecify the dictionary.

3.1.5  Words in Dictionaries

DECspell dictionaries contain whole words only.  There are no  derived
forms.   Separate entries exist for the plural and possessive forms of
words in dictionaries.   If  a  user  adds  a  word  to  his  personal
dictionary  he  may  also  need to add the plural and possessive forms
separately.

Many hyphenated words are stored in the  dictionary  as  whole  words.
DECspell  also  handles  compound  words  (valid  words separated by a
single hyphen) by checking each part in the dictionary.  The  compound
word  is  only  accepted  if  both  halves  are valid and have correct
capitalization.  Compound words can be added to personal dictionaries.

DECspell handles abbreviations by first checking the word without  the
trailing  period.   If it is not found a second check is made with the
trailing period appended.

3.2  The HELP Key

The HELP key used by DECspell is the  PF2  key  or the HELP key on LK4xx 
keyboards.

3.4  DCL Command Qualifiers

Qualifiers modify the way DECspell works.  Users  can  use  them  when
starting   DECspell   Users  can  abbreviate  any
qualifier uniquely and can use more than one qualifier at a time.  The
following DCL command qualifiers are available:


/OUTPUT

Gives the output document a new name.  If this qualifier is  not  used
the  output  document  will  be  stored under its original name with a
higher version number.

For example:  $ SPELL/OUTPUT=NEWNAME.TXT NAME.TXT


/NOOUTPUT

Prevents a corrected version of the document being created.  Words can
still be added to the personal dictionaries during the run.

For example:  $ SPELL/NOOUTPUT NAME.TXT


/NOPERSONAL_DICTIONARY

Prevents the users's default personal dictionary (PERSONAL.LGP)  being
used.

For example:  $ SPELL/NOPERSONAL_DICTIONARY NAME.TXT


/PERSONAL_DICTIONARY

This can be used to specify an alternative personal dictionary  to  be
used instead of PERSONAL.LGP.  If the dictionary specified by the user
does not exist, DECspell asks whether he would like it created.

For example:  $ SPELL/PERSONAL_DICTIONARY=DICNAME NAME.TXT


/DICTIONARY

Specifies additional personal dictionaries for checking.   If  a  user
wishes  to  use a dictionary for checking, he must have Read access to
the dictionary.  If a user wishes to add words  to  a  dictionary,  he
must  have  Write  access  to  the  dictionary.   Up  to 10 additional
personal dictionaries can be used for checking.

For example:  $ SPELL/DICTIONARY=(DICNAME1,DICNAME2) NAME.TXT


/KEYPAD

Specifies an alternative editor mini-keypad layout.  Available keypads
are WPS and EDT.  The default is WPS.

For example:  $ SPELL/KEYPAD=EDT NAME.TXT


/MASTER_DICTIONARY

Specifies an alternative master dictionary.   This  qualifier  can  be
used  only  if  the  system  has  both dictionaries.  The dictionaries
available are:

      .  AMERICAN (the American English dictionary)

      .  BRITISH (the British English dictionary)

For Example:  $ SPELL/MASTER_DICTIONARY=BRITISH NAME.TXT


/RUNOFF

Indicates that the document is a  RUNOFF  document,  if  it  does  not
already  have  a  .RN%  file type, where % is any character.  DECspell
then bypasses the RUNOFF commands when checking the document.

For example:  $ SPELL/RUNOFF NAME.TXT


/NORUNOFF

Indicates that the document is not a RUNOFF document, if it has a .RN%
file type.  DECspell then checks every line in the document, including
any beginning with a period.

For example:  $ SPELL/NORUNOFF NAME.RNO

3.4.1  Tailoring Command Qualifiers

Sometimes it is cumbersome to type in a whole line of qualifiers.   If
the  same set of qualifiers are used frequently it is easier to set up
a global symbol in your login command file.

For example:

$ SPELL :== SPELL/MASTER=BRITISH/KEYPAD=EDT

The command SPELL will now invoke DECspell with the above qualifiers.

3.5  Finding the Version Number

To find the version number of DECspell a user can do the following:

While verifying a document, press the HELP key.  The top line of  each
help frame has the format:

HELP               topic for help                    VERSION NUMBER

This version number shows:

      .  The version of DECspell you are using (for example, V1.5).

      .  Whether the Corrector option is present (VC).  All V1.5  kits
         have  the  Corrector.   V1.0 kits could be Verifier only kits
         (VO).

      .  Whether the master dictionary you are using  is  American  or
         British (A or B).


                              CHAPTER 5

                            RELEASE NOTES

5.1  Differences Between DECspell V1.1 and T1.5

DECspell V1.5 has the following differences:

      .  No support for /dx

      .  No support for ALL-IN-1.

5.2  Software Problems Fixed by this Release

	None.


5.3  Known Problems and Restrictions


5.3.2  Dictionary Status Report

When DECspell has finished  checking  a  document,  it  displays  some
statistics  for  each  personal  dictionary  to  which words have been
added.  These are:

      .  The number of words added

      .  The new total of words in the dictionary

The total number of words in the dictionary does not include any words
greater  than  32  characters  that  you  may  have  edited  into your
dictionary.


5.3.3  Lines With More Than 255 Characters

DECspell does not support documents containing lines  of  text  longer
than 255 characters (that is, documents whose record length is greater
than 255 characters).  Personal  dictionaries,  however,  can  contain
lines of any length.

5.3.4  RUNOFF Support

DECspell does not highlight incorrect RUNOFF commands as errors.  This
means that:

      .  Incorrect RUNOFF commands will not be found

      .  If a  RUNOFF  command  without  a  terminating  semicolon  is
         incorrect,  DECspell  assumes that the whole line is a RUNOFF
         command.  Therefore, DECspell will not highlight  any  errors
         in the text on that line.

                        SEVERE ERROR MESSAGES

This chapter lists all the error messages that  appear  when  DECspell
fails, why they have occurred and how to deal with them.


D.1  Associated With Master Dictionaries

%LNGSPL-F-BAD_MASTDIC, Master dictionary  was  specified  incorrectly.
See your system manager.

You specified the master dictionary incorrectly when using the /MASTER
qualifier.

When using the /MASTER qualifier  specify  either  /MASTER=BRITISH  or
/MASTER=AMERICAN


%LNGSPL-F-FILNOTFOU, Master dictionary not  opened  -  disk  file  not
found

The master dictionary you specified does  not  exist  on  the  system.
Either  just  the  American or just the British dictionary is present.
You cannot use the /MASTER qualifier.


D.3  Associated with Formatter
D.3  Associated with Formatter

%LNGSPL-F-SORTWRKSET, Not enough working set space for SORT.  See your
system manager.

The sort facility in the formatter failed to get the  working  set  it
needed.

Increase the user's working set quota.  If the  quota  is  already  at
maximum, increase the maximum.


%LNGSPL-F-SORVIRMEM, Not enough virtual memory  for  SORT.   See  your
system manager.

The sort facility in the formatter failed to get the virtual memory it
needed.

DECREASE the user's working set quota to release more memory  for  the
system.

%LNGSPL-F-SORWRKDEV, SORT work file not a  disk  device  or  on  local
node.  See your system manager.

The logical names for the sort facility  in  the  formatter  temporary
work  files, SORTWORK1, SORTWORK2, are pointing to unsuitable devices;
either to devices on another system, or to devices that are not random
access devices (disks).

Reassign these logical names to point to a random access device  on  a
system  from  which  you  wish to run the SPELL/FORMAT.  Alternatively
deassign these logical names, so that the sort creates temporary  work
files in your local directory.


%LNGSPL-F-SOREXTWRK, SORT could not extend work file.  See your system
manager.

The sort facility in the formatter  creates  two  work  files  on  the
device(s)  specified  by  the  logical names SORTWORK1, SORTWORK2.  If
these logicals are undefined, the work files are created in your login
directory.

Ensure you extend your privilege for the device where SORT is creating
the temporary work files.  If you extended the privilege, increase the
free block space on the device.


%LNGSPL-F-SORTMAP, SORT could not map  work  file.   See  your  system
manager.

Ensure that the system parameter 'maximum process sections' is set  to
20.


%LNGSPL-F-SORCLNUP, SORT did not clean up work area.  Run SPELL/FORMAT
again.

Sort failed to delete the work files and reinitialize the areas.


%LNGSPL-F-SORNOOUT, SORT could not open a work file.  See your  system
manager.

Sort failed to open a work file.

If the logical names (SORTWORK1, SORTWORK2) are not defined,  increase
the  free  disk  space  on  the  device(s)  they point to.  Otherwise,
increase the free disk space on your login device.
