<h2>DECspell</h2>
  BJM Midnight Hacks is proud to bring you DECspell V1.5 for OpenVMS Alpha,
  a product that has long been retired.  
<p>
  This page provides links to the two known pieces of documentation for 
  DECspell and an OpenVMS Alpha port of the code that was written back 
  in the early 1980's.

<hr>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
  The documentation was taken from the on-line version and modified to remove 
  any references to the /DX qualifier or any ALL-IN-1 support.
