The DECspell software is distributed on RX01 diskettes,  TU58  DECTAPE
II  cartridges,  or  9-track  1600  BPI magnetic tapes.  The number of
volumes in the kit depends on which  kit  you  are  installing.   Each
volume  has  a  unique physical label.  The volumes must be mounted in
order.

The installation procedure is the same for all types of media.

There are two types of kit, basic and  update.   The  basic  kits  are
complete  products.   An  update  kit  adds  an  extra dictionary to a
previously installed basic kit.

2.1  Preparing for Installation2.1  Preparing for Installation

Before you begin installing DECspell do the following:

     1   Check the distribution  kit  for  DECspell  is  complete  and
         correct  according to the bill of materials included with the
         kit.

     2   Make sure there are:

          .  3000 free blocks on the system disk for a DECspell  basic
             kit, and

          .  a further 1100 blocks  if  an  additional  dictionary  is
             being installed.


     3   Back up the system disk.

     4   Make sure there are no users logged into the system.

     5   Make a note of the the product identifier from Table 1-1, The
         DECspell Kits.

                                     NOTE

               1 A basic kit  (Product  Identifiers:   LNGVCA,
                 LNGVCB)  must already be installed if you are
                 installing    an    update    kit    (Product
                 Identifiers:  LNGALA, LNGALB).

               2 Do not move the files in your basic kit  from
                 the  system disk to another area.  If you do,
                 you will not be able  to  install  an  update
                 kit.




                                 2-1
     6   Obtain a copy of the user's card - How to Use DECspell.

     7   During installation you are asked whether you require  access
         to  DECspell through ALL-IN-1.  (ALL-IN-1 is DIGITAL's office
         automation system.)




















































                                 2-2
         Decide now whether you  wish  to  incorporate  DECspell  into
         ALL-IN-1.   Several  files will be copied into the SYS$UPDATE
         directory.  (See  Appendix  A,  Incorporating  DECspell  into
         ALL-IN-1  V1.3,  and  Appendix B, Incorporating DECspell into
         ALL-IN-1 V2.)

     8   It is recommended that you perform the  installation  on  the
         system  console, a hard-copy terminal.  However, installation
         can be performed on a video terminal.

         If you use a hard-copy terminal, make sure that  you  have  a
         video  terminal  available  to complete the final part of the
         Installation Verification Procedure, the interactive test.




2.2  Installing DECspell2.2  Installing DECspell

Take note of the following points before you install DECspell:

      .  The installation procedure (below) assumes you are installing
         on the console, and displays CSA1:  as the device name.

      .  The wording of the messages displayed may vary, depending  on
         the  version  of  VMS  being  used.   Some  questions may not
         appear.

      .  During this installation procedure  a  number  of  cautionary
         messages  and  general  information  messages,  which are not
         documented here,  may  display.   Please  read  all  messages
         carefully and follow the advice they offer.

      .  If the following error messages display at any  time,  during

                       ADVICE ON USING DECSPELL                       ADVICE ON USING DECSPELL



This chapter contains information to help you and the  users  on  your
system  make  the  most  effective  use of DECspell.  It also contains
information that may help you in answering users' queries or problems.



3.1  Personal Dictionaries3.1  Personal Dictionaries

Personal dictionaries are lists maintained by users.   The  words  and
names  contained  in  them  are  words  which  are  not  in the master
dictionary.  DECspell is easier to use when personal dictionaries  are
used  for  checking,  because  fewer  valid  words  are highlighted as
errors.

Users should  be  encouraged  to  make  full  use  of  their  personal
dictionaries.



3.1.1  Using DECspell for the First Time3.1.1  Using DECspell for the First Time

If you are using DECspell from  ALL-IN-1  V2,  read  section  3.1.1.2.
Otherwise, read section 3.1.1.1.  (This includes ALL-IN-1 V1.3 users.)



3.1.1.1  Using DECspell Outside ALL-IN-1 V23.1.1.1  Using DECspell Outside ALL-IN-1 V2 - The first  time  a  user
runs DECspell he will not have a default personal dictionary.  This is
the personal dictionary that DECspell  always  uses  unless  the  user
specifies  otherwise.   DECspell  will  ask whether the user wants one
created.  If  the  user  answers  NO,  this  question  is  asked  each
subsequent  time  the  user  runs DECspell.  If the user answers YES a
default  personal  dictionary  is  created,   with   the   file   name
SYS$LOGIN:PERSONAL.LGP.

Personal dictionaries are ASCII files.  Users can create  and  add  to
other  personal  dictionaries using an editor, for example EDT.  There


                                 3-1
can be more than one word per line; separate the  words  with  spaces.
The words can be in any order.



3.1.1.2  Using DECspell from ALL-IN-1 V23.1.1.2  Using DECspell from ALL-IN-1 V2 - The first time a user  runs
DECspell from ALL-IN-1 V2, an empty personal dictionary is created for
that user.  It is called PERSONAL, and is stored in  the  DICTIONARIES
folder.   (Personal  dictionaries  are ALL-IN-1 documents, with a file
type of DICTIONARY.)

However, if a user already has a personal dictionary outside  ALL-IN-1
(SYS$LOGIN:PERSONAL.LGP),  then  ALL-IN-1  takes  this as the PERSONAL
dictionary.  Each time the user updates the dictionary, both  PERSONAL
and  PERSONAL.LGP  are  updated.  In this way, people can use the same
personal dictionary when running DECspell inside or outside ALL-IN-1.



3.1.2  Using Imported Dictionaries in ALL-IN-1 V23.1.2  Using Imported Dictionaries in ALL-IN-1 V2

In  addition  to  dictionaries  in  the  user's  own   File   Cabinet,
dictionaries  transferred  from  VMS,  or  mailed  from other ALL-IN-1
accounts can be used.  However, DECspell does not recognize  these  as
dictionaries unless the user does the following:

     1   Dictionaries transferred from VMS, using the DT option on the
         WP menu --

         When transferring a dictionary, users should press Gold A  at
         the  Creating  From  VMS  File  form,  to  display additional
         fields.  They should then enter DICTIONARY  in  the  Handling
         field.   (Refer to the ALL-IN-1 User's Reference volume 2 for
         details on transferring documents.)

         If a user has transferred the dictionary without doing  this,
         he  should  enter Convert Document (CD) from the File Cabinet
         menu, and convert the document type to DICTIONARY.

     2   Dictionaries mailed  from  another  ALL-IN-1  account,  using
         ALL-IN-1 Electronic Messaging --

         When  users  mail  dictionaries  using  ALL-IN-1   Electronic
         Messaging,  they  should mail them as attachments.  (Refer to
         the ALL-IN-1 User's Reference volume 1 for details on sending
         mail.)  The  filed  attachments  can  then  be  used to check
         documents.

3.1.3  Sharing Personal Dictionaries with Other Users3.1.3  Sharing Personal Dictionaries with Other Users

ALL-IN-1  does  not  allow  users  to  share  personal   dictionaries.
However,  outside  of  ALL-IN-1,  you  can specify additional personal
dictionaries with the /DICTIONARY qualifier.  Users  should  refer  to
their   own  dictionaries  by  name.   They  can  use  other  people's
dictionaries, but will need to specify the directory for  dictionaries
located  in  other  accounts.   For  example,  user  Brown  issues the
command:

$ SPELL/DICTIONARY=(TECHNICAL,[SMITH]COMPANY) NAME.TXT

This will cause DECspell to use the following dictionaries:

SYS$LOGIN:PERSONAL.LGP       (by default)
SYS$LOGIN:TECHNICAL.LGP      (one of user Brown's dictionaries)
[SMITH]COMPANY.LGP           (one of user Smith's dictionaries)

DECspell requires Read access to additional dictionaries in  order  to
use   them  for  verification.   DECspell  requires  Write  access  to
additional dictionaries if you wish to add words while using DECspell.

You can use this feature to set up a dictionary  that  can  be  shared
between  users.   You  can  set  up shared dictionaries with Read-only
access to prevent the addition of incorrectly  spelled  words.   (This
means that users cannot add any words to those dictionaries.)



3.1.4  System Messages Associated with Personal Dictionaries3.1.4  System Messages Associated with Personal Dictionaries

If a user is running DECspell from ALL-IN-1, an error message  appears
if  he types an incorrect name when specifying additional dictionaries
to be used for checking.  ALL-IN-1 then lets the user try again.

Outside of ALL-IN-1, when a user invokes  additional  dictionaries  at
the start of using DECspell (with the /DICTIONARY switch), a number of
messages may appear if he makes any one of these mistakes:

      .  Specifies the dictionary incorrectly

      .  Specifies the directory in which  the  dictionary  is  stored
         incorrectly

      .  Specifies the  device  on  which  the  dictionary  is  stored
         incorrectly

      .  Specifies a dictionary that is protected against Read access

The user is asked if he wishes to continue.  He can type Y to continue
without  using  the  incorrectly specified dictionary or type N, start
DECspell again and respecify the dictionary.





                                 3-3
3.1.5  Words in Dictionaries3.1.5  Words in Dictionaries

DECspell dictionaries contain whole words only.  There are no  derived
forms.   Separate entries exist for the plural and possessive forms of
words in dictionaries.   If  a  user  adds  a  word  to  his  personal
dictionary  he  may  also  need to add the plural and possessive forms
separately.

Many hyphenated words are stored in the  dictionary  as  whole  words.
DECspell  also  handles  compound  words  (valid  words separated by a
single hyphen) by checking each part in the dictionary.  The  compound
word  is  only  accepted  if  both  halves  are valid and have correct
capitalization.  Compound words can be added to personal dictionaries.

DECspell handles abbreviations by first checking the word without  the
trailing  period.   If it is not found a second check is made with the
trailing period appended.



3.2  The HELP Key3.2  The HELP Key

The HELP key used by DECspell is the  PF2  key  for  VT100  and  VT200
series  terminals  and  the  blue  key  on the mini-keypad on the VT52
series terminals.

Alternatively you can use Gold H.   On  non-word-processing  terminals
the  Gold  key is the PF1 key for VT100 and VT200 series terminals and
the red key on the mini-keypad for VT52 series terminals.



3.3  RUNOFF Documents in ALL-IN-13.3  RUNOFF Documents in ALL-IN-1

When transferring a RUNOFF document from  VMS,  users  should  do  the
following to make DECspell recognize it as a RUNOFF document:

     1   Press Gold A at the Creating From VMS File form,  to  display
         additional fields.

     2   Enter RUNOFF in the Handling field.  (Refer to  the  ALL-IN-1
         User's  Reference  volume  2 for more details on transferring
         documents.)

If users have transferred RUNOFF documents without  doing  this,  they
should  enter Update Index Information (U) from the File Cabinet menu,
and enter RUNOFF in the Handling field.

DECspell then bypasses RUNOFF commands in the document  when  checking
it.







                                 3-4
3.4  DCL Command Qualifiers3.4  DCL Command Qualifiers

Qualifiers modify the way DECspell works.  Users  can  use  them  when
starting   DECspell   outside  ALL-IN-1.   Users  can  abbreviate  any
qualifier uniquely and can use more than one qualifier at a time.  The
following DCL command qualifiers are available:


/OUTPUT

Gives the output document a new name.  If this qualifier is  not  used
the  output  document  will  be  stored under its original name with a
higher version number.

For example:  $ SPELL/OUTPUT=NEWNAME.TXT NAME.TXT


/NOOUTPUT

Prevents a corrected version of the document being created.  Words can
still be added to the personal dictionaries during the run.

For example:  $ SPELL/NOOUTPUT NAME.TXT


/NOPERSONAL_DICTIONARY

Prevents the users's default personal dictionary (PERSONAL.LGP)  being
used.

For example:  $ SPELL/NOPERSONAL_DICTIONARY NAME.TXT


/PERSONAL_DICTIONARY

This can be used to specify an alternative personal dictionary  to  be
used instead of PERSONAL.LGP.  If the dictionary specified by the user
does not exist, DECspell asks whether he would like it created.

For example:  $ SPELL/PERSONAL_DICTIONARY=DICNAME NAME.TXT


/DICTIONARY

Specifies additional personal dictionaries for checking.   If  a  user
wishes  to  use a dictionary for checking, he must have Read access to
the dictionary.  If a user wishes to add words  to  a  dictionary,  he
must  have  Write  access  to  the  dictionary.   Up  to 10 additional
personal dictionaries can be used for checking.








                                 3-5
For example:  $ SPELL/DICTIONARY=(DICNAME1,DICNAME2) NAME.TXT


/KEYPAD

Specifies an alternative editor mini-keypad layout.  Available keypads
are WPS and EDT.  The default is WPS.

For example:  $ SPELL/KEYPAD=EDT NAME.TXT


/MASTER_DICTIONARY

Specifies an alternative master dictionary.   This  qualifier  can  be
used  only  if  the  system  has  both dictionaries.  The dictionaries
available are:

      .  AMERICAN (the American English dictionary)

      .  BRITISH (the British English dictionary)

For Example:  $ SPELL/MASTER_DICTIONARY=BRITISH NAME.TXT


/DX

Displays the index of the user's documents created on a word processor
and  transferred  by  DX.   Allows  the  user  to  select the required
document  for  checking.   (If  the  user  combines  /DX  with   other
qualifiers, he must specify /DX first.)

For example:  $ SPELL/DX


/RUNOFF

Indicates that the document is a  RUNOFF  document,  if  it  does  not
already  have  a  .RN%  file type, where % is any character.  DECspell
then bypasses the RUNOFF commands when checking the document.

For example:  $ SPELL/RUNOFF NAME.TXT


/NORUNOFF

Indicates that the document is not a RUNOFF document, if it has a .RN%
file type.  DECspell then checks every line in the document, including
any beginning with a period.

For example:  $ SPELL/NORUNOFF NAME.RNO







                                 3-6
3.4.1  Tailoring Command Qualifiers3.4.1  Tailoring Command Qualifiers

Sometimes it is cumbersome to type in a whole line of qualifiers.   If
the  same set of qualifiers are used frequently it is easier to set up
a global symbol in your login command file.

For example:

$ SPELL :== SPELL/MASTER=BRITISH/KEYPAD=EDT

The command SPELL will now invoke DECspell with the above qualifiers.



3.5  Finding the Version Number3.5  Finding the Version Number

To find the version number of DECspell a user can do the following:

While verifying a document, press the HELP key.  The top line of  each
help frame has the format:

HELP               topic for help                    VERSION NUMBER

This version number shows:

      .  The version of DECspell you are using (for example, V1.1).

      .  Whether the Corrector option is present (VC).  All V1.1  kits
         have  the  Corrector.   V1.0 kits could be Verifier only kits
         (VO).

      .  Whether the master dictionary you are using  is  American  or
         British (A or B).

To reduce the overheads associated with  invoking  DECspell,  and  the
memory  requirements  when more than one person is using DECspell, the
image components of DECspell may be installed as shared images to  the
VAX/VMS system.

Specify these as shared images  using  the  VAX/VMS  INSTALL  utility.
(Refer to the VAX/VMS System Management and Operations Guide.)

Make sure that you increase the parameters GBLPAGES (global pages) and
GLBSECTIONS  (global  sections)  so  that  they  can  accommodate  the
DECspell images.

5.1  Differences Between DECspell V1.1 and V1.05.1  Differences Between DECspell V1.1 and V1.0

DECspell V1.1 has the following differences:

      .  Larger, more compact master dictionaries

      .  Support for RUNOFF.  DECspell now by-passes  RUNOFF  commands
         when  checking  documents,  instead  of  highlighting them as
         errors

      .  Support for ALL-IN-1 V2.  There is an ALL-IN-1 Spelling Check
         Dictionary menu.




5.2  Software Problems Fixed by this Release5.2  Software Problems Fixed by this Release

5.2.1  Message Numbers Appearing on the Screen5.2.1  Message Numbers Appearing on the Screen

DECspell no longer displays an erroneous message at various places  on
the  screen  when  a user's process has run out of open file quota, or
when DECspell is being run with a working set extent that is too small
(less than 50).  The message that appeared was:

                       MESSAGE NUMBER XXXXXXXX

where XXXXXXXX represents a hexadecimal number.

Instead, DECspell displays the correct error messages,  as  listed  in
Appendix D.

5.2.2  Lost Output Files5.2.2  Lost Output Files

There will no longer be lost space on disk if the user leaves DECspell
in  an  unusual  way  (by  typing  CTRL/Y,  or if the system crashes).
Previously, this space had to be recovered using the VERIFY utility.

Now, if the user types CTRL/Y STOP, or if the system crashes,  a  file
called  <USER'S  FILENAME>.TMP  appears in the user's directory.  This
file will contain the results of the checking done up to that point.

If the user types CTRL/Y only, no output file is produced.



5.3  Known Problems and Restrictions5.3  Known Problems and Restrictions

5.3.1  Non-AVO Terminals5.3.1  Non-AVO Terminals

Non-AVO terminals are VT100  series  terminals  without  the  Advanced
Video  Option.   These terminals have limited video attributes and are
not suitable for checking DX documents containing  either  bolding  or
underlining, because:

      .  The bolding and underlining in the DX document  is  displayed
         as  normal  video.   If  you edit the document and insert any
         characters in a section of text that is bolded or underlined,
         they will not be bolded or underlined.

      .  If you select  the  cursor  to  be  an  underline  character,
         spelling errors will be displayed underlined.




5.3.2  Dictionary Status Report5.3.2  Dictionary Status Report

When DECspell has finished  checking  a  document,  it  displays  some
statistics  for  each  personal  dictionary  to  which words have been
added.  These are:

      .  The number of words added

      .  The new total of words in the dictionary

The total number of words in the dictionary does not include any words
greater  than  32  characters  that  you  may  have  edited  into your
dictionary.



5.3.3  Lines With More Than 255 Characters5.3.3  Lines With More Than 255 Characters

DECspell does not support documents containing lines  of  text  longer
than 255 characters (that is, documents whose record length is greater
than 255 characters).  Personal  dictionaries,  however,  can  contain
lines of any length.

5.3.4  RUNOFF Support5.3.4  RUNOFF Support

DECspell does not highlight incorrect RUNOFF commands as errors.  This
means that:

      .  Incorrect RUNOFF commands will not be found

      .  If a  RUNOFF  command  without  a  terminating  semicolon  is
         incorrect,  DECspell  assumes that the whole line is a RUNOFF
         command.  Therefore, DECspell will not highlight  any  errors
         in the text on that line.

              INCORPORATING DECSPELL INTO ALL-IN-1 V1.3              INCORPORATING DECSPELL INTO ALL-IN-1 V1.3



A.1  The ProcedureA.1  The Procedure

You can use DECspell V1.1  from  ALL-IN-1  V1.3  or  V2.   Appendix  B
describes how to use DECspell from ALL-IN-1 V2.

You can set up DECspell to be accessed in the way you require.

Before you attempt to install DECspell into ALL-IN-1 V1.3  you  should
be  familiar  with  ALL-IN-1  and  have  read the ALL-IN-1 Application
Programmer's  Reference  Guide.   Also  make  yourself  familiar  with
DECspell.

If you install DECspell into ALL-IN-1 V1.3 in  the  way  described  in
this appendix it will be available from the SC option on the WP menu.

You should already have answered YES to the  following  prompt  during
the DECspell installation procedure (section 2.2, step 12):

   Do you require access to DECspell through ALL-IN-1 [YES]? 
        

This  means  that  the  ALL-IN-1  related  files,  LNGSPLSC1.COM   and
LNGSPLFRM.FLB,  have  been  copied  into SYS$UPDATE.  Now follow these
steps:

     1   Incorporate the DECspell personal dictionary  form  into  the
         ALL-IN-1 form library in the following way:

          -  Log into the ALL-IN-1 manager's account.

          -  Copy the files from SYS$UPDATE to the ALL-IN-1  directory
             using the following commands:

             $ COPY SYS$UPDATE:LNGSPLSC1.COM DEVICE:[DIRECTORY]

             $ COPY SYS$UPDATE:LNGSPLFRM.FLB DEVICE:[DIRECTORY]



                                 A-1
             where DEVICE:[DIRECTORY] is the location of ALL-IN-1.
























































                                 A-2
     2   Copy the form LNGSC1 in the form  library  LNGSPLFRM  to  the
         library of ALL-IN-1 forms in the following way:

          -  Run ALL-IN-1.

          -  At  the  ALL-IN-1  Main  Menu,  enter  FD.    The   Forms
             Development menu is displayed.

          -  Enter the CO option to copy a known form to another  form
             library.

          -  When the Extract and Copy a Form Definition form appears,
             enter the following information:

             Destination Form Library:  OALIB:OAFORM
             Form Name to Extract:  LNGSC1
             Source Form Library:  OALIB:LNGSPLFRM

             Do  NOT  enter  the  file  type  FLB   in   the   library
             specifications.   Press RETURN when complete and the form
             will be copied into the ALL-IN-1 library.


     3   Make  DECspell  accessible  as  an  ALL-IN-1  option  in  the
         following way:

          -  Return to the Forms Development menu.

          -  Type E to edit an existing form.

          -  When the Update Argument form appears type the following:

                 Form Name to Update:            WP
                 Form library containing form:   OALIB:OAFORM

          -  When the form appears enter EDIT at the  command  prompt.
             If  there  is  no  line describing the SC option, enter a
             line describing it.

          -  When you have finished editing return to command mode.


     4   Type NAME to create an entry in the name  table.   Enter  the
         following  line  in  the  table,  or if a line already exists
         change it to the following:

             Name    Data
             
             SC      COMMAND LNGSPLSC1/NODUMP

         If the name table is full the last line of the table will contain
         the name of the continuation form, for example: 


             Name     Data


                                 A-3

         described in step 4 above.

     9   When you have entered the line in the name  table  describing
         the SC option, press RETURN and type SAVE.

         DECspell will now be available for users.  However, any users
         currently  using  the system must log out and log in again to
         use this option.

    10   When you are sure that DECspell is installed  correctly  into
         ALL-IN-1,   delete   the   two   files,   LNGSPLSCI.COM   and
         LNGSPLFRM.FLB, in SYS$UPDATE.

B.1  The ProcedureB.1  The Procedure

Before you install DECspell into ALL-IN-1 V2, you should:

      .  Make yourself familiar with both DECspell and ALL-IN-1

      .  Make sure you have the following VMS  system  privileges  set
         up:

             . SYSPRV
             . EXQUOTA
             . PRMGBL
             . SYSGBL

         PRMGBL and SYSGBL are needed when you recompile and reinstall
         the OAFORM library in Step 5.

      .  Make sure you have the  ALL-IN-1  PRVCMD  privilege  set  up.
         This  is  needed  when you recompile and reinstall the TXL in
         Step 6.

      .  Make sure that no users are logged into ALL-IN-1.

                                    NOTE

                 If WPS-PLUS/ALL-IN-1 was already on your system 
                 when you installed DECspell, you must relink 
                 WPS-PLUS and ALL-IN-1 before continuing with this 
                 procedure.  Refer to the ALL-IN-1 Installation 
                 Guide for more details.


If you install DECspell into ALL-IN-1 in the  way  described  in  this
section  it  will  be  available  from the SC option on the WP and EMC
menus.  The Spelling Check Dictionary Menu will be available from  the
SCD  option on any ALL-IN-1 menu.  The option will be displayed on the
WP menu.


                                 B-1
You should already have answered YES to the  following  prompt  during
the DECspell installation procedure (section 2.2, step 12):

   Do you require access to DECspell through ALL-IN-1 [YES]?    

This means that the following files are copied into SYS$UPDATE:

                            NOTE

         The first two files (LNGSPLFRM.FLB and
         LNGSPLSC1.COM) are ALL-IN-1 V1.3 files, and are
         not needed for ALL-IN-1 V2.  Delete them if you 
         wish.

Now follow these steps:

     1   Run ALL-IN-1 from a system manager's account.

     2   At the System Manager Functions  menu,  enter  SCI  (Spelling
         Check  Install) to copy the ALL-IN-1 V2 files from SYS$UPDATE
         to the appropriate ALL-IN-1 library (OA$LIB:  or OA$DO:), and
         to update the ALL-IN-1 form and help libraries.

         The steps that  follow  explain  how  to  make  the  DECspell
         commands  visible  to the user.  You may need to refer to the
         ALL-IN-1 Application Programmer's Reference.

     3   Enter FD.  The Forms Development menu is displayed.

     4   Make an entry for DECspell  in  the  WP  (Word  and  Document

%LNGSPL-F-SORTWRKSET, Not enough working set space for SORT.  See your
system manager.

The sort facility in the formatter failed to get the  working  set  it
needed.

Increase the user's working set quota.  If the  quota  is  already  at
maximum, increase the maximum.


%LNGSPL-F-SORVIRMEM, Not enough virtual memory  for  SORT.   See  your
system manager.

The sort facility in the formatter failed to get the virtual memory it
needed.

DECREASE the user's working set quota to release more memory  for  the

The logical names for the sort facility  in  the  formatter  temporary
work  files, SORTWORK1, SORTWORK2, are pointing to unsuitable devices;
either to devices on another system, or to devices that are not random
access devices (disks).

Reassign these logical names to point to a random access device  on  a
system  from  which  you  wish to run the SPELL/FORMAT.  Alternatively
deassign these logical names, so that the sort creates temporary  work
files in your local directory.


%LNGSPL-F-SOREXTWRK, SORT could not extend work file.  See your system
manager.

The sort facility in the formatter  creates  two  work  files  on  the
device(s)  specified  by  the  logical names SORTWORK1, SORTWORK2.  If
these logicals are undefined, the work files are created in your login
directory.
