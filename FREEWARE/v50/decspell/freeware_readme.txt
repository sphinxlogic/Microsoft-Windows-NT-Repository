SPELL, UTILITIES, DECspell for OpenVMS Alpha

Unsupported DECspell kit for OpenVMS Alpha Systems

  This kit contains an unsupported kit and documentation that provides
  DECspell for OpenVMS Alpha systems -- this is a port of the former
  DECspell kit for OpenVMS VAX, a package that is itself no longer 
  supported.  This port looks and works similar to the VAX kit.

  Installation instructions (in HTML form) are in:

    DECSPELL_INSTALL.HTML

  The product installation kit (installed via VMSINSTAL) is:

    SPLAXP015.A

  Limitations:

     o The Houghton-Mifflin copyrights...

     o There is absolutely no support for this...

     o If this does not work, you are entirely on your own...

  FTP Warning:

    When a BACKUP saveset kit is transfered via FTP, you may (will?) 
    need to reset the OpenVMS file attributes via a tool such as:

      RESET_BACKUP_SAVESET_ATTRIBUTES.COM

    This tool is available on the OpenVMS Freeware distribution.
