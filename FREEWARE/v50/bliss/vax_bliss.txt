   A new version of the BLISS-32 compiler is now available.  This
   version, BLISS-32 V4.7-999, includes new features for compatibility
   with MIPS and Alpha dialects.

                                    NOTE

           The format of BLISS library files has changed.
           Library files compiled with this version of BLISS-32
           cannot be used with prior versions of the compiler,
           but old library files can be used with this version.





                        HOW TO INSTALL BLISS-32 V4.7


   This describes the installation procedures for the VAX-11
   Bliss-32 Version 4.7 compiler.  You should read this
   completely before beginning the installation.



   4.1  INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

   To install Bliss-32, proceed as follows:

   1.  Log in under the privileged system manager's account.  Since this
       installation procedure will recompile STARLET.REQ and LIB.REQ (if
       present in [SYSLIB]), this account should have a large working-set
       limit (500 to 1000 pages is recommended) to insure that the
       installation proceeds quickly.

       Issue the command:

       $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL BLS32047 <location of kit>

       (To install in a system root other than the root of the running
       system, you can use the following alternative command:

       $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL BLS32047 <location of kit> OPTIONS R <root>

       where <root> specifies the alternate system root in the format
       "__ddcu:[SYSn.]".)

                                      NOTE

               You should have at least 5000 free blocks on your
               system disk device before beginning the
               installation procedure.



   2.  If there are other users on the system, or you have DECnet
       running, VMSINSTAL will warn you and ask if you want to continue
       with the installation.  DECnet should not cause any problems.  It
       is slightly safer to install when you have the system to yourself,
       but other users on the system normally will not cause problems.

       VMSINSTAL will also ask if you are satisfied with the backup of
       your system disk.  It is always a good idea to have a current
       system disk backup before performing an installation.  VMSINSTAL
       will then report:


   The following products will be processed:

           Product:      BLISS32
           Producer:     DEC

           Release Date: 3-OCT-1989


   * Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded?

   If you respond "NO" the installation continues:

   %BLS32-W-NOLICENSE, License not registered.  Installation will continue.

                   After your BLISS-32 license has been registered,
                   compile the system require files and run the IVP.

                   To compile the system require files:

                           $ SET DEFAULT SYS$LIBRARY
                           $ BLISS/LIBRARY STARLET
                           $ BLISS/LIBRARY=LIB STARLET+LIB
                           $ BLISS/LIBRARY TPAMAC

                   To run the IVP:

                           $ @SYS$TEST:BLISS32$IVP



   The installation continues:

   %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set B ...

   * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]?

           This kit contains a  file  summarizing the new features, changes,
           restrictions,  and  compatibility issues  in this release of  VAX
           BLISS-32.  This file is named  BLS32047.RELEASE_NOTES and will be
           placed in SYS$HELP:.

           The  release notes  contains information valuable to VAX BLISS-32
           programmers.   Please  inform  your  VAX  BLISS-32  users of this
           file's existence.

           The BLISS help file contains extensive documentation on the BLISS
           language.  Since this material  requires about 525 blocks of disk
           space, its inclusion is optional.

   * Do you want the long help file [YES]?

           All questions regarding the installation have now been asked.
           The system directories will now be updated.

   %BLS32-I-LIBBUILD, Building the precompiled libraries

           This phase of the installation process compiles the STARLET, LIB,
           and TPAMAC L32 files.  The corresponding REQ  files  are expected
           to  be  in  SYS$LIBRARY.   If one is missing,  you will receive a
           warning message and that library file will not be created.   This
           will not interfere with the rest of the installation.

   %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system disk directory
     VMI$ROOT:[SYSTEST.BLS32].
