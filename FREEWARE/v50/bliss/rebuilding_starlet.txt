$! To rebuild the STARLET and LIB libraries required by Bliss -- a rebuild 
$! is typically required after installing Bliss a system or after upgrading 
$! OpenVMS when Bliss is installed -- use the following commands:
$!
$ BLISS SYS$LIBRARY:STARLET.REQ /LIBR=SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]STARLET.L32
$ BLISS SYS$LIBRARY:STARLET.REQ+LIB.REQ /LIBR=SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]LIB.L32
$!
$! You will likely see (benign) informational messages, such as the 
$! following example:
$!
$!   literal PRV$M_IMPORT = %X'1000000000';
$!   .........................^
$!   %BLS32-I-TEXT, Numeric literal overflow
$!   at line number 15107 in file SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]STARLET.REQ;1
$!
$! This particular example indicates that a thirty-two bit Bliss compiler 
$! has just encountered a 64-bit constant.  You won't be able to reference 
$! PRV$M_IMPORT because of this, but the results of the library rebuild 
$! will otherwise function entirely as expected.
