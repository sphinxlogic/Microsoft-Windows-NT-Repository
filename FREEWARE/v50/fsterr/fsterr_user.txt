              released version of FSTerr.

              o Support for OpenVMS V7.1-2 for Alpha and OpenVMS V7.2

                OpenVMS V7.1-2 for Alpha and OpenVMS V7.2 significantly
                changed the internal format of the error log file, requiring
                significant changes to FSTerr.

                While the changes to FSTerr were substantial, much effort
                has been made to permit FSTerr to continue to read error
                log files from VMS V4.0 and later, for both Alpha and VAX
                versions

                While reading the new file format, FSTerr disallows the
                writing of these records into a binary output file. If
                FSTerr is writing error log entries to a binary error log
                file, and it starts reading from an error log file of the
                new format, FSTerr will display a warning message, con-
                tinue processing the input error log file and will not write
                records to the output binary error log file. However, at the
                end of the new format input error log file, FSTerr will re-
                sume writing error log records starting with the next input
                error log file.

              o Fixed ACCVIO on Alpha

                While attempting to determine the file type, FSTerr would
                crash with an ACCVIO. This was due to a known bug in the DEC
                Fortran RTL on Alpha. The bug has been worked around.

              o Changed Alpha version to say "Alpha"

                When FSTerr first started supporting Alpha systems, they
                were known as "AXP". They're now known as "Alpha".

              o Fixed problem introduced during the large packet handling
                changes that prevented the FST_SCSNAMES.DATA file from being
                opened.

              o Again, fixed Alpha file handling problems

                The routine the determines the type of error log file (old
                style, before VMS V7.1-2 vs. the new style) now directly
                calls RMS to determine the file type information, rather
                than the Fortran INQUIRE statement. Hopefully this finally
                fixes the Alpha and new-style files problem! The Fortran

                                                                          vii

 





          New Features and Changes for FSTerr V4.2


                INQUIRE statement problem is a bug that has been reported to
                the Fortran people.

              o Worked around compiler bug on Alpha

                The routine that reads records from old style error log file
                would return no data for the first record read from a file,
                and would intermittently return incorrect data on subsequent
                reads. The Language Support Team at the Customer Support
                Center provided a workaround for this problem until the next
                version of the compiler is released.

              o Updated HSJxx and HSDxx error code descriptions

                Error code descriptions for HSXXX, HSX00 and HST00 report
                formats have been updated to those in the V3.4 and V5.4
                HSJxx and HSDxx firmware distributions.

              o Forced error flag for HSX00 devices added

                When a forced error flag results from a bad block replace-
                ment, FSTerr now indicates this for HSX00 devices. The for-
                mat is the same as for the RAXX device report: an 'f' is
                added next to the MSCP Event field.

          New Features and Changes for FSTerr V4.1-4



              Below is a list of new features, things that have changed,
              and known problems that have been fixed from the previously
              released version of FSTerr.

              o Changed input buffer size to 65535

                Newer systems now record much larger error log packets than
                previously versions of FSTerr would allow. This version
                increases the input buffer size to accomodate these larger
                error log packets.

              and known problems that have been fixed from the previously
              released version of FSTerr.

              o Added SCS node names file

                Previously, for HSXXX type of reports, FSTerr would only
                report the controller serial number to identify the HSXXX
                device. Now, FSTerr will look up the controller serial num-
                ber in a user supplied file and get the device node name.
                See Chapter 2 for the name and format of this file.

          New Features and Changes for V4.1-1



              Below is a list of new features, things that have changed,
              and known problems that have been fixed from the previously
              released version of FSTerr.

              o Fixed HST00 report on HSC-based tape devices

                On older versions of HSC software, the device type indi-
                cated in the error log entry was just "HST00". So, FSTerr
                would just scan for that. On newer versions of HSC software,
                the device type now indicates what type of tape drive is
                reporting the error.

                This version of FSTerr now scans for both the "HST00" device
                type, as well as a list of devices that are supported on the
                HSC K.scsi requestor.

              o Added more SCSI devices to internal tables

                VMS V6.2 now supports more SCSI devices, and FSTerr has
                added these devices to its internal tables.

              o Added "forced error flag" to HSX00 report

                Add the 'f' that indicates a bad block replacement attempt
                resulted in a forced error flag for the block. This is simi-
                lar to the flag in the RAXX report.

          New Features and Changes for FSTerr V4.1



              Below is a list of new features, things that have changed,
              and known problems that have been fixed from the previously
              released version of FSTerr.

              o FSTerr now runs on Alpha/AXP systems!

                This is the first version of FSTerr to be ported to
                Alpha/AXP systems. This version is identical to the VAX
                version in report layouts and commands accepted.

                The installation kit contains both the VAX and the AXP ver-
                sion. The installation procedure will auto-detect the system
                type and build the correct program for the system on which
                the kit was installed.

              o Added support for OpenVMS V6.1

                FSTerr now supports error log files created on both VAX and
                AXP systems up to VMS V6.1. Either version, VAX or AXP, can
                report from error log files created on either system type.
                For example, the VAX version can report from error log files
                created on either VAX or AXP systems. Likewise, the AXP
                version can report from error log files created on either
                system.

              o Fixed RZXX report

                Fixed a bug that prevented some RZ28 and newer disk type
                from being found and reported.

              o Fixed decode counts

                Fixed a bug where the decoding section of a report would
                show counts for MSCP events that where not listed in the
                error log entry section of the report. This problem was only
                seen on HSX00, HST00 and HSXXX device types.

              o Fixed report header misplacement

                Fixed a cosmetic error on the report header for the HST00
                device error report. The device locator field header did not
                line up with the report information.




                                                                           xv

          New Features and Changes for V4.0-3



              Below is a list of new features, things that have changed,
              and known problems that have been fixed from FSTerr V4.0-2 to
              FSTerr V4.0-3.

              o Added HSD05 support

                FSTerr now locates and displays error log entries that are
                logged by HSD05 controllers.

                The HSD05 controller works differently, and the amount and
                type of error log data is significantly different than that
                logged by other HSD/HSJ controllers. None of the report
                headers were changed for the HSD05, but the format of data
                on a report line is different for this controller. The de-
                tails can be found in the section of the user manual that
                lists the report formats.

              o Fixed RZXX report

                Fixed a bug that prevented some RZ28 and newer disk type
                from being found and reported.

          New Features and Changes for V4.0-2



              Below is a list of new features, things that have changed,
              and known problems that have been fixed from FSTerr V4.0-1 to
              FSTerr V4.0-2.

              o Filled out report displays

                On the HSX00 (MSCP served SCSI disks), the HST00 (MSCP
                served SCSI tapes) and the HSXXX (MSCP controller of
                SCSI devices), the report display has been filled out.
                Previously, not all information available was displayed.

              o Rearranged HSX00, HST00 and HSXXX report formats

                The various fields in these reports have been rearranged to
                allow keeping the device locator field in the same place on
                all the reports.

              o HSXXX report displays controller serial number

                Previously, the HSXXX report would not indicate which HSxnn
                controller was reporting the error. Now the "Drive name"
                field is replaced by "Controller Serial Number" field. This
                is the serial number of the HSxnn controller module. The se-
                rial number can be obtained with the SHOW CONTROLLER command
                on the controller itself.

              o HSX00, HST00 and HSXXX reports find more entries

                Previously, these reports would intermittently miss some
                entries. This has been corrected, so that all entries of the
                specified device type are displayed properly.















                                                                          xix

          New Features and Changes for V4.0-1



              Below is a list of new features, things that have changed, and
              known problems that have been fixed from FSTerr V4.0 to FSTerr
              V4.0-1.

              o Fixed problem displaying HST00 entries

                Previously, FSTerr would intermittently fail to display
                HST00 device entries. This has been corrected.

              o Added K.scsi support for HST00 tape device entries

                FSTerr now displays entries logged by HST00 devices served
                by HSC controllers with K.scsi requestors.

                The HST00 is a pseudoname for SCSI tape devices served by
                an MSCP server. Such servers include StorageWorks (FIB)
                controllers and HSC controllers with K.scsi requestors.

              o Added /DECODE support for SCSI sense key values

                FSTerr now counts and decodes SCSI sense key values for
                those report types that include SCSI sense keys.

              o Fixed packet code display for TA/TF 85/86 error displays

                Previously, FSTerr would intermittently display '**' for the
                packet code. This has been corrected so that FSTerr always
                display the packet code value.

          New Features and Changes for V4.0



              Below is a list of new features, things that have changed,
              and known problems that have been fixed from FSTerr V3.9-2 to
              FSTerr V4.0.

              o Changed command line format

                Previously, the command line to run FSTerr was:

                        $ FSTERR/DEVICE_NAME=device-name [errorlog-file]

                If you didn't specify device-name, FSTerr would supply a
                default of RAXX to display errors on RAxx disks.

                The new command line format is:

                        $ FSTERR device-name [errorlog-file]

                Now, there is no default for device-name. It must be speci-
                fied on the command line.

                If the command line format is incorrect, or the device name
                is not recognized, FSTerr issues an error message and dis-
                plays a help screen. This help screen shows how to define
                the FSTerr command verb and how to specify the command line.
                The help screen also lists all the device names that FSTerr
                recognizes.

              o Added ESE50 device support

                The ESE50 device name may be used to display events relating
                to the ESE52, ESE56 and ESE58.

              o Added StorageWorks device and controller support This re-
                lease supports the HSX00, HST00 and HSJ40 devices and con-
                trollers.

                The HSX00 is a pseudoname for SCSI disks served by an MSCP
                server. Such servers include StorageWorks (FIB) controllers
                and HSC controllers with K.scsi requestors.

                The HST00 is a pseudoname for SCSI tapes served by an MSCP
                server. Such servers include StorageWorks (FIB) controllers.

                The HSJ40 is a StorageWorks controller that serves SCSI
                disks to hosts on a CI bus.

              o Improved user manual

                Starting with this version, the Guide to FSTerr will be
                available in PostScript format and in text format. If you
                have access to a PostScript printer, this format is pre-
                ferred, as it is easier to read and uses less paper.

                                                                        xxiii

 





          New Features and Changes for V4.0


                Each device name that FSTerr recognizes is listed separately
                in an appendix, along with a brief description of the device
                to which the device name refers. Each device name also lists
                the available sort types and user types that the device name
                supports.

              o Fixed RFXX display

                In previous versions, the RFXX device type would intermit-
                tently attempt to use RA92 disk entries.

                In previous versions, the RFXX device type would intermit-
                tently not find some RFXX device entries.

                Both of these problems have been corrected in this version.

              o TF85/86, TA85/86 display format changed slightly

                The display format for the statistics display for these de-
                vices has changed slightly. The "blocks written" and "blocks
                read" fields now display up to 9999 blocks before switching
                to 'nnnK' format.

              o TZXX display now includes tape volume label

                The TZXX display format has changed to now include the tape
                volume label, if tape volume information is present in the
                error log file.

              o RZXX display header changed

                The column headers for the RZXX display have been changed to
                make them easier to read.

              o Changed INVPAGE message text

              o Older device support removed

                The following devices are no longer supported:

                o  RDXX series disks

                o  MASSbus disks and tapes (RPXX, RMXX, TU78, TE16, TU45,
                   TU77)

                o  Unibus and Q-bus based tapes (TS05, TSV05, TS11, TU80)

          OVERVIEW



              FSTerr is a tool that Digital Customer Services engineers and
              technicians can use to assist in troubleshooting failures in
              disk and tape drives connected to VMS and OpenVMS systems.

              All reports consist of one line containing the drive name, the
              date and time of the error, the record number within the error
              log, and various device specific information. The report may
              optionally contain a decoding of several error codes presented,
              along with the count of each error code.

              Some devices provide statistics, which may indicate the opera-
              tional health of the device. FSTerr can provide these statis-
              tics as one of its various report formats.

              You can specify which error log entries that FSTerr processes
              by specifying selection parameters, including:

              o Device type.

              o Unit number.

              o Starting time.

              o Ending time.

              By default, all output is sent to SYS$OUTPUT (which is normally
              your terminal), but the output may be redirected to a disk file
              with the /OUTPUT qualifier. When using the /DECODE qualifier,
              the decoding output is normally appended to the rest of the
              report, but it may be redirected to another disk file.

              FSTerr is normally used to generate reports from the system er-
              ror log file, usually SYS$ERRORLOG:ERRLOG.SYS. However, FSTerr
              can examine any valid error log file by supplying the name(s)
              of the file(s) when FSTerr is invoked. FSTerr allows sharing
              of the input file so that it is not necessary to rename the
              current error log file before invoking FSTerr.

                                                                OVERVIEW  1-1

 








              All FSTerr reports are 80 columns wide. Some formats do not use
              the full 80 columns, however.

          SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS




          2.1  System version requirements

              FSTerr will work on VMS version 4.0 or later.

          2.2  Privilege requirements

              You must have sufficient privilege to read the error log
              file(s). It is not necessary to rename the error log file from
              ERRLOG.SYS to ERRLOG.OLD before using FSTerr. Also, you must
              have sufficient privilege to write the output file(s). The
              FIELD or SYSTEM accounts generally have sufficient privilege
              to read and write the various files. If your account is able
              to run the ANALYZE/ERROR_LOG command, it should have sufficient
              privilege and quotas needed to run FSTerr.


          2.3  Terminal requirements

              There are no requirements for a specific type of terminal
              to use FSTerr. If you have an ANSI-compatible terminal (all
              Digital terminals since the VT100 are ANSI compatible), you may
              use the /PAGE qualifier to cause FSTerr to display its output
              one screenful at a time.

          2.4  SCS node names file

              This file is not required to run FSTerr. However, when display-
              ing HSXXX-type entries, the node name of the controller is not
              available to FSTerr. Instead, the controller serial number is
              display to identify the HSXXX controller. If an SCS node names
              file is present, FSTerr will search it for the controller's se-
              rial number, and if found will display the node name instead of
              the serial number. If the file does not exist, FSTerr displays
              an informational message and continues.



                                                     SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  2-1

 








              The filename is MAINT$TOOLS:FST_SCSNAMES.DATA and the format of
              the lines of text are:

              nodename1,serial_number1
              nodename2,serial_number2
                 .
                 .
                 .

              For example, on one particular cluster, the file looks like:

              HSJ111,0000953711329
              HSJ110,0000953911481
              HSJ109,0000954111617
              HSJ108,0000954111750
              HSJ113,0000961700811

              You can get the controller serial number from a FSTerr re-
              port. Then associate the serial number with a controller by
              issuing the SHOW THIS_CONTROLLER command at the console of the
              controller.

          USING FSTerr




          3.1  INVOKING

              Before using FSTerr, you must first do two things:

              o Create MAINT$TOOLS logical name.

              o Create FSTerr DCL symbol.

              MAINT$TOOLS is a logical name that translates to the name of
              a device:[directory] where the FSTerr program and its other
              files are located. This logical name is usually defined for you
              when you install FSTerr in the FSTERR_INIT.COM command proce-
              dure. FSTERR_INIT.COM is created for you by the installation
              procedure.

              You must also define a DCL symbol that invokes FSTerr. This
              symbol is also created for you by FSTERR_INIT.COM. The easiest
              way to define this symbol is:

              $ FST*ERR == "$Maint$Tools:FSTerr.EXE"

              Note there are two dollar signs ('$') in the definition.

              You should either add the commands from FSTERR_INIT.COM to your
              login command file, or the login command file can invoke the
              FSTERR_INIT.COM.

              FSTerr is invoked by entering a DCL command line:

              $ FSTERR device-type [file-spec] [/qualifier(s)]

              You must supply a device name. The input (error log) file-
              name, and the qualifiers are optional. See Chapter 4 for more
              details.



                                                            USING FSTerr  3-1

 








          3.2  EXITING

              FSTerr will exit when it has reached the end of the error log
              file it is processing. It can be stopped prematurely by typing
              ^Y (Control-Y) while it is running. FSTerr can also be exited
              by typing ^Z (Control-Z) at any input prompt, including the
              prompt that occurs after each page while in paging mode.


          3.3  DIRECTING OUTPUT

              Normally, FSTerr writes all of its output to SYS$OUTPUT, which
              is normally your terminal. Output may be redirected to another
              file with the /OUTPUT qualifier. Error code decoding output
              may be redirected to yet another file by specifying a file
              name with the /DECODE qualifier. In order to use the /PAGE
              qualifier, the output file must be an ANSI compatible video
              terminal (VT1xx, VT2xx, VT3xx, etc), and you cannot use a file
              name with the /DECODE qualifier.

              Appendix A for a complete list of device names and devices
              supported by this version of FSTerr.

              [file-spec[,...]]
              Specifies the file(s) containing binary error log information
              to be processed by FSTerr. You may supply a list of filenames
              (separated by commas), a wildcard file specification, or a
              combination of both.

              If you don't supply the file specification, the FSTerr will use
              the current error log file, SYS$ERRORLOG:ERRLOG.SYS.

              [/qualifier(s)]
              Specifies any special functions that FSTerr should perform.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          /BEFORE

              The /BEFORE qualifier is used to specify that only those en-
              tries dated earlier than the stated date and time are to be
              selected for the report.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Format

              /BEFORE=date-time

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Parameters

              date-time
              Limits the error report to those entries dated earlier than the
              specified time.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              You can specify an absolute time, a delta time, or a combi-
              nation of absolute and delta times. See the VMS DCL Concepts
              Manual for details on specifying times.

              If you omit the /BEFORE qualifier, or specify /BEFORE without
              a date or time, all entries will be processed until the end of
              the error log file.

          Examples

              1. $  FSTERR RAXX/BEFORE=12-FEB-1988:10:00

                The FSTerr report generated from the default input file
                SYS$ERRORLOG:ERRLOG.SYS will contain entries from RAXX de-
                vices that were logged before 10:00 on 12-FEB-1988

          ___________________________________________________________________

          /BINARY

              The /BINARY qualifier is used to specify that FSTerr should
              save all the error log entries that it printed in its report in
              a binary form.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Format

              /BINARY  [=file-spec]

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Parameters

              file-spec
              The file to which FSTerr should write binary records that it
              printed in its report.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              Occasionally, the information that FSTerr provides may not
              provide sufficient information to fully describe an error log
              entry. The /BINARY qualifier tells FSTerr that for each error
              log entry that it reports, it should also write a file contain-
              ing the binary information from the original error log input
              file. This file can be examined using the standard VMS command,
              ANALYZE/ERROR, or by FSTerr. In addition, FSTerr will write all
              MOUNT and DISMOUNT records to the binary output file. This is
              needed for volume label tracking.

              If you don't specify a filename with the /BINARY qualifier,
              FSTerr will write the binary records to the name "FSTERR.BIN"
              in the current directory.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Examples

              1. $  FSTERR RAXX/BINARY=RAXX_ERR.BIN

                This example invokes FSTerr to report on RAXX errors, and to
                write a file containing the binary information that can be
                analyzed later by the ANALYZE/ERROR command.

          /DECODE


          ___________________________________________________________________

          /DECODE

              The /DECODE qualifier is used to specify that FSTerr should
              attempt to decode error codes.

          Parameters

              file-spec
              The output file selected to write error code counts and decod-
              ing.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              The /DECODE qualifier tells FSTerr that it should attempt to
              decode any error codes. Various types of error codes, such
              as MSCP event codes, disk drive fault codes, etc., along with
              the descriptions and counts are listed. If the device type
              specified does not have error codes that can be decoded, there
              will be no decoding file written.

              If you don't specify a filename with the /DECODE qualifier,
              the decoding information will be appended to the normal out-
              put file. The default output file is SYS$OUTPUT (normally,
              your terminal). You may use the /OUTPUT qualifier to specify a
              different output file.

              If you specify a filename with the /DECODE qualifier, the de-
              coding information will be written to that file. This file is
              usually different than the normal output file.

          Examples

              1. $  FSTERR RAXX/DECODE

                This example invokes FSTerr to report on RAXX errors, and
                that all MSCP event codes and RAXX LED fault codes should be
                decoded and appended to the report.

              2. $  FSTERR RAXX/UNIT=5/OUTPUT=NLA0:/DECODE=SYS$OUTPUT

                This example invokes FSTerr to report on RAXX errors, unit
                5. The normal FSTerr report is written to the null device
                (NLA0:) and effectively discarded. The decoding information
                is written to SYS$OUTPUT (normally, your terminal). The
                result is that the only thing displayed is the decoding
                output showing the types of error codes seen, the counts of
                those error codes and the description of the error codes.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          /HEADER

              The /HEADER qualifier is used to specify whether FSTerr should
              display a column header on the report.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Format

              /HEADER (default)

              /NOHEADER

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              The /[NO]HEADER qualifier is used to tell FSTerr whether it
              should print a column header on the report.

              When preparing a report that will later be sorted, it makes for
              a better looking report if the header is not sorted into the
              report, as it may appear anywhere in the report after sorting.
              Note that there is a /SORT qualifier that can be used to sort
              entries in a variety of formats. Therefore, external sorting
              may not be needed.

              The default is /HEADER to print the column headers.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Examples

              1. $  FSTERR RAXX/NOHEADER/OUTPUT=RAXX_ERR.RPT

                This example invokes FSTerr to report on RAXX errors, write
                the report to the file RAXX_ERR.RPT and that FSTerr should
                not print headers on the output file. Apparently the result-
                ing report is going to be sorted later.

          Description

              The /LOG qualifier controls where FSTerr will send informa-
              tional messages to SYS$OUTPUT when it reaches the end of the
              input file. These messages will list the number of records that
              FSTerr read from the input file(s), and the number of records
              that FSTerr wrote to the output file.

              The default is /NOLOG.

          Parameters

              file-spec
              The output file selected to write FSTerr's report.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              The /OUTPUT qualifier tells FSTerr where to send its report.
              By default, FSTerr will send its report to SYS$OUTPUT, which is
              normally your terminal. However, you can redirect the output to
              a file for later analysis.

              If you don't specify a filename with /OUTPUT, FSTerr will write
              its report to the filename FSTERR.LIS in the current directory.

              If you use the /DECODE qualfier without specifying a filename,
              the decoding information will be added to the end of the report
              file.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          /PAGE

              The /PAGE qualifier specifies whether FSTerr should paginate
              its output to suit the output device.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              The /[NO]PAGE qualifier is used to tell FSTerr whether it
              should define a scrolling area on a video terminal, and control
              the number of lines written to the terminal. If you specify
              /PAGE, FSTerr will define a scrolling area on your video ter-
              minal, and only write enough lines to fill the screen. When
              the screen is filled, FSTerr will prompt to continue with the
              output.

              This qualifier cannot be used when running FSTerr in a batch
              job, or when the output device is not an ANSI compatible video
              terminal. In those cases, FSTerr will display an error message
              and disable paging.

                the report to SYS$OUTPUT (normally your terminal), and that
                FSTerr should paginate its output. After each screenful
                of error text, you must press the RETURN or ENTER key to
                continue.

          Parameters

              ERRORS (default)
              ERRORS specifies that FSTerr should generate a report contain-
              ing only device errors. This is the default.

              STATISTICS
              STATISTICS specifies that FSTerr should generate a report con-
              taining only statistics entries. You must also specify a device
              type that supplies statistics error log entries. See Appendix A
              for those device types that supply statistics error log en-
              tries.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              Some devices maintain performance or error counters which are
              written to the system error log either periodically, at volume
              unloads, or when a counter overflows. These counters can be
              useful indicators of the health of the device, or the condition
              of tape media. See the service manual for the specific device
              type for details on interpreting these counters.

              If you omit the /REPORT_TYPE qualifier, FSTerr will display
              only device errors for the device type that you have specified.

              If you specify /REPORT_TYPE=STATISTICS for a device that does
              not supply statistics entries, FSTerr will display an error
              message and continue to provide an error report.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          /SERIAL_TYPE

              The /SERIAL_TYPE qualifier specifies which serial number FSTerr
              should display for those devices that provide a drive and vol-
              ume serial number.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Format

              /SERIAL_TYPE=serial-type

              There are 3 serial types that may be specified:

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Parameters

              AUTO (default)
              AUTO specifies that FSTerr should automatically determine which
              serial number to display. For the RA60, RA70, RA71, RA72 and
              RA73 devices, FSTerr will display the volume serial number. For
              all other RAXX devices, FSTerr will display the drive serial
              number. In either case, FSTerr will display a 'V' (for volume)
              or 'D' (for drive) next to the last 5 digits of the serial
              number. This is the default value.

              DRIVE
              DRIVE specifies that FSTerr display only the drive serial num-
              ber. Using this qualifier value will cause FSTerr to display
              the last 6 digits of the drive serial number.

              VOLUME
              VOLUME specifies that FSTerr display only the volume serial
              number. Using this qualifier value will cause FSTerr to display
              the last 6 digits of the volume serial number.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              Currently, only the RAXX devices provide both serial numbers.
              This qualifier is ignored on all other devices.

              If you omit the /SERIAL_TYPE qualifier, FSTerr will automati-
              cally select which serial number to display, as if you had used
              /SERIAL_TYPE=AUTO.

              The /SINCE qualifier specifies that only those entries dated
              earlier than the stated date-time be selected for the FSTerr
              report.

          Parameters

              date-time
              Limits the error report to those entries dated later than the
              specified time.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              You can specify an absolute time, a delta time, or a combi-
              nation of absolute and delta times. See the VMS DCL Concepts
              Manual for details on specifying times.

              If you omit the /SINCE qualifier, all entries will be processed
              starting from the beginning of the error log file.

              If you specify /SINCE without a date or time, or /SINCE=TODAY,
              only those entries dated since midnight today will be pro-
              cessed.

          /SORT

              The /SORT qualifier specifies that FSTerr should sort entries
              based on the value keyword.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Format

              /SORT=sort-type

              There are several sort types available. Not all sort types may
              be used with all devices. See Appendix A for the sort types
              that may be used with the various device types.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Parameters

              SEQUENTIAL
              SEQUENTIAL sorts on the date/time and the entry number. This
              is useful when reporting from multiple input files. Instead of
              the entries being listed as they are read from each input file,
              they are sorted according to the date/time that the errors
              occured.

              PHYSICAL
              PHYSICAL sorts on the device name and the date/time. This
              groups the entries according to the device name, and then by
              the date/time within each device name.

              GEOGRAPHIC
              GEOGRAPHIC sorts on the device name, the physical cylinder,
              the physical head and the physical sector. This is useful for
              finding media problems with disks. This keyword may only be
              used for most disk entries.

              VOLUME
              VOLUME sorts on the volume label, the device name and the date
              and time. This sort type is useful in finding problems with
              certain tapes. This keyword may only be used for most tape
              entries.

              SERIAL_NUMBER
              SERIAL_NUMBER sorts disk error reports on the serial number
              field. This helps in locating disks whose unit numbers have
              been changed during the error log reporting period.

          /SORT

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              If you omit the /SORT qualifier, all entries will be processed
              in the order that they are read from the input file(s).

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Examples

              1. $  FSTERR RAXX/SORT=GEOGRAPHIC

                The FSTerr report generated from the default input file
                SYS$ERRORLOG:ERRLOG.SYS will contain RAXX entries that are
                sorted according to the device type and to the physical
                location of any data errors on the disk media.

              2. $  FSTERR TA78/SORT=PHYSICAL ERRLOG.OLD

                The FSTerr report generated from the input file ERRLOG.OLD
                will contain TA78/TA79 entries sorted by device type and
                date/time.

              3. $  FSTERR TA78/SORT=VOLUME

                The FSTerr report generated from the default input file
                SYS$ERRORLOG:ERRLOG.SYS will contain TA78/TA79 entries that
                are sorted according to the volume label. Tape entries that
                have no volume label (for example, those tape having errors
                while being initialized) will be listed first.

              through 4094 are valid.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              The /UNIT_NUMBER qualifier is used to tell FSTerr to limit its
              report to just the specified unit number(s).

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Examples

              1. $  FSTERR TA78/UNIT_NUMBER=5

                The FSTerr report generated from the default input file
                SYS$ERRORLOG:ERRLOG.SYS will contain entries from the TA78
                tape drive whose unit number is 5.

              2. $  FSTERR RAXX/UNIT_NUMBER=(14,15,19) ERRLOG.OLD

                The FSTerr report generated from the specified input file
                ERRLOG.OLD will contain entries that were logged against
                RAXX disk drives with unit numbers 14, 15 and 19.

          Format

              /USER_TYPE=user-type

              FSTerr support 2 user types. They are listed below.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Parameters

              FIELD_SERVICE (default)
              FIELD_SERVICE specifies that FSTerr should display information
              from the error log entry appropriate to Field Service use.

              This is the default.

              ENGINEERING
              ENGINEERING specifies that FSTerr should display information
              from the error log entry appropriate to use by engineering.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Description

              Causes FSTerr to modify displays to suit the user running
              FSTerr.

              This qualifier is primarily meant for use by engineering groups
              during product development and debugging. It modifies some
              reports to provide information more appropriate to engineering
              users. Normally, it is not used by Customer Services personnel.

          ___________________________________________________________________

          Examples

              1. $  FSTERR TA78/USER=FIELD_SERVICE

          Field Descriptions

              1 Drive Name

                This is the name of the device that had an error, or that
                caused the error log event to be logged. It is of the form
                "ssssss$dddnnn". "ssssss" is the SCS name of the controller
                or serving system. For HSC based devices, this is the name
                of the HSC controller. "ddd" is the name of the device, and
                "nnn" is the unit number of the device.

                Note that there are only 3 digits in "nnn". If the unit
                number is greater than 999, then unit number field will grow
                into the device name field. Therefore, if an RA90's unit
                number is 1234, then the drive name will be displayed as
                "DU1234", instead of "DUA1234". This may cause confusion
                if, for example, a system has 2 KDB50 disk controllers and
                each controller has an RA90 with a unit number of 1234.
                The drives would be named DUA1234 and DUB1234, but FSTerr
                would display them as DU1234, causing the controller letter
                (the 'A' and 'B') to be overwritten. If this should happen,
                FSTerr will display an asterisk ('*') next to the drive
                name to note that the unit number was greater than 999,
                and that the controller letter has been overwritten. This
                type of configuration should be avoided, anyway, to prevent
                confusion in other areas. Ideally, drive unit numbers should
                all be unique, anyway.

                If the report type is HSXXX, then this field becomes the
                "Controller Serial Number". If an SCS names file is present,
                then the values in this field will either be the con-
                troller's serial number, or if the serial number can be
                found in the SCS names file, then the controller type and
                controller's SCS node name will be displayed. The serial
                number of the controller is obtained from the MSLG$Q_CNT_ID

                field of the error log entry. See Chapter 2 for information
                on setting up a SCS names data file.

                This is the only way to distinguish between multiple con-
                trollers that a system may be using.

                If the report type is HSXXX, and the entry being displayed
                is from an HSD05 controller, then the value displayed will
                be the name of the device being accessed when the event
                occurred. The string before the '$' is the SCS node name of
                the HSD05 controller.

              2 Date/Time

                This is the date and time that the error was logged. It
                is in this strange format to make it easier for you (and
                FSTerr) to sort entries based on their date and time.

              3 Entry number

                The error log file consists of a series of records, start-
                ing with record number 1. This field displays the record
                number of each entry. The entry number can be used in
                an ANALZYE/ERROR/ENTRIES=(START:ssss,END:eeee) command.
                Occasionally, FSTerr will not be able to display some needed
                information, which only the ANA/ERR command can display.
                Therefore, if you have the entry number (or numbers), you
                can get ANA/ERR to display just those record numbers spec-
                ified. See the help for ANA/ERR/ENTR for addition infor-
                mation. To the left of the entry number is a file number.
                FSTerr allows the user to specify a list of files to report
                errors from. The file number indicates from which file this
                error log entry came. The first file is file 'a', the second
                file is file 'b', and so on, up to the 26th file 'z'.

          Field Descriptions

              1 MSCP_Evnt

                This is the MSCP Event code that caused the error to be
                logged. If the event that caused the error to be logged was
                some type of bad block replacement event, and if the bad
                block replacement resulted in a "Forced error flag" in the
                replaced block, the letter 'f' appears next to the event
                code. FSTerr does not attempt to process all types of events
                seen. If FSTerr sees an unsupported type of event, the MSCP
                event code will be replaced by question marks '????'. This
                event will require further inspection using ANALYZE/ERROR.

                The MSCP event codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              2 LED

                This is the LED code for a drive fault that caused the er-
                ror to be logged. The exact meaning of the LED fault code
                depends on the drive type that logged the error. The LED
                column will be blank if there is no LED fault code available
                for the error.

                The LED fault codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

                The LED fault code on RA71, RA72 and RA73 disk drives are 16
                bits, and will be displayed as 4 digit hex numbers.

                                                     RAXX error report format


                This is the Logical Block Number (LBN) of where the error
                has occured on the disk. The LBN column will be blank if
                there is no LBN available from the error entry. If the entry
                is a bad block replacement, the LBN given is the LBN of the
                bad block. If the LBN given in the error entry is actually a
                replacement block, then the LBN given will be the replace-
                ment block number and will have the letter 'R' next to it.
                LBNs are translated to cylinder, head and sector format and
                displayed in the following columns.

              4 Physical cylinder

                This is the physical cylinder where the disk error occured.
                If the error entry contained an LBN (see above), then the
                cylinder shown is calculated from the LBN based on the drive
                geometry. If the error entry contains the drive supplied
                error log, then the cylinder shown is the last cylinder in
                use by the drive.

              5 Physical head

                This is the physical head where the disk error occured.
                If the error entry contained an LBN (see above), then the
                head shown is calculated from the LBN based on the drive
                geometry. If the error entry contains the drive supplied
                error log, then the head shown is the last head in use by
                the drive.

              6 Physical sector

                This is the physical sector where the disk error occured,
                also known as the "sector from index". If the error en-
                try contained an LBN (see above), then the sector shown is
                calculated from the LBN based on the drive geometry.

              7 HSC RP

                This field contains controller connection information show-
                ing where the drive is connected on its controller

                If the controller is an HSC, this field will contain 2 dig-
                its: The left digit (under the 'R') is the requestor number,
                and the right digit (under the 'P') is the port on that
                requestor (0 thru 3).

                If the controller is a "two board controller" (UDA50, KDA50,
                KDB50) or the KDM70, this field will contain 1 digit under
                the 'P': the port number on the controller.

          RAXX error report format


                This is the serial number field. If a 'D' appears next to
                the number, this is the serial number of the drive. If a 'V'
                appears next to the number, this is the serial number of the
                disk pack or volume. On fixed media drives, the drive serial
                number is displayed. On removeable media drives (RA60) and
                small fixed media drives (RA70, RA71, RA72, RA73) the volume
                serial number is displayed.

                Use of the /SERIAL_TYPE qualifier may modify this field. See
                /SERIAL_TYPE for more information.

                If the /USER_TYPE=ENGINEERING qualifier is used, this field
                is replaced by the MSLG flags and format bytes of the MSLG
                record.

          Field Descriptions

              1 MSCP evnt

                This is the MSCP Event code that caused the error to be
                logged. If the event that caused the error to be logged was
                some type of bad block replacement event, and if the bad
                block replacement resulted in a "Forced error flag" in the
                replaced block, the letter 'f' appears next to the event
                code. FSTerr does not attempt to process all types of events
                seen. If FSTerr sees an unsupported type of event, the MSCP
                event code will be replaced by question marks '????'. This
                event will require further inspection using ANALYZE/ERROR.

                The MSCP event codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              2 Drive Error

                This is the Drive error register for the RFxx disk drive,
                displayed in hexadecimal format.

                The drive error codes are translated at the end of the
                FSTerr report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              3 LBN

                This is the Logical Block Number (LBN) of where the error
                has occured on the disk. The LBN column will be blank if
                there is no LBN available from the error entry. If the entry
                is a bad block replacement, the LBN given is the LBN of the
                bad block. If the bad block replacement resulted in a Forced
                Error flag, the character 'f' will be found next to the MSCP
                event code.

                                              NOTE

                    Unlike the RAxx entries, the LBN is not translated to
                    cylinder, track and sector format. The cylinder, track
                    and sector information is explicitly provided in most
                    (but not all) RFxx error log entries.

              4 Physical cylinder

                This is the physical cylinder where the error occured on
                the disk. This column will be blank if there is no cylinder
                information available from the error log entry.

              5 Physical head

                This is the physical head (or track) selected when the error
                occured on the disk. This column will be blank if there is
                no track information available from the error log entry.

              6 Physical sector

                This is the physical sector where the error occured on the
                disk. This column will be blank if there is no sector infor-
                mation available from the error log entry.

              7 Servo error

                This is the servo error code provided by the RFxx drive,
                displayed in hexadecimal format. The servo error code is
                only displayed when the "servo error" bit is set in the
                servo status word of the error log entry. Note that the
                servo status word is not displayed by FSTerr.

                The servo error codes are translated at the end of the
                FSTerr report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              8 Write fault

                This is the write fault register provided by the RFxx drive,
                displayed in hexadecimal format. A 'FF' in this column means
                "Servo off track at next sector". Otherwise, the register is
                bit-encoded as follows:

              9 Data status register

                This is the data status register provided by the RFxx drive,
                and is displayed in hexadecimal format. A '800' in this
                column means that the DSR value is unavailable. Otherwise,
                it is bit-encoded as follows:

              1 Seek Ctr

                This is a counter that represents seek activity vs. perfor-
                mance.

              2 Servo Perf Ctr

                The Servo Performance Counter provides an indication to the
                relative state of the servo system.

              3 Servo Event Ctr

                The Servo Event Counter is a count of the number of abnormal
                conditions detected by the servo system.

              4 Servo Perf Delta

                The Servo Performance Delta provides the difference in the
                Servo Performance Counter since the last report.

              5 Overshoot Count

                The Overshoot counter.

                RF30 and RF71 disk drives do not supply this field.
                Therefore, on these devices, this field will contain "n/a".

          Field Descriptions

              1 Port Sts

                This is the port status field supplied by VMS. This indi-
                cates whether the I/O operation in progress (when the error
                log entry was made) was successful or not. If the value is
                1 (or other odd number), then I/O operation was success-
                ful. Other typical values for this field may be 22C (Device
                Timeout) or 54 (Fatal Controller Error).

              2 SCSI Sts

                This is the SCSI system status field returned from the SCSI
                device reporting the error. Generally, 'FF' indicates that
                no further error information is available, while '02' indi-
                cates that extended sense data is available.

              3 LBN

                This is the Logical Block Address (or disk address) where
                the error occured during media read or write operations.

              4 SCSI Cmd

                This is the SCSI command issued to the SCSI device when the
                error was logged. Note that this command is not necessarily
                the command that failed.

              5 Sense Key

                This is the sense key provided by the SCSI device report-
                ing the error. This provides a means of categorizing error
                types for later analysis. The sense code (described below)
                provides more specific information as to the nature of the
                error.

                Sense code values are decoded at the end of the FSTerr re-
                port if the /DECODE qualifier is specified.

              6 Sense Code

                This is the sense code provided by the SCSI device reporting
                the error. This field is actually both the "Additional sense
                code" and "Additional sense code qualifier" as described in
                the SCSI specifications. This sense code provides a specific
                indication of the nature of the error. Sense code values
                are decoded at the end of the FSTerr report if the /DECODE
                qualifier is specified.

              7 FRU

                This is the FRU (Field Replaceable Unit) code provided by
                the SCSI device reporting the error. The FRU code varies
                with the device type, and not all devices provide any infor-
                mation for the FRU field. Consult the service manual for the
                specific device for more information.

              8 Dev type

                This is the type of device reporting the error. If the de-
                vice type is not known, the string "GenDK" will appear here.

              1 MSCP evnt

                This is the MSCP Event code that caused the error to be
                logged. If the event is not a disk or tape message, then
                this is considered an "unusual" event, and the MSCP event
                code will be replaced by question marks '????'. This event
                will require further inspection using ANALYZE/ERROR.

                The following event codes are suppressed:

                o  0000

                o  FF68

                o  FFE8

                If the /USER_TYPE=ENGINEERING qualifier is used, these event
                codes are not suppressed.

                The MSCP event codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              2 Gap Count

                Gap count indicates the position of the tape, in records (or
                gaps) from the beginning of the tape.

                occurred.

                This field is derived from the GEDS text in the logged mes-

                TIE stands for Track In Error. It indicates what tracks have
                dropped one or more bits during the operation. Each bit is
                represented by a dot '.'. A dead track is indicated by an
                'X'.

                To convert from the bit weighted track indications to the
                physical locations of the 9 tracks, use the following chart:

                "Reference edge"    |123456789|              Back edge
                Edge closest to you |204P56713| Edge furthest from you

              9 Volume label

                This is the label of the tape mounted on the tape drive
                at the time of the error. The volume label is derived by
                noting the MOUNT and DISMOUNT error log entries. As FSTerr
                reads an error log, it keeps an internal database of volume
                mounts and dismounts. When an tape drive error is seen,
                FSTerr consults the internal volume database to determine
                the volume label that was last mounted on the tape drive.

                Note that if a tape is being initialized, or if a blank tape
                is mounted, then there is no volume label to report. Also,
                FSTerr can not display a volume label for a tape drive error
                that may occur between a volume dismount and a volume mount.

                If the /USER_TYPE=ENGINEERING qualifier is used, this field
                is replaced by the MSLG flags and format bytes of the MSLG
                record.

              1 MSCP evnt

                This is the MSCP Event code that caused the error to be
                logged. If the event is not a disk or tape message, then
                this is considered an "unusual" event, and the MSCP event
                code will be replaced by question marks '????'. This event
                will require further inspection using ANALYZE/ERROR.

                The following event codes are suppressed:

                o  0000

                o  0068

                o  FF68

                If the /USER_TYPE=ENGINEERING qualifier is used, these event
                codes are not suppressed.

                The MSCP event codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

                Gap count indicates the position of the tape, in records (or
                gaps) from the beginning of the tape.

              3 Control Unit Hardware Error

                This is the control unit hardware detected error code, dis-
                played in hexadecimal format. This field consists of bytes
                16 and 17 of the TA90 sense bytes.

              4 Control Unit Microcode Error

                This is the control unit microcode detected error code for
                the first error of the control unit or drive, displayed in
                hexadecimal format. This field consists of bytes 10 and 11
                of the TA90 sense bytes.

              5 FNC

                This field specifies the function the drive was perform-
                ing at the time of the error. "R" indicates the drive was
                reading, while "W" indicates the drive was writing.

                This field is derived from GEDS text, sense byte 1, bit 2.

              6 Drive Hardware Error

                This is the first drive detected error code since the last
                device sense command. The error code number is the same as
                the CHK number. This is byte 21 of the TA90 sense bytes ,and
                is displayed in hexadecimal format.

              7 ERPA

                This is the subsystem Error Recovery Procedure Action code.
                It describes the action that the host system should take to
                recover from an error in the subsystem. This is byte 3 of
                the TA90 sense bytes, displayed in hexadecimal format.

              8 Volume label

                This is the label of the tape mounted on the tape drive
                at the time of the error. The volume label is derived by
                noting the MOUNT and DISMOUNT error log entries. As FSTerr
                reads an error log, it keeps an internal database of volume
                mounts and dismounts. When an tape drive error is seen,
                FSTerr consults the internal volume database to determine
                the volume label that was last mounted on the tape drive.

                Note that if a tape is being initialized, or if a blank tape
                is mounted, then there is no volume label to report. Also,
                FSTerr can not display a volume label for a tape drive error
                that may occur between a volume dismount and a volume mount.

                If the value is from 0 to 9999, it is displayed in decimal
                format. If the value is from 10000 to 999,999, it is dis-
                played as the number of thousands followed by 'K'. If the
                value is above 1,000,000, it is displayed as the number of
                million blocks, followed by 'M'.

                For example, if the actual value is 12,735, it would be
                displayed as "12K". If the actual value is 2,735, it would
                be displayed as "2735".

              6 Blocks written

                This is the number of data blocks processed and written by
                the tape drive. This field consists of byte 19 and the low
                nibble from byte 26.

                If the value is from 0 to 9999, it is displayed in decimal
                format. If the value is from 10000 to 999,999, it is dis-
                played as the number of thousands followed by 'K'. If the
                value is above 1,000,000, it is displayed as the number of
                million blocks, followed by 'M'.

                For example, if the actual value is 12,735, it would be
                displayed as "12K". If the actual value is 2,735, it would
                be displayed as "2735".

              7 Drive errors

                This field is the number of unit checks set by the drive.

                If the user type is ENGINEERING, this field will be replaced
                by the compaction ratio of the TA90E or TA91. The compaction
                ratio is calculated by dividing the number of bytes written
                to the tape (bytes 35-37 of the TA90E sense bytes) by the
                number of bytes written from the channel (bytes 41-42 of the
                TA90E sense bytes). If the entry is for a TA90, this field
                will be 'n/a'.

              8 ERPA

                This is the subsystem Error Recovery Procedure Action code.
                It describes the action that the host system should take to

                This is a code indicating how the device dependent areas of
                the error log record should be interpreted. The TF85/86 and
                TA85/86 tape drives generate a variety of types of error log
                entries, and this code indicates what type of entry this is.
                The value is displayed in hexadecimal format.

              5 Physical Track number

                The track number indicates the location of the tape at error
                time. The value actually indicates which head is in use and
                the direction of tape movement. If the value is even, then
                the head is number 0 and the direction is forward. If the
                value is odd, then the head is number 1 and the directory is
                backward.

              6 Physical block number

                The block number indicates the location of the tape at error
                time. The value actually indicates how far from BOT the
                error occured. Note that the beginning of tape is related
                to the direction of the tape movement. If the tape is moving
                in the forward direction, then the BOT is the end near the
                leader. If the tape is moving in the backward direction,
                then BOT is the end opposite the leader.

              7 Unique Media_ID

                This is the unique media indentifier written on the tape by
                the first drive to write upon the tape. This value is unique
                for each tape cartridge, and is a more reliable indicator of
                the identity of a cartridge than the volume label.

                Think of it as the tape cartridge's "serial number".

              8 Volume label

                This is the label of the tape mounted on the tape drive
                at the time of the error. The volume label is derived by
                noting the MOUNT and DISMOUNT error log entries. As FSTerr
                reads an error log, it keeps an internal database of volume
                mounts and dismounts. When an tape drive error is seen,
                FSTerr consults the internal volume database to determine
                the volume label that was last mounted on the tape drive.

                Note that if a tape is being initialized, or if a blank tape
                is mounted, then there is no volume label to report. Also,
                FSTerr can not display a volume label for a tape drive error
                that may occur between a volume dismount and a volume mount.

              o MSCP Evnt

                This is the MSCP Event code that caused the error to be
                logged. If the event is not a disk or tape message, then
                this is considered an "unusual" event, and the MSCP event
                code will be replaced by question marks '????'. This event
                will require further inspection using ANALYZE/ERROR.

                The MSCP event codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              o Blocks read

                This is a count of the number of blocks read from the tape
                that the host explicity requested. Each block is 4096 bytes.

                If the count is less than 1000, the exact value is given.
                If the count is equal to or greater than 1000, the count is
                displayed as the number of thousands followed by 'K'.

              o Blocks written

                This is a count of the number of block written to the tape
                generated by the host. This does not include extra tape
                blocks generated during rewrite retries. Each block is 4096
                bytes.

                If the count is less than 1000, the exact value is given.
                If the count is equal to or greater than 1000, the count is
                displayed as the number of thousands followed by 'K'.

              o Head Wear Time counter

                A count reflecting the number of hours media has been moving
                across the head.

                displayed as the number of thousands followed by 'K'.

              o ReWrite counter

                This value indicates the number of times tape blocks have
                been rewritten (no reposition done). It is the sum of the
                Forward 1 and 2, and Backward 1 and 2 counters.

              o OverWrite counter

                This value indicates the number of times tape blocks have
                been rewritten (with reposition done). It is the sum of the
                Forward 1 and 2, and Backward 1 and 2 counters.

              o ECC Correction counter

                This value indicates the number of times ECC corrected
                was attempted. It is the sum of the Forward 1 and 2, and
                Backward 1 and 2 counters.

              o ReRead counter

                This value indicates the number of times the tape was repo-
                sitioned and reread following an ECC correction failure.
                It is the sum of the Forward 1 and 2, and Backward 1 and 2
                counters.

              o Volume label

                This is the label of the tape mounted on the tape drive
                at the time of the error. The volume label is derived by
                noting the MOUNT and DISMOUNT error log entries. As FSTerr

                Note that if a tape is being initialized, or if a blank tape
                is mounted, then there is no volume label to report. Also,
                FSTerr can not display a volume label for a tape drive error
                that may occur between a volume dismount and a volume mount.

                This field specifies the density in use at the time. "G"
                indicates the drive was in GCR (6250 bpi) mode, while "P"
                indicates the drive was in PE (1600 bpi) mode when the error
                occurred.

                This field specifies the function the drive was perform-

                reading, while "W" indicates the drive was writing.

                This field is derived from sense byte 13, bit 6.

              8 TIE bus

                TIE stands for Track In Error. It indicates what tracks have
                dropped one or more bits during the operation. Each bit is
                represented by a dot '.'. A dead track is indicated by an
                'X'.

                To convert from the bit weighted track indications to the
                physical locations of the 9 tracks, use the following chart:

                "Reference edge"    |123456789|              Back edge
                Edge closest to you |204P56713| Edge furthest from you

              9 Volume label

                This is the label of the tape mounted on the tape drive
                at the time of the error. The volume label is derived by
                noting the MOUNT and DISMOUNT error log entries. As FSTerr
                reads an error log, it keeps an internal database of volume
                mounts and dismounts. When an tape drive error is seen,
                FSTerr consults the internal volume database to determine
                the volume label that was last mounted on the tape drive.

              6 Track number

                The track number indicates the location of the tape at error
                time. The value actually indicates which head is in use
                (even=head zero, odd=head one) and where across the tape the
                error occured.

              7 Physical block number

                The block number indicates the location of the tape at error
                time. The value actually indicates how far from BOT the
                error occured.

              8 Volume label

                This is the label of the tape mounted on the tape drive
                at the time of the error. The volume label is derived by
                noting the MOUNT and DISMOUNT error log entries. As FSTerr
                reads an error log, it keeps an internal database of volume
                mounts and dismounts. When an tape drive error is seen,
                FSTerr consults the internal volume database to determine
                the volume label that was last mounted on the tape drive.

                Note that if a tape is being initialized, or if a blank tape
                is mounted, then there is no volume label to report. Also,
                FSTerr can not display a volume label for a tape drive error
                that may occur between a volume dismount and a volume mount.

                If the /USER_TYPE=ENGINEERING qualifier is used, this field
                is replaced by the MSLG flags and format bytes of the MSLG
                record.

          Field Descriptions

              1 Port Sts

                This is the port status field supplied by VMS. This indi-
                cates whether the I/O operation in progress (when the error
                log entry was made) was successful or not. If the value is
                1 (or other odd number), then I/O operation was success-
                ful. Other typical values for this field may be 22C (Device
                Timeout) or 54 (Fatal Controller Error).

              2 SCSI Sts

                This is the SCSI system status field returned from the SCSI
                device reporting the error. Generally, 'FF' indicates that
                no further error information is available, while '02' indi-
                cates that extended sense data is available.

              3 SCSI Cmd

                This is the SCSI command issued to the SCSI device when the
                error was logged. Note that this command is not necessarily
                the command that failed.

              4 Sense Key

                This is the sense key provided by the SCSI device reporting
                the error. This provides a means of categorizing error types
                for later analysis. The sense code provides more specific
                information as to the nature of the error.

                Sense code values are decoded at the end of the FSTerr re-
                port if the /DECODE qualifier is specified.

                This is the sense code provided by the SCSI device reporting
                the error. This field is actually both the "Additional sense
                code" and "Additional sense code qualifier" as described in
                the SCSI specifications. This sense code provides a specific
                indication of the nature of the error. Sense code values
                are decoded at the end of the FSTerr report if the /DECODE
                qualifier is specified.

              6 FRU

                This is the FRU (Field Replaceable Unit) code provided by
                the SCSI device reporting the error. The FRU code varies
                with the device type, and not all devices provide any infor-
                mation for the FRU field. Consult the service manual for the
                specific device for more information.

              7 Dev type

                This is the type of device reporting the error. If the de-
                vice type is not known, the string "GenMK" will appear here.

              8 Volume label

                This is the label of the tape mounted on the tape drive
                at the time of the error. The volume label is derived by
                noting the MOUNT and DISMOUNT error log entries. As FSTerr
                reads an error log, it keeps an internal database of volume
                mounts and dismounts. When an tape drive error is seen,
                FSTerr consults the internal volume database to determine
                the volume label that was last mounted on the tape drive.

                Note that if a tape is being initialized, or if a blank tape
                is mounted, then there is no volume label to report. Also,
                FSTerr can not display a volume label for a tape drive error
                that may occur between a volume dismount and a volume mount.

          Field Descriptions

              1 MSCP evnt

                This is the MSCP Event code that caused the error to be
                logged. If the event that caused the error to be logged was
                some type of bad block replacement event, and if the bad
                block replacement resulted in a "Forced error flag" in the
                replaced block, the letter 'f' appears next to the event
                code. FSTerr does not attempt to process all types of events
                seen. If FSTerr sees an unsupported type of event, the MSCP
                event code will be replaced by question marks '????'. This
                event will require further inspection using ANALYZE/ERROR.

                The MSCP event codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              2 LED fault code

                This is the LED fault code provided by the ESE20 drive,
                displayed in hexadecimal format.

                The LED fault codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              3 Front Panel fault code

                This is the front panel fault code provided by the ESE20
                drive, displayed in hexadecimal format.

                The front panel fault codes are translated at the end of the

                The FRU codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr report
                if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              5 Array number

                This is the array number in use at the time of the error. It
                may not always be the cause of the error. It is calculated
                from the current cylinder address from the error entry.

              6 LBN

                This is the Logical Block Number (LBN) at the time of the
                error. Error log entries that describe a data error pro-
                vide the LBN, while other entries do not. If the error log
                entry provides the LBN, then it is displayed. If the error
                log entry does not provide the LBN, it supplies a cylinder
                address. This cylinder address is then used to calculate
                the base of a range of LBNs that the cylinder contains.
                Therefore, the LBN may not be exact. In this case, the LBN
                field will contain an asterisk '*' to denote that fact.

              7 Drive status

                This is the status of the ESE20 subsystem at the time of
                the error, displayed in hexadecimal format. The byte is bit

                requestor (0 thru 3).

                If the controller is a "two board controller" (UDA50, KDA50,
                KDB50) or the KDM70, this field will contain 1 digit under

          Field Descriptions

              1 MSCP evnt

                This is the MSCP Event code that caused the error to be
                logged. If the event that caused the error to be logged was
                some type of bad block replacement event, and if the bad
                block replacement resulted in a "Forced error flag" in the
                replaced block, the letter 'f' appears next to the event
                code. FSTerr does not attempt to process all types of events
                seen. If FSTerr sees an unsupported type of event, the MSCP
                event code will be replaced by question marks '????'. This
                event will require further inspection using ANALYZE/ERROR.

                The MSCP event codes are translated at the end of the FSTerr
                report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

              2 Tpl

                This "template" field indicates the type of HSXXX error log
                entry is being displayed.

              3 Instance

                The "Instance Code" is an 8 digit hexadecimal number that
                identifies the event being reported. The code is composed of
                4 fields, listed below:

                o  IDEv

                   This field is actually the "Component ID" field and the
                   "Event Code" field shown together. These two fields to-
                   gether uniquely identify the event being reported, and are
                   translated at the end of the FSTerr report if the /DECODE
                   qualifier is used.

          HSXXX error report format


                   If the entry is from an HSD05, then this field is the
                   HSD05 Port Status field. This field will be translated at
                   the end of the FSTerr report if the /DECODE qualifier is
                   used.

                o  RA

                   This field indicates a recommended repair action for the
                   event. The Repair Action codes are translated at the end
                   of the FSTerr report if the /DECODE qualifier is used.

                   If the entry is from an HSD05 controller, then this field
                   will be blank.

                o  NR

                   This field is the "Notification/Recovery" threshold as-
                   signed to the event. It is used by Symptom Directed
                   Diagnosis to determine when notification should take
                   place.

                   If the entry is from an HSD05 controller, then this field
                   will be blank.

              4 LastFail

                This field is a "last failure" or "crash code" that the con-
                troller records the reason for the crash, and upon restart
                provides this code to the error log. It is composed of 4
                fields, which are described below in more detail.

                                              NOTE

                    The format of this field is very similar to the
                    "Instance Code" field, but the contents mean very
                    different things. Do not confuse the LastFail code
                    with the Instance code.

                o  IDEv

                   This field is actually the "Component ID" field and the
                   "Event Code" field shown together. These two fields to-
                   gether uniquely identify the event being reported, and are
                   translated at the end of the FSTerr report if the /DECODE
                   qualifier is used.

                                                 NOTE

                      This field has the same format as the "IDEv" field
                      from the Instance Code. Do not confuse the two
                      codes. The values in this field will have different
                      meanings from those in the Instance Code.

                the SCSI specifications. This sense code provides a specific
                indication of the nature of the error. Sense code values
                are decoded at the end of the FSTerr report if the /DECODE
                qualifier is specified.

              6 FRU

                This is the FRU (Field Replaceable Unit) code provided by
                the SCSI device reporting the error. The FRU code varies
                with the device type, and not all devices provide any infor-
                mation for the FRU field. Consult the service manual for the
                specific device for more information.

          FSTerr ERROR MESSAGES



              FSTerr can issue a variety of messages, some of which report
              error conditions (such as "can't open input file"), and others
              which simply provide information showing what FSTerr is doing.
              FSTerr uses the same format for its messages as VMS:

                %FSTERR-s-name, text

              Use the 'name' field for looking up error messages.

              AMBDEV,  Ambiguous device type specified

                Explanation: The device type you gave was ambiguous. That
                is, the text you gave would match more than one device type.
                For example, "TA" would match "TA78", "TA79" or "TA85".
                Supply more of the device type.

              BEFORETIME,  Invalid /BEFORE time specified

                Explanation: The time you entered for BEFORE is not a valid
                VMS time format. Use the format: DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS.

              BINDISABL,  Binary output file error, none written

                Explanation: There was an error opening the binary output
                file. FSTerr continues, but there will be no binary output
                file.

              BUGCHK,  FSTerr has an internal error, Code: [nn]

                Explanation: FSTerr has encountered an internal error.
                Please send the contents of this message (the code number)
                and the traceback listing to "stuart.fuller@digital.com",
                along with an example of the command line used when this
                error occurred.

              CMDLIN,  The equivalent DCL command is:

                Explanation: This message will provide a valid DCL command
                on the next line. If you run FSTerr in the prompt mode,
                after answering all the questions, FSTerr will give you the
                equivalent DCL command line that you can use the next time
                you use FSTerr. Running FSTerr as a DCL command is preferred
                over the prompt mode because there are many more options
                available.

              DECDISABL,  Decoding file error, decoding file disabled

                Explanation: There was an error opening the decoding output
                file. FSTerr continues, but there will be no decoding file.

              DEVNOSORT,  This device type does not support this sort type;
                          sorting disabled

                Explanation: This device type does not support the sort
                type request. FSTerr continues, but the entries will not be
                sorted.

              DEVNOSTAT,  This device type does not have a statistics report;
                          using error report

                Explanation: This device type does not support a statis-
                tics report. FSTerr continues, but provides an error report
                instead of the requested statistics report.

              DVIFAIL,  Failed to obtain output device characteristics -
                        /PAGE disabled

                Explanation: FSTerr tried to obtain the output device char-
                acteristics, but was unable to. Since FSTerr could not ob-
                tain the output device characteristics, it cannot run in
                paging mode. Additional information will usually follow this
                message. FSTerr continues, but the report will not be paged.

              INPUT,  Read [nnnn] records from [input file]

                Explanation: This is an informational message displaying
                the number of error log entries that FSTerr read from the
                indicated input file. This message is only printed if the
                /LOG qualifier was used. If there are multiple input files,
                this message will be repeated for each input file.

              INVPAGE,  Invalid output device for /PAGE - /PAGE disabled

                Explanation: The /PAGE qualifier can only be used if the
                output device is an ANSI compatible video terminal. FSTerr
                continues, but the output will be sent continuously instead
                of paging a screenful at a time.

          C-2  FSTerr ERROR MESSAGES

 








              INVUNIT,  Invalid unit number specified

                Explanation: You have specified an invalid unit number.
                Valid unit numbers are in the range of 0 through 4095.

              LOOKUP,  Error searching for [file name] as input

                Explanation: The file name you have specified can not be
                found. Additional information will usually follow this mes-
                sage.

              MAXFILES,  Maximum number of input files is 26, skipping rest
                         of files

                Explanation: FSTerr can report from up to 26 error log
                files. After reporting on the 26th file, FSTerr will stop
                with this message. The reason for the 26 file limitation is
                due to the method FSTerr reports what error came from which
                file. In the Entry column, beside the entry number is a let-
                ter from 'a' to 'z'. This indicates which error entry came
                from which file. The first file is file 'a', the second is
                file 'b', and so on.

              NEEDNEWVER,  This version of FSTerr is more than 1 year old

                Explanation: This release of FSTerr is more than 1 year
                old. Therefore, it may not support newer devices released
                since this version was developed. You should inquire about
                obtaining a new version. This is simply an informational
                message. FSTerr will continue to operate normally.

              NOBINCEH,  input file [file name] is a Common Event Header
                         (CEH) file. Binary file output disabled for this
                         input file's events.

                Explanation: The event file mentioned is of the new Common
                Event Header format. FSTerr does not support the writing
                of such records into the binary output file. Therefore, no
                records from this event file will be written to the binary
                output file. However, records from old-style event files
                will continue to be written to the binary output file.

              NODESC,  Error opening [file name] - no decoding available

                Explanation: FSTerr uses a text library that contains the
                various error code decoding information. If this file can
                not be found, then FSTerr can not provide any error code
                decoding.



                                                   FSTerr ERROR MESSAGES  C-3

 








              NOMATCH,  No matches found

                Explanation: This message indicates that FSTerr has not
                found any error log entries that match the request you have
                made. If any output files were specified, FSTerr will delete
                them, since they will be empty.

              NOSCSNAMES,  Error opening [file name] - no SCS names available

                Explanation: FSTerr reads a file [file name] that contains
                a list of SCS node names and controller serial numbers for
                HSXXX-type entries. If this file can not be found, then
                FSTerr can not provide node names for HSXXX entries, and
                will only print controller serial numbers. See the reference
                manual for instructions on creating the SCS names file.

              ODDCNT,  [count] events may require further inspection

                Explanation: This message indicates that FSTerr found one
                or more unusual error log events that you may want to in-
                spect in more detail, using the ANALYZE/ERROR command. These
                events can be noted by an question mark '?' somewhere on the
                display line (the location on the display line is dependent
                on the device type).

              OPENIN,  Error opening [file name] for input

                Explanation: This message indicates that FSTerr can find the
                input file, but it can not open it for some reason. The most
                likely reason is that the file is not an error log file.
                Additional information will usually follow this message.

              OPENOUT,  Error opening [file name] for output

                Explanation: This message indicates that FSTerr can not
                open the output file. This error may or may not be fatal,
                depending on what file FSTerr is trying to open. Additional
                information will usually follow this message.

              OTHERRPT,  [count] events were excluded from this report

                Explanation: This message indicates that there were some
                events excluded from the report because they were of the
                wrong report type. If you have selected an error report,
                this value would be the number of statistics events that
                FSTerr saw, but did not display. Likewise, if you have se-
                lected a statistics reports, this value is the number of
                error events that FSTerr did not display.

              OUTPUT,  Wrote [nnnn] records to [file name]

                Explanation: This is an informational message displaying
                the number of error log entries that FSTerr wrote to the
                indicated output file. This message is only printed if the
                /LOG qualifier was used.

              SINCETIME,  Invalid /SINCE time specified

                Explanation: The time you entered for SINCE is not a valid
                VMS time format. Use the format: DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS.

              SORTDISABL,  Error in BEGIN_SORT, sorting disabled

                Explanation: This is a warning message indicating that
                FSTerr could not properly initialize the sort routines. The
                reason for the error will follow this message. FSTerr con-
                tinues, but the entries will be given in the order in which
                they appear in the error log file(s).

              SORTERR,  Error during sort

                Explanation: An error occured during some phase of sorting.
                The reason for the error is given following this message.

              STARTDCD,  Starting decoding section

                Explanation: This informational message indicates that
                FSTerr is starting to display error code decode informa-
                tion. This message is only displayed if the /PAGE qualifier
                was used.

              STARTSORT,  Starting sort pass, count: [nn]

                Explanation: This informational message indicates that
                FSTerr has read of the specified entries from the specified
                input files, and is starting to sort the entries according
                to the desires sort type. The count indicates how many en-
                tries FSTerr will be sorting, and will be the same number as
                the OUTPUT message gives.

              UNKPKTFMT,  Unknown packet format, entry [nn] skipped

                Explanation: This warning message indicates that the entry
                'nn' in the error log does not appear to be a valid error
                log entry. This may be due to either a corrupted error log
                file or using an older version of FSTerr to report from an
                error log file from a newer version of VMS.

              UNRDEV,  Unrecognized device type specified

                Explanation: This message indicates that FSTerr does not
                recognize the device type you have entered. See Appendix A
                for a list of supported device types.

              USEERRRPT,  Use /REPORT_TYPE=ERRORS to see the excluded events

                Explanation: This is simply an informational message indi-
                cating that you have selected a device statistics report and
                FSTerr saw some device error events. The previous message
                indicates how many error events that FSTerr skipped.

              USESTATRPT,  Use /REPORT_TYPE=STATISTICS to see the excluded
                           events

                Explanation: This is simply an informational message in-
                dicating that you have selected a device errors report and
                FSTerr saw some device statistics events. The previous mes-
                sage indicates how many error events that FSTerr skipped.

              WHOKNOWS,  Can't determine reason - probably not an error log
                         file

                Explanation: This message is usually associated with the
                OPENIN error message. It indicates that either the system
                did not supply a reason for the failure to open the input
                file, or the input file is not a valid error log file.

          Appendix  D


          FSTerr installation procedures



              This appendix describes how to install the FSTerr tool.


          D.1  Installation overview

              There are several pre-installation checks that you must make
              before attempting to install FSTerr. These are covered in
              Section D.2.

              The instructions to perform the actual installation of FSTerr
              are found in Section D.3.

              Following the installation of FSTerr, there are some tasks that
              must be performed, and they are listed in Section D.4.

              A log of a sample installation is found in Section D.5.

              A listing of the various files in the installation kit, and
              those files created during the installation are found in
              Section D.6.

          D.2  Prior to installing

              Prior to installing FSTerr, there are some things that should
              be checked first:

              _ VMS version is at least V4.0

              _ Necessary privileges and quotas

                Normally, FSTerr is installed from the SYSTEM or FIELD
                accounts, which have the necessary privileges and quotas
                needed to install.

              _ Necessary free disk space



                                          FSTerr installation procedures  D-1

 








                The installation procedure needs some free space in order
                to unpack the installation kit, and some working space for
                linking the program. The amount of free space needed may
                vary from one FSTerr version to another, but generally, 5000
                blocks of free disk space is sufficient. If the installation
                kit is copied to the same disk, then an additional amount of
                free space is needed for the kit itself.

              _ License PAK

                At this time, FSTerr does not require the installation of a
                license PAK.

          D.3  Installing FSTerr

              This section describes the step by step procedure for in-
              stalling FSTerr on a VMS system.

              Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

              The VMSINSTAL installation procedure checks various things
              on the system, which may be important to the successful in-
              stallation of other products, but they have no effect on the
              installation of FSTerr. VMSINSTAL reports various things, such
              as if you are logged into the SYSTEM account, the active user
              processes on the system, and so on.

              If you are not logged in to the SYSTEM account, you will see
              this error message. If the account is has suitable privileges
              and quotas, then you may ignore this message.

              %VMSINSTAL-W-NOTSYSTEM, You are not logged in to the
              SYSTEM account.

          D-2  FSTerr installation procedures

 








              If there are user processes running, you will see a list of
              them, followed by a prompt. Answer YES to this prompt, since
              the presence of user processes will not affect the installation
              of FSTerr.

              * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? YES <RETURN>

              VMSINSTAL will ask if the system disk has been backed up. Since
              the installation of FSTerr does not affect any system files,
              you need not be concerned about the backup of the system disk.

              * Are you satisfied with the backup of your
              system disk [YES]? <RETURN>

              VMSINSTAL asks for the location of the installation kit.

              If the installation kit is located on a tape, then you load
              the tape onto the drive and put it online, and respond to the
              prompt with the name of the tape drive.

              * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted: MKB0: <RETURN>

              If the installation kit is located on a disk, then you respond
              to the prompt with the name of the disk and directory that
              contains the installation kit.

              * Where will the distribution volumes
              be mounted: SYS$COMMON:[SYSMAINT] <RETURN>

              VMSINSTAL asks for the name of the product to install. If the
              FSTerr installation kit is the only kit on the tape, or in the
              directory, you can respond with * (to install all the prod-
              ucts that VMSINSTAL can find there). However, it is safer to
              explicity specify the name of the product. The name of the
              product is generally the name of the installation kit file, as
              in FSTERRU3040.

              Enter the products to be processed from the first
              distribution volume set.
              * Products: FSTERRU3040 <RETURN>

              VMSINSTAL asks for any installation options. FSTerr does not
              explicitly use any installation options, nor are any installa-
              tion options required to install FSTerr. If you would like to
              see a list of the options, type ? and RETURN, else just type
              RETURN.

              * Enter installation options you wish to use (none): <RETURN>

              If all goes well, VMSINSTAL will locate the installation kit
              and tell you what product it is installing, as well as the time
              of day. If you get this far, then everything is going well.

                                          FSTerr installation procedures  D-3

 








              At this point, VMSINSTAL will unpack the installation kit and
              process the commands stored in the installation kit. VMSINSTAL
              will copy the product release notes to the SYS$HELP directory

              %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A ...
              %VMSINSTAL-I-RELMOVED, Product's release notes have been
              moved to SYS$HELP.

              Some or all of the files that this installation provides may
              be newer versions than those on the system disk. The installa-
              tion procedure asks if these older versions of files should be
              purged from the disk. If you want to keep the older versions,
              answer NO to the question. Else, just hit RETURN.

              * Do you want to purge files replaced by
              this installation [YES]? <RETURN>

              The installation procedure asks for the name of the disk and
              directory to where FSTerr should be installed. The default de-
              vice:[directory] is SYS$COMMON:[SYSMAINT.TOOLS], but these may
              be changed by answering the following prompts appropriately.

              * Enter disk drive name [SYS$COMMON:]: <RETURN>
              * Enter directory name [[SYSMAINT.TOOLS]]: <RETURN>

              The installation procedure now links the FSTerr program.
              Depending on the speed and load of the system, this could take
              anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.

              The installation procedure creates a command file FSTERR_INIT.COM,
              and copies it to the directory to where FSTerr is to be in-
              stalled. This command file contains the commands to define a
              logical name (so that FSTerr can find the error code decod-
              ing file) and define the FSTerr command. You should either add
              these commands to your LOGIN.COM file, or change your LOGIN.COM
              file to execute this command file. That way, the FSTerr command
              is defined for you every time you login.

              Included with the installation kit are 2 copies of the user
              guide. One copy is in PostScript format, and the other is
              in text format. Both copies are put into the directory where
              FSTerr is installed. If you have a PostScript printer, print
              the PostScript version, since it's easier to read. If not,
              print the text version. In either event, read the guide. It
              shows all of the command line qualifiers and what they do. It
              shows all the record formats, and what all the data means. It
              also shows the error messages that FSTerr is able to produce,
              and what they mean.

              VMSINSTAL now copies the various files from its temporary work-
              ing directory to the directory that you specified above into
              which to install FSTerr. If there are any file access or priv-
              ilege errors, they will usually be seen here. If any errors

          D-4  FSTerr installation procedures

 








              occur, the installation will be aborted, and VMSINSTAL will
              delete the temporary working directory it had been using. You
              will need to correct the problem and restart the installation.

              %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their
              target directories...

              If no errors occurred, then the installation is completed.

                      Installation of FSTERRU3 V4.0 completed at 14:31

          D.4  Post installation tasks

              Once the FSTerr tool has been installed, there are still some
              things to do.

              o Edit your LOGIN.COM

                Edit your LOGIN.COM to include the line that the installa-
                tion procedure told you to include. This way, the necessary
                logical names and commands are defined each time you login.
                If you have installed FSTerr into the default device and
                directory, then the line to include in your LOGIN.COM is:

                $ @SYS$COMMON:[SYSMAINT.TOOLS]FSTERR_INIT.COM

                If you have installed FSTerr in some other location, change
                the above line as needed.

              o Print and read the user guide

                The user guide is provided in 2 formats: PostScript and
                text. If you have a PostScript printer, then print the
                PostScript version. If you do not have a PostScript printer,
                then print the text version. The PostScript version is pre-
                ferred, since it is easier to read. If you do not know how
                to print files, see your system manager.

              o Try it out

                This is the best way to learn how to use any tool. "Just do
                it!"

          D.6  Files created or modified

              This is a brief description of the files in the installation
              kit and created during the installation.

          D.6.1  KITINSTAL.COM

              This is the VMSINSTAL required installation command procedure.
              It is the procedure that unpacks the documentation, links the
              FSTerr.EXE program, copies the various files to where they need
              to be, etc. After the installation is complete, it is no longer
              needed, and is deleted from the system.

          D.6.2  FSTERR.OLB

              This is the object library from which the FSTerr.EXE program
              is built. The installation procedure links the program from
              this library. After the link is completed, this file is no
              longer needed and is deleted from the system. The resulting
              file FSTERR.EXE is moved to the directory to which the logical
              name MAINT$TOOLS refers.

          D.6.3  FSTERR.TLB

              This file contains all the error code descriptions that FSTerr
              displays when the user specifies the /DECODE qualifier. It is
              only required when the user specifies the /DECODE qualifier. It
              is moved to the MAINT$TOOLS directory.




          D-8  FSTerr installation procedures

 








          D.6.4  FSTDOCS.TLB

              This file contains both the PostScript and ASCII text ver-
              sions of the user reference manual, in a compressed format (to
              save space). The installation procedure extracts and uncom-
              presses both versions of the manual to become FSTERR_USER.PS
              and FSTERR_USER.TXT. Both of these files are moved to the
              MAINT$TOOLS directory. Once the installation is complete, this
              file (FSTDOCS.TLB) is no longer needed, and is deleted from the
              system.

          D.6.5  FSTERR042.RELEASE_NOTES

              This file contains the release notes for this version of
              FSTerr. It is a standard text file, and contains information
              about each release of FSTerr starting with V4.0 through the
              current release. The installation procedure copies this to the
              MAINT$TOOLS directory, as well as to the directory SYS$HELP.


          D.6.6  FSTERR_INIT.COM

              This file is not part of the installation kit, but rather is
