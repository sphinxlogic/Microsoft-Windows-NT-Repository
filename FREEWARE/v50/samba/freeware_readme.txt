SAMBA, SOFTWARE, Porting library for OpenVMS

This is an implementation of SAMBA 2.0.6 for OpenVMS.

Samba is a collection of programs that allow communication
with LANMAN hosts using NETbios over TCP/IP.

These programs include client utilities to allow OpenVMS
systems to access shares on LANMAN hosts.

Please read the installing*.txt and the *source*.txt file for
information of what works and what does not work.

Thank you,
John Malmberg
