I will attempt to get this more automated in a future release,
for now it must be a manual procedure.


If you are moving from an older release of SAMBA for OpenVMS, I
would use a different directory for this new release, or rename
your old directory and keep your files around.

	Pay attention to the comments smb.conf_sample provided.
	Because this release is attempting to be exactly compatible
	with the UNIX version of SAMBA, some settings that were
	ignored before are now used.

	The parameter "ole locking compatability = off" must not be
	set to true.  If it is enabled OpenVMS will attempt to create
	giant Empty files.

	The printing settings have also changed.  The older settings
	may be incompatible with this version.

This port was developed from a different perspective from the
previous versions of SAMBA for OpenVMS.

I do not have support for encoding of case preservation for
ODS-2 disks built.

Some testing on ODS-5 has been done though.


I also do not have the command procedures tried for other than
Compaq OpenVMS 5.0.  I think that anything that is missing for
other TCP/IP programs can be obtained from the previous SAMBA
for VMS releases.


The installation procedure for SAMBA on OpenVMS 2.0.6 is as follows:

 1. Create a directory with the suggested name of [SAMBA_ROOT] at
    the root of a physical device.

 2. Define logical name SAMBA_ROOT as a concealed logical such as:

    $DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SAMBA_ROOT.]/TRANS=CONCEALED

 3. Put this logical name definition where it will be created when
    the OpenVMS system boots.  SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGICALS.COM can be
    used for this, or what ever your site uses.

 4. UNZIP the SAMBA base kit into the SAMBA_ROOT:[000000] directory.
    It should create all the directories that are needed.
    Just to be certain, run the command procedure CREATE_SAMBA_ROOT.COM
    in the SAMBA_ROOT:[BIN] directory.

    For test or custom installations, read the comments in the
    CREATE_SAMBA_ROOT.COM

 5. This version of SAMBA requires a GUEST account for the SMBD
    process to exist.  The default for this account is now
    SAMBA__GUEST.  Note that there are two underscores in the
    name to avoid namespace collision.

    To create this account run the command procedure
    MAKE_SAMBA_GUEST_ACCOUNT in the SAMBA_ROOT:[BIN] directory.

    Before running this command procedure, inspect it and make any
    site specific changes for running it.

 6. The binaries are shipped as .OLB files.  The command procedure
    LINK_SAMBA_VMS.COM will link them into executables.  SMBD is no
    longer linked against the system symbol table.  The FRONTPORT
    library has a module that does the SETUID function and is linked
    against the system image.  For more details see the documentation
    for the FRONTPORT library shared image.

 7. Edit SAMBA_ROOT:[LIB]SMB.CONF to suit your needs.  If you are
    upgrading compare your old settings with the comments in the
    new file.  Note the warning earlier in this file.

    My installation using Compaq UCX 4.2 on VAX required an interface line:

    interfaces = 10.10.10.1/8

    For Compaq TCPIP 5.0, I did not need an interface statement in the
    smb.conf.

 8. Edit the file SAMBA_ROOT:[BIN]SITE_SAMBA_VMS_LOGICALS.COM to
    specify any site specific logical names that you may have for
    setting SAMBA options.

 9. If you do not have a Timezone logical set, you need to set one.
    The FRONTPORT library will interpret the standard OpenVMS
    TIMEZONE logicals in the same order as OpenVMS is documented to.
    See the file TIMEZONE_RULE.TXT

10. Place a call to the SAMBA_ROOT:[BIN]SAMBA_STARTUP.COM file in
    the SYSTARTUP_*.COM file where it can be executed on system boot.
    It must be placed after the startup procedure for the FRONTPORT
    library, and also your TCPIP program has started.

11. Place a call to the SAMBA_ROOT:[BIN]SAMBA_COMMANDS.COM in either
    the SYLOGIN.COM file or individual login.com files.


Notes:

    The following programs appear to work:

    MAKE_SMBCODEPAGE

    NMBD

    NMBLOOKUP

    SMBCLIENT

    SMBD

    SMBPASSWD

    SMBSTATUS

    TESTPARM


    The SWAT program might work, I have not had the time to test it or
    configure it into a web server.

    The RPCCLIENT routine will not work.  It is coded to use select to wait
    on input from stdin.  That will cause a failure on OpenVMS.

    Not sure how useful the following routines are.  They compile and link.
    Use if you can.  For a few of them, I do not even know what they do.

    DEBUG2HTML, MAKE_PRINTERDEF, RPCTORTURE, SMBFILTER, SMBSH, SMBSPOOL,
    TESTPRNS.
