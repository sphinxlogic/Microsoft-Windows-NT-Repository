What This Primer Doesn't Cover

   This primer assumes that you have:
   
      at least a passing knowledge of how to use NCSA Mosaic or some     other
      Web browser
      
      a general understanding of how Web servers and client browsers     work
      
      access to a Web server for which you would like to produce HTML
      documents, or that you wish to produce HTML documents for personal
      use
      
Creating HTML Documents

   HTML documents are in plain (also known as ASCII) text format and can be
   created using any text editor (e.g., Emacs or vi on UNIX machines). A couple
   of Web browsers (tkWWW for X Window System machines and CERN's Web browser
   for NeXT computers) include rudimentary HTML editors in a WYSIWYG
   environment. There are also some WYSIWIG editors available now (e.g.
   HotMetal for Sun Sparcstations, HTML Edit for Macintoshes). You may wish to
   try one of them first before delving into the details of HTML.
   
       You can preview a document in progress with NCSA Mosaic (and     so
     me other Web browsers). Open it with the Open Local     command under
      the File menu.
     
           After you edit the source HTML file, save the changes. Return
        to NCSA Mosaic and Reload the document. The     changes are reflec
     ted in the on-screen display.
     
  THE MINIMAL HTML DOCUMENT
  
   Here is a bare-bones example of HTML:
   
    <TITLE>The simplest HTML example</TITLE>
    <H1>This is a level-one heading</H1>
    Welcome to the world of HTML.
    This is one paragraph.<P>
    And this is a second.<P>

   Click here[45] to see the formatted version of the example.
   
   HTML uses markup tags to tell the Web browser how to display the text. The
   above example uses:
   
      the <TITLE> tag (and corresponding </TITLE>    tag), which specifies the
      title of the document
      
      the <H1> header tag (and corresponding </H1>)
      
      the <P> paragraph-separator tag
      
   HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (<), (a ``less than'' symbol to
   mathematicians), followed by name of the tag and closed by a right angular
   bracket (>). Tags are usually paired, e.g. <H1> and </H1>. The ending tag
   looks just like the starting tag except a slash (/) precedes the text within
   the brackets. In the example, <H1> tells the Web browser to start formatting
   a level-one heading; </H1>tells the browser that the heading is complete.
   
   The primary exception to the pairing rule is the <P>tag. There is no such
   thing as </P>.
   
   NOTE: HTML is not case sensitive. <title>is equivalent to <TITLE> or
   <TiTlE>.
   
   Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers. If a browser does
   not support a tag, it just ignores it.
   
  BASIC MARKUP TAGS
  
    Title
    
   Every HTML document should have a title. A title is generally displayed
   separately from the document and is used primarily for document
   identification in other contexts (e.g., a WAIS search). Choose about half a
   dozen words that describe the document's purpose.
   
       In the X Window System and Microsoft Windows versions of NCSA     M
     osaic, the Document Title field is at the     top of the screen just
     below the pulldown menus. In NCSA     Mosaic for Macintosh, text tagg
     ed as <TITLE>    appears as the window title.
     
    Headings
    
   HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being the most
   prominent. Headings are displayed in larger and/or bolder fonts than normal
   body text. The first heading in each document should be tagged <H1>. The
   syntax of the heading tag is:
   
   <Hy>Text of heading</Hy >
   
   where y is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level of the heading.
   
   For example, the coding for the ``Headings'' section heading above is
   
    <H3>Headings</H3>

      Title versus first heading
      
   In many documents, the first heading is identical to the title. For
   multipart documents, the text of the first heading should be suitable for a
   reader who is already browsing related information (e.g., a chapter title),
   while the title tag should identify the document in a wider context (e.g.,
   include both the book title and the chapter title, although this can
   sometimes become overly long).
   
    Paragraphs
    
   Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in HTML files
   aren't significant. Word wrapping can occur at any point in your source
   file, and multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space. (There are
   couple of exceptions; space following a <P>or <Hy> tag, for example, is
   ignored.) Notice that in the bare-bones example, the first paragraph is
   coded as
   
    Welcome to HTML.
    This is the first paragraph. <P>

   In the source file, there is a line break between the sentences. A Web
   browser ignores this line break and starts a new paragraph only when it
   reaches a <P> tag.
   
   Important: You must separate paragraphs with <P>. The browser ignores any
   indentations or blank lines in the source text. HTML relies almost entirely
   on the tags for formatting instructions, and without the <P> tags, the
   document becomes one large paragraph. (The exception is text tagged as
   ``preformatted,'' which is explained below.) For instance, the following
   would produce identical output as the first bare-bones HTML example:
   
    <TITLE>The simplest HTML example</TITLE><H1>This is a level
    one heading</H1>Welcome to the world of HTML. This is one
    paragraph.<P>And this is a second.<P>

   However, to preserve readability in HTML files, headings should be on
   separate lines, and paragraphs should be separated by blank lines (in
   addition to the <P> tags).
   
       NCSA Mosaic handles <P> by ending the current paragraph     and ins
     erting a blank line.
     
   In HTML+, a successor to HTML currently in development, <P>becomes a
   ``container'' of text, just as the text of a level-one heading is
   ``contained'' within<H1> ... </H1>:
   
    <P>
    This is a paragraph in HTML+.
    </P>

   The difference is that the </P> closing tag can always be omitted. (That is,
   if a browser sees a <P>, it knows that there must be an implied </P> to end
   the previous paragraph.) In other words, in HTML+, <P>is a
   beginning-of-paragraph marker.
   
   The advantage of this change is that you will be able to specify formatting
   options for a paragraph. For example, in HTML+, you will be able to center a
   paragraph by coding
   
    <P ALIGN=CENTER>
    This is a centered paragraph. This is HTML+, so you can't do it yet.

   This change won't effect any documents you write now, and they will continue
   to look just the same with HTML+ browsers.
   
  LINKING TO OTHER DOCUMENTS
  
   The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link regions of text (and
   also images) to another document. The browser highlights these regions
   (usually with color and/or underlines) to indicate that they are hypertext
   links (often shortened to hyperlinks or simply links).
   
   HTML's single hypertext-related tag is <A>, which stands for anchor. To
   include an anchor in your document:
   
      Start the anchor with <A . (There's a space after     the A.)
      
      Specify the document that's being pointed to by entering the parameter
       HREF=_filename_    followed by a closing right angle bracket: >
      
      Enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the current
      document.
      
      Enter the ending anchor tag: </A>.
      
   Here is an sample hypertext reference:
   
    <A HREF=_MaineStats.html_>Maine</A>

   This entry makes the word ``Maine'' the hyperlink to the document
   MaineStats.html, which is in the same directory as the first document. You
   can link to documents in other directories by specifying the relative
   pathfrom the current document to the linked document. For example, a link to
   a file NJStats.html located in the subdirectory AtlanticStateswould be:
   
    <A HREF=_AtlanticStates/NJStats.html_>New Jersey</A>

   These are called relative links. You can also use the absolute pathname of
   the file if you wish. Pathnames use the standard UNIX syntax.
   
    Relative Links Versus Absolute Pathnames
    
   In general, you should use relative links, because
   
      You have less to type.
      
      It's easier to move a group of documents to another location, because
      the relative path names will still be valid.
      
   However, use absolute pathnames when linking to documents that are not
   directly related. For example, consider a group of documents that comprise a
   user manual. Links within this group should be relative links. Links to
   other documents (perhaps a reference to related software) should use full
   path names. This way, if you move the user manual to a different directory,
   none of the links would have to be updated.
   
    Uniform Resource Locator
    
   The World Wide Web uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to specify the
   location of files on other servers. A URL includes the type of resource
   being accessed (e.g., gopher, WAIS), the address of the server, and the
   location of the file. The syntax is:
   
   scheme://host.domain[:port]/path/filename
   
   where scheme is one of
   
  file
                         
                         a file on your local system, or a file on an anonymous
                         FTP server
                         
  http                   a file on a World Wide Web server
                         
  gopher                 a file on a Gopher server
                         
  WAIS                   a file on a WAIS server
                         
  news                   an Usenet newsgroup
                         
  telnet                 a connection to a Telnet-based service
                         
   The port number can generally be omitted. (That means unless someone tells
   you otherwise, leave it out.)
   
   For example, to include a link to this primer in your document, you would
   use
   
    <A HREF = _http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html_>
    NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML</A>

   This would make the text ``NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML'' a hyperlink to
   this document.
   
   For more information on URLs, look at
   
          WWW Names and Addresses, URIs, URLs, URNs[46], written     by people
      at CERN
      
          A Beginner's Guide to URLs[47], located on the NCSA Mosaic     Help
      menu
      
    Links to Specific Sections in Other Documents
    
   Anchors can also be used to move to a particular section in a document.
   Suppose you wish to set a link from document A and a specific section in
   document B. (Call this file documentB.html.) First you need to set up a
   named anchor in document B. For example, to set up an anchor named
   ``Jabberwocky'' to document B, enter
   
    Here's <A NAME = _Jabberwocky_>some text</a>

   Now when you create the link in document A, include not only the filename,
   but also the named anchor, separated by a hash mark (#).
   
    This is my <A HREF = _documentB.html#Jabberwocky_>link</A> to document B.

   Now clicking on the word ``link'' in document A sends the reader directly to
   the words ``some text'' in document B.
   
    Links to Specific Sections Within the Current Document
    
   The technique is exactly the same except the filename is omitted.
   
   For example, to link to the Jabberwocky anchor from within the same file
   (Document B), use
   
    This is <A HREF = _#Jabberwocky_>Jabberwocky link</A> from within Document
B.

Additional Markup Tags

   The preceding is sufficient to produce simple HTML documents. For more
   complex documents, HTML has tags for several types of lists, preformatted
   sections, extended quotations, character formatting, and other items.
   
  LISTS
  
   HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and definition lists.
   
    Unnumbered Lists
    
   To make an unnumbered list,
   
      Start with an opening list <UL> tag.
      
      Enter the <LI> tag followed by the individual     item. (No closing </LI>
      tag is needed.)
      
      End with a closing list </UL> tag.
      
   Below an example two-item list:
   
    <UL>
    <LI> apples
    <LI> bananas
    </UL>

   The output is:
   
      apples
      
      bananas
      
   The <LI> items can contain multiple paragraphs. Just separate the paragraphs
   with the <P> paragraph tags.
   
    Numbered Lists
    
   A numbered list (also called an ordered list, from which the tag name
   derives) is identical to an unnumbered list, except it uses <OL>instead of
   <UL>. The items are tagged using the same <LI> tag. The following HTML code
   
    <OL>
    <LI> oranges
    <LI> peaches
    <LI> grapes
    </OL>

   produces this formatted output:
   
      oranges
      
      peaches
      
      grapes
      
    Definition Lists
    
   A definition list usually consists of alternating a term (abbreviated as DT)
   and a definition (abbreviated as DD). Web browsers generally format the
   definition on a new line.
   
   The following is an example of a definition list:
   
    <DL>
    <DT> NCSA
    <DD> NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
         is located on the campus of the University of Illinois
         at Urbana-Champaign. NCSA is one of the participants in the
         National MetaCenter for Computational Science and Engineering.
    <DT> Cornell Theory Center
    <DD> CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca,
         New York. CTC is another participant in the National MetaCenter
         for Computational Science and Engineering.
    </DL>

   The output looks like:
   
  NCSA                   NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing
                         Applications, is located     on the campus of the
                         University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.     NCSA
                         is one of the participants in the National MetaCenter
                         for     Computational Science and Engineering.
                         
  Cornell Theory Center
                         CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in
                         Ithaca, New     York. CTC is another participant in
                         the National MetaCenter for     Computational Science
                         and Engineering.
                         
   The <DT> and <DD> entries can contain multiple paragraphs (separated by <P>
   paragraph tags), lists, or other definition information.
   
    Nested Lists
    
   Lists can be arbitrarily nested, although in practice you probably should
   limit the nesting to three levels. You can also have a number of paragraphs,
   each containing a nested list, in a single list item.
   
    An example nested list:
   
    <UL>
    <LI> A few New England states:
        <UL>
        <LI> Vermont
        <LI> New Hampshire
        </UL>
    <LI> One Midwestern state:
        <UL>
        <LI> Michigan
        </UL>
    </UL>

   The nested list is displayed as
   
      A few New England states:
      
      Vermont
      
      New Hampshire
      
      One Midwestern state:
      
      Michigan
      
  PREFORMATTED TEXT
  
   Use the <PRE> tag (which stands for ``preformatted'') to generate text in a
   fixed-width font and cause spaces, new lines, and tabs to be significant.
   (That is, multiple spaces are displayed as multiple spaces, and lines break
   in the same locations as in the source HTML file.) This is useful for
   program listings. For example, the following lines
   
    <PRE>
      #!/bin/csh
      cd $SCR
      cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f
      cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile
      fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f
      mya.out
      cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile
      rm *
    </PRE>

   display as
   
      #!/bin/csh
      cd $SCR
      cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f
      cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile
      fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f
      mya.out
      cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile
      rm *

   Hyperlinks can be used within <PRE> sections. You should avoid using other
   HTML tags within <PRE>sections, however.
   
   Note that because <, >, and & have special meaning in HTML, you have to use
   their escape sequences (&lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, respectively) to enter these
   characters. See the section Special Characters[48] for more information.
   
  EXTENDED QUOTATIONS
  
   Use the <BLOCKQUOTE> tag to include quotations in a separate block on the
   screen. Most browsers generally indent to separate it from surrounding text.
   
   An example:
   
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the
    American dream. <P>
    I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and
    live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths
    to be self-evident that all men are created equal. <P>

  ADDRESSES
  
   The <ADDRESS> tag is generally used to specify the author of a document and
   a means of contacting the author (e.g., an email address). This is usually
   the last item in a file.
   
   For example, the last line of the online version of this guide is
   
    <ADDRESS>
    A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu
    </ADDRESS>

   The result is
   
                         A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu
                                                                               
   NOTE: <ADDRESS> is notused for postal addresses. See ``Forced Line Breaks''
   on page 10 to see how to format postal addresses.
   
Character Formatting

   You can code individual words or sentences with special styles. There are
   two types of styles: logical and physical. Logical stylestag text according
   to its meaning, while physical stylesspecify the specific appearance of a
   section. For example, in the preceding sentence, the words ``logical
   styles'' was tagged as a ``definition.'' The same effect (formatting those
   words in italics), could have been achieved via a different tag that
   specifies merely ``put these words in italics.''
   
  PHYSICAL VERSUS LOGICAL: USE LOGICAL STYLES WHEN POSSIBLE
  
   If physical and logical styles produce the same result on the screen, why
   are there both? We devolve, for a couple of paragraphs, into the philosophy
   of SGML, which can be summed in a Zen-like mantra: ``Trust your browser.''
   
   In the ideal SGML universe, content is divorced from presentation. Thus,
   SGML tags a level-one heading as a level-one heading, but does not specify
   that the level-one heading should be, for instance, 24-point bold Times
   centered on the top of a page. The advantage of this approach (it's similar
   in concept to style sheets in many word processors) is that if you decide to
   change level-one headings to be 20-point left-justified Helvetica, all you
   have to do is change the definition of the level-one heading in the
   presentation device (i.e., your World Wide Web browser).
   
   The other advantage of logical tags is that they help enforce consistency in
   your documents. It's easier to tag something as <H1>than to remember that
   level-one headings are 24-point bold Times or whatever. The same is true for
   character styles. For example, consider the <STRONG> tag. Most browsers
   render it in bold text. However, it is possible that a reader would prefer
   that these sections be displayed in red instead. Logical styles offer this
   flexibility.
   
    Logical Styles
    
  <DFN>                  for a word being defined. Typically displayed in
                         italics. (NCSA     Mosaic is a World Wide Web
                         browser.)
                         
  <EM>                   for emphasis. Typically displayed in italics. (Watch
                         out for     pickpockets.)
                         
  <CITE>                 for titles of books, films, etc. Typically displayed
                         in italics.     (A Beginner's Guide to HTML)
                         
  <CODE>                 for snippets of computer code. Displayed in a
                         fixed-width font.     (The <stdio.h> header file)
                         
   <KBD>                 for user keyboard entry. Should be displayed in a bold
                         fixed-width     font, but many browsers render it in
                         the plain fixed-width font.     (Enter passwd to
                         change your password.)
                         
  <SAMP>                 for computer status messages. Displayed in a
                         fixed-width font.     (Segmentation fault: Core
                         dumped.)
                         
  <STRONG>               for strong emphasis. Typically displayed in bold.
                         (Important)
                         
  <VAR>                  for a ``metasyntactic'' variable, where the user is to
                         replace     the variable with a specific instance.
                         Typically displayed in italics.     (rm filename
                         deletes the file.)
                         
    Physical Styles
    
  <B>                    bold text
                         
  <I>                    italic text
                         
  <TT>                   typewriter text, e.g. fixed-width font.
                         
  USING CHARACTER TAGS
  
   To apply a character style,
   
      Start with <tag>, where    tag is the desired character formatting tag,
        to indicate the beginning of the tagged text.
      
      Enter the tagged text.
      
      End the passage with </tag>.
      
  SPECIAL CHARACTERS
  
    Escape Sequences
    
   Four characters of the ASCII character set -- the left angle bracket (<),
   the right angle bracket (>), the ampersand (&) and the double quote (_) --
   have special meaning within HTML and therefore cannot be used ``as is'' in
   text. (The angle brackets are used to indicate the beginning and end of HTML
   tags, and the ampersand is used to indicate the beginning of an escape
   sequence.)
   
   To use one of these characters in an HTML document, you must enter its
   escape sequence instead:
   
  &lt;                   the escape sequence for <
                         
  &gt;                   the escape sequence for >
                         
  &amp;                  the escape sequence for &
                         
  &quot;                 the escape sequence for _
                         
   Additional escape sequences support accented characters. For example:
   
  &ouml;                 the escape sequence for a lowercase o with an umlaut:
                         v
                         
  &ntilde;               the escape sequence for a lowercase n with an tilde: q
                         
                         
  &Egrave;               the escape sequence for an uppercase E with a grave
                         accent: H
                         
    A full  list of supported characters[49] can be found at CERN.
   
   NOTE: Unlike the rest of HTML, the escape sequences are case sensitive. You
   cannot, for instance, use &LT; instead of &lt;.
   
    Forced Line Breaks
    
   The <BR> tag forces a line break with no extra space between lines. (By
   contrast, most browsers format the <P>paragraph tag with an additional blank
   line to more clearly indicate the beginning the new paragraph.)
   
   One use of <BR> is in formatting addresses:
   
    National Center for Supercomputing Applications<BR>
    605 East Springfield Avenue<BR>
    Champaign, Illinois 61820-5518<BR>

    Horizontal Rules
    
   The <HR> tag produces a horizontal line the width of the browser window.
   
In-line Images

   Most Web browsers can display in-line images (that is, images next to text)
   that are in X Bitmap (XBM) or GIF format. Each image takes time to process
   and slows down the initial display of the document, so generally you should
   not include too many or overly large images.
   
   To include an in-line image, use
   
    <IMG SRC=image_URL>

   where image_URL is the URL of the image file. The syntax for IMG SRC URLs is
   identical to that used in an anchor HREF. If the image file is a GIF file,
   then the filename part of image_URL must end with .gif. Filenames of X
   Bitmap images must end with .xbm.
   
   By default the bottom of an image is aligned with the text as shown in this
   paragraph.
   
   Add the ALIGN=TOPoption if you want the browser to align adjacent text with
   the top of the image as shown in this paragraph. The full in-line image tag
   with the top alignment is:
   
    <IMG ALIGN=top SRC=image_URL>

   ALIGN=MIDDLEaligns the text with the center of the image.
   
  ALTERNATE TEXT FOR BROWSERS THAT CAN'T DISPLAY IMAGES
  
   Some World Wide Web browsers, primarily those that run on VT100 terminals,
   cannot display images. The ALT option allows you to specify text to be
   displayed when an image cannot be. For example:
   
    <IMG SRC = _UpArrow.gif_ ALT = _Up_>

   where UpArrow.gif is the picture of an upward pointing arrow. With NCSA
   Mosaic and other graphics-capable viewers, the user sees the up arrow
   graphic. With a VT100 browser, such as lynx, the user sees the word ``Up.''
   
External Images, Sounds, and Animations

   You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a user
   activates a link on either a word or a smaller, in-line version of the image
   included in your document. This is considered an external image and is
   useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading of the main document with
   large in-line images.
   
   To include a reference to an external image, use
   
    <A HREF = image_URL>link anchor</A>

   Use the same syntax is for links to external animations and sounds. The only
   difference is the file extension of the linked file. For example,
   
   <A HREF = _QuickTimeMovie.mov_>link anchor</A>
   
   specifies a link to a QuickTime movie. Some common file types and their
   extensions are:
   
  File Type              Extension
                         
  Plain text             .txt
                         
  HTML document          .html
                         
  GIF image              .gif
                         
  TIFF image             .tiff
                         
  XBM bitmap image       .xbm
                         
  JPEG image             .jpg or .jpeg
                         
  PostScript file        .ps
                         
  AIFF sound             .aiff
                         
  AU sound               .au
                         
  QuickTime movie        .mov
                         
  MPEG movie             .mpeg or .mpg
                         
   Make sure your intended audience has the necessary viewers. Most UNIX
   workstations, for instance, cannot view QuickTime movies.
   
Troubleshooting

  AVOID OVERLAPPING TAGS
  
   Consider this snippet of HTML:
   
    <B>This is an example of <DFN>overlapping</B> HTML tags.</DFN>

   The word ``overlapping'' is contained within both the <B>and <DFN> tags. How
   does the browser format it? You won't know until you look, and different
   browsers will likely react differently. In general, avoid overlapping tags.
   
  EMBED ANCHORS AND CHARACTER TAGS, BUT NOTHING ELSE
  
   It is acceptable to embed anchors within another HTML element:
   
    <H1><A HREF = _Destination.html_>My heading</A></H1>

   Do not embed a heading or another HTML element within an anchor:
   
    <A HREF = _Destination.html_>
    <H1>My heading</H1>
    </A>

   Although most browsers currently handle this example, it is forbidden by the
   official HTML and HTML+ specifications, and will not work with future
   browsers.
   
   Character tags modify the appearance of other tags:
   
    <UL><LI><B>A bold list item</B>
        <UL>
        <LI><I>An italic list item</I>
    </UL>

   However, avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For example, it
   is tempting to embed a heading within a list, in order to make the font size
   larger:
   
    <UL><LI><H1>A large heading</H1>
        <UL>
        <LI><H2>Something slightly smaller</H2>
    </UL>

   Although some browsers, such as NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System, format
   this construct quite nicely, it is unpredictable (because it is undefined)
   what other browsers will do. For compatibility with all browsers, avoid
   these kinds of constructs.
   
   What's the difference between embedding a <B> within a <LI> tag as opposed
   to embedding a <H1>within a <LI>? This is again a question of SGML. The
   semantic meaning of <H1> is that it's the main heading of a document and
   that it should be followed by the content of the document.Thus it doesn't
   make sense to find a <H1>within a list.
   
   Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. You might expect
   that
   
    <B><I>some text</I></B>

   would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsers
   interpret only the innermost tag (here, the italics).
   
  CHECK YOUR LINKS
  
   When an <IMG> tag points at an image that does not exist, a dummy image is
   substituted. When this happens, make sure that the referenced image does in
   fact exist, that the hyperlink has the correct information in the URL, and
   that the file permission is set appropriately (world-readable).
   
A Longer Example

   Here is a longer example of an HTML document:
   
    <HEAD>
    <TITLE>A Longer Example</TITLE>
    </HEAD>
    <BODY>
    <H1>A Longer Example</H1>
    This is a simple HTML document. This is the first
    paragraph. <P>
    This is the second paragraph, which shows special effects.  This is a
    word in <I>italics</I>.  This is a word in <B>bold</B>.
    Here is an in-lined GIF image: <IMG SRC = _myimage.gif_>.
    <P>
    This is the third paragraph, which demonstrates links.  Here is
    a hypertext link from the word <A HREF = _subdir/myfile.html_>foo</A>
    to a document called _subdir/myfile.html_. (If you
    try to follow this link, you will get an error screen.) <P>
    <H2>A second-level header</H2>
    Here is a section of text that should display as a
    fixed-width font: <P>
    <PRE>
        On the stiff twig up there
        Hunches a wet black rook
        Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain ...
    </PRE>
    This is a unordered list with two items: <P>
    <UL>
    <LI> cranberries
    <LI> blueberries
    </UL>
    This is the end of my example document. <P>
    <ADDRESS>Me (me@mycomputer.univ.edu)</ADDRESS>
    </BODY>

   Click here[50] to see the formatted version.
   
   In addition to tags already discussed, this example also uses the <HEAD> ...
   </HEAD> and <BODY> ... </BODY>tags, which separate the document into
   introductory information about the document and the main text of the
   document. These tags don't change the appearance of the formatted document
   at all, but are useful for several purposes (for example, NCSA Mosaic for
   Macintosh 2.0, for example, allows you to browse just the header portion of
   document before deciding whether to download the rest), and it is
   recommended that you use these tags.
