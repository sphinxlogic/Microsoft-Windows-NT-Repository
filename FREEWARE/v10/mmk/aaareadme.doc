Matt's Make Utility (MMK)

MMK is a "make" utility for VMS systems.  It is used for building software
systems based on a "description file" (or "makefile") you create that lists
the sources and objects of a system and the dependencies between them.

MMK provides a subset of the functionality of Digital's DEC/Module Management
System (DEC/MMS); the description files MMK uses are syntactically compatible
with DEC/MMS.

MMK runs on VAX/VMS, OpenVMS VAX, and OpenVMS AXP systems.  It requires
VAX/VMS V5.0 or later, or OpenVMS AXP V1.0 or later.


MMK is written entirely in C.  Complete source code is provided.
