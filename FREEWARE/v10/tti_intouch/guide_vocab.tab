!  Contexts: open, include, exclude, sort, break, list, lookup, all
!            List all contexts that apply.  Otherwise word will be used
!            as is.  When a word and context is matched, the given synonym
!            is substituted.  Where a word has different meanings in different
!            contexts, list the exceptions first, then the norm (see "where")
!
!  Synonyms: May be $first-word (establishes a context)
!            May be #keyword (special meaning in certain contexts)
!            May be blank (means throw away that word in that context)
!            May be another word to substitute in the given context
!                Where punctuation is deleted in certain contexts, note
!                that text between quotes is not altered.
