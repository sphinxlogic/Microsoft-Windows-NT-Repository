               Installing Alpha AXP BLISS V1.3-023

   BLISS-32EN and BLISS-64EN are native compilers running under
   OpenVMS for Alpha AXP and producing object files for OpenVMS
   for Alpha AXP.

   To install Alpha AXP BLISS, you must either be logged in to your
   SYSTEM account, or to an account with SETPRV privileges.  Then use the
   command:

           $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL BLSALPHAN013 <location of kit>


   VMSINSTAL may ask you several questions during the installation.  You
   can get more information about any of these by responding to the
   question with a question mark ("?").  Note that there doesn't seem to
   be any problem with installing Alpha AXP BLISS while there are other
   users on the system.

   At the completion of the installation procedure, the new files will be
   available in the appropriate system directories and the system command
   tables will have been updated.

   If you are installing on a cluster, you will want to update the DCL
   command tables so all nodes will know about new compiler switches
   (e.g., BLISS/A32).  To do this, enter the following:

           $ mcr sysman
           SYSMAN> set environment/cluster
           SYSMAN> do install replace sys$share:dcltables

   No other action is necessary; this configuration will still be valid
   after a reboot.

   Please note that the Alpha AXP BLISS kits, unlike the VAX BLISS kit,
   do not create the system libraries STARLET and LIB.
