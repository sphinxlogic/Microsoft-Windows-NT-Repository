
	The OpenVMS WHO utility is packaged as a standard VMSINSTALL kit and
must be installed to work. Both the VAX and AXP versions of WHO are included in
this kit. The WHO VMSINSTALL procedure will automatically install the proper
version of WHO (VAX or AXP) for your system. The WHO executable is linked on
your system. WHO056 is supported on OpenVMS VAX V6.0 - V6.2 and on OpenVMS 
Alpha V1.5-1HW - V6.2.

	In order to use WHO to a remote Node, WHO must be installed on the
remote node. Simply install the provided WHO kit on the target node. The system
must be rebooted for the WHO network functions to become active.  Please be 
sure and read the release notes.  WHO includes a standard OpenVMS help file
that explains all of the WHO functions and parameters.

	WHO uses DECnet as the only supported transport. Therefore DECnet must
be active on your system for any of the WHO remote functions.

	To install WHO:

	$@sys$update:vmsinstal who056 freewarecd:[who056]
