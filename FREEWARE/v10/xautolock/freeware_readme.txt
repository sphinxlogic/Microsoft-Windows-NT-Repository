XAUTOLOCK, MOTIF TOYS, Program to automatically lock the display

Xautolock is a program which monitors console activity, and starts up
a program of  your choice if  nothing  happens  during a certain time
interval.  You can use this to automatically start up a screen locker
in case you tend  to forget to do so  manually before having a coffee
break.
