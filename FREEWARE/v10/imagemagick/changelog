    rjohnson@shell.com).

  o You can now use wildcards under VMS (suggested by

    reduction option was specified (-colors).  This affected images written as
    AVS, CMYK, and RGB.

  o Modified various sources to reduce lint warnings.


ImageMagick 2.2.2

  o Dithering did not work properly on the Cray (due to right shift problem).

  o In most cases dithering requires 1/2 as much memory as previously.

  o Dithering was sped up by ~15%.

  o Occasionally the quantization error was reported incorrectly.


ImageMagick 2.2.1

  o The number of colors reported with the -verbose option was on occasion
    incorrect.

  o Color quantization was improved and in some cases sped up ~10%.

  o Cleaned up image rotation code.

  o Added -shear to mogrify options.

  o Added a file type of HISTOGRAM to convert.

  o Sometimes PBM image files did not have the correct number of bytes.

  o Color reduced PPM images were being written at the full color resolution.

  o Keypresses are no longer accepted during image configuration.

  o Red, green, and blue values of a X constant image were set to the red
    intensity of the background color.

  o Cropped images did not show up correctly in the panning icon.

  o `animate' no longer shows images out-of-order if the image scene number is
    absent (thanks to kent@oddjob.uchicago.edu).

  o ImageMagick now recognizes the X resource class with the first letter of
    the client capitalized, i.e. 'Display.Visual: default' (thanks to
    dws@ssec.wisc.edu).


ImageMagick 2.2

  o When displaying a composite MIFF image created with `montage', button 3
    no longer displays a magnify window.  Instead the tile at the mouse
    location is displayed.  When the tile image is exited, the composite
    image reappears.  This is effectively a visual image directory.

  o `montage' has a new gravity option for placing an image within a tile of
    the composite, i.e. CenterGravity.

  o `montage' has a new compose option for specifying which composite
    operation to use.

  o `montage' creates composite images with the `montage' keyword.

  o Updated MIFF manual page to reflect 'montage' image header keyword.

  o Add -colormap to `mogrify.'  Use to color reduce an image to a set of
    colors you choose.

  o Some compilers have read-only strings.   ImageMagick no longer writes on
    read-only strings.

  o For colormapped X servers, the color reduction has been sped up by trading
    image quality for processing time.  See the README for details.

  o Latin1Upper was declared wrong in X.h.

  o Added unistd.h to display.h for strict ANSI compilers.

  o Changed long to time_t for calls to C time routine.

  o Multi-part GIF's can now be displayed or animated.

  o Fixed segmentation fault when reading multi-part images with animate,
    montage, or mogrify.

  o Multi-part MIFF images have the correct file name now.

  o An expose event for the Magnify window may occur before it is mapped.
    This caused display to fail on Solburne and HP's.

  o Using `-colorspace gray' with 'convert' correctly produces grayscale
    images.

  o Images are sorted by intensity for shared colormapped visuals.  Some
    intensity intervals are made "more popular".  This gives better image
    results when sharing colors with other applications.

  o All utilities correctly read multi-part TIFF images.

  o Image pixmap was not being updated correctly when pan icon appears
    (thanks to dws@ssec.wisc.edu).

  o Fixed ANSI warning on image composite code.

  o Panning uses a pixmap for faster panning speed.

  o Rotate.c now uses a table to force range limits.

  o range table in quantize.c is allocated from the heap instead of the stack.

  o adjusted the sensitivity for automatic dithering.  Some JPEG images were
    not being dithered.


ImageMagick 2.0

  o Dirk Wetzel <wetzel@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de> fixed the select statement
    in animate.c.

  o Eric Haines <erich@eye.com> fixed ReadRLEImage in decode.c.  It previously
    did not check to see if the background color was present in the image.
