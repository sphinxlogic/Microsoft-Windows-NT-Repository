XFISH, MOTIF TOYS, Fishtank Background for X11
!
This is the classic fishtank background for Motif.
You can simply run it, or copy the executable to
DECW$EXAMPLES, and the file VUE$XFISH.COM to VUE$LIBRARY
and add XFISH command to the menu.  The command
file sets the priority low, so that it only eats
idle CPU time, and slows down the updating a bit.
