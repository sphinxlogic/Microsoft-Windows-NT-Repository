This is a quick hack to force a remote system out of the cluster. It can
be used when a remote system hangs for example at high IPL (bewteen 3
and 6), or when the SMIserver does not respond.

It uses an internal routine in the connection manager. There is one
problem with this approach, and that is that this routine (CNX$DISC_REMOVE)
is not available in any symboltable which we can include in the link.
So what we do is use MATCHC to find the sequence of instructions around
the place where we expect the code, and issue an error if we can't find it.
If we got the address, we JSB to it and let that routine do the dirty work.
The net result will be that the remote node will CLUEXIT.

This is strictly a HACK, and as such it may fail at any time. Use at
your own risk. (I included a check to prevent removal of the node from
which this program runs, although it was fun to get a system in a state
in which the only clusternode was removed from the cluster and in longbreak,
without quorum....). It was tested on VMS V5.5 thru T6.2-FT1.
