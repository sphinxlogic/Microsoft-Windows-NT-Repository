------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO1.  What is the scope of comp.os.vms?

The comp.os.vms newsgroup is the primary newsgroup for discussion of 
Digital's OpenVMS operating system and the computer systems on which it
runs.  Questions about layered products which run on OpenVMS are also
welcome, though many of them (in particular, language compilers and
database systems) have more specific newsgroups.  If a question has
some relationship to OpenVMS, it belongs here.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO2.  What other newsgroups carry VMS-related information?

The vmsnet.* hierarchy, run by DECUS, contains several newsgroups of
interest, including vmsnet.misc and vmsnet.alpha, the latter being mostly
devoted to Alpha AXP topics.  There's also vmsnet.sources (and 
vmsnet.sources.d) to which sources for or pointers to freeware are posted.
See the separate "What is VMSNET" monthly posting for further details.

The comp.sys.dec newsgroup carries discussions about all Digital systems
as well as about Digital itself.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO3.  What is INFO-VAX?

INFO-VAX is a mailing list which is bidirectionally gatewayed to the
comp.os.vms newsgroup.  This means that postings to comp.os.vms get
automatically sent to INFO-VAX subscribers and messages sent to the INFO-VAX
list are automatically posted to comp.os.vms.  INFO-VAX can be a useful way
to participate in the newsgroup if you can't access the group directly
through a news reader.

An important point to keep in mind is that propagation delays vary, both
within the newsgroup and with INFO-VAX mailings.  It's possible that
postings may not be delivered for several days and some may appear out of
order.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO4.  How do I subscribe to or unsubscribe from INFO-VAX?

The address for subscription requests, as well as notes intended for the
moderator, is Info-VAX-Request@Mvb.Saic.Com.  Subscription requests are handled
automatically by a mail server.  This mail server ignores the subject line and
processes each line of the message as a command.  The syntax for subscribing
and unsubscribing to this mailing list is as follows:
 
SUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX      (ADD is a valid synonym)
UNSUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX	(REMOVE, SIGNOFF, and SIGN-OFF are valid synonyms)
 
Case is irrelevant and attempts to fetch a copy of the mailing list will be
rejected (I consider the information to be confidential).  Any message not
understood by the mailserver will be forwarded to a human (allegedly) for
manual processing.
				[Mark.Berryman@Mvb.Saic.Com]

If you are on Bitnet, send a mail message containing the text 
"SUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX" to LISTSERV@(nearest listserv system).  To unsubscribe,
send a message containing the text "SIGNOFF INFO-VAX" to the *SAME* listserv
address. 

If you are on the Internet in the UK, send a message containing the
word SUBSCRIBE (or UNSUBSCRIBE) to info-vax-request@ncdlab.ulcc.ac.uk.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO5.  How do I submit a question or a response?

If you are using a news reader, post your question to comp.os.vms.  If you
want to submit through INFO-VAX, send the message to Info-VAX@mvb.saic.com.

Before posting, please use available local resources, such as the manuals,
HELP and this FAQ first.  Also make a point of reading the release notes for
the product you're using, generally placed in SYS$HELP.  Often you'll find
the answer and will save time and effort for all concerned.

When posting, please consider the following suggestions:

    1.  Include a valid e-mail address in the text of your posting or
        in a "signature" appended to the end.  Reply-to addresses in
	headers often get garbled.

    2.  If you are submitting a question, please be as specific as you
        can.  Include relevant information such as processor type, product
	versions (VMS and layered products that apply) and a short,
	reproducible example of problems.  Say what you've tried so far,
	so that effort isn't duplicated.  Keep in mind that there's not yet 
	a telepathy protocol for the Internet - the more detailed your
	description, the better people can help you.

    3.  If responding to a posting, include in your reply only as much of
        the original posting as is necessary to establish context.  As
	a guideline, consider that if you've included more text than you've 
	added, you've possibly included too much.  Never include signatures 
	and other irrelevant material.

    4.  Be polite.  If the question isn't worded the way you think is
        correct or doesn't include the information you want, try to
	imagine what the problem might be if viewed from the poster's
	perspective.  Requests for additional information are often
	better sent through mail rather than posted to the newsgroup.

    5.  If you have a problem with Digital (or any vendor's) product,
        use the appropriate support channel.  Don't assume that
	newsgroup postings will get read or responded to by the appropriate
	developers.

INTRO6.  What is DECUS?

DECUS, the Digital Equipment Computer Users Society, is a World Wide
organization of Information Technology professionals interested in the
products, services, and technologies of Digital Equipment Corporation and
related vendors.
   
Membership in the Chapter is free and provides participants with the means
to enhance their professional development, forums for technical training,
mechanisms for obtaining up-to-date information, advocacy programs, and
opportunities for informal disclosure and interaction with professional
colleagues of like interest.

For further information, see the separate monthly "What is DECUS" posting, or
refer to the DECUS WWW server at http://www.decus.org .

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS1.   What is OpenVMS?  What is its history?

OpenVMS, originally called VMS (Virtual Memory System), was first conceived in
1976 as a new operating system for Digital's new, 32-bit, virtual memory line
of computers, eventually named VAX (Virtual Address eXtension).  The first VAX
model, the 11/780, was code-named "Star", hence the code name for the VMS
operating system, "Starlet", a name that remains to this day the name for the
system library files (STARLET.OLB, etc.).  VMS version X0.5 was the first
released to customers, in support of the hardware beta test of the VAX-11/780,
in 1977.  VAX/VMS Version V1.0 shipped in 1978, along with the first
revenue-ship 11/780s.

OpenVMS was designed entirely within Digital Equipment Corporation.  The
principal designers were Dave Cutler and Dick Hustvedt.  OpenVMS was conceived
as a 32-bit, virtual memory successor to Digital's RSX-11M operating system
for the PDP-11.  Many of the original designers and programmers of OpenVMS
had worked previously on RSX-11M, and many concepts from RSX-11M were carried
over to OpenVMS.

OpenVMS is a 32-bit, multitasking, multiprocessing virtual memory operating
system. Current implementations run on Digital's VAX and Alpha AXP computer
systems.

Product Descriptions at:
  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/SPD/25-01-39.txt   (OpenVMS VAX)
  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/SPD/41-87-02.txt   (OpenVMS AXP)

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS2.   What is the difference between VMS and OpenVMS?

VMS and OpenVMS are two names for the same operating system.  Originally,
the operating system was called VAX-11/VMS; it changed to VAX/VMS at
around VAX/VMS V2.0.  When the VMS operating system was ported to the
Alpha AXP platform, it was renamed OpenVMS, for both VAX and AXP, in part
to signify the high degree of support for industry standards such as
POSIX, which provides many features of UNIX systems.  An OpenVMS license
allows you to install and run POSIX for OpenVMS at no additional charge;
all you need is the media and documentation which can be found on the
Consolidated Distribution and On-Line Documentation CD-ROMs.  For more
information on POSIX for VMS see:
  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/pr-news/92060311FS.txt

What became confusing is that the OpenVMS name was introduced first
for OpenVMS AXP V1.0 causing the widespread misimpression that OpenVMS
was for AXP only, while "regular VMS" was for VAX.  In fact, Digital
officially changed the name of the VAX operating system as of V5.5,
though the name did not start to be actually used in the product until
V6.0.

The proper names for OpenVMS on the two platforms are "OpenVMS VAX"
and "OpenVMS AXP".

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS3.   How do I port from VMS to OpenVMS?

You already did.  Wasn't that easy?  (See question VMS2.)

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS4.   Which is better - OpenVMS or UNIX?

This question comes up periodically, usually asked by new subscribers who are
long-time UNIX users. Sometimes, it is ignored totally; other times, it leads
to a long series of repetitive messages that convince no one and usually carry
little if any new information.  Please do everyone a favor and avoid
re-starting this perpetual, fruitless debate.
					[leichter@lrw.com]

Seriously, OpenVMS and the better implementations of UNIX are all fine
operating systems, each with its strengths and weaknesses.  If you're
in a position where you need to choose, select the one that best fits
your own requirements, considering, for example, whether or not the
layered products or specific OS features you want are available.

See also question VMS2 for information on POSIX for OpenVMS which provides
significant UNIX functionality on OpenVMS.

------------------------------------------------------------
AXP1.   What do the letters AXP stand for?

While there are many fanciful "definitions" which have circulated widely,
the truth is that AXP is not an abbreviation nor an acronym; the letters
do not mean anything.  They are just three letters chosen to form a
trademark.

When it came time to chose a "marketing name" for the Alpha AXP line,
Digital was in a quandary.  The internal "code name" for the project,
Alpha, was widely known and would seem the ideal choice, but it was already
in common use by a number of other companies and could not be trademarked.
A well-known "name search" firm was hired and was asked to come up with
two lists of possible names.  The first list was intended to evoke the
feeling of "extension to VAX", while the second list was to suggest
"not a VAX".  Unfortunately, none of the choices offered were any good;
for example, "VAX 2000" was found on the first list while the second list
contained "MONDO" (later to be used for a kids' soft drink).

Shortly before announcement, a decision was made to name the new line ARA,
for Advanced RISC Architecture.  However, a Digital employee in Israel
quickly pointed out that this name, if pronounced in the "obvious" manner,
sounded very much like an Arabic word with decidely unfortunate connotations.
Eventually, AXP was selected; the architecture would be referred to as
"Alpha AXP" whereas products themselves would use just "AXP".

Despite all this, everyone went on calling the new line "Alpha".  Digital
has recognized this by coining a new "AlphaGeneration" trademark to apply
to all products (hardware, software and services) related to the Alpha AXP
line.

------------------------------------------------------------
AXP2.   What are the OpenVMS differences between VAX and AXP?

Very few.  As of OpenVMS V6.1, the VAX and AXP platforms are very close
to "feature parity".  Most applications can just be recompiled and
run.  Some differences to be aware of:

    - The default double-precision floating type on OpenVMS AXP
      is VAX G_float, whereas on VAX it is usually D_float.  D_float
      is available on AXP, but D_float values are converted to
      G_float for computations and then converted back to D_float
      when stored.  Because the G_float type has three fewer fraction
      bits than D_float, some applications may get different results.
      IEEE float types are also available on OpenVMS AXP.

    - Data alignment is extremely important for best performance on
      AXP.  This means that data items should be allocated at
      addresses which are exact multiples of their sizes.  Quadword
      alignment will offer the best performance, especially for
      character values and those smaller than 32 bits.  Compilers
      will naturally align variables where they can and will issue
      warnings if they detect unaligned data items.

    - DEC C is the only C compiler Digital offers on OpenVMS AXP.
      It is compatible with DEC C on OpenVMS VAX, but is somewhat
      different from the older VAX C compiler most people are familiar with.
      Read up on the /EXTERN_MODEL and /STANDARD qualifiers to avoid
      the most common problems.

    - The page size on AXP systems is variable, but is at least 8K bytes.
      This can have some effect on applications which use the $CRMPSC
      system service as well as on the display of available memory
      pages.  The page size is available from $GETSYI(SYI$_PAGE_SIZE).

There are also a number of manuals which discuss migration to AXP.

    - "A Comparison of System Management on OpenVMS AXP and OpenVMS VAX"
    - "Migrating to an OpenVMS AXP System: Planning for Migration"
    - "Migrating to an OpenVMS AXP System: Porting VAX MACRO Code"
    - "Migrating to an OpenVMS AXP System: Recompiling and Relinking"

These are part of the "AXP Migration Kit" (which is part of the "Programming
Kit" - which in turn is part of the "Standard Set" if ordering documentation.)
Check out the "Overview of OpenVMS Documentation" book on the Bookreader-based
doc set included on the OpenVMS AXP V6.1 distribution CD for part numbers of
both assorted "kits" and/or individual manuals.

------------------------------------------------------------
AXP3.   Are there Alpha AXP systems on the net I can try out?

Yes.  Two OpenVMS AXP and two DEC OSF/1 AXP systems are available.  Each
has a wide variety of layered products installed and they can be used to
test or port applications or just to "try it out".  The systems are:

    OpenVMS:
	    axpvms.pa.dec.com
	    axpvms.cc.utexas.edu

    OSF/1:
	    axposf.pa.dec.com
	    axposf.stanford.edu

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT1.  What is an installed image?

The term "install" has two distinct meanings in OpenVMS.  The first relates to
"installing a product", which is done with either the SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL.COM
command procedure or the POLYCENTER Software Installation (PCSI) utility 
(PRODUCT command).  The second meaning relates to the use of the INSTALL
utility, which is what concerns us here.

The INSTALL utility is used to identify to OpenVMS a specific copy of an
image, either executable or shareable, which is to be given some set of
enhanced properties.  For example, when you issue the SET PASSWORD command,
the image SYS$SYSTEM:SETP0.EXE is run.  That image needs to have elevated
privileges to perform its function.

The other important attribute is /SHARED.  This means that shareable parts
of the image (typically read-only code and data) are loaded into memory
only once and are shared among all users on a system.  Executable images
can be installed /SHARED as well as shareable library images.  (The term
"shareable" has dual meanings here, too.  See the OpenVMS Programming
Concepts Manual for further details.)

It's important to note that there is no such thing as "installing a shareable
image with privileges".  The INSTALL utility will let you do it, but the
privileges you specify will be ignored.  To have a callable routine run with
enhanced privileges that are not available to its caller, you must construct
your routines as "user-written system services" and install the shareable
image with the /PROTECT qualifier.  See the OpenVMS Programming Concepts
Manual for more information on user-written system services.  Note also
that in many cases the need to grant privileges to an image can be replaced
with the use of the "Protected Subsystems" feature that grants a rights
identifier to an image.  See the OpenVMS Guide to System Security for
information on Protected Subsystems.

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT2.  Are there any known viruses for OpenVMS?

Viruses are very common on PCs because the PC operating systems such as MS-DOS
and MacOS do not implement any sort of scheme to protect the operating system
or the file system against hostile action by programs.  On these operating
systems, any running program can subvert the operating system and take over
the hardware, at which point it can do anything it wishes, including hiding
copies of itself in other programs or in the file system.

This is not possible on VMS, Unix, MVS, and Windows NT, for two reasons.
First, the operating system runs in a privileged mode in memory that is
protected against modification by normal user programs.  Any old program
cannot take over the hardware as it can on PC operating systems.  Secondly,
VMS, Unix, MVS, and NT have file systems that can be set up so that
non-privileged programs cannot modify system programs and files on disk.  Both
of these protection schemes mean that traditional PC virus schemes don't work
on these OSes.

It is possible for VMS, etc., to be infected by viruses, but to do so, the
program containing the virus must be run from a user account that has
amplified privileges.  As long as the system administrator is careful that
only trusted applications are run from such accounts (and this is generally
the case), there is no danger from viruses.

To protect against viruses and other attempts at system interference or
misuse, follow the recommendations in the "OpenVMS Guide to System  Security". 
You may also want to consider optional software products which can monitor
your system for intrusion or infection attempts.  Digital offers the 
following products in this area:

  DECinspect Intrusion Detector

MGMT3.  How do I mount an ISO-9660 CD on OpenVMS?

ISO-9660 support was added in the following releases:

    OpenVMS VAX V6.0
    OpenVMS AXP V1.5
    OpenVMS VAX V5.5, use F11CD kit from InfoServer CD, or
                      Consolidated Distribution CD under InfoServer, or
		      Digital Customer Support - CSCPAT #1071012

Here's how to do it:

    $ MOUNT/MEDIA_FORMAT=CDROM  device-name[:] [volume-label]

Please refer to the OpenVMS MOUNT Utility Manual, especially the section
regarding the MOUNT qualifier /UNDEFINED_FAT. 

From the OpenVMS release notes:

  Because ISO-9660 media can be mastered from platforms that do not support
  semantics of files containing predefined record formats, you may encounter
  ISO-9660 CD-ROMs with files that contain records for which no record format
  was specified.

An example which works for most CD-ROMs is:

    $ MOUNT/MEDIA_FORMAT=CDROM/UNDEFINED_FAT=STREAM:2048 DUA0: FREEWARE

This /UNDEFINED_FAT qualifier states, "For any file whose file attributes are
'undefined', return file attributes of 'stream', maximum record length 2048".

MAIL1.  How do I send Internet mail?

There is no one answer to this question.  Internet mail is built upon the
TCP/IP protocols, which are not directly supported by VMS.  A number of
implementations of TCP/IP for VMS are available, from Digital, from a number
of other vendors, and even in a free "support it yourself" form.  The MAIL
program that comes with VMS does not directly support the mail format used on
the Internet, but various programs have been written that use MAIL's "foreign
protocol" facility to provide such support.  To send mail through a foreign
protocol by using an address syntax like IN%"fred@fred-host.flint.com".  You
*must* include the quotation marks  Between them is the address in the format
used by mail programs that support the Internet directly.  The IN% - short for
INternet - names the foreign protocol.  On some systems, you use MX% or SMTP%
instead. (MX is a widely used, free, mail handler; see question  SOFT1. SMTP%
is used by Digital's UCX TCP/IP product)  Other systems may use some other
name.  If none of these prefixes work, ask your system manager for assistance.
					[leichter@lrw.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL2.  How do I get IN% or MX% added automatically to Internet addresses?

Get the MAILSHR_PATCH package (there's one each for VAX and AXP) from the 
WKU FILESERV server (see question SOFT1.)

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL3.  How do I automatically append a signature file to my mail messages?

The basic MAIL utility which is shipped with VMS does not have an intrinsic
mechanism for adding signature files.  If you're using an enhanced mail
handling package (e.g PMDF), however, it may have provisions for adding
signature files to all messages it handles - check the documentation for
details.  In addition, it's common practice to use an editor to handle
addition of `quotation marks' (e.g. >) and signature files to mail messages
and news postings.  There are several implementations of this for different
editors available on the net; for one example, see the MAIL_EDIT package
available at 
  ftp://narnia.memst.edu/mail_edit_v1-4.zip
					[bailey@genetics.upenn.edu]

Define the logical MAIL$EDIT to a COM-file, which looks something like
the following:

$ IF P1 .NES. ""
$ THEN
$    COPY 'P1',<signaturefile> 'P2'
$ ELSE
$    COPY <signaturefile> 'P2'
$ ENDIF
$ DEFINE/NOLOG SYS$INPUT SYS$COMMAND
$ <editorname> 'P2'
$ EXIT

Where <signaturefile> is the name of the signature-file (including directory
and disk) and <editorname> is EDIT/EDT or EDIT/TPU (or your favorite editor).
					[ARNE@ko.hhs.dk]

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL4.  Do I have to use VMS MAIL?  I like my Unix mailer better.

Several Unix mailers have been ported to VMS, some by the vendors of specific
TCP/IP packages, some by users who have made them freely available.  See the
documentation for your TCP/IP package, and refer to question SOFT1 for
information about the availability of the free ports.
					[leichter@lrw.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL5.  How can I forward my mail?  Can I forward it to an Internet address?

You can use the SET FORWARD command within MAIL to specify where you want all
your mail forwarded to.  Use SHOW FORWARD to see your current forwarding.  To
cancel all forwarding, type SET NOFORWARD.

You can forward your mail to an Internet address, but you have to be careful
because of the way MAIL handles special characters, such as quotation marks.
First, determine the address you would use to send mail to the place you want
to forward to - say, IN%"fred@fred-host.flint.com".  Take that string and
*double all the quotation marks*, producing IN%""fred@fred-host.flint.com"".
Finally, wrap quotation marks around the outside and use the the result with
SET FORWARD:

	MAIL>SET FORWARD "IN%""fred@fred-host.flint.com"""

If you do SHOW FORWARD, you should now see:

	Your mail is being forwarded to IN%"fred@fred-host.flint.com".
					[leichter@lrw.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL6.  How can I forward my mail to a list of addresses?

VMS MAIL does not support forwarding a message to more than one address.
(Older versions of MAIL allowed you to specify such forwarding, but it never
worked correctly.)

Many of the TCP/IP mail packages support forwarding to mailing lists, as does
the free MX mail handling system and the DELIVER mail "extender".  See the
documentation of your TCP/IP package and question SOFT1.
					[leichter@lrw.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL7.  MAIL keeps saying I have new messages, but I don't.  What do I do?

The count of new mail messages is kept separately from your mail folder
in SYS$SYSTEM:VMSMAIL_PROFILE.DATA.  It sometimes happens that this count
differs from what's in your mail folder.  If this happens, go into MAIL
and repeat the READ/NEW command until you see no new mail messages.  Then
enter the command one more time.  This will resynchronize the counters.

------------------------------------------------------------
UTIL1.  How do I play an audio CD on my workstation?

If you've installed the DECwindows examples, you'll find
DECW$CDPLAYER.C, .DAT, .EXE, .UIL, and .UID.  Copy the .UID and .DAT
files to DECW$USER_DEFAULTS: (typically SYS$LOGIN:), define the logical name
DECW$CD_PLAYER to be the device name of your CD-ROM drive (eg. DKA400:),
give yourself PHY_IO and DIAGNOSE privileges, and run the .EXE.  You can
also install the image with these privileges.  See the source for
additional details - note that the comments regarding the need for
SYSGEN CONNECT are no longer applicable (at least as of VMS V5.5-2).

There's also SYS$EXAMPLES:CDROM_AUDIO.C and .EXE, a non-Motif program.
------------------------------------------------------------
DCL1.   How do I run a program with arguments?

The RUN command does not accept arguments.  To pass arguments to a program,
you must use what is called a "foreign command".  For example:

	$ uudecode :== $disk:[dir]uudecode.exe
	$ uudecode filespec

The leading $ in the symbol definition is what makes it a foreign command.
If the device and directory is omitted, SYS$SYSTEM: is assumed.  For more
information on foreign commands, see the OpenVMS User's Manual.

See also question PROG2.

------------------------------------------------------------
DCL2.   How can I redefine control keys in DCL?

The DCL DEFINE/KEY command allows you to define function and keypad
keys, but not control keys.  Also, keys you define with DEFINE/KEY are
not recognized inside applications.  Many applications which use the
SMG$ routines for input have a similar DEFINE/KEY feature.

The terminal driver line-editing control keys, including the use of DEL
for delete, are not modifiable.

------------------------------------------------------------
DCL3.   How can I clear the screen in DCL?

The simplest way is TYPE/PAGE NL:

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE1.  How can I undelete a file?

OpenVMS doesn't have an "undelete" function.  However, if you are quick
to write-protect the disk (or if you can guarantee that no new files get
created or existing files extended), your data is still on the disk
and it may be possible to retrieve it.  The FLORIAN tool available from
the WKU Fileserver claims to be able to do this (see question SOFT1.)

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE2.  Why does SHOW QUOTA give a different answer than DIR/SIZE?

DIR/SIZE doesn't take into account the size of file headers which are
charged to your quota.  Also, unless you use DIR/SIZE:ALL, you'll see only
the "used" size of the file, not the allocated size which is what gets
charged against your quota.  Also, you may have files in other directories.
					[lionel@quark.enet.dec.com]

$ DIR/SIZ=ALL/GRAND [username...]

Grand total of D1 directories, F1 files, B1/B2 blocks.

$ DIR/SIZ=ALL/GRAND [-]username.DIR

Grand total of 1 directory, 1 file, B3/B4 blocks.

$ SHOW QUOTA
  User [username] has B5 blocks used, B6 available,
  of B7 authorized and permitted overdraft of B8 blocks on disk

If the user has no files in other directories and all file-headers are
only 1 block, then the following should apply:

  B5=B2+B4+F1+1

If the diskquota is out of synch, then the system-manager can make a rebuild.
					[ARNE@ko.hhs.dk]
------------------------------------------------------------
FILE3.  How do I make sure that my data is safely written to disk?

If your application must absolutely guarantee that data is available,
no matter what, there's really no substitute for RMS Journalling.  However,
you can achieve a good degree of data integrity by issuing a SYS$FLUSH RMS
call at appropriate times (if you're using RMS, that is.)  If you're
using a high-level language's I/O system, check that language's documentation
to see if you can access the RMS control blocks for the open file.  In
C you can use fflush followed by fsync.  Note that fsync, which was
undocumented for VAX C but is documented for DEC C, takes a file descriptor
as an argument, not a *FILE.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG1.  How do I call <routine_name> from <language_name>?

Most OpenVMS system services and RTL routines pass string arguments by
descriptor.  Languages which support native string data types create
descriptors automatically; those which do not (eg., C) require that you set
them up explicitly.
					[eric@tardis.HQ.ileaf.com]

There is a lot of information available on how to call system services
and Run-Time Library routines, including examples in numerous languages.
The best references are:

	Your language's User Manual
	OpenVMS Programming Environment Manual
	OpenVMS Programming Concepts Manual
	OpenVMS Programming Interfaces: Calling a System Routine
	OpenVMS Calling Standard

In addition, if you are a subscriber to the Digital Software Information
Network (available to those with a software support contract), the DSIN
database contains hundreds of worked examples of calling system services
and RTL routines, including the one that seems to trip up almost everyone,
SMG$CREATE_MENU.
					[lionel@quark.enet.dec.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG2.  How do I get the arguments from the command line?

If you're writing a program and want to accept arguments from a foreign
command, you can use LIB$GET_FOREIGN to get the command line and parse
it yourself, or if you're programming in C, use the normal argc/argv
method.

To write an application which uses the normal DCL verb/qualifier/parameter
syntax for invocation, see the description of the CLI$ routines in the
OpenVMS Callable Utility Routines Reference Manual.

It is possible to write an application which can be used both ways; if a 
DCL verb isn't used to invoke the image, the application parses the command 
line itself.  One way to do this is to call CLI$GET_VALUE for a required
parameter.  If it is not present (or you get an error), call 
LIB$GET_FOREIGN to get the command line and do the manual parse.

See also question DCL1.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG3.  How do I get a formatted error message in a variable?

Use the SYS$PUTMSG system service with an action routine that stores
the message line(s) in the variable of your choice.  Be sure the action
routine returns a "false" (low bit clear) function value so that SYS$PUTMSG
doesn't then try to display the message (unless you want it to.)  See the
description of $PUTMSG in the System Services Reference Manual for an
example of using an action routine.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG4.  How do I link against SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.STB on an AXP system?

LINK/SYSEXE is the OpenVMS AXP equivalent of linking against SYS.STB.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG5.  How do I do a SET DEFAULT from inside a program?

The problem is that SYS$SETDDIR only changes the default directory - NOT
the default disk. The default disk is determined by the logical SYS$DISK.
If you want to change the default disk within a program, then call
LIB$SET_LOGICAL to change the logical SYS$DISK. You will need to call both
LIB$SET_LOGICAL and SYS$SETDDIR to change both default disk and the default
directory!
					[ARNE@ko.hhs.dk]	

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG6.  How do I create a shareable image transfer vector on an AXP system?

This is something that was greatly simplified for OpenVMS AXP.  You don't
need to create a separate transfer vector module; just use the SYMBOL_VECTOR
statement in a linker options file.  For example, if your shareable image
has two routines named FOO and BAR, the linker options file should contain
the following line:

	SYMBOL_VECTOR=(FOO=PROCEDURE, BAR=PROCEDURE)

The Linker manual has more details on this.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG7.  How do I turn my Fortran COMMON into a shareable image on AXP?

You need to add SYMBOL_VECTOR=(<common-name>=PSECT) to your options file.  On
OpenVMS VAX all OVR/REL/GBL psects were automatically exported into the
shareable image's Global Symbol Table.  On OpenVMS AXP you have to tell the
linker that you want this done by means of the PSECT keyword in the
SYMBOL_VECTOR options file statement.

This has several advantages over OpenVMS VAX.  First, you don't have to worry 
about the address of the psect when you try to create a new, upwardly 
compatible version of the shareable image. Second, you can control which
psects, if any, are made visible outside the shareable image.

By default, COMMON PSECTs in DEC Fortran for OpenVMS AXP (as well as most
other OpenVMS AXP compilers) are NOSHR.  On VAX, the default was SHR which
required you to change the attribute to NOSHR if you wanted your COMMON
to be in a shareable image but not write-shared by all processes on the
system.  If you do want write-sharing, use: 
	CDEC$ PSECT common-name=SHR
in the Fortran source code (the CDEC$ must be begin in column 1) or a linker 
options file PSECT_ATTR statement to set the COMMON PSECT attribute to SHR.

For further information, see the Linker manual.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG8.  How do I convert between IEEE and VAX floating data?

In OpenVMS V6.1 there is a routine CVT$CONVERT_FLOAT, documented in the
LIB$ Run-Time Library Reference Manual, which can perform conversions
between any two of the following floating datatypes: VAX (F,D,G,H),
little-endian IEEE (single, double, quad), big-endian IEEE (single, double,
quad), CRAY and IBM System\370.

DEC Fortran (all platforms) has a feature which will perform automatic
conversion of unformatted data during input or output.  See the DEC Fortran
documentation for information on "non-native data in I/O" and the
CONVERT= OPEN statement keyword.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG9.  How do I get the argument count in a Fortran routine?

On VAX, many programmers would use a MACRO routine which accessed the
AP register of the caller to get the address of the argument list and
hence the argument count.  This was not guaranteed to work on VAX, but
usually did.  However, it doesn't work at all on OpenVMS AXP, as there
is no AP register.  On Alpha systems, you must use a language's built-in
function to retrieve the argument count, if any.  In Fortran this is
IARGCOUNT, which is also available in DEC Fortran on OpenVMS VAX.

Note that omitting arguments to Fortran routines is non-standard and is
unsupported.  It will work in many cases - read the DEC Fortran release
notes for additional information.

------------------------------------------------------------
DECW1.  How do I let someone else display something on my workstation?

On a workstation, you go into "Customize" menu of the session manager utility
and select "Security".  When the pop-up box appears, you can put
node/user/tranport to allow who can launch an application to the display on
that workstation.
					[raspuzzi@mrlat.enet.dec.com]

> Yah, but this doesn't seem to work with non-VMS systems.  What do I put in 
> for the transport?  I tried "TCPIP" just for kicks, but it didn't work.

        You need a checklist of sorts:

      1) Make sure  that  you've  specified  the X-windows "display"
         correctly  on  the remote side.  For DECNET it's  something
         like NODE::0.0, for TCP/IP it's Node.Domain:0.0, etc.  On a
         unix system, define the DISPLAY environment variable so:

	    # setenv DISPLAY myvax.domain:0.0

      2) If you've verified 1) and things still aren't working, make
         sure the Security settings on  the  VMS side will allow the
         connection:  Pull  down the "Options" menu in  the  Session
         Manager, select "Security..."  near  the  bottom.   If  you
         don't  find  your  host  (and  username) listed on the left
         under "Authorized Users", go to the  right side of the menu
         and   fill   in  the  three  fields,  "Node",   "Username",
         "Transport".  Then click on the Add botton, then the  Apply
         and  OK  buttons  to  add  the  new  host  to  the security
         database.

          a) There are  various  transports: LOCAL, DECNET, LAT,
             TCPIP,  etc.   Select  the one appropriate  to  the
             client machine's connection to the VMS machine.

	  b) If the connection is DECNET, do *NOT* add :: to the
             node name!

          c) If the connection is TCPIP, "Username" _must_ be an
             asterisk (*) because the  TCP/IP protocol used does
             not provide the remote username.

          d) If the connection is TCPIP, it's best to use a full
             domain name, e.g.,  Node.Subd.Domain.  However, you
             _may_  have  to use the IP address  itself,  rather
             than  the  domain  name  (EWS  requires  this).   I
             generally  add two entries for each TPCIP host, the
             first using the  domain  name,  the  second  the IP
             address.

          e) There are a  various  3rd  party vendors who supply
             TCP/IP  packages for VMS, including but not limited
             to  TGV  (Multinet)  and  Wollongong  (Pathway  ?).
             Multinet  (and  DEC's  own  UCX) call the transport
             "TCPIP", Wollongong, at least in some incarnations,
             uses "WINTCP".  You need to use the appropriate
             vendor's package transport name  in the "Transport"
             field.

      3) If things _still_  aren't  working, make sure the transport
         you  want  has  been activated for DECwindows.  This  is  a
         system manager job, but you can do the ground work yourself
         before bothering the sysmgr.  Do the following:

	    $ DIR SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM

         If that file exists, then do:

	    $ SEARCH SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM -
            $_    DECW$SERVER_TRANSPORTS

         You sould find something like:

	    $ decw$server_transports == "DECNET,LOCAL,LAT,TCPIP"

         If the transport you want,  e.g., TCPIP, isn't listed, have
         your  system  manager  make  the  appropriate  changes  and
         restart DECwindows.  If the file doesn't exist, the  sysmgr
         will  have  to  create  it  by  copying  the  corresponding
         .TEMPLATE file  to  .COM  and  uncommenting  the  line that
         defines decw$server_transports.

          a) If you're wanting  to  use  TCP/IP to connect, make
             sure  TCP/IP is available on the VMS host.   TCP/IP
             is _not_ native to VMS.  You  need  to  be  running
             either Digital's UCX or a 3rd party vendor's TCP/IP
             product.   If  you're  not,  none of the above will
             help.
				    [Fairfield@Slac.Stanford.Edu]

There is a log file created in SYS$MANAGER which tells you which transports
are loaded, and also tell you what connect attempts were rejected, including
showing what the presented credentials were.  This file is
SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_ERROR.LOG, although the 0 could be another number if
you have multiple servers on the workstation.  I have found this file to be
very useful for tracking down what needs to be put in the Session Manager
Security entries.

DECW2.  How do I create a display on another workstation?

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=net_transport /NODE=remote_node

for LAT the command might look like this:

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=LAT /NODE=REMOTE_NODE

for DECnet:

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=DECNET /NODE=NODE

for TCP/IP

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=TCPIP /NODE=128.12.4.122

Note that LAT is typically used for X terminals but can be used from
OpenVMS to OpenVMS systems on OpenVMS AXP V6.1 (if you have setup the X
server to allow the LAT transport - check the docs).  LAT will be supported
on OpenVMS VAX as a transport for DECwindows in a future OpenVMS VAX
release.

DECW5.  Problem - the DELETE key deletes forward instead of backward!

This has to do with Motif's virtual bindings.  When a Motif application starts
up, it looks at the vendor string returned in the display connection
information and attempts to match the string to a table of virtual bindings.

You can override the default bindings in your decw$xdefaults.dat file. Here is

DECW6.  Problem - On a DEC2000-300, Motif doesn't start

Check for a GQ device by doing a SHOW DEVICE G at the DCL prompt.  If there is
no GQA0 device:

a) VMS failed to find the appropriate IRQ information for the Compaq QVision
   and did not autoconfigure it.  Run the correct ECU (for OSF and VMS) and
   reboot.

b) You do not have a Compaq QVision video card.  This card should have Compaq
   printed on it, and identifies itself as a CPQ3011 or a CPQ3111.  If it is 
   not one of these 2 devices (as of 7/1/94 and version 6.1) then VMS does not
   support it.

If there is a GQA0 device:

a) There may have been a severe error in the DECwindows startup. Type the
   contents of SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_ERROR.LOG for any information on
   errors starting the server.

b) The sysgen parameter WINDOW_SYSTEM is not set to 1.  This is a common way
   used by system managers to disable server startup.

c) You may not have a valid Motif license.    To check for the Motif license,
   type LICENSE LIST DW-MOTIF/FULL and examine the information displayed.
   Make sure that it is present, valid and active.

DECW7.  Problem - My LK401 keyboard unexpectedly autorepeats

There are several modes of failure:

a) Pressing 2 and 3 keys at the same time causes one key to autorepeat when
   released.  Check the hardware revision level printed on the bottom of the
   keyboard.  If the revision level is C01, the keyboard firmware is broken. 
   Call field service to replace the keyboard with any revision level other 
   than C01.

b) Pressing certain keys is always broken.  Typical sympypoms are: delete 
   always causes a autorepeat, return needs to be pressed twice, etc.  This is
   frequently caused by having keys depressed while the keyboard is being
   initialized.  Pressing ^F2 several times or unplugging and replugging the
   keyboard frequently fix this problem.  There is a patch available to fix 
   this problem [contact the CSC for information - a CSCPAT number will be 
   included here when available. - Ed.]

c) A key that was working spontaneously stops working correctly. This may be
   either (a) or (b) or it may be bad firmware.  Ensure that you have the most
   recent firmware installed on your CPU.  An old version of the DEC 3000 
   firmware had a bug that could cause this symptom.

------------------------------------------------------------
DECW8.  Problem - My LK411 sends the wrong keycodes or some keys are dead

Check the firmware revision on the keyboard.  Hardware revision B01 introduced
an incompatability with the device driver which causes the keyboard to not be
recognized correctly.  There is a patch available to fix this problem:
[CSCPAT number TBS - Ed.].  The rev A01 keyboard, and the LK450 should work 
without problems.

DECW9.  How do I set the title on a DECterm window?

If you are creating a new DECterm window, check 
HELP CREATE /TERMINAL /WINDOW_ATTRIBUTES.

If you want to change the title of an existing window, use the following
control sequences, where <esc> is the ANSI escape code, value decimal 27, and
<text> is what you want to display:

To set the DECterm title, send <esc>]21;<text><esc>\
To set the icon label, send    <esc>]2L;<text><esc>\

For example, DCL to display "My DECterm" in title bar:
$ ESC[0,8]=27
$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "``ESC`21;My DECterm``ESC`\"
					[p_lee@decus.ch]

You can also change the title and the icon using the Options-Window...
menu.

SOFT1.  Where can I find lots of free software for OpenVMS?

The best starting point for free software for OpenVMS is Hunter Goatley's
WKU FILESERV server.  If you're using a WWW browser, the URL is:

	http://www.wku.edu/www_root/fileserv/fileserv.html

The FILESERV packages are also available via anonymous FTP from:

      ftp.wku.edu, under [.VMS.FILESERV]. 
      ftp.spc.edu, under [.MACRO32.SAVESETS] and [.MX]. 
      ftp.vms.stacken.kth.se, under [.WKU.VMS.FILESERV]. 
      ftp.shsu.edu, under pub/vms/mx and pub/vms/utilities. 
      nic.switch.ch, under /mirror/vms/spc. 
      ftp.technion.ac.il, under /pub/unsupported/vms/spc. 
      ftp.riken.go.jp 

or via e-mail from FILESERV@WKUVX1.WKU.EDU. Send the commands HELP and
   DIR ALL in the body of a mail message for more information.

If you get the packages via WWW or FTP, they're in ZIP format which requires
the UNZIP (note: this is not Gnu gunzip!) tool to unpack.  You can get this
from:

	ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/unzip.exe        ! VAX
	ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/unzip.alpha_exe  ! AXP

or you can request the FILESERV_TOOLS package from the e-mail server.

Mosaic 2.1 is available here, but there's also a VMS port of Mosaic 2.4
available at file://ftp.service.digital.com/pub/vms/Mosaic which was
built for use with DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (UCX) V3.0 or V3.1.
Some people have reported success using this with "UCX emulation" on other
TCP/IP implementations.

Another source of free software is the vmsnet.sources newsgroup (and the
corresponding vmsnet.sources.d discussion group).  See the monthly posting
"vmsnet.sources archives" for a list of sites which archive submissions
to vmsnet.sources.

A good source of software for DEC boxes (and anything else pretty much)
is the DECUS library. online catalogs are available as well as some
software via ftp.decus.org; there's a gopher server 
  gopher://gopher.decus.org/
an FTP server:
  ftp://ftp.decus.org/
and a WWW server:
  http://www.decus.org/

Phone for orders is 508 841 3502. Lots of good stuff from lots of good
folks, and copies on media (tapes, CDs) are cheap.

The sources for ZMODEM from the DECUS CD Rom are at:
  ftp://ftp.infonet.net/pub/systems/vms/zmodem
				[kevin@ins.infonet.net]
There's also ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.2/simtel/misc/vaxvms/ZMODEM17.ZIP
