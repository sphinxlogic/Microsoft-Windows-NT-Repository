The symbiont as distributed is configured to print normal text files in
a variety of formats on the laser printer.  Support is also included for
printing PostScript files, MacPaint files, and Zeta plot files.  See
LASER.C for additional capabilities of the symbiont.

This distribution consists of the following files:

File		Destination		Purpose
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
debug.doc				debugging aid documentation
LASER$DEVCTL.TLB SYS$LIBRARY:		Library of PostScript header files.
LASER.EXE	SYS$SYSTEM:LASERSMB.EXE	The symbiont executable.
LASER.C					Symbiont source.
laser.cfg	SYS$SYSTEM:		laser configuration example
LASER.HLP	SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB	Description of forms supported.
LASER.OPT				Link options file.
LASER_COUNTERS.FDL			fdl for counter file
LASER_ERR.MSG				Error message source.
latdef.h				latmaster header file (for VMS < 6.0)
latmsg.h				lat codes	      (for VMS < 6.0)
replaser.com				build command file
SMBDEF.H				Source header files.
startq.com				more examples
startqueue$laser.com	SYS$MANAGER:	Queue startup command, the big one.
syst.com	startup file		Queue startup commands.

Installation.

Installation of the files can be accomplished with the following set of
commands:

$ COPY LASER.EXE SYS$SYSTEM:LASERSMB/PROT=W:RE
$ COPY LASER$DEVCTL.TLB SYS$LIBRARY:/PROT=W:RE
$ LIBRARY /HELP SYS$HELP:HELPLIB LASER		! Optional
$ create/fdl=laser_counters.fdl	sys$system:laser_counters.dat

Select a terminal port to attach the printer to, and edit STARTQ to
reflect your change.  STARTQ.COM may be invoked by your system startup
procedures.  The printer may be connected with a cable that has only
transmit, receive and ground pins connected.  Transmit and receive
should (I think) be swapped. The switch on the LaserWriter should be
switched to the "9600" position.  If you are sharing your LaserWriter
with a Macintosh connected via AppleTalk, use the following procedure
when switching the printer:

To switch the printer to the VAX:
1. Insure that no AppleTalk jobs are in progress.
2. Switch switch on LaserWriter to "9600".
3. $START/QUEUE ALW

To switch the printer to the MAC:
1. $STOP/QUEUE/NEXT ALW
2. Allow any jobs in progress to complete.
3. Switch switch on LaserWriter to "AppleTalk".


$ CREATE SYS$SYSDEVICE:[LASER].  This area is used for LASER log files
for spooled files, or when the laser log cannot be created in the user's
directory.  The location and name of the directory may be changed by 
changing the definition for LASER$LOG in SYST.COM.  Log files are only
created when there is an error in the job, or when the job sends back
information (i.e. using the PostScript PRINT command).

To build the symbiont:

$ @make	! if you have mms

configuration file structure
	each line has the following format:
	queue_name/lz pw/lat pw/inits
	and may be terminated at each '/'
	lz and lat pw are case sensitive
	inits is a string representing modules that are to be permanently loaded
in the laserwriter. this string contains one ore more substring separated with
commas/ these substrings have the structure MODULE=keyword, where keyword is
a name defined in /userdict if MODULE has already been loaded.
	the default init is TEXAS_INIT_R=md
*	if the logical name laser$accounting is defined, then the page
counters of all the served printers are recorded. To do this, this logical must
point to a directory, and, optionally, a file name. This file, the name of
which name defaults to LASER_COUNTERS.DAT, must be created with the following
command: 
$ create/fdl=LASER_COUNTERS
Each line in this file contains three fields: the DEVICE NAME of the queue, the
timestamp of the recording, and the value of the 'pagecount' postscript
operator. News records are added automatically, old records must be deleted
manually. The sharing of this file is done so that when symbionts are sharing
it, it can me typed, and lines can be removed, with the 'READ/DELETE' DCL
command, for instance. LAT symbionts can share the same device name, since
the record is updated only when the symbiont is connected to the LAT port.
