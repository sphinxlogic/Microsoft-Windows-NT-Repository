NSQUERY
-------

NSQUERY is a domain service query utility.  It constructs a Internet
domain service request, issues it to a domain server, and interprets and
displays the reply.  NSQUERY directly supports TGV MultiNet, and also
includes an interface to the NETLIB interface library, which supports
several TCP/IP packages.  Source code for the network access routines
is provided which can be modified to interface with other TCP/IP
implementations.

New features in V3.0:

* NSQUERY has been completely rewritten in C, and runs on both
  VAX and Alpha AXP systems.

NSQUERY runs on VMS V5.0 and later (or OpenVMS Alpha AXP V1.0 and later), and
requires either TGV MultiNet V2.2 or later, or NETLIB V2.0 or later.
