NSquery V3.0-3, TOOLS, Query Internet domain name servers
                                       
   [21-NOV-1994]
   
   NSQUERY issues a query to an Internet domain name server and displays
   the resultant reply.
   
   NSQUERY is provided with access routines for two network transports:
   MultiNet (using its $QIO interface) and NETLIB (which interfaces to
   several different TCP/IP packages). If you have a TCP/IP package that
   isn't directly supported, or you just don't want to install the NETLIB
   package to support it, you can write your own network access routines.
   
   
   NSQUERY is written entirely in C. Complete sources are provided.
