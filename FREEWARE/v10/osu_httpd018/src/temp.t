	I have read the FAQ for this group and couldn't find the answer there.
We have a VAX/VMS Mainframe with hundreds of users and we have our Web
server which is on a DEC 5000/133 Unix (Ultrix) workstation.  I thought 
anonymous ftp to the Web server would be the answer, but I don't think so now.
What I want is an easy way for users on the VAX to be able to put their 
home.html or whatever.html files on the Unix hard drive.  Something like
a directory named after their username which only they have access to and
they could also update their html files at any time.  Creating hundreds of
users on the Unix workstation is not an option because of the number of
users.  Anybody out there have any ideas?
