#
# Format of rules file:
#    Comments are delimited by  #.
#
#    map template result
#       If address matches template, use result string for future rulse.
#	Template and result must be in unix file specification format
#       (/device/dir/dir/...).
#
#    pass template [result]
#       if address matches the template, use it as is.  If result argument
#	is present, perform map operation and use translation.
#
#    userdir sub-dir
#	if address matches template /~username/xxx, replace with
#	/device/directory/sub-dir/xxx where device and directory are specified
#	username's default device and directory.  Note that sub-dir string
#	must not have a leading slash. (e.g. userdir web).
#
#    fail template
#       Prohibit access to this address.
#
#     redirect template url
#	If address matches template, a redirect will be sent to the client
#	redirecting it to the specified URL.  The URL must be in absolute
#	format (include scheme and host).  Local redirects are redundant
#	since they can be handled by map directives.
#
#     htbin directory		* obsolete *
#	Superceded by exec directory, for compatibility this directive is
#	mapped internally to "exec /htbin/* directory".
#
#    exec dir-template [node::["obj-spec"]]script-directory
#	If address matches dir-template, invoke corresponding script
#       in corresponding script directory.  Note that dir-template must be
#       in unix fomrmat (/dir/dir...) and script-directory must	be in VMS 
#	format (disk:[dir]).  If the script directory is prefixed with a
#	DECnet node, the script task will be started on that node instead
#	of the default.  If a node is specified, a object specification
#	("object=" or "0=taskname") may be specified.
#
#    accesslog logfile
#	Name of access log file.  The file specified by logfile is opened 
#	for append or created if it does not exist.
#
#    dnslookup [on|off]
#	Enable/disable translation of remote host address to Domain Name
#	Server host name.  If enabled, the translated name will appear
#	in the log files.
#
#    tracelevel level [tracefile]
#	Set trace level and trace file for debugging.  You may specify level
#       as either a numeric constant or a environment variable (DCL symbol)
#	name.  The trace level has the same meaning as the environment
#	variable http_log_level and will override it.  The optional tracefile
#	parameter specifies a separate file to record the trace, if missing
#	trace entries will go to the standard error log file.
#
#    include config-file
#	Read specified file and process records as if they were being read 
#	from original file at the point of the include statement.  Includes
#	may be nested to 20 levels (who would do that?).
#
#    defprot dir-template protection-setup-file
#	Set default protection setup file for protect and hostprot directives.
#
#    protect dir-template [protection-setup-file]
#	If address matches dir-template, validate access against that
#	granted by protection-setup-file.  The protection-setup-file argument
#	may be in either unix or VMS format.
#
#    hostprot dir-template [protection-setup-file]
#	Same as protect command above except that simpler (level 1)
#	protection checks take place.  Only groupmask directives in setup
#	file are processed and only items without usernames (i.e. 
#	@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) are checked.
#
#    search [node::["obj-spec"]]script-name
#	Search script to use to search documents.  If search rule not
#	present, searches will be disabled.
#
#    suffix [.sfx|*|*.*] representation encoding [quality]
#       bind data-type to file suffix.  Special values for suffix fields are
#       * (match any file that hasn't matched another suffix) and *.* (
#	(match file with suffix that hasn't matched another suffix).
#	The represention field is the MIME content-type.
#       Data encodings: BASE64 QUOTED_PRINTABLE 8BIT 7BIT BINARY x-token.
#
#    presentation representation [node::["obj-spec"]]script-name
#	Used by clients to map respresentations to a command to execute to
#       render that representation (e.g. mpeg).  Script-name is VMS file
#	specification of script to execute to convert source file to contents
#	standard content-type for transmission to client.  If a presentation
#	for rep. "text/file-directory" is defined, the corresponding script
#	will be invoked to format 'directory' URLS (ending in '/').
#	Default directory for the script is WWW_ROOT:[000000].
#
#    welcome index-filename
#	Adds index-filename to list of default file names to search for when
#	the requested URL is a directory (ends in slash).  The files are
#	searched for in the same order as they appear in the configuration
#	file.  If no welcome directives are defined, the server uses a
#	default list of index.html, index.htmlx for compatibilty with
#	previous releases.
#
#	If the first welcome rule has no index-filename specified, all
#	checks will be disabled.
#
#    diraccess [on|off|selective] [filename]
#	Controls whether server generates an automatic directory listing
#	when no welcome page found in a directory.  A value of 'on' enables
#	directory generation and a value of 'off' disables the listing.  A
#	value of 'selective' causes the server to list the directory iff it
#	contains the specified filename (defaults to .www_browsable).
#
#    localaddress ip-address
#       For multi-homed hosts, specifies the address of the interface
#       (or pseudo-interface) which server is to listen on.  ip-address
#       must be in 'dot' format (i.e. 128.146.235.50).
#
#    hostname name
#       Specified the hostname to use for server-generated redirects.  By
#       default server used value of HTTP_DEFAULT_HOST enviroment variable.
#
#    port port-num [nocache-port-num]
#	Specifies port number server is to listen on, overriding the port
#	specified on the command line.
#
# Operation:
#    At server startup, rules file is read sequentially.  The presence and/or
#    values of any 'search', 'authenticator', 'suffix', and 'presentation'
#    commands is noted/saved.  All other rules are tokenized and saved
#    in a table for processing in the same order that they occur in the rules
#    file when a URL is to be translated.  Comments are discarded.
#
#    The ident portion of a URL is translated by making a copy of it in a work
#    area and testing the work area copy against each entry in the tokenized
#    rule list.  A rule that matches against the translation in the work area
#    may rewrite the translation (see map rule), subsequent tests for
#    triggering rules will be made against the new translation.
#
#    The data from suffix rules is kept in a different data structure optimized
#    for finding highest quality representation supported by a client request.
