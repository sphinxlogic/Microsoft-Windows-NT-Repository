To search a VMSIndex database, press your client's search command key or
button while viewing the database cover page (from which you reached this
help file) and submit a QUERY.
<p>

The indexed/boolean search engine allows a client to query an index for
keywords (case-insensitive) and return a menu of documents or sections
in the database which contain them.  The use of both text keywords and
boolean operators allows clients to tailor searches to their individual
needs, for example:
<p>
fote* html or vms not junk
<p>

<PRE>
A QUERY consists an Expression, optionally	Query: expr {expr}
followed by another Expression; "AND" is

Each EXPRESSION contains a Term, optionally	Expr: term {OR term}
followed by "OR" and another Term.

A TERM is a Factor, optionally followed by	Term: factor {and|not factor}
"AND" or "NOT" and another Factor.
