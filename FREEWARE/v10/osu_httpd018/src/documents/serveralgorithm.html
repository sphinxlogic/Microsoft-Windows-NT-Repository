The main routine for the HTTP server configures itself according to the
command line arguments, reads the rules file into memory, and starts
a thread that listens for TCP/IP connections to the specified port.  When
a connection is received, the listener thread creates a new thread
with a start routine that performs the following actions:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Reads the HTTP request from WWW client and parses out method, URL, and 
protocol.  Any header lines included with the request are read at this 
time as well.
</LI><P>
<LI>Executes request (function http_execute()):<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  Parse URL into scheme, host, ident, and search arg (if any).<P>
  </LI>
  <LI>Apply rules file rules to ident portion of URL. Send error
		message  and return if 'fail' rule triggered.<P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
  <DL>
  <DT>If translated URL matched on an exec rule:</DT>
    <DD>Punt to DECnet task (WWWEXEC) with subfunction "HTBIN"<P></DD>
   <DT>else if requested method is "GET" or "HEAD":</DT>
    <DD><A HREF="#senddoc">Retrieve file/directory</A> and send to client.
    </DD><P>
    <DT>else if requested method is "POST":</DT>
	<DD>Punt to DECnet task with subfunction "POST"</DD>
   </DL>
   </LI>
</OL>
</LI><P>
<LI>
Close connection and exit thread.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Note the repeated use of the operation "<A HREF="#decnet">punt to DECnet 
task</A>", in which the
server makes a DECnet connection to object WWWEXEC and lets the object
control the processing of the request.

<H2><A NAME="senddoc">Document Retrieval</A></H2>
In most environments, the primary function of the HTTP server is the retrieval
of files residing on the server machine.  File-oriented URLs are processed with
the steps:
<OL>
<LI>Check access, abort if access not granted.<P>
</LI>
<LI>Determine if local port is no-cache port, which will inhibit placing
retrieved file in cache.<P>
</LI>
<LI>Determine content-type and encoding of document:
  <OL>
     <LI>Make list of content-types that client will accept by parsing request
	headers.
     <LI>Extract suffix and match content-type defined for suffix with
	 those accepted by client, suffix of "/" is treated special and
	 forced to type text/file-directory.
     <LI>If previous step found no match, abort request unless method is HEAD.
  </OL><P>
<LI>See if content-type matches presentation rule in configuration file
and punt to DECnet task with subfunction CONVERT if match.<P>
<LI>See if search argument (?xxx) present in request and punt to DECnet task
with subfunction SEARCH is so.<P>
<LI>Check document cache for requested URL and complete request using data
in cache if found.<P>
<LI>Open file, open depends upon case:<DL><DD><DL>
  <DT>Encoding is Binary</DT><DD>Attempt open using fopen mode "rb".</DD>
  <DT>URL is directory</DT><DD>Open directory using special "d" and check
   for existence of welcome file (index.html) in directory.  If welcome
   file present, set status to re-direct request to welcome file.
  </DD>
  <DT>Encoding is 8Bit (text)</DT><DD>Attempt open using fopen mode "r"</DD>
</DL></DD></DL><P>
<LI>If open failed, check for errant directory request (missing final slash)
and set status for re-direct if directory found.<P>
<LI> If open successful, make HTTP header and send contents.  If entire
caching allowed and contents fit in cache buffer (4K bytes), save in document 
cache.<P>
<LI>If open failed, abort request with 404 status.
</OL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="decnet">WWEXEC algorithm</A></H2>
The WWWEXEC procedure first opens SYS$NET, making it a PPF (Process
Permanent File).  It then reads the basic request parameters from the
server (sub-function, method, ident, protocol) and continues processing based 
upon the sub-function:<P>
<UL>
<DL>
<DT>HTBIN:</DT>
  <DD>Parse script name out of URL ident and search for matching
	script in htbin directory (directory that was named in the rule
	file).  If found, invoke script.<P>
  </DD>
<DT>CONVERT:</DT>
  <DD>Query server for name of converter script (defined by presenation rule
in configuration file) and invoke script to convert specified URL ident.<P>
  </DD>
<DT>SEARCH:</DT>
  <DD>Send message indicating generic search capability not available.
	Note that scripts can handle searches because they are
	tested for first by the server<P>
   </DD>
<DT>POST:</DT>
   <DD>Save request to temporary file and send acknowlegement to
	client.  Nothing is done with the saved file, I was testing
	the request_to_file program for future development.<P>
    </DD>
</DL>
