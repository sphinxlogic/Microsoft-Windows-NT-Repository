<H1>Setting up scripts</H1>

<H2>Simple setup</H2>
You can use the following set of steps to set up script execution for
the DECthreads HTTP server provided that the DECnet TASK object is not
disabled and DECnet proxies are in use on your machine.

<OL>
<P><LI>Copy the WWWEXEC.COM file to the login directory of the HTTP server 
account.<P>
<LI>If needed, use the authorize utility to setup default proxy access bewteen
the server account and itself (<CODE>SYSUAF> add/proxy node::user user/default
</CODE>).<P>
<LI> Create a script directory which is readable by the server account and
place the scripts (command procedures and executables) in this directory.<P>
<LI> Edit the server rules file (httpd.conf) and add an htbin directive
to make the script directory known to the server.  Note that the directory
must be in VMS format (disk:[dir]), NOT unix format (/disk/dir/). <P>
<LI>Edit the server startup file (HTTP_SERVER.COM) to define the environment
variable HTTP_DEFAULT_HOST to the full TCP/IP hostname of the server machine.
<P>
</OL>
<H2>Troubleshooting</H2>
If you can't get scripts to work, the first place to look is the
NETSERVER.LOG file created by the script process.  Hopefully, error messages
in the log file will indicate where the 
<A HREF="/www/serverscriptprotocol.html">server-script protocol</A> is failing.
<P>
If there is no
NETSERVER.LOG, log into the server account's login directory and try the following
command:
<PRE>
	$ show work /output=0::"TASK=WWWEXEC"
</PRE>
If this command fails, you'll probably get either a "login invalid" message, 
which means the proxy information isn't set up correctly, or "network partner
exited", which means you should check the netserver.log for error messages.
You may also get "object not found", which means WWWEXEC.COM is not in
the right place.
<H2>Advanced setup</H2>
You may desire or need to take advantage of other DECnet features
when setting up the script server.   If you are unfamiliar with these
features, the <i>VMS Guide to Networking</i> is the best place to learn about
them rather than this document.
<P>  To use most of the advanced features, you must
re-define the DECnet task string that the HTTP server opens when it wants
to execute a script.  You re-define this task string by defining the
environment variable WWWEXEC in the server startup procedure (if absent,
server uses 0::"TASK=WWWEXEC" as the task string).
<UL>
<P>
<H3>WWWEXEC as its own object</H3>
You may wish to define the WWWEXEC.COM procedure as a separate object rather 
than run it under the TASK object.  This step is required if the TASK object has
been disabled for security reasons.  You would then have to define WWWEXEC
with the form 0::"object=" where 'object' is either the object name
or number defined in the DECnet database.

<H3>Permanent script server processes</H3>
At system startup, define the logical NETSERVER$SERVERS_username as a numeric
string to indicate the target number of permanent server process.
Permanent server processes can greatly improve response time when using
scripts.<P>
<H3>Load balancing</H3>
You can use a node other than the local name (or zero) in the task string
to have the script execute remotely.  You can also use a cluster alias
to distribute the execution across several nodes.  Note that the htbin
directory is read by the script server and must be valid on whatever
node executes the script.
