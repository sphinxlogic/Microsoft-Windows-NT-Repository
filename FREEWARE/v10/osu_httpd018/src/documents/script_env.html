<H1>Writing scripts</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
This document describes how to write basic scripts for the DECthreads HTTP
server.  A script may be either a DCL command procedure or an executable
image.  It must reside in a script directory defined in the server's
<A HREF="configfile.html">configuration file</A> via an 'exec' rule or 'htbin' rule.
The execution of your script is directly managed by the DECnet task
object <A HREF="/www_root/000000/wwwexec.com">WWWEXEC.COM</A>, which locates
your script and invokes/runs it with the follow command line:
<PRE>
   $ script-cmd method translated-path protocol-version
</PRE>
<P>
Your script runs in 2 phases:
<OL>
<LI><em>Dialog phase</em>:
In the dialog phase, your script queries the server for additional data not 
included on the command line.  If all the necessary information has been
provided on the command line (i.e. method, path), your script may go directly
to the output phase.  For CGI (Common Gateway Interface) style scripts, the
dialog phase is handled internally by the cgi_init() routine or 
cgi_symbols.exe program.
<P>
<LI><em>Output phase</em>:
In the output phase, your script generates the response to be sent to the 
client.  Once a script enters the output phase, no other dialog commands
can be sent.  The output phase has 3 different modes: text, raw, and CGI.
The format of the output you need generate is different for each of the modes.
</OL>
<H2>Command line arguments (parameters)</H2>
<DL>
<DT>The following 3 items are passed to your script via the command line,
i.e. as DCL parameter symbols (if script is a command procedure) or as 
command line arguments:</DT><DD>
<P><DL>
<DT>argv[1]/P1</DT>
<DD>
This argument/parameter holds the method (e.g. GET) specified in the client's
request.
</DD><P>
<DT>argv[2]/P2</DT>
<DD>
This argument/parameter holds the path portion (ident) of the URL that triggered
the execution of the script, truncated to 255 characters.  Note that this
argument is the <i>translated</i> path, i.e. the string that results after
all the configuration file translations.  Note also that string includes the
exec directory prefix and is not the same as the CGI PATH_TRANSLATED variable.
</DD><P>
<DT>argv[3]/P3</DT>
<DD>
This argument/parameter holds the HTTP protocol that the client is using, either
"HTTP/1.0" or null.
</DD>
</DL></DD></DL>
<H2>Network connection</H2>
A script communicates with the server via a DECnet logical link which
is open by DCL as logical name net_link.  You write commands and data
to this link and read server responses to your commands on this link.  When your
script is a program, the scriptlib and cgilib routines handle the reading
and writing to the net_link connection.  Since this link is opened in 
supervisor mode by WWWEXEC.COM, it remains open until your script returns 
(i.e. it is a process permanent file).
<H2>Dialog phase</H2>
In dialog phase, your script writes commands over the net_link to the server and
read the response sent by the server.  The particular commands are described
in the <A HREF="serverscriptprotocol.html#commands">scriptserver 
protocol documentation</A>.
<H2>Output Modes</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Text mode (&lt;DNETTEXT&gt;)</DT>
<DD>
Text mode is used to send simple text data and messages (i.e. error messages)
to the client.  In text mode, the first line of output is the HTTP status line
followed by lines of text.  Do not include the protocol-version (HTTP/1.0)
on the status line as it will be prepended by the server if needed.
<P>
In text mode, the server automatically appends a CR/LF record delimiter
after each record sent over the network line.  This make text mode
convenient for returning DCL command output (e.g. HELP) to the client.
</DD><P>
<DT>Raw mode (&lt;DNETRAW&gt;)</DT>
<DD>
Raw mode is used in situations where you want your script to have complete
control over the HTTP response (status and headers) sent back to the client.
<P>
Note that unless you send a &lt;DNETRECMODE&gt; dialog command in the dialog phase, 
your output must explicitly include the carriage control characters (CR/LF) for 
delimiting lines.
</DD><P>
<DT>CGI mode (&lt;DNETCGI&gt;)</DT>
<DD>
</DD>
In CGI mode the server interprets your output according to the
CGI (Common Gateway Interface) <A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">
specification</A>.  The first line of output is
either a 'Content-type:' header line or 'location: ' header line followed
by a blank line and the output data.  If a 'Content-type:' header is sent,
you can include additional header lines to be returned to the client before
the blank line (e.g. last-modified header).  If you include a 'Status:' header
line, the header argument overrides the default HTTP status returned.
<P>
Note that unless you send a &lt;DNETRECMODE&gt; dialog command in the dialog phase, 
your output must explicitly include the carriage control characters (CR/LF) for 
delimiting lines.
