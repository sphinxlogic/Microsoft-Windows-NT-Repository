If the directory browser doesn't find a welcome file (index.html)
in the directory it is presenting, it dynamically generates HTML
to list the files in the directory.  In addition, a readme file
(aaareadme.www), if present is included the the html.

This particular directory contains the source files for the various
executable program scripts that reside in the [.bin] directory.
