Xodometer,MOTIF TOYS,Mouse Odometer
Xodometer measures how far your mouse travels in miles or kilometers!  It
was written as more of an exercize, than as a useful program (obviously).
The end result of the exercize, however, yeilded this fun little
application.  It was inspired by a similar application I saw demonstrated
for OS/2.

The main window contains both a trip odometer (resettable at your whim),
and a non-resettable odometer (which remembers its value between program
invocations).  The program is controled via a pop-up menu activated by
pressing mouse button 3 in the Xodometer window.

This program truly epitomizes the expression "X toys." :-)  Its completely
useless, but fun to look at.  Happy motoring.
