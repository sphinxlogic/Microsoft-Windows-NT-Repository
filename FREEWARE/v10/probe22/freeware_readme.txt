PROBE, UTILITIES, VAX Ethernet monitor / statistics / capture / playback

 Probe is a network monitoring tool which allows the real-time capture and/or
 graphical display of Ethernet traffic activity and the tabular formatting of
 previously collected frame and/or data.

 The main features are:

 o  Extensive user-specified attributes allow fine-grained filtering and
    enhanced presentation of raw or computed data. Some key attributes are
    dynamically modifiable.

 o  Sampling can be performed unattended (in batch for example) by setting
    a cycle of alternating collection and sleep intervals. Statistics are
    produced for every cycle.

 o  Automatic and static symbolic representation of Ethernet addresses.

 o  Heavily speed-optimized high-priority multi-process MACRO32 user-mode
    code for capture/display. Playback program in C.

 o  Optional (complete or partial) frame data capture and playback.
