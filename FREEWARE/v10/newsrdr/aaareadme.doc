NEWSRDR

NEWSRDR is an NNTP client program for VMS systems running CMU-Tek TCP/IP,
TGV MultiNet, DEC's VMS/ULTRIX Connection, or any TCP/IP package supporting
a Berkeley socket interface.

NNTP is the Network News Transfer Protocol, which is used to communicate
USENET news over TCP/IP.  Since many systems cannot afford the disk space to
store all net news locally, this program can be used to communicate with a
cooperating news server system to read and post net news.  News articles
are fetched on an as-needed basis and are stored on the client system only
while they are being read.

NEWSRDR is not a port of UNIX-based news readers.  It is written strictly
for VMS and provides an interface that VMS users should find reasonably
comfortable.  Most of the commands in NEWSRDR should be familiar to VMS MAIL
users.

NEWSRDR is written entirely in C. NEWSRDR can be used with any TCP/IP
package that supports a Berkeley socket library interface, or with any
package supported by the provided NETLIB network interface library.
NEWSRDR requires VAX/VMS V5.0 or later, or OpenVMS Alpha AXP V1.0 or later.

Support for Japanese sites using Kanji in news articles is provided
through the use of an installable library of character conversion routines
which can be mapped in at run-time by NEWSRDR.  C source is provided for the
Kanji character code conversion routines.  Support for username and mail
address conversion routines is also provided, also through the use of
shareable libraries.

Refer to the NEWSRDR documentation for specific system and user requirements.
