	This uudecode.c is based on NetBSD's, then ported on
OpenVMS/VAX V6.1, adds a feature to decode multiple encoded segments
from a single file.

Decoding multiple segments is enabled with "-m" specified, otherwise
should act as original uudecode, which accepts no options. This may
found as useful for a rmailout-file or extracted several article into
a single file. The sequence of segments in a file has to be ordered
like:

% grep "^Subj" 2
Subject: - abc.jpg (1/5) "test pattern"
Subject: - abc.jpg (2/5) "test pattern"
Subject: - abc.jpg (3/5) "test pattern"
Subject: - abc.jpg (4/5) "test pattern"
Subject: - abc.jpg (5/5) "test pattern"
% uudecode -m 2
% ls
2               abc.jpg
%

Note: uudecode employ attached algorithm to detect a line is encoded
one or not. Although it could never be perfect, it should work as
expected more than 90%. If you encounter the case an extracted file
looks like corrupted, then try with "-v" again. It prints "skipped"
lines.

Enjoy.

Multiple segments decoding are done as:

	1) Skip line to first "begin " line (same as original)
	2) Until "end\n" line found: (same as original)
	2-1) Check the line whether it looks like an encoded
	     line or not, Check is done as:
		(a) for encoded by uuencode:
			/*
			 * Encoded lines should be:
			 *	l%4 = 0
			 *  AND
			 *	l/4 = n/3 + (n%3 == 0 ? 0 : 1)
			 *			[l > 0]
			 *	n = 0		[l = 0, should be "`\n"]
			 * Where:
			 *	n = (Char_at_column (0) - 0x20) & 0x3f
			 *	l = length (line) - 2
			 *		(1 for column 0 + 1 for tailing \n)
			 *
			 * Based on: "$Id: uuencode.c,v 1.5 1993/11/09 01:47:00 jtc Exp $"
			 */
		(b) for encoded by an other more sophisticated encoder
		    which adjusts length of a last line:
			/*
			 * Encoded lines should be:
			 *	l/4 + l%4 = n/3 + n%3 + (n%3 == 0 ? 0 : 1)
			 *			[l > 4]
			 *	l = n + 1	[0 < l <= 4]
			 *	n = 0		[l = 0, should be "`\n"]
			 * Where:
			 *	l = Char_at_column (0) - 0x20
			 *	n = length (line) - 2
			 *		(1 for column 0 + 1 for tailing \n)
			 */
	2-2) If not, skip the line. If "-v" is specified then
	     skipping line is printed to ``stderr''
	2-3) If yes, then process as an encoded line
	3) If not EOF, then goto 1)
