MAKE/VMS is no longer supported since MMK (MMS clone by Matt Madison/MadGoat
Enterprises, compatible with descrip.mms) is both free and becoming quite 
popular.  MMK is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.spc.edu/ftp.wku.edu and 
by mailserver at wkuvx1.wku.edu.  Check VMS newsgroups for announcements and 
exact location.

The MAKE.COM command file accepts compilation options in a LOCAL_UNZIP 
symbol or logical; the format is "VMSCLI,RETURN_SEVERITY" (for example).
DESCRIP.MMS must be edited in order to use special options.
