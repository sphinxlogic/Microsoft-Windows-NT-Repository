   Note that some ftp sites may not yet have the latest versions of
   Zip and UnZip when you read this.  The latest versions, including
   the crypt sources, always appear in ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip
   (and subdirectories thereof) first.

   IF YOU FIND AN ERROR:  please let us know!  We don't have time to
   check each and every site personally (or even collectively), so any
   number of the sites listed below may have moved or disappeared en-
   tirely.  E-mail to zip-bugs@wkuvx1.wku.edu and we'll update this file.

ftp sites for the US-exportable sources and executables:

   NOTE:  Look for the file names given above in the following directories.
   Some sites like to use slightly different names, such as zip-2.0.1.tar.gz
   instead of zip201.tar.Z.  In the case of some comp.sources.misc archive
   sites, directories may be used (zip201/part01.Z, ..., zip201/part11.Z,
   zip201/patch01.Z, etc.).

ftp sites for the encryption and decryption sources and/or executables:

   NOTE 1:  Non-US users, please do NOT ftp from the US sites (US
   regulations and all that).  Likewise, US users, please do not
   ftp from the European sites (it's not illegal, but it sure is
   a waste of expensive bandwidth).

   NOTE 2:  Some sites may carry both encryption and non-encryption
   executables with slightly different names; for example, zip201c2.zip
   instead of zip201x2.zip ("c" == crypt version).  Other sites may
   include *only* the encryption-related executables (zip and zipcloak)
   in a second archive (e.g., zcryp20x.zip).

   From the US:
      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/garbo.uwasa.fi/arcutil
      ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip

   Outside the US:
      garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/arcutil

      ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/pub/comp/os/os2/archiver
         (mail server at ftp-mailer@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

      ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/compression/zip/...
      ftp.uni-erlangen.de:/pub/pc/msdos/utilities/zip/...

ftp sites for VMS-format Zip and UnZip packages (sources, object files and
executables, no encryption/decryption--see also "Mail servers" section below):

   ftp.spc.edu [192.107.46.27] and ftp.wku.edu:

   [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]UNZIP.BCK  or  UNZIP.ZIP  (if already have older version)
   [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]ZIP20.ZIP  (to be renamed to ZIP.ZIP in next release)

To find other ftp sites:

   The "archie" ftp database utility can be used to find an ftp site
   near you (although it always seems to find old versions...).  If
   you don't know how to use it, DON'T ASK US--check the Usenet groups
   news.announce.newusers or news.answers or some such, or ask your
   system administrator (or just RTFM :-) ).
