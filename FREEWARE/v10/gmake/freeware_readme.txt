GMAKE, TOOLS, GNU make for POSIX for OpenVMS

This tar file should be unpacked within a POSIX container filesystem using the
command:

   psx> tar -xvf posix_gmake.tar

This will create a directory hierarchy under a directory called,

POSIX_gmake-3.72.1

To build the GNU make executable you should run make within this directory. For example,

  psx> cd POSIX_gmake-3.72.1
  psx> make
