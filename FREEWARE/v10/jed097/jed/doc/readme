The main reason JED's version number is below 1.0 is due to the lack of
adequate documentation.  I am slowly working on it.  There is a postscript
manual available from amy.tch.harvard.edu in pub/jed.  It is somewhat dated
though (0.93).

Please read jed_faq.txt if you have any questions regarding JED.  The
majority of questions I receive are already answered here.   Even if you
have already read these documents from a previous JED version, it is a good
idea to re-read them because they do change (improve) from release to
release. 

In this directory, you will find the following supplemental documents:

    color.txt    : how to set up JED using a color terminal (e.g., MS-Kermit)
    syntax.txt   : Describes syntax highlighting
    program.txt  : S-Lang programming tips
    edt.txt      : EDT editor emulation
    batch.txt    : How to use JED in batch mode
    xjed.doc     : Notes pertaining to XWindows version of JED
    rmail.txt    : How to set up JED's rmail mode for mail reading
    wordstar.txt : Wordstar mode documentation
    pc-keys.txt  : list of keycodes for PC systems
    rgrep.doc    : document for recursive grep program (rgrep)
