These are some notes about using xjed, the X Window version of JED.  It also
mentions information about how to setup the EDT emulation under Linux.

xjed recognizes the following resources:

   Display    [d]    Display to run on
   Name              Instance name
   Geometry          Initial geometry specifications
   Font              Default font to use
   Background [bg]   Background color
   Foreground [fg]   Forground color
   Title             name to be displayed on the title bar
   Status_fg  [sfg]  foreground color of the xjed buffer status line
   Status_bg  [sbg]  background color of the xjed buffer status line
   Region_fg  [rfg]  foreground color of a region as defined by point and mark
   Region_bg  [rbg]  background color of a region as defined by point and mark
   Cursor_fg  [cfg]  text cursor foreground color
   Cursor_bg  [cbg]  text cursor background color
   Mouse_fg   [mfg]  mouse cursor foreground color
   Mouse_bg   [mbg]  mouse cursor background color
   
These resources specify color syntax highlighting options:

   Operator_fg   [opfg]   forground color for operators (+, -, etc...)
   Operator_bg   [opbg]   background color for operators
   Number_fg     [nmfg]   forground color for numbers
   Number_bg     [nmbg]   background color for numbers
   String_fg     [stfg]   forground color for strings
   String_bg     [stbg]   background color for strings
   Comments_fg   [cofg]   forground color for comments
   Comments_bg   [cobg]   background color for comments
   Keyword_fg    [kwfg]   forground color for keywords
   Keyword_bg    [kwbg]   background color for keywords
   Delimiter_fg  [defg]   forground color for delimeters
   Delimiter_bg  [debg]   background color for delimeters
   Preprocess_fg [prfg]   forground color for preprocessor lines
   Preprocess_bg [prbg]   background color for preprocessor lines

Any of the above items may be specified on the xjed command line. Quantities
enclosed in square brackets may be used as a shortform of their longer
counterparts.

For example, 

 xjed -d amy:0.0 -title Xjed@amy.tch.harvard.edu -font 9x15 -bg blue -fg white

will start xjed using the server on amy using a white on blue 9x15 font
with `Xjed@amy.tch.harvard.edu' on the title bar.

Once the X Window resource specifications have been parsed, any remaining
command line arguments are parsed as normal JED command line arguments.

The easiest way to specify the resources is to make use of a `.Xdefaults'
in your $HOME directory.  Here is an example entry for Xjed:

XJed*Geometry: 80x36+100+100
XJed*Font: 10x20
XJed*Background: white
XJed*Foreground: black

Note that the first two letters of `XJed' must be capitalized.  The first
line specifies that the initial window size is 80 columns by 36 rows and
that the top left corner of the window is to be positioned at (100, 100).
The second line specifies a fixed 10x20 font.  The other two lines specify
the foreground and background colors of the window.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse Usage:

          left :  set cursor to mouse point
        middle :  paste from cut buffer moving cursor to mouse point
         right :  copy region between cursor and mouse point to cut buffer
     drag left :  mark a region and copy it to cut buffer
    drag right :  mark a region and copy it to cut buffer
    shift left :  split window mouse is in
  shift middle :  insert contents of last XJED copy or kill
  control left :  delete window mouse is in
 control right :  kill region between point and mouse point to cut buffer

Other buttons are undefined.  Clicking on a window status line causes a
different behavior.  Specifically:

      left:  switch to next buffer   
    middle:  split the window
     right:  delete the window
    
For example, one can qucick move from one buffer to the next by simply
clicking on the status line with the left mouse button.

XJED S-Lang specific functions:

   x_set_window_name   :  Set the name of the window (for title bar)
   x_warp_pointer      :  Move mouse position to cursor position
   x_insert_cutbuffer  :  insert contents of system cut buffer in current
                          buffer
   x_copy_region_to_cutbuffer
                       :  insert a region in system cutbuffer
   x_set_keysym        :  define an equivalence string to be returned
                          when a function key is pressed.
			  
  also, set_color() may be used to set colors of mouse, cursor, normal,
  region, and status line as well as the colors used by the syntax
  highlighting routines.  For example,
  
      set_color ("mouse", "red", "blue");

  gives the mouse cursor a red forground with a blue background.  The color
  values must be recognizable by the X server.
  
  In addition to the usual keybindings, the X version binds:
  
     Control-UP     :  goto top of buffer
     Control-DOWN   :  goto end of buffer
     Shift-UP       :  move to top of window
     Shift-DOWN     :  move to bottom of window
     Control-RIGHT  :  Pan the window to the right
     Control-LEFT   :  Pan the window to the left
     Shift-RIGHT    :  skip to next word
     Shift-LEFT     :  skip to previous word
     
Miscellaneous:

   Suspending XJed is not allowed.  If ^Z is pressed, the window is raised
   if it is obscured, or lowered if it is totally visible.


EDT emulation under Linux.  

pagan@astrpd.pd.astro.it (Angelo Pagan (Universitas Studii Paduani))
suggests putting 

	keycode 22  = Delete
	keycode 77  = KP_F1
	keycode 112 = KP_F2
	keycode 63  = KP_F3
	keycode 82  = KP_F4
	keycode 86  = KP_Separator

in the .Xmodmap file to enable EDT keypad emulation.
