Using a mouse with JED (Linux console using selection and Xterm).

Currently JED is able to support a mouse in two ways: using Xjed and using
``Xterm Event Support''.  This document discusses the latter.  The user is
referred to `xjed.doc' for a discussion of Xjed.

Xterm event support is provided by not only Xterm but also the Linux console
running the `selection' program.  Only versions 1.6 and greater of selection
provide this support.  In addition, one must be using a recent Linux kernel
(1.1.35 or newer.)

Installation
=============

To enable JED to use this mouse support, the following steps must be
performed:

   1.  Make sure you have the appropriate version of selection and the Linux
       kernel installed.
       
   2.  Put the following on your .jedrc file:
   
          evalfile ("mousex"); pop ();
	  
       The file `mousex.sl' creates three hooks: `exit_hook', `suspend_hook',
       and `resume_hook'.  If you have already defined these hooks for
       yourself, look at `mousex.sl' and modify your hooks appropriately.
       These hooks are necessary so that the `selection' state can be
       properly initialized and restored.
       
Mouse Usage
===========

 Left Button:
 ------------

   If the left button is clicked on the status line of a window, the window 
   will switch to a different buffer.

   If the button is pressed anywhere else in the window, the cursor will be
   positioned at the location of the click.
 
 Middle Button:
 -------------
   
   On status line: split the window
   Anywhere else:
    If the region is highlighted, the region will be copied to the 
    pastebuffer.  This does not delete the region.
    Otherwise, the editing point will be moved to the location of the mouse
    and any contents in the pastebuffer will be pasted there.

 Right Button:
 -------------
 
   On status line: delete the window.
   Anywhere else:
    If a region is highlighted, it will be deleted and a copy put in the 
    pastebuffer.

    Otherwise, the mark is set and a region will be defined.

 Cut/Paste Tips:
  
  To mark and manipulate a region do:

   1. Click the LEFT mouse button at the beginning of the region.
   2. Move the mouse to the end of the region and click the RIGHT
      mouse button.  The region should now be marked.
   3. To delete it and copy it to the paste buffer,  press the RIGHT button 
      again.  To simply copy it without deleting it, press the MIDDLE button.

   4. To paste from the pastebuffer, move the mouse to where you want to 
      paste and press the MIDDLE button.
