Information about the JED rmail reader.

JED is able to read mail with proper file locking as long as the system mail
spool directory is writable.  That is, /usr/spool/mail should be writable
(some systems use /var/spol/mail).  This requirement is fulfilled for most
systems.

To install rmail, you must first create the executable `getmail'.  After
building JED, simply type `make getmail'.  Move the resulting executable to
JED_LIBRARY.  Add the following to your .jedrc file:

   autoload ("rmail", "rmail");
   add_completion("rmail");

Mail is moved (with locking) from the spool directory to a directory
$HOME/Mail.  This directory is created if it does not exist.  JED will then
parse the new mail and moved individual messages to the directory
$HOME/Mail/NewMail.  Future versions will compress the new mail.

JED then parses the headers of the new mail and creates a file called
$HOME/NewMail.index.  JED uses this index to manage files in the NewMail
folder. Similar statements apply to new folders.

JED will then show a window containing the index.  It may look like:

   4 12-Dec  R    Darrel R Hankerson <hanke  OS/2 changes in 0.95?
   5 13-Dec  R    Dominik Wujastyk <D.Wujas  Re: drive letters in JED
   6 13-Dec  R    Darrel R Hankerson <hanke  compiler warnings

The first field is a simple integer which indicates the name of the file
containing the message described by the line.  For example, the first line
above refers to the message in the file $HOME/NewMail/4.
The 3rd field contains flags.  R means that the message was replied to, F
means that it was Forwarded.

The arrow keys may be used to move the cursor from one line to another.
Pressing the spacebar will cause the message associated with the line the
cursor is on to be displayed in a second (larger) window.  Use the spacebar
and the DELETE key to scroll through the message.  

The following keys are defined:

   SPACE   scroll forward or select message
   DELETE  scroll message backward
   DOWN    move to next message (use space to select it)
   UP      move to previous message
   N       move to next Non-deleted message
   P       move to previously Non-deleted message
   D       Tag message for deletion
   X       Really delete tagged messages and resequence folder.
   G       Get newmail
   Q       Quit this folder returning to top level (folder index).
   T       toggle headers.  By default, JED will hide most of the headers.
           Use this key to unhide them.
   O       Output message to a different folder.  One will be created if
           necessary.
	   
Replying and Forwarding use JED's mail facility.  The relevant keys are:

   F       Forward message
   R       Reply
   M       mail
   
To actually send the message after composing it. press `ESC-X send' to
actually send it.  See the description of the Mail facility in the JED
documentation for more discussion.
	        
Not implemented but will be:

   Read compressed email.
   BCC will be supported.
