S-Lang is not free software --- it is copyrighted.  However, it may be used
for any purpose without royalty or fees in accordance with the terms of the
copyright.  The intent of the copyright is to prevent the propagation of
proprietary versions of S-Lang.  To implement this restriction, the
copyright forbids modification of the S-Lang source code without first
obtaining my approval.  The suggested modifications should be sent back to
me for incorporation into the next version of S-Lang.  I have spent alot of
time developing S-Lang and I am letting you use it for free.  The idea is
that any changes you intend to make in the software should benefit all users
of S-Lang.  The restrictions imposed by the copyright does not apply to the
source code embedding embedding S-Lang.

Any questions or comments regarding S-Lang should be addressed to me via
