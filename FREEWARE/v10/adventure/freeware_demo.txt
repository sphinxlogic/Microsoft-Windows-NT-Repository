Operating Instructions

Adventure comes ready to run; simply run the executable appropriate to
your system - either ADVENT_VAX.EXE or ADVENT_ALPHA.EXE. Adventure
needs a data file to work (ATEXT.TXT); it must be in your default
directory.

Should you wish to rebuild Adventure from source, simply invoke
MAKE_ADVENT.COM.
