	The following steps are necessary to install and use the DECW$CD_PLAYER
executable on OpenVMS VAX or Alpha systems.	


	+----------------------------------------------------------------+
	|                                                                |
	|	Note: You MUST have Motif installed on your system.      |
	|                                                                |
	+----------------------------------------------------------------+


	1)	Copy the files from the OpenVMS Freeware CD to a subdirectory
		on your system.

	2)	Both VAX and Alpha executables are provided. However if you
		choose to rebuild the code simply execute the provided
		script... $@decw$cd_player.bld

	3)	Copy the proper executable to sys$common:[sysexe]...

		$ copy decw$cd_player_(axp or vax).exe sys$common:[sysexe]

		Note: If you have a mixed architecture cluster I would go
		      ahead and copy both the VAX and Alpha executables
		      to sys$system.

	4)	Insure that the files are world read...

		$ set file /prot=(w:r) sys$system:decw$cd_player*.exe


	5)	Copy the window menu command file...

		$ copy vue$decw$cd_player.com sys$common:[vue$library.system]


	6)	Install the DECW$CD_PLAYER application in your Session manager
		Application menu.

		o  select "Options" --> "Menus..."
		o  select the "Applications" menu on the left...
		o  fill in the menu name "CD Player"
		o  fill in the DCL command "@vue$library:vue$decw$cd_player"
		o  select up arrow the left arrow
		o  select the "Apply" button then "OK"

		Be sure to save your session manager settings...

	7)	Define a logical for your CD drive. This definition should
		also be put in the "systartup_vms.com" command file.

		$ define /sys/exec/nolog decw$cd_player DKA400:
		  	(or whatever your drive is...)
	
	8)	Give it a try..
