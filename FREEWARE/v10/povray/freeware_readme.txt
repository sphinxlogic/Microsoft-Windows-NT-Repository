POVRAY, GRAPHICS, Persistence Of Vision Raytracer
!
Persistence Of Vision (POV) is a widely used raytracer.
This kit provides the OpenVMS Alpha executeable, as well
as the sources and documentation.  POVRAY may be freely
distributed, and modified, provided you follow the rules
spelled out in the included documentation.

This version was modified for OpenVMS, and is not the
official kit from the authors, who directly support only
the images that they build.

This version has been modified to display it's preview
window on 24-plane systems, as well as 8-plane systems.
It is also "quiet" by default (does not print information
messages).

To get online help, simply run POVRAY.
