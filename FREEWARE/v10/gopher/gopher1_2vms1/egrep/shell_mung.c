/*    Modifications of SHELL_MUNG.C for use with the VMSGopherServer
        -- Foteos Macrides (MACRIDES@WFEB.EDU.SCI) 18-June-1993 --
	                                   through 21-July-1993

        Permits use of comma-separated filespec lists, with sticky
          device:[directory] defaults.
        If the -l switch is used, all hits will be reported with
          complete (device:[directory]name.extension;version) pathspecs.
        Otherwise, filespecs are reported with standard EGREP rules.
        Is used with this command in INDEX.C of the Gopher server:
          
            sprintf(command, "$ egrep -il \">%s\" -e \"%s\" \"%s\"",
                              outfile, Searchstr, Indexdir);

	  where outfile is a temporary file to be passed to the client,
	        Searchstr is a regex search string, and
		and Indexdir is a pathspec of form:
		  
                  GOPHER_ROOTx:[directory]<filespec<,filespec<...>>>

                If no filespec follows the directory spec, the server
		appends *.*;

	  Note that shell_default is now a string of declared length
	        NAM$C_MAXRSS+1.  Declare pointers to it in routines that
		call shell_glob().  To clear the sticky default in such
		routines, use:  *shell_default = '\0';

	  03-JUL-1993, F.Macrides -- Added minor fix for clearing the sticky
	               default device:[directory] before as well as after the
		       glob of a filespec with input redirection ('<').
	  21-JUL-1993, F.Macrides -- I had set it up to block lowercasing if
	               the -l switch were used.  The Gopher Server now uses
		       lowercase filespecs, so I got rid of that block.
		       Modified the following header info to reflect the above
		       changes, and deleted previously just "commented out"
		       code.

** Version:     V1.3
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Facility:    GNU
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Prefix:      SHELL_
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Abstract
** ~~~~~~~~
**  If you think "shell mung" is a step in the preparation of a good mung dahl,
** you're right, but in this context "mung" is the verb.  ("Mung" historically
** means "mung until no good," but one could easily interpret it to mean "mung
** until nearly gnu".  Or something to that effect.)
**  This file provides the shell_glob() and shell_mung() functions for the
** VMS/DCL/VAX C user.  The shell_glob() function "globs" (parses filespecs
** with wildcards and matches them with existing files).  The shell_mung()
** function provides GNU-shell-like IO redirection and globbing:  it changes
** `stderr', `stdin', and/or `stdout' to do the IO redirection; it mungs a
** VAX C program's main() function's `argc' and `argv' variables (using shell_
** glob()) to do the globbing; and it truncates `argv[0]' down to a filename
** and filetype or, if the file is a .EXE file, to just the filename.
**  This makes it easy to port many GNU utilities to VMS, as these utilities
** often expect the shell to have done the work that shell_mung() does.  It can
** also be used to port Un*x utilities as well, if anybody cares.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Functions
** ~~~~~~~~~
** shell_glob()
** shell_mung()
** (static) truncate_argv_0()
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Environment
** ~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Must be linked with the VAX C RTL.  Intended for use with the DCL CLI on
** VMS; it would be pointless to use shell_mung() with the SHELL CLI, though
** shell_glob() might possibly come in handy.
**  Must be linked with xmalloc() and xrealloc() functions, which are readily
** available from GNU source code.  These are simply malloc() and realloc()
** functions that exit if there is an error getting memory.

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Functional Description
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Given a filespec, this function parses that filespec out and searches for
** the file---or, if the filespec has wildcard characters in it, the files---
** associated with the filespec.  It returns a newly-allocated vector of file-
** specs that are also newly-allocated.  This function can be used to find only
** the first file that matches the filespec or all the files that match it.  In
** the latter case, this function will also provide a count of the files that
** were found.
**  Filespecs returned by this function are in lowercase, to approximate the
** "look and feel" of GNU.
**  This function is used by shell_mung(), and is also handy for general use.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Usage
** ~~~~~
**  This function returns a vector---that is, a pointer to pointers.  Thus you
** will need to declare this function and a vector like this:
**
**      extern char **  shell_glob();
**
**      char **  filespec_v;
**
**  To find only the first match of a wildcarded filespec, or just to get the
** fully-parsed filespec of a given filespec, call shell_glob() with NULL as
** its second parameter.  For example, if you call it like this:
**
**      static int const  filespec = "*.c";
**      char **  filespec_v;
**              ...
**      filespec_v = shell_glob(filespec,NULL);
**
** The value in `filespec_v[0]' will be (for example) "dev:[dir]bar.c;".  Note
** that the character string pointer is the content of the vector, not the
** vector itself.
**  With this usage, `filespec_v' points to a pointer (actually an array of one
** pointer, which is the same thing).  When used to get a number of filespecs,
** it points to an array of pointers.
**  To get all the filespecs that match a filespec, use an address of an
** integer as shell_glob()'s second parameter, as in this example:
**
**      static int const  filespec = "*.c";
**      int  filespec_count;
**      char **  filespec_v;
**              ...
**      filespec_v = shell_glob(filespec,&filespec_count);
**
** The result of this would be (for example),
**
**      filespec_count = 3,
**      filespec_v[0] = "dev:[dir]bar.c",
**      filespec_v[1] = "dev:[dir]baz.c", and
**      filespec_v[2] = "dev:[dir]foo.c".
**
**  In either type of usage, both the vector and the character strings are in
** newly-allocated memory.
**  VMS globbing entails a feature that allows one to fill in parts of a file-
** spec with default values.  This feature can be used by shell_glob() using
** `shell_default[]', a global character string.  Use of this character string
** is optional, and it is initially set to "" (i.e., *shell_default = '\0'),
** meaning no default filespec is used.  To use it, you need to declare it
** like this:
**
**      globalref char *  shell_default;
**
**  The most frequent use of a default filespec in VMS is to provide a default
** filetype, as shown in this example:
**
**      static int const  filespec = "*.c";
**      int  filespec_count;
**      char **  filespec_v;
**              ...
**      shell_default = ".c";
**      filespec_v = shell_glob(filespec,&filespec_count);
**
** If `user_string' (which is, of course, a character string) is (for example)
** "foo*", a filespec without a filetype, shell_glob() will look for all files
** whose filespecs match "foo*.c".  If `user_string' were "foo*.h", a filespec
** that has a filetype, the default filespec ".c" is ignored and shell_glob()
** will look for all files whose filespecs match "foo*.h".
**  Default filespecs can include devices, directories, filenames, filetypes,
** and version numbers.  Wildcards can be used in filenames, filetypes, and
** version numbers.  To turn default filespecs off, just set *shell_default
** back to '\0'.
**  If the given filespec cannot be globbed, shell_glob() will simply return
** a filespec vector with an array of one pointer, pointing to the unglobbable
** given filespec.  The given filespec, therefore, should be something that
** will stick around for as long as you expect to use the filespec vector.  In
** particular, don't call shell_glob() from a function using an automatic
** character string variable of that function and expect the string to still be
** available when you've exited that function.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Calling Sequence
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
** filespec_v = shell_glob(given_filespec,filespec_count_p);
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Formal Arguments     Description
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~~~~~
** given_filespec       Filespec "as given"---that is, as typed on the command
**                      line.  This is what we parse and search for.
** filespec_count_p     Pointer to an integer that is to receive a count of
**                      filespecs found that match `given_filespec'.  If NULL,
**                      indicates that we're only to search for the first file
**                      that matches `given_filespec'.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Implicit Input       Description
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~       ~~~~~~~~~~~
** shell_default        This global variable is a character string (with
**                      declared length NAM$C_MAXRSS+1) of a default
**                      filespec.  If *shell_default = '\0', no default
**                      filespec is used.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Implicit Outputs:    None
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Return Value
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Returns a vector of pointers to newly-parsed filespecs.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Side Effects
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Memory is allocated for the filespec vector and for the filespecs that it
** points to.

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Functional Description
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Given a description of the command line that invoked a program from the
** main() function's `argc' and `argv' variables, this function changes those
** variables to reflect wildcard matching of filespecs in that command line
** and changes standard IO file pointers `stderr', `stdin', and `stdout' to
** reflect any IO redirection requested in that command line.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Usage
** ~~~~~
**  Since shell_mung() is written for programs running VAX C programs under the
** DCL CLI on VMS, a call to shell_mung() should be predicated on these things:
**
**      #if defined(VAXC) && defined(VMS)
**        if (!shell$is_shell())
**         shell_mung(&argc,&argv,...,...);
**      #endif
**
** One should call shell_mung() before doing anything else---in particular,
** before anything is done with `argc', `argv', and parts of the standard IO
** library.
**  The first and second arguments to shell_mung() should always be addresses
** of `argc' and `argv', respectively.  The third and fourth arguments require
** a bit more thought.  Before they are explained, though, we have to define
** some terms.
**  A "parameter" is a position-dependent command line argument that isn't an
** IO redirection (those start with '<' or '>'), an option or an option value.
** An "option" is similar to a DCL qualifier, except that it starts with '-' or
** '+' instead of '/'.  A "value" is a string that follows certain options.
** Which options have values is something that varies from program to program.
** A value in DCL is indicated with a equal sign (e.g. /qualifier=value), but
** here it can either be concatenated to an option (e.g. -ovalue) or appear as
** an argument following the option (e.g. -o value).  "Globbing," as mentioned
** above, is to parse wildcarded filespecs and match them with existing files.
** A "mung" is a legume used in Indian cooking, often after being shelled.
**  The third argument to shell_mung() is the number of the parameter where we
** expect filespecs to appear---in other words, the parameters we expect to
** need globbing.  A GNU-shell-like command language interpreter will glob any
** argument that has a wildcard character in it, unless that argument is put in
** single quotes.  DCL doesn't glob arguments, and though you can put arguments
** in double quotes to pass them through exactly as typed, by the time VAX C
** has processed them into `argv' strings, the double quotes have been stripped
** off.  This is why we have to tell shell_mung() where to start globbing.  The
** assumption is made that unglobbable arguments (such as strings) will appear
** as parameters before globbable arguments (such as filespecs), an assumption
** that holds for most GNU utilities, probably because it's the only rational
** way to code utilities that accept multiple filespecs on the command line.
**  As an example, consider the following command line, where "fgrep" is a DCL
** command to run the GNU "fgrep" program:
**
**      $ fgrep -n xyzzy *.c *.h
**
** "xyzzy", "*.c", and "*.h" are the parameters.  For fgrep, the string to be
** searched for is always the first parameter ("xyzzy" in this case); the files
** to be searched always begin as a second parameter.  The "-n" is an option,
** which could be placed anywhere.  The following commands mean the same thing
** as the previous one:
**
**      $ fgrep xyzzy -n *.c *.h
**      $ fgrep xyzzy *.c -n *.h
**      $ fgrep xyzzy *.c *.h -n
**
** (It is, however, usually considered better form to type the options first.
** Some programs actually require that certain options appear before certain
** parameters.)  To indicate that we expect input filespecs to begin as the
** second parameter, we call shell_mung() with 2 as its third argument:
**
**      shell_mung(&argc,&argv,2,...);
**
** This changes `argc' and `argv' so that if the user types this:
**
**      $ fgrep -n xyzzy *.c
**
** It's as if the user had typed this (for example):
**
**      $ fgrep -n xyzzy dev:[dir]bar.c dev:[dir]baz.c dev:[dir]foo.c
**
** If all of the parameters are to be considered globbable filespecs, the third
** argument to shell_mung() should be 1 (indicating, of course, that globbing
** can start with the first parameter).  If no parameters are to be considered
** globbable, shell_mung()'s third argument should be 0.  If the user uses a
** negative number as the third argument, it is treated as 0.
**  The fourth argument is a list of options which are followed by values, with
** indications as to which values are to be globbed, and which option/value
** combinations are to be considered as replacements for parameters (more on
** this later).  The list is passed as a character string.
**  As an example, the "make" program has a "-f" option that expects a filespec
** as its value:
**
**      $ make [-f makefile] [target] [macros]...
**
** To indicate that we have a "-f" option followed by a globbable value, we put
** 'f' in shell_mung()'s fourth argument:
**
**      shell_mung(&argc,&argv,0,"f");
**
** When an option's value is globbed, only the first matching filespec is used
** to replace that value.  If, for example, "makefile.vms" and "makefile.xenix"
** are the only two files in your directory, and the user types one of these:
**
**      $ make -fmakefile.*
**      $ make -f makefile.*
**
** It's as if the user had typed one of these (respectively):
**
**      $ make -fdev:[dir]makefile.vms
**      $ make -f dev:[dir]makefile.vms
**
**  Options with unglobbable values must also be listed, with indications that
** they are unglobbable.  The "from" program is an example of this:
**
**      $ from [-s sender] [user]
**
** The "-s" option is followed by a username, not an input filespec.  Thus we
** put a '-' after the 's' in shell_mung()'s fourth argument:
**
**      shell_mung(&argc,&argv,0,"s-");
**
**  There are times when an option/value combination can replace a parameter.
** Using fgrep as an example again, its first parameter---the string to be
** searched for---can be replaced by the "-e" and "-f" options and their
** values.  The "-e" option is used when the string to be searched for starts
** with a '-' character and could be confused with an option, and the "-f"
** option is used when the string or strings to be searched for is in a file.
** We indicate such options by appending a '+' character to them in the string
** that is shell_mungs()'s fourth argument:
**
**      shell_mung(&argc,&argv,2,"e+-f+");
**
** (Note that the "-e" option also has a '-' character following it, since we
** don't want its value to be globbed.  When both '+' and '-' are used, the '+'
** should always be first.)  It should be noted that such option/value pairs
** should be typed early in the command line, in positions where the parameters
** they're replacing would have been.  For example, you would do this:
**
**      $ fgrep -f stringfile inputfile
**
** But this would be an invitation to disaster:
**
**      $ fgrep inputfile -f stringfile
**
**  Programs that use the getopt() library function to process options will
** help you decide which options to include in shell_mung()'s fourth argument.
** The third argument to getopt() is a list of options, and options that have
** values are followed by a ':' character.  Here's an example from the source
** to the GNU "grep" program:
**
**      while ((c = getopt(argc,argv,"0123456789A:B:CVbce:f:hilnsvwx")) != EOF)
**
** This tells us that the "-A", "-B", "-e", and "-f" options have values.  Of
** these, "-A", "-B", and "-e" have unglobbable values; and "-e" and "-f" can
** replace a parameter.  Thus, our call to shell_mung() for the GNU grep
** program looks like this:
**
**      shell_mung(&argc,&argv,2,"A-B-e+-f+");
**
**  The IO redirection capabilities provided are as follows:
**
**      <infile         Input comes from "infile".
**      >outfile        Output goes to "outfile".
**      >&outfile       Output and errors go to "outfile".
**      >>outfile       Output appended to "outfile".
**      >>&outfile      Output and errors appended to "outfile".
**
** They can be used anywhere on the command line, except between an option and
** its value.  Here are some examples:
**
**      $ fgrep xyzzy *.txt >&lines_with_xyzzy.lis
**      $ from -s flintstone >>accumulated_flintstone_missives.dat
**      $ my_mailer -d <mail_commands.com
**
** Some notes:  (1) The filespecs must be next to the redirection characters;
** they can't be separate arguments.  (2) For input redirection, the "infile"
** is globbed to the first matching filespec, just like an option's value.  (3)
** The "<<" redirection characters are not implemented.  Unlike shell scripts,
** VMS DCL command procedures define standard input as records that don't start
** with a '$' character, or aren't the record defined by the DECK command.
** Thus, "<<" redirection is irrelevant.  (4) The "!" redirection character as
** used in ">!", ">&!", ">>!", and ">>&!" is also not implemented.  VMS uses
** file versions, which makes it irrelevant.  (5) If a globbable argument turns
** out to be unglobbable, the new vector will simply point to the original
** argument.  (6) Pipes (as in the "|" and "|&" redirection characters) are not
** implemented.

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Functional Description
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Programs written in VAX C, when run under VMS DCL, will have their entire
** filespec (i.e., the filespec of the running image) in the main() function's
** `argv[0]' variable.  While this makes sense from a VMS standpoint, it does
** not look very good in programs ported from GNU, which often use `argv[0]' as
** an error message prefix.
**  This function, which is called from shell_mung(), truncates the filespec in
** `argv[0]' to just the filename or, if the filetype is not ".EXE", to the
** filename and filetype.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Calling Sequence
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
** new_argv[0] = truncate_argv_0(given_filespec);
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Formal Argument      Description
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~~~~~~~
** given_filespec       The filespec to be truncated.  Assumed to be `argv[0]'
**                      or a pointer to the same thing `argv[0]' points to.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Implicit Inputs:     None
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Implicit Outputs:    None
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Return Value
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Returns the truncated filespec, which is in newly-allocated memory.
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Side Effects
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~
**  Memory is allocated for the truncated filespec.
