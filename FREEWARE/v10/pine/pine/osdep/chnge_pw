       Call the system to change the passwd
 
It would be nice to talk to the passwd program via a pipe or ptty so the
user interface could be consistent, but we can't count on the the prompts
and responses from the passwd program to be regular so we just let the user 
type at the passwd program with some screen space, hope he doesn't scroll 
off the top and repaint when he's done.
