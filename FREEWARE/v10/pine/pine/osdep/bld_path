      Paste together two pieces of a file name path

  Args: pathbuf      -- Put the result here
        first_part   -- of path name
        second_part  -- of path name
 
 Result: New path is in pathbuf.  No check is made for overflow.  Note that
	 we don't have to check for /'s at end of first_part and beginning
	 of second_part since multiple slashes are ok.

BUGS:  This is a first stab at dealing with fs naming dependencies, and others 
still exist.
