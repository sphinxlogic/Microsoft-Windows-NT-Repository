Changes since first beta release
================================
C-client/COMPILE.COM - Removed /NOMEMBER_ALIGN so it works on AXP now.
*/COMPILE.COM - Modify the test for AXP/VAX architecture as suggested by Ehud.
C-Client/VMS_MAIL.C - Fixed so when NEWMAIL folder is closed and new mails
        arrive it won't access-violate.
        Set the message's flags on folder open so all messages in a folder
        which is not NEWMAIL are marked as seen.
        Do not allow openning of a non-existing folder.
        Append empty line to header when returnning it to caller.
C-CLIENT/OSDEP_VMS.C - Add NETLIB support.
PICO/ANSI.C - Modify ANSIREV function to return if we try to set the state
        to what it is now. This conserve a lot of I/O.
