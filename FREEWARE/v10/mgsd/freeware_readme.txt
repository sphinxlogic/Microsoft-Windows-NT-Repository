MGSD 01-007, TOOLS, Yet another SET DEFAULT replacement

   MadGoat SD is yet another SET DEFAULT replacement that provides
   shortcuts for changing directories, as well as a stack of previous
   directories visited.  This is a MACRO rewrite of an SD originally
   submitted to an ancient DECUS SIG tape by Alan Zirkle.
