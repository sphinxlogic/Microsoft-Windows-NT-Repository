MadGoat Software's NETLIB Package

NETLIB is a library for TCP/IP-based network programming on VMS.  It provides
the following features:

    - a common API for all supported TCP/IP packages
    - support for VMS-style asynchronous I/O (using ASTs)
    - useable from any programming language for VMS
    - eliminates having to re-compile or re-link programs when changing
      TCP/IP packages.
    - documentation provided in PostScript, ASCII, and BookReader formats.

NETLIB is written in C, with some MACRO for defining transfer vectors.
NETLIB requires VAX/VMS V5.2 or later, or OpenVMS Alpha AXP V1.0 or later.

Refer to the NETLIB documentation for specific system and user requirements.
