GZIP, UTILITIES, GNU Zip - compress and decompress files

This is the GNU Zip application.  It takes a file of the form FOO.BAR-GZ
and converts it into FOO.BAR or converts a FOO.BAR file into FOO.BAR-GZ. 
Note that you give the filename without the "-GZ" suffix, and GZIP will add
or remove it - depending on if you are compressing or decompressing.

GNU Zip is written by the Free Software Foundation, more information as
well as all of the sources are available in the ZIP file (use UNZIP to
unzip).

This version, 1.4.2b, includes modifications from Paul Repacholi that make
GUNZIP as much as 10 times faster than the previous release of GZIP for
VMS.  This .ZIP file includes binaries for both VAX and Alpha, supplied by
Hunter Goatley <goathunter@goatley.com>.
