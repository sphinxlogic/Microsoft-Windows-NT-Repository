NOTES, Utilities, Notes Conferencing Software

Notes conferences allow discussions among engineering teams, 
and can also be used for publication, tracking, and other 
related tasks.

This Freeware directory contains installation kits for the 
OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Notes Conferencing Client and 
Server Kits, and copies of the client kits for systems using
the Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000 and other NT-compatible
platforms.  

The Windows kits access a Notes Server running on an OpenVMS
system using IP networking.

Application Programming Interface (API) documentation is
also provided.

Due to slightly differing behaviours, both the most current
Notes ECO kits (full kits) and the most recent Notes production 
installation kits are provided within the directory.
