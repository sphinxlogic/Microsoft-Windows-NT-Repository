DCLHolidays, SYSTEM_MGMT, Calculation of holidays

The sample DCL procedure HOLIDAYS.COM (freeware V5) and its successor
HOLIDAYS020.COM use a special form auf the Gaussian Easter Algorithm (see
reference in the procedure itself) to calculate the date of Easter sunday
and from there the dates of other holidays depending on it. Included is
the handling of holidays with fixed dates, christmas for example.

This procedure has been written in Germany with respect to the local
holidays; it may and will require some modifications for other
countries. It uses _only_ DCL and _no_ other programming language so
it can be used on any OpenVMS system without a need for a separate
compiler and its license.

This procedure may be usefull if backup or similar operations have to
be skipped on such days. (No operator available to handle tape
cartridges, for example.)

Usage: Include the "check_date" subroutine in your main procedure,
call it with the date to be checked as a parameter (OpenVMS absolute
date format) and evaluate the value of the symbol(s) $STATUS and/or
$SEVERITY. The possible return codes are listed in the subroutine
itself.

New for V2.0 are (thanks to Paddy O'Brien for suggestions):
- a localization option (definition file)
- a listing option
- a major re-write of the procedure (many loops instead of repeated
  code segments)

The author (i.e., me :-) does not warrant the software but error reports
may be sent via e-mail. There even is a real chance that suggestions or
enhancement requests get implemented eventually.

DCL_CHECK, UTILITIES, Charlie Hammond's unsupported DCL checker

    Note: Information about DCL_CHECK V3.0 is at the end of this file.

The following information is extracted from DCL_CHECK's help file.
There is much more information in the help file.
The HELP utility can access the DCL_CHECK help file using the command

    $ HELP /LIBRARY=<device>:[<directory>]DCL_CHECK

or through DCL_CHECK with this command

    $ @<device>:[<directory>]dcl_check help


DCL_CHECK

        The DCL_CHECK procedure detects a variety of DCL coding errors and
        displays  diagnostic  messages  that  allow  you  to  correct  the
        problems. See "Diagnostics" for a list of the types of errors that
        DCL_CHECK can detect. See "Problems" for information on the limits
        of DCL_CHECK.

        When  you  execute  DCL_CHECK  with "HELP" as the first parameter,
        DCL_CHECK invokes the DCL Help utility.  If you provide additional
        parameters, they are passed to the Help utility.

        To exit the Help utility, press Return one or more times until the
        prompt "enter name of file:"  is displayed.

INSTALLATION

        To install DCL_CHECK you must put the files

            DCL_CHECK.COM and
            DCL_CHECK.HLB

        into the same directory. You then execute DCL_CHECK as an indirect
        command procedure.  See "Format" for additional information.

        DCL_CHECK.COM  is provided in "dieted" form.  You may also wish to
        have the file DCL_CHECK.COM_SOURCE available; this  is  the  fully
        commented version of the procedure.

Topic? format

FORMAT

        DCL_CHECK  is  a  DCL  command  procedure.   It is executed by the
        following DCL command:

            $ @[<disk>:][<directory>]DCL_CHECK.COM [<input> [<list>]]
            $ @[<disk>:][<directory>]DCL_CHECK.COM HELP [<topic>...]

        <disk>  and/or  <directory>  may  be omitted; the current defaults
        will be used.

        The   file   DCL_CHECK.HLB  must  be  in  the  same  directory  as
        DCL_CHECK.COM if you use the HELP function in DCL_CHECK. The files
        may be in any directory to which you have read access.

        If  you  use DCL_CHECK frequently, you may wish to assign a symbol
        in your LOGIN.COM file to execute DCL_CHECK.  For example, if  the
        DCL_CHECK.COM  and  .HLB files are in you login default directory,
        you might put the following in your LOGIN.COM:

            $ DCL_CHECK :== "@SYS$LOGIN:DCL_CHECK"

        Alternatively,  if  you  put  DCL_CHECK.COM  and  DCL_CHECK.HLB in
        SYS$SYSTEM, you might put the following in your SYS$SYLOGIN (which
        is normally SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM):

            $ DCL_CHECK :== "@SYS$SYSTEM:DCL_CHECK"

Topic? modifications

MODIFICATIONS

        You  can  modify  or  "customize" DCL_CHECK by editing the command
        procedure, DCL_CHECK.COM. However, DCL_CHECK.COM is a "compressed"
        version  of  the  procedure.   To  save  disk  space  and  improve
        performance,  all  comments  and  unnecessary  spacing  have  been
        removed  from  DCL_CHECK.COM.  This makes it difficult to read and
        understand the procedure.

        It  should  be  much easier to edit the file DCL_CHECK.COM_SOURCE,
        which contains commands  and  is  formatted  to  facilitate  human
        reading.   You  can recreate a "compressed" version of the command
        procedure by using DCL_DIET.COM.

DCL_DIET

        DCL_DIET  is  a  command  procedure  that  accepts  as input a DCL
        command procedure file.  It compresses, or "diets",  the  file  by
        removing  comments and unnecessary spaces.  The compressed version
        is created as output.

        The smaller size of the compressed file has two advantages:

            o It takes up less space on disk or tape.

            o It executes faster
                -- especially for larger command procedures.

        DCL_DIET is not part of DCL_CHECK.  It is provided separately.

DCL_DIET, UTILITIES, Charlie Hammond's unsupported DCL dieter

    [The following also appears near the beginning of
     DCL_DIET.COM and DCL_DIET.COM_SOURCE.]

    **************************************************************

    This procedure "DIETs" a command procedure file -- compressing
    it by removing comments and unnecessary space. This saves file
    space and improves execution time.  It may also remove comments
    that you don't want users to see.

    To run this procedure, enter command

        $@DCL_DIET <input> <output>

        where   <input> is the input command procedure
               <output> is the "DIETed" output file

    (<output> may also be in the form "/OUTPUT=<filename>"

    If you use DCL_DIET frequently, you may wish to assign a symbol in
    your LOGIN.COM file to execute DCL_DIET.  For example, if the
    DCL_DIET.COM is in you LOGIN default directory, you might put the
    following in your LOGIN.COM:

        $ DCL_DIET :== "@SYS$LOGIN:DCL_DIET"

    Alternatively, if you put DCL_DIET.COM in SYS$SYSTEM, you might put
    the following in your SYS$SYLOGIN (which is normally
    SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM):

        $ DCL_DIET :== "@SYS$SYSTEM:DCL_DIET"

    If the translation of the logical name DCL$DIET_DOTDOT is true, then
    this version adds a space a the beginning of a line that starts with ".".
    This is to overcome a problem with SMTP mail in Compaq TCP/IP services
    so that TCP/IP V5.3-18's SMTP won't double the "."

DECxterm, UTILITIES, xterm key remapping (for use on UNIX Systems)

The procedure remaps the Sun Keyboard, IBM AIX PC type Keyboard, Linux PC 
type Keyboard and Tru64 Compaq Unix keyboards to mappings suitable for VMS
This program is designed to run on a Unix machine, create a terminal 
emulator with VMS keyboard mappings and then telnet to a VMS machine.

USAGE: DECxterm [-option ...]
          which are identical to xterm. "#man xterm" for further details
   eg: DECxterm -e telnet yakka.ali.dec.com

Note 1: All keys in the same position are mapped to the standard
  VMS LKxxx ikeyboard except for the keys between the main keyboard
  keys and the Numeric/Application keys which remain as labelled.
  The keys on an DEC LKxxx Keyboard are marked on other keyboards as:-
  Find marked Home, Insert marked the same, Remove marked Delete,
  Select marked End, Previous marked Page-Up and Next marked Page-Down.

Note 2: Shift/F1 to Shift/F10 are mapped to F11 to F20

Note 3: Other Terminal Emulators such as dtterm or dxterm can be used
  by setting the variable DECXTERM_EMULATOR. The default is xterm.

Note 4: The default xterm qualiers are defined by the variable
  DECXTERM_OPTIONS and are set to:-
   -fn 9X15   Default font
   -sb        Enable scroll bars
   -sl 500    Number of lines saved that are scrolled off the top of window
   -cr red    Set the cursor color to red
   -tn vt100  Set the terminal type to vt100
   -132       Allow switching between 80 and 132 columns
  The default settings can be changed by defining this environment
  variable before running DECxterm.

DISKBLOCK, UTILITIES, Editor and performance tests for ODS2 ODS5 and Foreign disks

  DISKBLOCK is a low level disk block editing tool.

  This V5.8 version contains fixes for bugs that were identified in the
  version of this tool that was available on Freeware V4.0.

  It can be used to read, modify and write LBNs on a disk or VBNs in a file.
  It can also carry out read, write and seek performance measurements.

  Diskblock ignores all locking activity on the selected Disk or File, it
  can access and modify ODS2 and ODS5 data structures such as file headers 
  and it can read, write and test individual shadow set members independently!

  There is a buffer which holds a copy of the block which you read, 
  you can modify the contents of this buffer using EXAMINE and DEPOSIT
  commands and then REWRITE it to the same block, WRITE it to a different
  block or SELECT a new disk or file and WRITE the buffer to any block.

  When you SELECT a disk, diskblock will attempt to map the Index File
  If it is successful then any command which requires an LBN (READ, WRITE,
  COPY etc...) will also accept a FID and operate on the appropriate file
  header.  This will work even if the disk is mounted /FOREIGN.

  There are commands to SAVE and RESTORE the buffer so that you can keep 
  a copy of the original block and undo changes if they do not work as you
  expect.

  There is a CHECKSUM command to enable you to recalculate the checksums
  for ODS2 and ODS5 file headers and home blocks.

  There is a DIRECTORY command which will find the header for a 
  file (even if the disk is mounted /foreign)

  There is a COPY command which will enable you to treat any block on a 
  disk as a file header and copy the LBNs described by its mapping pointers 
  to a new file (even if the disk is mounted /foreign).
  
  There is a SEARCH command which will search the entire disk/file 
  (or any range of blocks) for a particular string or integer or file
  header.

  There is a TEST command which will carry out performance testing.  You
  may specify queue lengths, I/O sizes, read/write ratios and seek types 
  and Diskblock will report throughput and bandwidth to the disk.

  Because of its potential to corrupt disks you should only
  use Diskblock in extreme desperation or on a disk which you have
  backed up.  
  
  You need LOG_IO privilege to run DISKBLOCK.

  Diskblock has an extensive help file with further information.

DIX, Utilities, A program to read/modify records in any RMS (seq/relative/idx) file

This program lets you view/modify records in any RMS file.

Dix can work in three modes

a. Full screen mode. DIX uses SMG to display the data on the screen and 
   allows you to modify it (if you specify /MODIFY (not the default))
   This mode is the default on a terminal.
   You enter this mode by specifying the /SCREEN qualifier.

b. Interactive mode. DIX will prompt you for commands. This mode can also
   be used in batch with command files. If you specified /MODIFY
   the file can also be modified (not the default). 
   You also have some scripting possibilities with the IF and GOTO commands.
   You enter this mode by specifying the /INTER qualifier.
   See the help with DIX/HELP INTER for possible commands.

c. File mode. DIX will display a or more records and returns to DCL. No
   interaction is possible.
   You enter this mode by specifying the /FILE qualifier.

In all three modes the data can be displayed in two ways.

a. Interpreted. You need a record descriptor to do this.
   The descriptor file syntax looks like fortran record definitions(structures)
   and the descriptors can be in a file or in the DIX_DES.TLB text library.
   The layout of the descriptor files is described in the DIX
   help library under the topic 
   DISPLAY_MODES INTERPRETED /DESCRIPTION

   See DIX/HELP DISPL INTERP /DESCR

   DIX delivers (in DIX_DES.TLB) descriptors for the following files
    SYSUAF.DAT
    RIGHTSLIST.DAT
    INDEXF.SYS 
    VMS$PASSWORD_HISTORY
    VMSMAIL_PROFILE
    DIRECTORY files
    Some ALL-IN-1 files.

   And you can add any file you like, if you know the record layout.
  
b. Raw dump. The program displays the data like VMS DUMP and
   you can modify any byte.


  See the help via the HELP command.

usage:
Define DIX as a foreign command

DIX:=$'directory'dix_alpha or DIX_VAX

DIX filename /qualifiers

For the qualifiers see the help via DIX/HELP, but one very 
one important one is the /MODIFY. If you do not specify /MODIFY the
file is opened readonly and cannot be modified.

Note:
The files DIX.HLB and DIX_DES.TLB must be in the same directory as DIX, or
you must define the logical DIX_HELP and/or DIX_DES to another file.

Building:
The executables for Alpha and Vax are skipped with the kit, as well
as the sources. If you want to rebuild DIX, goto the dix directory and
use the command procedure @create_dix. This will compile (fortran) and
link DIX.

Examples:

$DIX SYSUAF[/SCREEN]/EQ=smith [/MODIFY]
  Will display the SYSUAF record of user "SMITH" using SMG, and lets
  you scroll though this data. If you specified /MODIFY, you can also
  modify entries (When you type any character on that field, you enter 
  modify mode for that field (this is signalled by an underline under
  the text)). You leave modify mode for that field when you type ENTER.
  The (modified) data is not written to the file until you type DO or PF4.
  F10 or ^Z returns you to DCL.

$DIX SYSUAF/INTER/EQ=smith [/MODIFY]
  Will enter interactive mode (non-smg), and allows you to inspect/modify
  fields of the current record. It also contains a (limited) scripting
  language. Type help in this mode to see the possible commands.

$DIX SYSUAF/FILE/EQ=smith
  Will display the data on the terminal, but will not allow you to modify
  the record (DUMP command).

$DIX datafile/FILE/REC=10
  Will display the data on the terminal, but will not allow you to modify
  the record (DUMP command). Only record 10 will be displayed

$DIX datafile/FILE/RECORD=10/COUNT=5
  Will display the data on the terminal, but will not allow you to modify
  the record (DUMP command). The records 10 upto 14 (5) wil be displayed.

(1) is an example for a bits type. The part between the []
    gives an more friendly view of the bits.
    For example bit3 will be displayed as "readonly"
    Any bit not described will be displayed as BITnn (for example bit8)
(2) is an example of a union/map structure. A union contains one
    or more maps. This part is selected if the field STRUCT_LEV_MAJ 
    contains 5. See also (4)
(3) This is an example for an integer (byte). The part between
    the [] gives a list of possible values of the integer.
    For example : if the value of FI5$B_CONTROL is 1, the
    text displayed is ODS-5. Anly other value than 0 or 1 will
    be displayed as the normal numeric text.
(4) The rest of the union/map. If none of the map statements has
    matched, this one will. If you do not specify a map with an *,
    the first map will be taken (in this case the map struct_lev_maj=5 
(5) This is an example for the RANGE statement. A RANGE defines a
    part of the record. 
    In this case the field diskmap map(256) in contained in a part
    of the record between bytes map_offset*2:map_offset*2 and map_in_use-1
    The length 256 is choosen to be big enough.
(6) A example of a Position statement. This set the offset for the 
    next field to an absolute value (in this case 510).
    The next field (checksum) will be at offset 510.
(7) The length of the character string depends on a previous field
    (fi5$b_namelen). 

All fieldsizes are in bytes, except within a bitfield/endbitfield range.
In this bitfield_mode only (u)integer, bits and logical fields are allowed.


Another example of files that are linked 

  The example is about 3 RMS indexed files that form a simple sourcemodule
  cross_reference system

  The first file (CROSS_REF.CRF_CROSS) has the following description
  (.CRF_CROSS in the system or user textlibrary)
          integer*2    caller_nr /file=.crf_mod_names   !link to modulename
          integer*2    called_nr /file=.crf_mod_names   !link to modulename

  The second file (CROSS_REF.CRF_MOD_NAMES) has the following description
  (.CRF_MOD_NAMES in the system or user textlibrary)
          integer*2    mod_nr                           !primary key
          character*32 mod_name
          integer*2    file_nr/file=.crf_file_names     !link to the filename

  The third file (CROSS_REF.CRF_FILE_NAMES) has the following description
  (.CRF_FILE_NAMES in the system or user textlibrary)
          integer*2    file_nr                          !primary key
          character*60 file_name
          integer*2    %filler

  When you now (dix-)edit the CROSS_REF.CRF_CROSS file
    $DIX CROSS_REF.CRF_CROSS
    %DIX-I-USINGFIL, Using file DSA40:[DIR]CROSS_REC.CRF_CROSS
    %DIX-I-USINGDES, Using description SYSLIB(.CRF_CROSS)
    DIX> EXA *
     0|CALLER_NR>|738             !the > tells us there is a link present
     2|CALLED_NR>|-262

 You can follow the link to the next file

    DIX> Follow CALLER_NR         !try to follow this link
    File .CRF_MOD_NAMES not (yes) opened, open it (y/[n]):Y     !do you want to o
    %DIX-I-USINGFIL, Using file DSA40:[DIR]CROSS_REF.CRF_MOD_NAMES
    %DIX-I-USINGDES, Using description SYSLIB(.CRF_MOD_NAMES)
    DIX> Exa *
    0|MOD_NR  |738
    2|MOD_NAME|CHECK_ALLOWED_USER
   34|FILE_NR>|66                 !and this field also has a link defined

 Now follow the link to the third file (open automatic)

    DIX> Follow/automatic file_nr
    %DIX-I-USINGFIL, Using file DSA40:[DIR]CROSS_REF.CRF_FILE_NAMES
    %DIX-I-USINGDES, Using description SYSLIB(.CRF_FILE_NAMES)
    DIX> Exa *
    0|FILE_NR  |66
    2|FILE_NAME|REM_SERVER_CHECK_ACCESS

 Now backtrace to the CROSS_REF.CRF_MOD_NAMES file

    DIX> BACK
    %DIX-I-USINGFIL, Using file DSA40:[DIR]CROSS_REF.CRF_MOD_NAMES
    %DIX-I-USINGDES, Using description SYSLIB(.CRF_MOD_NAMES)
    DIX> Exa *
    0|MOD_NR  |738
    2|MOD_NAME|CHECK_ALLOWED_USER
   34|FILE_NR>|66
  

For a complete list of directives see the help in the DIX.HLB under the
topic "DISPLAY_MODES INTERPRETED_DUMP/DESCRIPTION RECORD_FORMAT". Use
DIX/HELP to display this help.

Note:

Be careful when modifying datafiles. DIX is very powerful and has no UNDO
function after you update the record. If you modify the record, there is 
no way back except the backup (if you have one). /BLOCK mode is even more
powerful, since it bypasses RMS.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
DQDRIVER, SOFTWARE, ATA/ATAPI (IDE) Disk Driver for OpenVMS Alpha

    Beware: This version is newer than OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-2.

    SYS$DQDRIVER is an ATA/ATAPI (IDE) disk driver for OpenVMS Alpha. 
    The driver was originally written and tested on an add-in ATA
    controller board as well as the on-board IDE controller found
    on early members of the AlphaStation series.

    The driver has been substantially revised in subsequent releases
    and includes ATAPI CD-ROM device support.  In addition, the driver
    has been incorporated in OpenVMS Alpha and is supported on various
    recent platforms.

    This version of SYS$DQDRIVER continues the inclusion of IO$_DIAGNOSE
    for use with CD-ROM audio and also for use with ATAPI devices such
    as CD-RW and DVD+RW.

    This version is newer than that included with OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-2, 
    and contains changes to IO$_DIAGNOSE not found in V7.3-2 and prior.
    This version particularly corrects cases where the SS$_NORMAL was
    erroneously returned when the requested IO$_DIAGNOSE operation had
    failed.  There may be (will be?) changes  made to this version prior
    to its release either as an ECO kit and/or with an OpenVMS Alpha
    and/or OpenVMS I64 release after V7.3-2.

    The driver is provided as an example, and as with any hardware-based
    tools, you should use at your own risk.  Failures within DQDRIVER can
    lead to OpenVMS system crashes, and errors may or may not result in
    disk and memory data inconsistencies or corruptions.

    A version of DECW$CDPLAYER been included in the kit.  This version
    contains enhancements for ATAPI CD-ROM audio support via the new
    IO$_DIAGNOSE interface in DQDRIVER.  The new version of the CD player
    can be used to play CD-ROM audio from either ATA/ATAPI drives or from
    SCSI CD-ROM drives.  

    This package has the following code modules:

	DQDRIVER.C		- ATA/ATAPI device driver source file.
        DQDRIVER.COM		- Build file for SYS$DQDRIVER
	ENABLE-IDE.C 		- tool to enable the built-in ATA for the
			  	  AlphaStation 400 4/233 and load the ATA
    				  driver.  (Beware: DQDRIVER is presently
                                  autoconfigured on all Alpha systems with
                                  support for ATA/ATAPI devices.)
	ENABLE-IDE.COM 		- Build file for ENABLE-IDE.C
	IDE-INFO 		- tool to dump the identity page information 
    				  from an ATA drive.
	IDE-INFO 		- Build file for IDE-INFO.C
	DECW$CDPLAYER.C		- New version of DECwindows CD-ROM audio 
    				  player with support for ATAPI CD-ROMs.
    	DECW$CDPALYER.UIL	- Interface definition file for CD player
	DECW$CDPLAYER.EXE	- Excutable for V7.1-2 
    	DECW$CDPALYER.UIL	- Compiled Interface definition file.  Must 
                                  be co-located with the .EXE file.

    Also included in this directory is the procedure LOAD_DQ_INTEL_SIO.COM,
    which will connect and load DQDRIVER for operation with the Intel SIO
    peripheral controller found on some members of the Personal Workstation
    -au series Alpha systems.  (DQDRIVER is supported with and autoconfigures
    on and can boot via the Cypress ATA/ATAPI PCI Peripheral Controller found
    on various Personal Workstation -au series systems.  OpenVMS cannot boot
    from ATA/ATAPI (IDE) devices connected via the Intel SIO PCI adapter. 
    If your system has the Intel SIO, you must boot from a SCSI device.)

    To determine which ATA/ATAPI controller you have, use the SRM console
    command SHOW CONFIGURATION.   If your controller is shown as:

             Bus 00 Slot 07: Cypress PCI Peripheral Controller

    You can directly use DQDRIVER, can boot from supported ATA/ATAPI devices,
    and do not require LOAD_DQ_INTEL_SIO.COM.  If your controller is:

             Bus 00 Slot 07: Intel SIO 82378

    You cannot bootstrap from any ATA/ATAPI devices, and DQDRIVER will not 
    configure automatically.  If you wish to use DQDRIVER with ATA/ATAPI
    devices connected via the Intel SIO, you will need LOAD_DQ_INTEL_SIO.COM.

DVDRTOOLS, UTILITIES, DVD-R/RW Recording Tools for OpenVMS

This is an early port of DVDRTOOLS-0_1_5.

The core CDRECORD engine is known to function with local CD-R drives,
but a (local) lack of DVD-R and DVD-RW drives and a lack of support 
within this DVDRTOOLS-0_1_5 for the available local DVD+R and DVD+RW
drives has meant that none of the DVD code has been tested.  

Again, CD-R operations have been tried and do function with Plextor
PlexWriter SCSI drives and do with CD-R media loaded in HP DVD200 
series DVD drives.

This version of MKISOFS is known not to function.  (Problems within
the assumptions made around the readdir and related calls being one
reported area of incompatibility.)

Other components of DVDRTOOLS here have not been tested.

DWREMTERM, SYSTEM_MGMT, Start X-Window displays on remote machines

This command procedure is designed to allow users flexability in using 
DECwindows across a large number of machines connected together by a 
Local Area Network. It allows users to create LAT, DECnet, Telnet and LDT
windows locally and connect to remote nodes or to create remote DECwindow
sessions using the RDT, RFV, RDW, DWRT and RSH commands. The remote
commands are actually network process's and therefore do not count as an
interactive login.

DWremterm can be run in two modes:
  MENU MODE: commands are entered from a Small Menu Window.
  COMMAND MODE: commands are entered from the DCL command line.

Valid command are:-
  HELP, DWHELP, LAT, DECNET, TELNET, LDR, RDT, RFV, RDW, RSH, DWRT and $.
Parameters listed are [] brackets is optional.
HELP: Gives details on how to receive Brief or Expanded Help
DWHELP: Provide detailed Help on DWremterm
LAT:    Creates a Local DECterm Window using a SET HOST/LAT command.
        LAT nodename
DECNET: Creates a Local DECterm Window using a SET HOST command.
        DECNET nodename
TELNET: Creates a Local DECterm Window using a TELNET command.
        TELNET nodename
LDT:    Creates a local decterm and then does an rlogin
        LDT nodename [init_state] [title]
RDT:    Creates a Remote Decterm Window.
        RDT nodename [init_state] [title] [dcl_command]
                     [display] [transport] [x:y]
RFV:    Creates a Remote Fileview Window.
        RFV nodename [init_state] [display] [transport]
RDW:    Runs a Remote Remote Decwindows Application.
        RDW nodename command [display] [transport]
RSH:    Runs RSH commands on a remote node.
        RSH nodename command
DWRT:   Starts a second DWremterm Window.
        DWRT nodename [init_state] [display] [transport]
$:      Executes a local DCL command

For further details refer to sys$library:dwremterm.hlb.

A unique window title and icon name is chosen by referencing the user's
process name. If the login sequence changes the process name then duplicate
window and icon names may occur.

Refer to SYS$HELP:DWREMTERM.HLP for further help by typing:-
@VUE$LIBRARY:DWREMTERM DWHELP.

DWremterm consists of two files:
SYS$COMMON:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]DWREMTERM.COM 
SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]DWREMTERM.HLB

The RDT, RDW, DWRT and RFV commands require DWREMTERM.COM to exist on the
both the local and remote node and requires the user to either specify node
access control or for the remote account to be set up for proxy access.
DWremterm can simply reside in sys$login on the remote node, which requires
each user to have their own copy -or- DWremterm can be defined as a DECnet
object, requiring each system to have only one copy.

DECNET:
To install DWremterm as a network object the system manager should enter the
following commands:
DECnet/IV:
 $ MCR NCP
 NCP> DEFINE OBJECT DWREMTERM NUMBER 0 FILE -
      SYS$COMMON:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]DWREMTERM.COM PROXY BOTH
 NCP> SET OBJECT DWREMTERM ALL
 NCP> EXIT
 $
DECnet/OSI:
 $@sys$startup:net$configure application_add dwremterm "" -
 "{name=dwremterm}||vue$library:dwremterm.com|true|true|true|true|true||||1"

If DWremterm is not installed as a network object then by default no other 
setups are required. However if the DECnet object task has been modified to 
disable proxy access then DWremterm will fail. In this case the system 
manager should enter the following commands:
 $ MCR NCP
 NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TASK PROXY BOTH
 NCP> SET OBJECT TASK ALL
 NCP> EXIT
 $

PROXY accounts allow one user direct access to another users account
 without having to specify username and password. The system manager
 can set up proxy account access from within AUTHORIZE. 
 Example:  $ MCR AUTHORIZE>
           UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL KINGSMILL/DEFAULT
           UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL OLSENK
           UAF> EXIT
           $
 This examples allows user KINGSMILL on node MVAX into the local KINGSMILL 
 and OLSENK account. The default switch enables you to specify just the 
 nodename when addressing this node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX::
 If Default access is not specified then you need to specify the 
 nodename and username when addressing this node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"OLSENK"::
 If you do not have proxy access then you need to specify the
 nodename, username and password when addressing a remote node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"SYSTEM password"::

LAT:
 VMS V5.5-2 is required for outgoing LAT. This is enabled as follows:-
 MCR LATCP> SET NODE/CONNECTION=BOTH.

TCPIP:
 To prevent the need to use passwords on the RSH command proxies can be
 set up to authorize remote user access. To set up remote user access
 on a UNIX machine, or TCPWARE/MULTINET under VMS you specify the remote
 node and username in the .rhosts file which resides in the users home
 directory. With UCX you use the "UCX> ADD PROXY command"
 In addition, if you don't want to specify a password on RSH and RLOGIN
 you may need to add the following:-
 UCX> set service rsh /flag=(proxy,case)
 UCX> set service rlogin /flag=(proxy,case)

DISPLAY SECURITY: 
 The Factory Defaults prohibit a remote users from displaying their
 output to your workstation. To authorize other users or remote
 nodes to use your workstation display you should:
   1. Choose Security... from Session Manager's Options menu.
   2. Type the nodename, the username, and the method of transport,
      of the user you want to authorize. Entering * * * will allow
      any user on any node with any transport to display output on
      your workstaton.
   3. Click on the Add button and the Clock OK.
 Refer to the DECwindows user guide for further information.
 
CONFIGURATION SETUPS:
  The following logicals can be used to alter default DWremterm behaviour.
  DWREMTERM_ENABLE_COPY gives the user the option of copying the latest
    version of DWREMTERM should there be a mismatch in versions between
    the local and remote node.
  The WINDOW POSITION and INITIAL STATE can be altered from the default
    by editing the resource file. Details on how to do this is given within 
    the following resource files. 
      Default DWremterm window:
      - decw$user_defaults:dwremterm$default_v*.dat 
      DWRT DWremterm window:
      - decw$user_defaults:dwremterm$dwrt_default_v*.dat 
        This is on the remote node/users account.
      You can also override the DWRT resource file window position by
      defining the logical names DWREMTERM_DWRT_X and DWREMTERM_DWRT_Y
      under your local user account. These values are then passed to
      the remote node/users account.
  LAT$DISCONNECT_CHARACTER defines the character that you can use to 
    disconnect from a remote session. Default character is Ctrl+\.
  SYS$SCRATCH - temporary files are written to sys$scratch. If you don't
    want the temporary files written to sys$login then define sys$scratch.

TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS:
o Ensure that Security has been set up to enable a remote node to
  display output on your workstation. See installation section above
  for further details.
o The following logicals can be used to aid in troubleshooting
  These can be defined before starting DWremterm or during a DWremterm 
  Session by using the $ command.
    DWREMTERM_VERBOSE to display the progress of both local and remote 
      events. If verbose is enabled then a full sized menu window will 
      be displayed. This can also be enabled by prefixing the version 
      with an "X".
    DWREMTERM_VERIFY to turn on verify and verbose.
o NETSERVER.LOG on the remote node may also aid in troubleshooting.
o DWREMTERM_'pid'*.COM temporary file on the remote node shows the created
    command file.
o DWREMTERM_'pid'_*.LOG temporary file on on the remote node showing the
    output from dwremterm_'pid'_*.TMP
o If you have problems creating DECterms then get the latest DECterm patch
    from your CSC.

TIPS:
o By default you cannot shutdown VMS from an RDT window when running
  DECnet/OSI or DECnet/Plus because the shutdown procedure stops DECnet,
  which aborts the DWremterm session and the shutdown procedure itself.
  You can workaround this by doing the following:-
  $ DEFINE NET$STARTUP_STATUS SHUTDOWN
  $ @SYS$SYSTEM:SHUTDOWN

FIXUP_IMAGE, UTILITIES, Fix an image's shareable image information

Copyright 2001, Applied Synergy, Inc.  All rights reserved.

FIXUP_IMAGE can edit the shareable image information in an executable image
file.  This can be used to avoid the dreaded:

%DCL-W-ACTIMAGE, error activating image VAXCRTL
-CLI-E-IMGNAME, image file DKA0:[SYS0.SYSCOMMON.][SYSLIB]VAXCRTL.EXE
-SYSTEM-F-SHRIDMISMAT, ident mismatch with shareable image

In some cases, it can also remove extraneous references to shareables that do
not exist on the current system.  For example, it can remove this message which
can occur when you try to run an image linked under VMS V6 or later on a VMS V5
system:

%DCL-W-ACTIMAGE, error activating image CMA$TIS_SHR
-CLI-E-IMAGEFNF, image file not found DKA0:[SYS0.SYSCOMMON.][SYSLIB]CMA$TIS_SHR.EXE;


FIXUP_IMAGE V2.0 only supports VAX executables.

                     General Freeware V6.0 release notes
                     -----------------------------------

  o There were the usual problems building the distributions due to errors
    found in various FREEWARE_README.TXT files, and due to submissions that
    were missing the (required0 FREEWARE_README.TXT file.  The Keeper of the
    Freeware (KoF) apologizes for these changes, and for the last-minute 
    changes.

  o Several BACKUP saveset submissions were unpacked only with difficulty, due
    to problems with the ZIP archive files.  Various file attributes were reset
    to match OpenVMS expectations, but there may well be additional files that
    do not have the expected file attributes.  One tool that may be useful for
    this [000TOOLS]RESET_BACKUP_SAVESET_ATTRIBUTES.COM.

  o Most of the submissions in this kit were zipped solely to try to fit the 
    total volume of Freeware submissions -- and thank you for your response 
    to the Freeware collection effort! -- onto the available CD-ROM storage.
    Kits providing PCSI or VMSINSTAL installation kits were zipped in multiple
    parts, and the installation kits were left available outside the main zip
    archive for the submission.  For the unzip tool, please see [000TOOLS] 
    and (if you cannot use the pre-built version here for some reason) please 
    see the various sites offering pre-built Zip images referenced in the
    OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

  o Kits that were submitted as zip archives were unzipped first, and then
    re-zipped into a consistent format and settings.  This means various of 
    the submissions will appear different than what was originally submitted.
    For the unzip tool, please see [000TOOLS] and also please consider the 
    unzip download pointers in the OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

  o The menu system is deliberately not requiring all CD-ROMs in the Freeware
    set to be mounted at the same time -- this avoids the requirement to have
    multiple CD-ROM drives.  This also unfortunately makes it somewhat more
    difficult to rummage around on the various disks.

  o Please take the time to examine the following files and directories:

      [000000]AAAREADME.*
      [000000]OPENVMS_FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS_FAQ.TXT
      [000000]00FREEWARE_ABSTRACT.TXT
      [000TOOLS]*.*
      [FREEWARE]*.*
      [VMSFAQ]*.*

    These files are replicated on all Freeware CD-ROM disks.

  o Current copies of the OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document
    are available at:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
FSHELP, utilities, A full screen help utility with lots of extra's

  FSHELP is a screen-oriented help utility. It makes use of SMG routines to 
  display help on video terminals. It has the following features

  - Full screen display of normal .HLB files (scrolling in both directions).
    Fshelp can also display data from .TLB, .OLB and .MLB files including
    an analyze/object of a module in an .OLB file.
  - Selecting subtopics by just typing the name of the subtopic or enter.
  - Allows cross-referencing of help modules via extra info in help file.
  - Allows header lines to remain on screen when scrolling.
  - Allows you to look back at the last 20 topics.
  - Allows you to mark some help topics for easy return to this topic
  - Allows you to toggle 132/80 columns
  - On all screens help can be displayed via the HELP or PF2 key
  - FSHELP checks for all libraries via the hlp$library* logicals
     and lets you select one of them via the TAB key.
  - FSHELP also interfaces to the HELP/MESSAGE databases so you can
     define FSHELP as your normal help utility (HELP:=$'directory'FSHELP)
  - There is a sharable image that can be called from any other application
     to display help (lib$find_image_symbol), so you can display help
     in FSHELP format from any image.
  - FSHELP messages are in English, Nederlands(Dutch) or Frysk (A language
     spoken in the north of Holland). You can easily add you own language
     (see the .MSG file for help). FSHELP does not translate text in helpfiles,
     only the FSHELP messages are in the selected language.
  - You can search text within a help page ((PF1-)PF3), or on this page and all 
    deeper levels ((PF1-)FIND). If you are on the top page of the help library, 
    you can search through the whole library, or even in all loaded 
    libraries.
  
  Help files and libraries are in the same format as normal VMS help files. 
  The format is described in the 
  VMS LIBRARIAN UTILITY MANUAL, chapter 5 : HELP Libraries
  with the following additions. All these commands start with an ! so
  VMSHELP will ignore them.

  a. !# Signal the end of header lines in a help text. Th(is)(ese) lines
        (upto 4) will remain on screen, even when the rest of the text
        is scrolled.
  b. ![text on screen]@library topic topic ...
        FSHELP will save this information, and when you type the 
        F12 key, a list of topics will be displayed, from which you 
        can select one. @library is optional. This gives a possibility to
        make see-also entries.
  c. !@[text on screen]DCL command|dcl command...
	FSHELP will save this information, and when you type the
	PF1-E (execute) command, FSHELP will let you select one of the 
        execute-scripts.
        FSHELP will generate a batch-job in the queue FSHELP_QUEUE (default
        SYS$BATCH) containing the above lines (separated by |). In these
        commands you can specify symbols to be asked from you.
        These symbols are separated by '. FSHELP will check if there is
        a symbol with that name. If this symbol exists FSHELP will substitute
        the value of that symbol, otherwise FSHELP will ask you for
        a substitution.
        Example  !@[header]$compute 'test'/out=q.q|$print/delete q.q
        will try to find the symbol test, and if not found will ask you
        to specify a new value for 'test'. Then a batchjob will be 
        submitted in the queue in the symbol FSHELP_QUEUE (default SYS$BATCH)
        containing the lines:
         $compute new_value/out=q.q
         $print/delete q.q
        where new_value is the value found in the symbol TEST or the value
        given by you.

  VMS HELP will ignore all lines starting with ! (as will FSHELP), so these
  lines can be included without interfering with VMS HELP.

  You can enter help topics on the command line, just as VMS HELP.
  The format is

  fshelp [@libraryname] [topic [topic...]]

 FSHELP does not only display help files, it can also display data from
  .TLB, .OLB (object and shareable image files) and .MLB files
  via the qualifier(s) /text, /object, /image and /macro

 For further help look at the FSHELP help file, you can do that by typing
 fshelp=$'directory'fshelp_alpha  (or _vax)
 fshelp/ownhelp
  Where 'directory' is the directory where fshelp (and its help file )
  can be found

 When looking at a help page, you can display the deeper topics by
 typing a Return, a /,  or a letter. This will display a menu containing
 the deeper topics. The / or letter will jump to the first topic containing
 that letter (or starting with that letter if you specified /NOSEARCHWILD).
 Typing FIND will jump to the next topic that matches.
 By typing more letters you can make your search more exact.
 PF4 or F10 returns to the previous screen. For more help type PF2 or HELP.

Usage:

Define fshelp as a foreign command
$FSHE*LP:=$'diretory'FSHELP_ALPHA   or FSHELP_VAX

Start it as normal help

$FSHELP [topic [subtopic...]]]	!give normal help
$FSHELP/OWNHELP			!give help info about FSHELP
$FSHELP/TEXT [module] 		!Display [the module in] FORSYSDEF.TLB
$FSHELP/IMAGE  [module]		!display [the module in] IMAGELIB.OLB library
$FSHELP/OBJECT [module]         !Display [the module in] STARLET.OLB library
				! in the deeper help you can get analyze/object info
$FSHELP/MACRO  [module]		!display [the module in] LIB.MLB
$FSHELP/LIBR=*.HLB		!Display help about all .HLB files in SYS$HELP
$FSHELP/LIBR=*.HLB/LOAD		!Read all info from all .HLB files to memory for
				! fast access (this takes a while, but if you do
				! not leave FSHELP, access is fast).
				!  select libraries via the TAB key.
$FSHELP/MESSAGE Accvio          !give help/mess about the ACCVIO item

The libraries chosen for the /text, /objext, /macro ,/image can be changed.
  See the .MSG file for more info

There are a lot more qualifiers, see the FSHELP/OWNHELP for more info.

Note: Of course you can also define FSHELP as HELP.

Also included is a shareable image that can be called from any application
See the FSHELP_OUTPUT_HELP_EXAMPLE.FOR for more info.

GD, Graphics, Library to create graphs from programs

Installation

Just execute @make to build the library. This checks for available compilers 
as well as MMS/MMK and uses them for the build if available. Upon first 
invocation make will generate a template vmslib.dat, which needs to be 
tailored to reflect your local installation.
 
Minimum requirement for using the current version of the GDlib is to have 
installed Libpng and Zlib. Additional features of the library can be used if 
the following libraries are available too: Jpeglib, Freetype 2, and XPMlib. 
All information on these libraries needed by the build procedure is collected 
in the file vmslib.dat. The format of this is documented here. If not 
available make.com will create a template vmslib.dat upon first invocation 
which needs to be tailored to match the local installation. 


Build options


Make.com currently accepts the following options in arbitrary order: 

DEBUG
Build the library with debug information and without optimization. 
lopts=<value>
Options to pass to the link command e.g. lopts=/tracback 
ccopt=<value>
Options to pass to the C compiler e.g. ccopt=/float=ieee 
LINK
Do not compile, just link GD example programs 
CC=<DECC||VAXC||GNUC>
Force usage of the given C compiler over the intrinsic selection (which is 
DEC C, VAX C, and finally GNU C). 

Package contents


The main result of the compilation ist he object library libgd.olb, which 
other applications need to link against. Additionally a number of small 
executable programs are created: 

ANNOTATE
Add text to a JPEG graphics files 
FONTSIZETEST
Creates four test images with fonts of varying sizes 
FONTWHEELTEST
Creates four test images of spoke wheels 
GD2COPYPAL

GHOSTSCRIPT,UTILITIES,Postscript and PDF interpreter for OpenVMS

An interpreter for the PostScript language and the Adobe Portable
Document Format (PDF -- sometimes confused with Acrobat, Adobe's PDF
browser and editor product);

Input modules (utilities) for reading a variety of raster formats,
including CMYK, GIF, JFIF (JPEG), MIFF, PBM/PGM/PPM, and PCX;  Output
modules (drivers) for a wide variety of window systems (including X
Windows and Microsoft Windows), raster file formats, and printers, as
well as a PDF output module that implements functions similar to
Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product; and

The Ghostscript library, a set of procedures to implement the
graphics and filtering capabilities that are primitive operations in
the PostScript language and in PDF.

In simple terms, this means that Ghostscript can read a PostScript or
PDF file and display the results on the screen or convert them into a
form you can print on a non-PostScript printer. Especially together
with several popular previewers, with Ghostscript you can view or
print an entire document or even isolated pages, even if your
computer doesn't have Display PostScript and your printer doesn't
handle PostScript itself.

GNM, LANGUAGES, Common-sources tool for messages and documentation

This is GNM V2.0.

The GNM compiler allow you to have a common source file for both an 
OpenVMS message file (.MSG) and for DOCUMENT (.SDML) documentation.

GNM V2.0 is an overhaul of previous GNM versions, with improvements 
in the tool and its operations.  The command operations also differ 
from previous versions, and particularly with better diagnostics and
with a single executable image now used for both .MSG and .SDML output.

Here is the basic foreign-command sequence:

  $ gnm :== $ddcu:[dir]gnm.exe
  $ gnm gnm-in-file.gnm msg-out-file.msg sdml-out-file.sdml

GNM converts a .GNM file into a standard OpenVMS message file, which
can then be processed by the MESSAGE compiler and then (optionally)
with MESSAGE/SDL and the SDL tool to create language-specific include 
files.  GNM also converts the .GNM file into an .SDML file for use
with DOCUMENT.

The .GNM file can be thought of as a series of directives:

   .NAME	    - The message symbol without the VDE$_
   .MESSAGE	    - The message text, it may be wrapped
   .EXPLANATION    - The description that appears in the document
   .USER_ACTION    - The recovery section that appears in the document.
   .BREAK	    - May be used to start a new paragraph in the
		      .explanation or .user_action
   .DESTINATION    - Which file the following appears in, parameters are
		      both, message
   .SEVERITY       - informational, success, warning, error, or fatal

The first 4 directives: .name, .message, .explanation, .user_action,
occur as a group in that order for each message.  .explanation and
.user_action are optional.  The FAO arguments within the .message
are contained within <>.  Within the <> there are 2 arguments, the
first is a word which will be emphasized in that position in the
document, the second is the FAO argument which will appear in the
message file in that position.  

The .destination directive must appear between message groups and is
in effect until another .destination directive occurs.  Thus, when
one message is to goto the message file only a .destination message
will precede the message group and a .destination both will follow
the group.  

.FACILITY and .END frame the contents of the GNM file.  The arguments
on the .FACILITY directive indicate the facility name and the facility
number, and the directive also accepts qualifiers to pass through to 
the MESSAGE file .FACILITY directive.

Use spaces for the indentation of the message text and explanations.

The following is an example of a GNM file:


.facility	facnam,facnum /PREFIX=prefix$_
!
! Success messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
!
.severity success
.destination message

.name	    SUCCESS1
.message	successful
.explanation	This message indicates success
.user_action	None required
!
! Informational messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
!
.base 500
.severity informational
.destination both

.name	    INFO1
.message	information <text, !AC> is displayed
.explanation	This message informs you of something, and shows how
		to include some text in the message using a standard
                FAO directive.
.user_action	None required

!
! Warning messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
! 
.base 1000
.severity warning
.destination both

.name	    WARNING1
.message	ambiguous '<text,!AC>'
.explanation	Cannot complete the command because '<EMPHASIS>(text)' 
		is ambiguous in the context of this command.
.user_action	None required

!
! Error messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.
!
.base 1500
.severity error
.destination both

.name	    ERROR1
.message	whoops, something unusual this way walked
.explanation	a part of the magical unknown mystery tour,
                with seats still available.
.user_action	Wave a rubber chicken over the application.
                If that fails, upgrade to Rubber Chicken V2.0.

!
! Fatal messages go here.  DO NOT REORDER.  Very few messages should
! be of fatal severity.
!
.base 2000
.severity fatal
.destination both

.name	    FATAL1
.message	a fatal crash has occured, film at 11
.explanation	unknown fatal mystery error
.user_action	Dance for the computer.  It might help.

GZIP, UTILITIES, GNU Zip - compress and decompress files

This is the GNU Zip application.  It takes a file of the form FOO.BAR-GZ
and converts it into FOO.BAR or converts a FOO.BAR file into FOO.BAR-GZ. 
Note that you give the filename without the "-GZ" suffix, and GZIP will add
or remove it - depending on if you are compressing or decompressing.

GNU Zip is written by the Free Software Foundation, more information as
well as all of the sources are available in the ZIP file (use UNZIP to
unzip).

This version, 1.4.2b, includes modifications from Paul Repacholi that make
GUNZIP as much as 10 times faster than the previous release of GZIP for
VMS.  This .ZIP file includes binaries for both VAX and Alpha, supplied by

HTDIG, WEB_TOOLS, WWW indexing and searching system

The ht://Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and
searching system for a small domain or intranet. This system is
*not* meant to replace the need for powerful internet-wide search
systems like Lycos, Infoseek, Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead
it is meant to cover the search needs for a single company, campus,
or even a particular sub section of a web site.

As opposed to some WAIS or web server based search engines, ht://Dig
can span several web servers at a site. The type of these different
web servers doesn't matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1.0
protocol.

This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.

This OpenVMS port of ht://Dig 3.1.6 will install and run under OpenVMS
Alpha V7.2 or later. The most recent version can be found at
http://www.pdv-systeme.de/users/martinv/htdig/ and by anonymous FTP
to ftp.pdv-systeme.de in the directory vms/ .

To set up the software:

- Unpack the archive:

    $ RUN CDROM:[HTDIG]GNU-AXPVMS-HTDIG-V0301-6R2-1.PCSI-ZIP_AXPEXE

  where CDROM is the drive that contains the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM.

- Install the software:

    $ PRODUCT INSTALL HTDIG

  Please see the PRODUCT command's help for available qualifiers.

  The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) isn't yet perfect,
  so you may try and continue with the installation even if it fails.

- Complete the base installation by executing

    $ @SYS$STARTUP:HTDIG_STARTUP CONFIG
    
  This will create SYS$MANAGER:HTDIG_CONFIG.DAT .
  
- Set up the software by executing

    $ @SYS$STARTUP:HTDIG_STARTUP START

  The "START" parameter is optional, if SYS$MANAGER:HTDIG_CONFIG.DAT
  exists. This command should also be included in the system startup.

- Make HTDIG_ROOT:[CGI-BIN]HTSEARCH.EXE accesible to the web server
  as a CGI program.
  
  The procedure depends on your web server software; e.g. for CSWS:
  $ SET SECURITY /OWNER=APACHE$WWW HTDIG_ROOT:[CGI-BIN]HTSEARCH.EXE

- Make sure that the directories HTDIG_ROOT:[COMMON], [CONF],
  and [DB], all files in these directories, and the shareable image
  HTDIG_ROOT:[BIN]LIBDB_SHR.EXE are accessible to HTSEARCH.EXE
  when run by the account the web server runs under.

  The procedure depends on your web server software; e.g. for CSWS:

    $ SET FILE /OWNER=APACHE$WWW -
    _$ HTDIG_ROOT:[000000]COMMON.DIR, CONF.DIR, DB.DIR, -
    _$ [COMMON]*.*;*, [CONF]*.*;*, [DB]*.*;*, -
    _$ [BIN]LIBDB_SHR.EXE

- Edit HTDIG_ROOT:[CONF]HTDIG.CONF to suit your needs. Complete
  documentation of the product including a description of all
  configuration attributes is installed by default, and can be
  found in HTDIG_ROOT:[DOCUMENTATION].

  Especially modify the line containing the "start_url" attribute.
  Without being changed, the online ht://Dig documentation at
  http://www.htdig.org/ will be indexed!

  Path and file specification attributes (e.g. common_dir, url_list)
  can be written in either VMS or Unix syntax, i.e. DEVICE:[DIR1.DIR2]
  can also be written as /device/dir1/dir2.

  When using variables in file specifications, a directory variable
  must be separated from the filename by a slash, e.g. ${database_dir}/db,
  regardless of the notation of the directory. This syntax is consistent
  with the ht://Dig documentation.

  As the dollar sign is used as a variable designator in attribute
  values, all dollar characters in device and directory names must
  be escaped (i.e. prepended with a backslash). That is, USER$DISK:[DIR]
  must be written as USER\$DISK:[DIR] or /user\$disk/dir.

  In the "external_parsers" and "pdf_parser" attributes' values, the
  external converter or parser programs must be valid DCL commands.

  The default values for attributes that are defined at compile time
  (refered to in the configuration file documentation) are:

    BIN_DIR           /htdig_root/bin
    COMMON_DIR        /htdig_root/common
    CONFIG_DIR        /htdig_root/conf
    DATABASE_DIR      /htdig_root/db
    IMAGE_URL_PREFIX  /htdig_image
    PDF_PARSER        pdftops
    VERSION           3.1.6-2/VMS

  The file specification of the default configuration file is found
  by the logical name HTDIG_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE.

- Before you can start searching, you have to create a search
  database. A sample command procedure to do this is provided
  in HTDIG_ROOT:[BIN]RUNDIG.COM.

- HTDIG_ROOT:[SEARCH]SEARCH.HTML contains a sample search form.
  The <FORM ACTION> attribute value must be changed to point to
  HTSEARCH.EXE. Also pay attention to the <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN>
  fields. The provided SEARCH.HTML uses image files from
  HTDIG_ROOT:[IMAGE], which must then too be accessible to
  the web server, of course.

- Tools to index PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint files
  are available for download at the URL mentioned above.

JPEG, Graphics, Library supporting the JPEG format

Installation

The best way to build the Jpeg library is currently to execute the
modified DCL procedure make_vms.com from this server. This procedure
will examine the system environment, create a suitable jconfig.h file
and use the available tools (MMS/MMK, C compiler) to rebuild the
sources. Make_vms.com currently accepts the following options in
arbitrary order:

DEBUG
  Build the library with debug information and without optimization.
lopts=<value>
  Options to pass to the link command e.g. lopts=/tracback
ccopt=<value>
  Options to pass to the C compiler e.g. ccopt=/float=ieee
LINK
  Do not compile, just link Jpeg example programs and shareable image
CC=<DECC||VAXC||GNUC>
  Force usage of the given C compiler over the intrinsic selection
  (which is DEC C, VAX C, and finally GNU C).

An object library of the Jpeg code will be generated in any case, on
OpenVMS Alpha additionally a shareable image will be created.
It also ensures a working copy of testimgp.jpg is available for testing.

Test problems with progressive Jpeg file

In case you do experience problems with the check for the progressive
Jpeg test image (i.e. Backup /Compare/Log testimgp.jpg. testoutp.jpg.)
you most probably packed the original file testimgp.jpg directly with
Zip. This causes an extra byte to turn up at the end of the file after
unpacking. I suspect this is a bug and have reported this to the
Zip/UnZip developers. To circumvent this the archive from this server
contains a backup saveset with this specific image.

Package contents

The main result of the compilation is the object library libjpeg.olb
(OpenVMS Alpha: jpegshr.exe), which other applications need to link
against. Additionally five small executable programs are created:

CJPEG
  Compress an image file to a JPEG file. Supported input formats: PPM (PBMPLUS
  color format), PGM (PBMPLUS gray-scale format), BMP, Targa
DJPEG
  Decompress a JPEG file to an image file. Supported output formats: PBMPLUS
  (PPM/PGM), BMP, GIF, Targa
JPEGTRAN
  Jpegtran translates JPEG files from one variant of JPEG to another,
  for example from baseline JPEG to progressive JPEG.
RDJPGCOM
  Display text comments from a JPEG file
WRJPGCOM
  Insert text comments into a JPEG file

More-detailed descriptions:

BAD_CHARS.COM

Take file with odd characters added by Windows and
replace odd characters with equivalents.  For example,
Windows uses <PU2> for apostrophe, and left and right
double-quote marks.  This DCL fixes these up by
replacing them with an apostrophe and regular
quotation marks, respectively.  Pass the procedure the
name of the file, and it creates a new version of the
file with the characters fixed.


CONTIG.COM

Creates or extends a system file in as contiguous a manner as possible.  System
files can only have one file header (no extension headers) because they are
accessed by primitive code.  In a Contiguous Best Try file extension, VMS will
find the three largest extents on the disk, but then gives up and proceeds to
allocates space arbitrarily for the rest of the file.  This means the file
header for a system file may fill up prematurely, sometimes before the desired
file size is reached, and a backup/restore of the entire disk is then required
to repack the file before it can be extended to the desired size. This DCL
procedure finds the largest free extent and enlarges the file by only that
amount each cycle, repeating this until the desired size is reached, thus
minimizing the degree of fragmentation for the resulting file, and minimizing
the number of extents used up in the file header. 


COMBINE_FEEDBACK.COM

Logically combines feedback data from multiple files.

Some systems (especially government systems) are not
allowed to run continuously for the 24 hours or more
that AUTOGEN wants for valid feedback data.  These
systems may run 8 hours per day, then be shut down and
have their disks removed and locked in a safe overnight.
This DCL procedure logically combines the data from
multiple AUTOGEN feedback files, so that if feedback
data is saved at the end of each uptime session, these
periods of data can effectively be combined together
and used as input to AUTOGEN as if they were contiguous.
The procedure basically works by adding the values from
cumulative counters together, finding the highest value
for peak values, and using the most recent data for any
data items which represent "current" data, and adding
the elapsed times together.


DECNET_LATENCY.COM

Sends 100 loopback packets using NCP, and measures the
average round-trip network latency.  Since it uses
the NCP> LOOP NODE command, it needs DECnet Phase IV.


EDIT_LAVC.COM

LAVC$FAILURE_ANALYSIS is a facility included in VMS that
produces OPCOM messages on LAN cluster interconect
failures.  It is documented in an appendix of the OpenVMS
Cluster Systems Manual, but was fairly troublesome to
set up.  This DCL procedure gathers all the information
necessary and even creates a customized version of the
LAVC$FAILURE_ANALYSIS.MAR program for a given cluster,
taking all the pain out of getting LAVC$FAILURE_ANALYSIS
up and running.  More info may be found in the file
EDIT_LAVC_README.TXT.

FIXQUE.COM

Creates DCL code to re-create queues, jobs, forms, and
characteristics, based on output listing from $SHOW QUEUE.
Was developed to solve queue file corruption; still useful
to help in moving queues and jobs between systems or
setting up one cluster to have the same queue environment
as another.  Is also supplied in a "squeezed" version
(FIXQUE_SQZ.COM) for faster execution.


LAVC$FAILURE_OFF.MAR

Short Macro program to turn off LAVC$FAILURE_ANALYSIS if
desired.


NODE$TRACK.COM

Track cluster membership and notify someone by e-mail when things change, like
when a node leaves the cluster or joins the cluster.


SIFT_LAVC.COM

Sifts through OPERATOR.LOG files on all nodes in a cluster
and creates a time-sorted, consolidated list of all the %LAVC
console messages from SYS$EXAMPLES:LAVC$FAILURE_ANALYSIS.MAR
in the format of:
    dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.cc nodexx %LAVC-s-ident, text
This allows one to more easily determine the sequence of
events and timing in a failure of a cluster interconnect.


SHADOW$CONFIG.COM

Determine the existence, membership, and status of all shadowsets on the
system, and their member devices.  Stores results in either DCL symbols or
in logical names.

The following information is returned by the procedure:
SHADOW$CONFIG_set_count                     Number of shadowsets
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_LABEL                   Volume label for each shadowset
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_DEVICE_NAME             DSAn: device name for shadowset
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_MEMBER_COUNT            shadowset size (# of members)
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_MEMBER_m_DEVICE_NAME    Member device names
SHADOW$CONFIG_SET_n_MEMBER_m_STATE          Member state: "ShadowMember",
                                            "FullCopying", or "MergeCopying"
There is also a timestamp logical name defined if the results are placed
into logical names:
SHADOW$CONFIG_TIMESTAMP                     Time of data-gathering


SHADOW$DISPLAY.COM

Display, in semi-graphical format, all the host-based volume shadowing
shadow sets, highlighting any anomalies (such as lack of redundancy
or full copies in progress) with the judicious use of color.


SHAD$DISPLAY.COM

Abbreviated version of SHADOW$DISPLAY.COM, taking less on-screen real estate. 

This version optionally supports a multi-site disaster-tolerant cluster
configuration (it does assume that disk allocation classes are $1$ at one site
and $2$ at the other site so it can tell which site a given disk is located
at).  Shadowsets without cross-site shadowing protection are then flagged as
unprotected, even if they have two or more members, if all are within a single
site.


SHADOW$TRACK.COM

Track shadowset membership and notify someone by e-mail when a member is added
or lost, when a new shadowset is created, or when a shadowset goes away. 


SHOW_PATHS.COM

DCL procedure to display LAN cluster interconnect
details in the form of a connectivity matrix.
Nodes and their LAN adapters are shown along the
top and left of the matrix, with connectivity
indicated by a "+" at the conjunction of any two
adapters which can communicate with each other
using the NISCA protocol.


SHOW_PATHS_ECS.COM

DCL procedure to display LAN cluster interconnect
details in the form of a connectivity matrix, but
with the added detail of indicating Preferred Paths
in VMS versions prior to 7.3, and Equivalent
Channel Set information for VMS versions 7.3 and
above.


SHOW_SEGMENTS.COM

Shows the LAN cluster interconect configuration
in the form of an ASCII line drawing.

(For DECUS presentations describing the theory behind these tools and how
they operate, see the websites http://www2.openvms.org/kparris/ and
http://www.geocities.com/keithparris/, looking for the latest incarnation
of the presentation which has been entitled at various times things like
'Monitoring and Controlling the VMS Lock Manager or or 'OpenVMS Distributed
Lock Manager Performance'.  As of this writing, the latest version is at: 
www.geocities.com/keithparris/decus_presentations/s2002_dist_lock_mgr_perf.ppt)

* indicates a new tool for the V6 release.  Most of the existing tools have
  been significantly improved for the V6 Freeware CD.

Determine which lock trees are the busiest, cluster-wide:
	LOCK_ACTV.COM - DCL to collect and display lock-rate data immediately
	LOCK_ACTV_DC.COM - DCL to collect lock-rate data only (no analysis)
			   for lower system overhead at time of data collection
	LOCK_ACTV_RG.COM - DCL to generate a report on lock rates later from
		           data collected earlier by LOCK_ACTV_DC.COM
	LCKACT_RUN.COM - DCL to run proper version of LCKACT based on VMS version
	LCKACT.MAR - Macro-32 source code
	BUILD_LCKACT.COM - DCL to compile/link LCKACT.MAR
		Note: SYSGEN parameter PE1 must be either left at its default
		value of 0 or set to a positive value for the counters that
		LCKACT uses to be updated by VMS.  If you have set PE1 to -1
		to disable lock remastering entirely and wish to use this
		tool, I suggest using a value of positive 1 instead.  PE1
		is a dynamic SYSGEN parameter, so no reboot is needed to change
		it.

Detect and display lock queues:
	LCKQUE.COM - Display lock queues.  Now incorporates source code for
		     LCKACT.MAR.  Call with "BUILD" as P1 parameter to compile/
		     link the Macro program.  This replaces the formerly-
		     separate files LCKQUE.COM, LCKQUE.MAR, LCKQUE_RUN.COM, and
		     BUILD_LCKQUE.COM.

	Information on the updates to LCKACT and LCKQUE may be found in the
	file LCKACT_LCKQUE_README.TXT

Measure lock-request latencies across all nodes in a cluster:
  *	LOCKTIME.COM -  DCL to measure lock-request round-trip latencies in
			a cluster.
			Call with BUILD as P1 parameter to compile/link.  Uses
			Roy Davis's LOCKTIME_* program pair.  Generates
			.CSV file with matrix of lock latencies for all
			node-to-node combinations in the cluster, suitable for
			importing into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
			More information is in the file LOCKTIME_README.TXT.

DCL procedures to help determine if lock remastering activity is taking place.
	RBLD.COM - Display remastering-message counts using SDA
	WATCH_RBLD.COM - Using RBLD.COM, monitor counts and note activity
	  (Note that with VMS 7.2 or later, this info is available from
	   SDA> SHOW LOCK/SUMMARY under the "Lock Remaster Counters:" heading,
           and from 7.3 or later with $MONITOR RLOCK)

Determine which node is the lock master for the RMS global buffer lock tree
for a file:
	FINDMASTER_FILE.COM - DCL: given filespec for an RMS file, determine
        lock master node
	FINDMASTER.MAR - Macro-32 source code
	BUILD_FINDMASTER.COM - Compile/link FINDMASTER.MAR

Generate lots of locks to convince VMS to remaster an RMS global buffer lock
tree:
	LOTSALOX.MAR - Macro to generate lots of lock requests
	MOVE_MASTER.COM, FORCE_MASTER_FILE.COM - DCL to use LOTSALOX.MAR to
			try to move lock tree to this node

Map from File Number and device name to file specification:
 *	FILE_ID_TO_NAME.COM - DCL to look up file spec. from file number/disk

The following programs are available upon request, but are not on this CD
-- see below for where to request them.

REMASTER.MAR, a program to trigger lock tree remastering by modifying contents
	of VMS data structures

LCMRM.MAR, a program to report cases where there is pent-up remastering demand,
	that is, VMS would like to remaster a lock tree, but is prevented from
	doing so by a non-zero setting for the SYSGEN parameter PE1.

LYNX, UTILITIES, Text Web Browser
This is Lynx version 2.8.5dev.16, snapshot June 1, 2003.

WHAT IS LYNX?

   Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
   cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100
   terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other
   character-cell display.  It will display Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system, as well
   as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp,
   finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to
   telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts.  Current versions of Lynx run on
   Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

   Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to establish
   information systems intended primarily for local access.  Lynx has been
   used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  Lynx can
   also be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

   Links to the current sources and support materials for Lynx are
   maintained at:
			  "Lynx links"
	     <URL:http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx.html>
   and at the Lynx homepage:
			"Lynx Information"
		  <URL:http://lynx.browser.org/>.
   View these pages for information about Lynx, including new updates.

   Lynx is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) without
   restrictions on usage or redistribution.  The Lynx copyright statement,
   "COPYHEADER", and GNU GPL, "COPYING", are included in the top-level
   directory of the distribution.  Lynx is supported by the Lynx user
   community, an entirely volunteer (and unofficial) organization.

   Certain portions of the Lynx source distribution were originally created
   by CERN and have been modified during the development of Lynx.  See
   WWW/Copyright.txt for copyright info regarding CERN products used in
   Lynx.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

   We believe Lynx works properly for the Year 2000 issues, since it does
   not store dates in 2-digit form.  Since it must communicate with a wide
   range of web servers, it interprets dates in a variety of formats.  In
   particular, if Lynx receives a date with a 2-digit year, it assumes that
   values less than 70 are in the range 2000-2069.

DOCUMENTATION

   A users guide is included in this distribution along with a man page for
   Unix systems and a help file for VMS systems.  All documentation is
   contained in the top directory and the docs, samples and lynx_help
   subdirectories.

   While running Lynx, type 'h', 'H', or '?' to invoke the help menu
   system.  From the help menu you may access several useful documents
   pertaining to Lynx and the World Wide Web.  The most important of these
   is the Lynx Users Guide.  By default, Lynx will use the Lynx Enhanced
   Pages, which includes http links for help and FAQs concerning Lynx.  It
   is recommended that you install your own help menu system at your site
   in order to lessen the load on http servers.  This also will allow you
   to customize the help menu system for your site and greatly speed up
   access for those using Lynx over a slow connection.

   For Unix and related systems which support the autoconf configure
   script, the help menu system is installed by the "make install-help"
   command.

   For other systems (such as VMS), copy COPYHEADER and COPYING into the
   lynx_help/ subdirectory.  Then copy the lynx_help subdirectory to a
   public place on your system, or into your $HOME directory if you are a
   single user.  Finally, edit the lynx.cfg file so that the HELPFILE line
   is defined as follows:

      HELPFILE:file://localhost/[public_path]/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html

   where [public_path] is the absolute path to the lynx_help directory.
   Customizing the help menu system is just a matter of editing a set of
   HTML files.  Additional information about installing and customizing
   the help file set is available at <URL:http://www.irm.nara.kindai.ac.jp/
   lynxdev/README.help>.

INSTALLING LYNX

   To install Lynx, follow the steps in the INSTALLATION file, which is
   located in the top directory of the source distribution.

PROBLEMS

   If you experience problems configuring, compiling or installing Lynx,
   please read Section VI.  "General installation instructions" in the
   INSTALLATION file.  Instructions are given there for reporting your
   problem to the "lynx-dev" mailing list, which is frequented by

interface to convert RTF documents. 


The converters 

	DDIF$READ_RTF.EXE	DDIF$WRITE_RTF.EXE

should be placed in the SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB] directory.


When converting from RTF format warnings about unknown RTF
control words may be generated. The supported RTF format
is based on Microsoft WORD 2 format so later enhancements
are not available however, the resultant document should
still be usable.

An example of the errors generated by the CONVERT/DOCUMENT 
command is as follows:

$ convert/document TEST.rtf/form=rtf TEST.DDIF/form=ddif
%CONVERT-W-UNKCNTL, unknown RTF-control-word "\ansicpg" encountered.
%CONVERT-W-UNKCNTL, unknown RTF-control-word "\fromtext" encountered.
%CONVERT-W-UNKCNTL, unknown RTF-control-word "\uc" encountered.


When converting to RTF format you may encounter the errors:

%CONVERT-W-STYNOTREADABLE, Can't open style guide file: defstyle
or 
%CONVERT-W-STYNOTREADABLE, Can't open style guide file: dx_times

these can be resolved by defining the following logicals:

     $ define/sys defstyle cda$library:defstyle.ddif
     $ define/sys dx_times cda$library:dx_times.doc_style


The converters are not capable of using rooted logicals in the
paths to files:

	"USER_ROOT" = "DISK1:[ROOT.]"

	USER_ROOT:[USER]FILE.DOC	- will fail

	DISK1:[ROOT.USER]FILE.DOC	- will work

before entering DECWRITE the user is advised to $SET DEFAULT to 
a non-roooted path.

                     General Freeware V6.0 release notes
                     -----------------------------------

  o There were the usual problems building the distributions due to errors
    found in various FREEWARE_README.TXT files, and due to submissions that
    were missing the (required0 FREEWARE_README.TXT file.  The Keeper of the
    Freeware (KoF) apologizes for these changes, and for the last-minute 
    changes.

  o Several BACKUP saveset submissions were unpacked only with difficulty, due
    to problems with the ZIP archive files.  Various file attributes were reset
    to match OpenVMS expectations, but there may well be additional files that
    do not have the expected file attributes.  One tool that may be useful for
    this [000TOOLS]RESET_BACKUP_SAVESET_ATTRIBUTES.COM.

  o Most of the submissions in this kit were zipped solely to try to fit the 
    total volume of Freeware submissions -- and thank you for your response 
    to the Freeware collection effort! -- onto the available CD-ROM storage.
    Kits providing PCSI or VMSINSTAL installation kits were zipped in multiple
    parts, and the installation kits were left available outside the main zip
    archive for the submission.  For the unzip tool, please see [000TOOLS] 
    and (if you cannot use the pre-built version here for some reason) please 
    see the various sites offering pre-built Zip images referenced in the
    OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

  o Kits that were submitted as zip archives were unzipped first, and then
    re-zipped into a consistent format and settings.  This means various of 
    the submissions will appear different than what was originally submitted.
    For the unzip tool, please see [000TOOLS] and also please consider the 
    unzip download pointers in the OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

  o The menu system is deliberately not requiring all CD-ROMs in the Freeware
    set to be mounted at the same time -- this avoids the requirement to have
    multiple CD-ROM drives.  This also unfortunately makes it somewhat more
    difficult to rummage around on the various disks.

  o Please take the time to examine the following files and directories:

      [000000]AAAREADME.*
      [000000]OPENVMS_FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS_FAQ.TXT
      [000000]00FREEWARE_ABSTRACT.TXT
      [000TOOLS]*.*
      [FREEWARE]*.*
      [VMSFAQ]*.*

    These files are replicated on all Freeware CD-ROM disks.

  o Current copies of the OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document
    are available at:

      http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/faq/

MOZPLUGGER,UTILITIES,plugin handler for Mozilla on VMS

    This is a port of mozplugger V1.3.0 for use with Mozilla on OpenVMS.
    It enables one to use standalone programs as if they were plugins for
    Mozilla.  For example, one can use XPDF to display PDF files and
    mozplugger will cause XPDF to be embedded in the browser window.  You
    can also use MPG123 to play streaming MP3 files and Timidity to play
    background midi files.

    Tools needed:

    UNZIP		(you must use the -V switch when unzipping)
    DEC C compiler
    Mozilla web browser (or CSWB)
    OpenVMS Porting Library (VMS_JACKETS.EXE) minimum version A8.

    After unzipping the mozplugger.zip file, set default to the
    mozplugger-1_3_0 directory and read README.VMS for build and
    installation instructions.  MOZPLUGGER.TXT documents the keywords in
    the mozpluggerrc. file.

DISK$FREEWARE60_2:[MPG123]FREEWARE_README.TXT;1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
MPG123,UTILITIES,Plays MP3 files from local files or URLs

    This is a modifed version of mpg123 v0.59s.  This program was last
    modified by the author in October, 2000 to revision mh4.  I have made
    the following changes:

      o fixed the http code so that the ability to read an MP3 file
        directly from a URL now works on VMS.  You can now issue the
        command mpg123 http://somewhere/something.mp3 and it will read
        the file directly from the web for you.

      o Rewrote the VMS sound support.  The file included with the kit
        from the author's web site (AUDIO_DEC.C) works by constantly
        allocating and freeing buffers from shared memory space.  There
        appears to be an error in the MMOV libraries that handle this
        work since, if you play a playlist of several songs length, this
        program will eventually start getting memory allocation failures.  
        I have changed the code to only allocate a buffer once and then 
        reuse it over and over.  Also, the supplied code did not
        return all of the sound formats supported by the various audio
        cards.  This has also been corrected.  My version of the driver
        is called AUDIO_VMS.C.  You are free to use whichever you prefer.

    Tools needed:

    UNZIP		(You must use the -V switch when unzipping)
    DEC C compiler
    Multimedia Services for OpenVMS Alpha V2.2 (Development kit)

    Build Instructions:

    $ unzip mpg123-0_59s-mh4.zip
    $ set default [.mpg123-0_59s-mh4]
    $ @build

    I have included an executable in this distribution.  It should work
    on any recent version of VMS.  Since it is built against a patched
    version of MMOV.OLB that has not yet been released to the public, I
    recommend using it, rather than rebuilding, if you can.

MySQL, Utilities, MySQL Database

 Tous droits rservs 2003 Jean-Franois PIRONNE

MySQL V4.0.15
Software Requirements

   1. CPQ SSL V1.0-B or V1.1 (available as a free download from HP)
   2. JFP ZLIB 1.1-4

New SYSUAF Account

This installation procedure creates the unprivileged SYSUAF account MYSQL_SERVER
to run the server. After installation is complete, you will want to review the
security settings on all volumes, directories, and files this account will
access during operation and adjust them according to your needs.

By default, the installation procedure installs MySQL in the SYS$COMMON:[MYSQL]
directory. To install it in another directory, dev:[dir], use the /DESTINATION
parameter of the PRODUCT command. In this case, MySQL will be installed in the
dev:[dir.MYSQL] directory. Installation

   1. Make the directory which holds the ZIP file your default directory
   2. Extract the PCSI kit from the ZIP archive.

$ UNZIP "-V" MYSQL-V0400-15-1

   3. Install MySQL to your chosen destination directory.

$ PRODUCT INSTALL mysql  (default)

  or ... 

$ PRODUCT INSTALL mysql /DESTINATION=dev:[dir]

   4. Change the default directory to the VMS-specific directory and run the 
      two DCL procedure files, LOGICALS.COM and SYMBOLS.COM, to define the 
      necessary logicals and symbols for MySQL.

$ SET DEFAULT SYS$COMMON:[MYSQL.VMS]  (default)

  or ...

$ SET DEFAULT dev:[dir.MYSQL.VMS]

  then ...

$ @LOGICALS "/SYSTEM/EXEC"
$ @SYMBOLS

   5. (Optional) Configure the MySQL package to suit your environment by 
      editing the file MYSQL_ROOT:[VMS]MY.CNF.
   6. Run the special DCL procedure FIRST_START_MYSQLD.COM to start the 
      MySQL server for the first time.

$ @[.MYSQL]FIRST_START_MYSQLD

. . .and wait here a few moments for the database to be created.

   7. Run the special DCL procedure MYSQL_PRIVILEGES.COM to create the 
      system tables.

$ @[.MYSQL]MYSQL_PRIVILEGES
    

   8. Start the MySQL monitor (client).

$ mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1 to server version: 4.0.15-log

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

   9. Connect to the master system table and display the existing password 
      for ROOT (should be "" at this point).

mysql> use mysql
Database changed
mysql> select Host, User, Password from user;
+-----------+------+----------+
| Host      | User | Password |
+-----------+------+----------+
| localhost | root |          |
+-----------+------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

  10. IMPORTANT! Define a password for the ROOT MySQL account.

mysql> update user set Password=PASSWORD('myrootpassword') where User='root';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql> select Host, User, Password from user;
+-----------+------+------------------+
| Host      | User | Password         |
+-----------+------+------------------+
| localhost | root | 6b6403a743ef6b56 |
+-----------+------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)
$

  11. (Optional): You must also change the HOST field contents if you want 
      to access MySQL from another host using the ROOT account. For example, 
      setting HOST to '%' allows access from anywhere.

  12. (Optional): Verify your password and/or host changes took effect.

$ MYSQLADMIN -u ROOT -p STATUS
Enter password:
                Uptime: 25  Threads: 1  Questions: 1  Slow queries: 0  Opens: 6
 Flush tables: 1  Open tables: 0  Queries per second avg: 0.040
$

  13. Shut down the MySQL server process.

mysql> exit
Bye

$ MYSQLADMIN -u ROOT -p SHUTDOWN

$ MYSQLADMIN -u ROOT -p SHUTDOWN   That's right, quit twice :-)

  14. Finally, run the DCL procedure MYSQL_STARTUP.COM.

(You might want to add this line to your SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM file.)

$ @MYSQL_ROOT:[VMS]MYSQL_STARTUP

You should now have a running MySQL server!

BE SURE TO READ THE MANUAL.

This is a brief readme file for the netperf TCP/UDP/sockets/etc
performance benchmark. This is here mostly as a boot-strap. The real
information is in the manual, which can be found in netperf.ps and
online from http://www.cup.hp.com/netperf/NetperfPage.html. The
sources, and a limited number of binaries, can be found from
ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/benchmarks/netperf/ .

BE SURE TO READ THE MANUAL.

There is a COPYRIGHT file included. It is based on what the HP Legal
Eagles gave me. I am not sure if the legalese is clear, but the intent
is to say "Here is a benchmark. Use it in good health. Pass it along,
port it, enhance it. You didn't pay for this tool, so don't expect it 
to be perfect ;-)" The rest of it is there to keep the layers happy...

Feel free to report results in public forums, but please be
excruciatingly complete in your description of the test envorinment.
Better still, report results to the netperf database at
http://www.cup.hp.com/netperf/NetperfPage.html.

There is an Internet mailing list devoted to netperf. It is called
netperf-talk and it is hosted on netperf.cup.hp.com
(hpisrdq.cup.hp.com). Subscription requests should go to
netperf-talk-request@netperf.cup.hp.com. 

Please DO NOT SEND subscription requests to netperf-talk!

If you run into severe difficulties, or are just feeling chatty,
please feel free to drop some email to me - Rick Jones
<raj@cup.hp.com>. Be sure to include a meaningful subject lines.

happy benchmarking,

OMI, Utilities, A feature rich menu development tool

OMI v2.2 - 1997-2002, Oscar van Eijk, Oveas Functionality Provider
===================================================================

OMI proves *everything* can be written with 'just' DCL :-)

Oscar's Menu Interpreter is a menu environment that reads menu files
and represents the menu structure on a ChUI based window.

OMI does not perform any actions on its own. Additional procedures
are required to handle upon the users input. It comes with a toolbox
loaded with functions that can be used to create these procedures.
OMI is written to create a standard user interface for all kinds of
actions, with a clear structure, support for different security levels
and password protection.

The documentation should provide with all information to build your
own menu structures, OMI modules and enhancements.

Documentation and support
-------------------------
Full documentation for OMI can be found at the OMI site:
http://freeware.oveas.com/omi.
An online HELP is also provided, but since v2.0 the printable documentation
is completely reviewed. This has not (yet?) been done with the online
HELP, except for the interactive OMI command section.

This site also offers a forum (http://freeware.oveas.com/omi/forum.html)
where you can get support.
Please note OMI comes without any warranty, but I'll try to give as much
support as possible via this forum.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
To install OMI, download one of the distributions: either
the ZIP file (download in BINary format) or the COM file
(download in ASCII format).
Also, download OMI$INSTALL.COM in ASCII format.

Next, set default to the directory where the installation
script is located, and issue the command:
$ @OMI$INSTALL

Follow the instruction to install OMI.
The procedure extracts the distribution and moves all
files to the desired location (that you will be prompted for).
Site specific files will not be overwritten.
If the file OMI$TOOLBOX.INI exists, it will be patched.

The installation procedure also creates the HELP library,
and repairs message datafiles, which have been corrupted
by the distribution.

If this is a new installtion, let all the users who will be
using OMI execute the procedure OMI$USER_INSTALL once.
This is not required for upgrades of existing OMI installations.

Installation is now complete. All users can optionally change
the behaviour of OMI by modifying the file OMI$MENU.CFG, located
in their SYS$LOGIN:.

To test OMI, you can use the example menu file OMI$EXAMPLE.MNU
which comes with this distribution. Start this menu with the command
OMI OMI$EXAMPLE.

This menu performs no other action than displaying information.
The 'Protected menu' is protected with the password "test123456789".
(Note: passwords are case sensitive!)

More information can be obtained from the online HELP and the documentation.

Perl, Languages, Powerful scripting language

Disclaimer
==========
While this Perl distribution for the hp OpenVMS freeware CD was packaged 
by Martin P.J. Zinser (zinser@decus.de) and I am certainly willing to help 
with questions and problems concerning its usage, I am a dwarf standing on the 
shoulders of giants here. A number of very talented individuals are working
hard to make sure OpenVMS support is well integrated into the Perl language.
This specifically includes Craig Berry, Peter Prymmer, Dan Sugalski, and 
Charles Bailey although this list is not exhaustive. If you are interested
in Perl on VMS consider joining the VMS Perl mailing list as described 
below and you will soon find out that there are many good people contributing
to this effort.

The version on this CD does contain a pre-build binary distribution for 
OpenVMS Alpha in the [.perl-bin] directory. This should work on 7.2-1H1
and later. For regular use backup this directory from the CD to disk and 
change perl_setup.com to point to the new location.

If you want to re-build from sources backup the [.perl-src] and [.mod]
directories from CD to disk. As a convenience there is a make.com provided
with this distribution which does build the perl interpreter as well as the 
additional/updated Modules. This procedure does accept the following 
parameters in arbitrary order:

MAKE=<MMS||MMK>
Enforce usage of MMS or MMK to build Perl over the build-in detection
by the procedure.

IDIR=<PATH>
Installation directory where the Perl binaries and libraries are to be 
moved after compilation

TARGET=<MODULE>
If invoked without this parameter bothe the perl interpreter and the 
add-on moudles will be build. If set to PERL only the perl interpreter
will be build and when given a value of MODULE only all the addon 
moudles will be build. To build a specific module use one of the following
as the target:

  CGI, CPLOT, czlib, dbi, datemanip, gdpm, mailsender, mimebase64, recdescent,
  sigfigs, timemod, vecstat, vmsdevice, vmsfileutils, vmsfindfile,
  vmsindexedfile, vmsmisc, vmsmonitor, vmsqueue, vmssystem, vmsuser,
  writeexcel

Below you can find a general discussion about building Perl with the procedures
that are part of the "standard" distribution. If you either want to change
particular settings to influence a particular aspect of Perl or want to 
build a new Perl version not on the CD it is highly recommended you get 
familiar with this

Note for users with experience on Perl prior to 5.8.0: The default type of 
floating point numbers has changed from D-Float to IEEE float as of 
5.8.0. If you do need D-Float support you need to recompile Perl and 
change the appropriate setting during execution of @configure.

================================================================================


Building


The installation of Perl has vastly improved during the past years. Nowadays 
it is almost as simple to install Perl on OpenVMS than it is on Unix ;-)
 
The build consists of two steps. First configure.com is used to determine the 
local configuration and then a "make" program is used to perform the actual 
compilation. 

configure.com

configure.com can be invoked with a number of different options. These include: 

"-d"
Use defaults for all answers.
 Handy if you have a normal installation and don't want to be bothered with 
 lots of questions by install. As far as I can tell the defaults used are 
 pretty reasonable. 
"-e"
Go on without questioning past the production of config.sh
 Together with the -d and -s options this suppresses many informational 
 messages during the build. This can be usefull for automated production 
 builds. 
"-f"
Specify an alternate default configuration file
 Configure.com by default looks for config.sh and [.vms]config.vms for 
 configuration information from previous invocations. If you want to override 
 settings in these files you can add your own configuration file with this 
 switch. 
"-h"
Prints a short help message and exits (with an informational status). 
"-m"
Skip the MANIFEST check to see that all files are present 
"-r"
Reuse C symbols value if possible (skips costly nm extraction)
 Seems not to be implemented on OpenVMS as of 5.8.0. 
"-s"
Silent mode, only echoes questions and essential information, the rest will be 
sent to the Null-Device NLA0 ;-) 
-"D"
Define symbol to have some value 

  -"Dsymbol"               symbol gets the value 'define'
  -"Dsymbol=value"         symbol gets the value 'value' 

-E
Stop at the end of questions, after having produced config.sh.
 Doesn't do much yet, but prevents configure.com from going into silent mode 
 after the creation of config.sh. 
-K
Do not use unless you know what you are doing.
 Currently you might think you knowitall, but configure.com knows it better ;-).
 Setting this doesn't change the execution yet. 
-O
Let -D and -U override definitions from loaded configuration file.
 Seems not to be implemented on OpenVMS as of 5.8.0 
-S
Perform variable substitutions on all .SH files (can mix with -f)
 Seems not to be implemented on OpenVMS as of 5.8.0. 
-"U"
Undefine symbol: 

  -"Usymbol"    symbol gets the value 'undef'
  -"Usymbol="   symbol gets completely empty 

-V
Print version number and exit (with a zero status) 

My personal strategy is to perform one run with configure going through all 
the questions and options to get some idea about the new version and 
afterwards to use @configure "-des" to do the production build.
One of the essential things checked by configure.com is which "make"-tool is 
available on your system. It currently checks for the following: Imake, 
Gnumake, MGmake, Gmake, Make, MMS, and MMK. I personally always use MMK. MMS 
should work fine too, since it is pretty similar to MMK ;-) Gnumake might or 
might not work, at least it is the only of the other tools that I've seen a 
current version of. 


At the end of the execution of configure.com a line will be printed showing 
how you should invoke your "make"-tool to actually build Perl. Once you've 
typed in this command (with no changes compared to the example provided by 
configure.com) no further user intervention should be required. 


Setup


During the installation of Perl the DCL-procedure [.vms]perl_setup.com is 
created, which can be used as a starting point for the definiton of logicals 
and symbols. The procedure already defines everything which is undispensable 
for working seriously with Perl, but still you might wish to add some of the 
following: 

DEFINE/TRANS=(CONC,TERM) PERL_ROOT <path>
The path to the place where Perl is located on your system. Necessary to get 
access to library functions and documentation. 

PERL :== $<path>PERL.EXE
The symbol used to invoke Perl. 

PERLSHR :== <path>PERLSHR.EXE
Symbol pointing to the shareable image containing most of the routines 
belonging to Perl. 

PERLDOC :== "$<path>PERL PERL_ROOT:[LIB.POD]PERLDOC.COM -T"
Read documentation concerning perl available in POD format. 

DEFINE/NOLOG PERLDOC_PAGER <pager>
The file viewer used to display the documentation files. I personally prefer 
Look, but you're certainly entitled to have an own opinion about this ;-> 
(Yes, I'm really sick and tired to all the My xxx is better than your yyy 
flame wars). 

PERLBUG :== "$<path>PERL PERL_ROOT:[LIB]PERLBUG.COM"
Generates a template for a bug report providing all necessary details on your 
local perl installation. 

DEFINE/NOLOG POD2MAN PERL_ROOT:[LIB.POD]POD2MAN.COM
 POD2MAN :== "$<path>PERL POD2MAN"
Translates files in POD format to nroff. Some build procedures for perlmodules 
might complain if this symbol is not defined. 

DEFINE/NOLOG POD2TEXT PERL_ROOT:[LIB.POD]POD2TEXT.COM
 POD2TEXT :== "$<path>PERL POD2TEXT"
Translates files in POD format to plain text. This is also required for 
perldoc -f <internal function> to work properly. 

Basics introduction

I've once prepard a talk for our DECUS LUG covering the basics of Perl and awk. 
If you don't have an idea about Perl yet you might want to check this out 
starting with [.talk]ap_toc.html. 

(P.S.Yes, all of the stuff done there can be accomplished much easier with the 
VMS::User and Mail::Sender modules, but this particular presenataton is already
a few years old and I still think it gives a very basic idea about the things
one can do with Perl.)

Tips and Tricks

To retrieve the translations of a multi valued logical name use code like the 
following: 

$ define myname martin, zinser
$ show log myname
   "MYNAME" = "MARTIN" (LNM$PROCESS_TABLE)
        = "ZINSER"
$ perl -e "print $ENV{'myname;'.0}"
MARTIN
$ perl -e "print $ENV{'myname;'.1}"
ZINSER


This may not work as expected on the Compaq supplied version of Perl 5.6.1.

Further notes on Perl Modules

Building


Every module should contain a script named Makefile.PL. Executing this 
perl script should create a makefile (descrip.mms) which then can be used with 
make (MMS/MMK) to actually perform the installation. The normal procedure for 
installing a perl module therefore looks like this: 

perl Makefile.PL
mmk
mmk test
mmk install


Note: According to my experience this only works if you place the sources for 
the modules not inside the source tree of the normal Perl installation. 


Examples


Online Example


The following example shows a number of the mentioned packages in use. CGI is 
used to create an HTML document on the fly, which contains an input field, 
where one can enter some value. If this value can be interpreted as a date by 
datemanip it is echoed back and converted to a julian date using one of the 
Time-Modules. Vecstat is used to calculate the sum of year, month, and date 
(silly, I know ;-). In a second field you can enter your age, which will be 
echoed back rounded to one significant digit (usually decades ;-) using the 
SigFigs module. Finally some information about the VMS environment is shown. 
VMS::Queue is used to determine the batchjob running the webserver and the 
submission time of the job is printed on the page. VMS::User determines the 
last non-interactive login for the server account (which most of the time will 
correspond to the last script invocation on the server). VMS::System is used 
to retrive information on the hardware the server is executing on. 
VMS::Monitor then is used to determine how many processes currently execute on 
the system at all and VMS::Device gives space information for the disk housing 
the webserver. Which disk this is, is detemined using VMS::FileUtils::Root to 
translate the appropriate rooted logical name. GD is used to create a graphic 
showing free vs. used disk space on the device. In the next step your age is 
used to determine the starting letter for software to be pulled in from a list 
kept in an indexed file via VMS::IndexedFile. Subsequently VMS::FindFile 
generates a list of the currently stored disk usages graphics in the temp area 
of the webserver. Finally the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module (which relies on 
Parse::RecDescent) is used to put some of the data into an Excel Spreadsheet, 
which you may download if you are inclined to do so.

Mail Example


As might be expected in the days of SPAM I do not provide the following 
example on-line. It uses Mail::Sender (and implicitly MIME::Base64) to 
distribute a mail to a number of addreses read from a file. Obviously any 
number of improvements can be made to this sketch, but it does show how to use 
the module(s). 
use Mail::Sender;
use Getopt::Std;

getopts('s:f:');

if (not $opt_s){
  die "-s \"Subject\" Missing ... exiting\n";
}

&build_add_list;
 
&check_body;

ref ($sender = new Mail::Sender({from => 'foo@bar.de',
                                 smtp => 'mail.foobar.net'})
    ) ;
printf "with Subject %s ...\n", $opt_s;    
for($i=0;$i<@add;$i++){
  &send_body;
}    
exit;

sub build_add_list {
  open(ADD,"email.txt");
  my $i = 0;
  while(<ADD>){
    chop();
    s/\s+//g;
    if ($_ ne ""){
      $add[$i++]=$_;
    }
  }
  close(ADD);
}		       				 

sub check_body {
  die "-f file with Mail contents missing ... exiting\n" if (not $opt_f);
  die "File $opt_f can not be read ... exiting\n"  if (not -r $opt_f); 
  if (-T $opt_f) {
    printf "Text message found in $opt_f will be sent\n";
    open(IN, $opt_f);
    @text = <IN>;
    close(IN);
  }
  else {
    printf "Binary contents in $opt_f will be sent as attachment\n";
  }  
}

sub send_body {
  if (-t $opt_f) {
    (ref ($sender->Open({to => $add[$i], subject => $opt_s}))
     and print "Start Mail to $add[$i] ok\n"
    )
    or die "$Mail::Sender::Error\n";
    $sender->SendEx(@text);
    $sender->Close();  
  }
  else {
    (ref ($sender->MailFile({to => $add[$i], subject => $opt_s,
                             msg => "Please check attachment\n Me\n",
			     file => $opt_f}))
     and print "Mail to $add[$i] sent ok\n"
    )
    or die "$Mail::Sender::Error\n"; 
     			     
  }
}


Perl reference guide


Since the Perl reference guide is not really a module the installation process 
is a bit different than described above.
You'll need MMS/MMK to build the file. The process is described in detail in 
the readme file of the package. In short 

mmk testpage.ps
 Print the page, find the horizontal offset by folding the resulting page and 
 change makefile accordingly. Repeat this step until the printout is centered 
 on the page. 
mmk refguide.ps
 Printing the resulting file refguide.ps should give you a copy of the 
 reference guide which can be cut and stapeled to a readily useable paper 
 version of the reference guide. 

The version from this server contains an adapted copy of makefile 
(makefile.lps17_vms) for use with an DEC LPS17 printserver, using A4 paper and 
duplex printing. As you can see from this the changes needed are really easy.

Python V2.3

Full documentation and some useful links are available from the Python 
for VMS site: http://vmspython.dyndns.org/

Software Requirements

   1. CPQ SSL V1.0-B or V1.1(available as a free download from HP)
   2. JFP ZLIB 1.1-4  
   3. JFP LibBZ2 1.0-2 

I strongly recommend you install Python on an ODS-5 volume.

By default, the installation procedure installs Python in the
SYS$COMMON:[PYTHON] directory. To install it in another directory, dev:[dir],
use the /DESTINATION parameter of the PRODUCT command. In this case, Python will
be installed in the dev:[dir.PYTHON] directory. Installation

   1. Make the directory which holds the ZIP file your default directory
   2. Extract the PCSI kit from the ZIP archive.

$ UNZIP "-V" PYTHON-V0203--1

   3. Install Python to your chosen destination.

$ PRODUCT INSTALL python  (default)

  or ... 

$ PRODUCT INSTALL python /DESTINATION=dev:[dir]

   4. Finally, run the DCL procedure STARTUP.COM.

(You might want to add this line to your SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM file.)

$ @PYTHON_ROOT:[VMS]STARTUP

   4.
      Shared Images

      The STARTUP.COM procedure runs two other DCL procedures: LOGICALS.COM, 
      to set up the correct Python logicals; and INSTALL_DYNAMICS_MODULES.COM
      which uses the VMS INTALL command to load Python modules as shared 
      images (requires CMKRNL privileges). 

      By default, no modules are INSTALL'ed as shared images.

   5. (Optional): Post-Installation Module Compilation

$ SET DEFAULT PYTHON_VMS
$ @SETUP
$ PYTHON COMPILE_PYTHON_MODULES.PY
$ PYTHON -"OO" COMPILE_PYTHON_MODULES.PY

   6. (Optional): Post-Installation Module Testing

$ SET DEFAULT PYTHON_VMS
$ @SETUP
$ @ALLTESTS

Module Testing Results

Currently, 6 tests should fail:
test_codecs, test_queue, test_re, test_socket, test_unicode, and test_zipimport

REGEDIT, Utilities, A program to look at or modify the registry database

Regedit is a program to look at or modify the registryserver database.
It is a full screen (SMG) program and looks like the (MS-)Windows regedit.
If you use the DecWindows environment, you can use mouse-clicks, 
otherwise you must use keyboard-keys.
Because the registry-server exists only on alpha, there is not VAX version.

Usage:

Run regedit

Once in the program you can use PF2/HELP for help info
F10 or ^z will return you to DCL. If you have a Decwindows/VXT display, use
can use the mouse, otherwise you must use the keyboard.

Building
The Alpha executable is in the kit, but if you want to rebuild REGEDIT,
go to the regedit directory and use @create_regedit


Contents:

Ths package contains the following files
In the home directory

 REGEDIT.EXE		The executable
 CREATE_REGEDIT.COM	The command file to compile/link
 FREEWARE_README.TXT    This file

In the [.SRC] directory
 REGEDIT.FOR		The Fortran source
 REGEDIT.INC		The include file

In the [.ALPHA] directory
 REGEDIT.OBJ		The object

There is no VAX equivalent, since the registry server only runs on Alpha.

Instructions:

Unpack the save set.
If you want to rebuild:
 If you have a fortran compiler
  @CREATE_REGEDIT
 Else to link only
  @CREATE_REGEDIT LINK

RMS_LOCKS, Miscellaneous, Shows all and/or blocked locks for RMS files and records

VMS version:  VAX: 7.2  Alpha: 7.2-1
Language   :  VAX/DEC Basic

This program will scan the DLM database capturing all locks for RMS files
and records.  It will then traverse the data displaying ALL locks, or only
BLOCKed locks.

NOTE: The program requires CMEXEC privs!  Maybe others.

Development of the program derived from another utility, and identification
of RMS file and record locks was done purely on a 'discovery' basis, not
referencing the VMS documentation.  Lock values could change in future
versions of VMS and the program would be rendered unusable.

The Alpha version of the program has one 'hack' (means I don't really
understand why there is a difference) to address differences in device
naming on Alpha.  I'm pretty sure neither version would work in a cluster
environment, I don't have a cluster to perform any testing.

Some selections to limit the volumn of data displayed would be useful
enhancements.  I don't plan any since I don't have much use for the
utility.

Also included is DLM_LOCKS.BAS, a tool used in the research for
implementing RMS_LOCKS.

SDL, LANGUAGES, Data Structure/Interface Definition Language

  EV1-65/EV1-66

  This tool is a data definition language and is used to convert a 
  language-independent definition file (an SDL input file) into a 
  language-dependent definition file.  Alone or in conjunction with 
  mechanisms such as the OpenVMS MESSAGE/SDL command (a latent and
  undocumented qualifier which converts the .MSG file into an SDL
  file) and the Freeware GNM tool, the SDL tool can be used to 
  maintain common sources for a wide variety of language files.

  This version of SDL includes images for use on OpenVMS VAX systems 
  (in [.VAX_IMAGES]) and on OpenVMS Alpha (in [.ALPHA_IMAGES]) 
  systems.  These images were built with/for/on OpenVMS V7.3-1.

  The provided SDL.COM procedure will create logical names for the 
  correct set of images for the local system architecture, and will
  also load the SDL.CLD command definition into the current process.
  To invoke SDL:

  $ @SDL  ! needed once

  then

  $ SDL/ALPHA/LANGUAGE=CC filedef.SDL

  or

  $ SDL/VAX/LANGUAGE=CC filedef.SDL

  Also available is SDL/NOPARSE, which converts the intermediate
  files (.SDI files) found in STARLETSD.TLB into language-specific
  definition files.

Syltrem, UTILITIES, Determine Global Pages and Sections Requirements

I have written a DCL procedure to know how much free global
pages/sections are required for installing a program in 
shared memory.

It supports both Alpha and VAX.

I believe it can be useful to others as it is to me from time to time.

Maybe it could be included in the next release of the freeware CD.

Regards,

TCPDUMP-3_7_2, NETWORKING, TCPDUMP and PCAP for OpenVMS

This a port of the tcpdump and the pcap library to OpenVMS. There are two
versions of the pcap library for OpenVMS, one which uses the $QIO interface
to the OpenVMS LAN driver, and one which uses the VCI interface to the
LAN driver.

To build everything, just invoke the build_all.com procedure. 
Notice that the tcpdump port uses MMS (MMK should work as well)
for the build.

The subdirecotries contains:

 [.pcap-lan]
   A port of the pcap library using the $QIO interface to the LAN driver.
   This version of the library can only capture packets.

 [.pcap-vci]
   A port of pcap using the VCI interface to the LAN driver. This
   version of pcap uses the PCAPVCM execlet and is faster than the
   QIO implementation of pcap. This version also allows you to send
   packets as well as receiving packets. 

 [.pcapvcm]
   The VMS execlet which uses the VCI interface to the LAN driver.
   Once built it must be placed in SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES.

 [.tcpdump-3_7_2]
   A quick and dirty port of tcpdump. When built, two versions of tcpdump
   are produced. One using the $QIO version of pcap and one using the VCI
   version of pcap. These are the only executables created by the build.

 [.vci_10_spec]
   A html version of the VCI version 1.0 specification.

TELL, NETWORKING, Executes DCL Commands on Remote Nodes via DECnet

 This command procedure will execute commands on a remote node.

 The command syntax for tell is :-
 @TELL[/output=filename] NODENAME[,...] DCL-COMMAND [&] [|...]

   P1 - NODENAME:
    More than one nodename can be specified, each being seperated by a comma.
    Nodename can be a symbol 
    Nodename can be a file containing a list of nodes (one node per line)
      specified by an @ prefix (@file). The default extension is .dat.
      Comments should start with a ! or #.
    A double colon (::) after the nodename is optional and specifies
      decnet transport. 
    A single colon (:) after the nodename specifies tcpip transport.
    "0" can be used to specify the local nodename.
    If you do not have proxy access then you can specify access control 
      information as part of the nodename specification (node"user password")
    You can force a routing path by specifiy nodename of the from
      nodename::nodename::
    If in command mode and two or more nodenames are specified then on 
      completion TELL displays a summary listing of unreachable nodes. This 
      feature can be disabled by defining the logical name as follows:-
      $ DEFINE/PROCESS/NOLOG TELL_INHIBIT_SUMMARY TRUE
    If node not specified then the symbol tell_default_nodes is used if
      defined.

   P2 to P8 - DCL COMMAND:
    INTERACTIVE MODE:
      If no DCL command is specified then you will be in interactive mode.
      At that point you will have a DCL session in the context of the remote
        node. The standard EXIT command will return you to your local node.
      If a decnet nodename is specified then the tell decnet object will be 
        used to process the command on the remote node.
      If a tcpip nodename is specified then an rlogin command is used
        used to process the command on the remote node. A password can
        be specified but will not be used.
    COMMAND MODE:
      Here the DCL commands are specified in P2 to P8 and are separated 
        by a vertical bar "|". Quotes are optional and are only required to
        reduce the number of P parameters.
      If a decnet nodename is specified then the tell decnet object will be 
        used to process the command on the remote node.
      If a tcpip nodename is specified then an rsh command is used
        used to process the command on the remote node. 
    DETACHED MODE:
      Jobs can be run in the background as a detached process by 
      suffixing the & (unix background command) to any command.
      This can be done from either Interactive or Command Mode.

    Note that you cannot issue commands that require terminal input such as 
    EDIT etc. This is a restriction of the DECnet task-task software and not
    of TELL itself. Some of these restrictions can be overcome by defining 
    the verb as a foreign command. This allows many commands to be entered on 
    a single line.
        eg. $ AUTHORIZE :== $AUTHORIZE
            $ AUTHORIZE SHOW KINGSMILL
     
   QUALIFIERS:
    /Output can be used to direct the output to a filename.


   EXAMPLES:

   $ TELL :== @SYS$MANAGER:TELL.COM
        All the following examples assume that the tell symbol is defined.
        Place this in your login.com.

   $ TELL MVAX,UNIXA"geoffk":
        This command will allow you to interactively enter commands
        on both MVAX and UVAX. Default proxy access is used to MVAX
	  and the geoffk account will be used on UNIXA (unix machine).

   $ TELL MVAX SHOW ERROR
        This command relies on proxy access to MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX.

   $ TELL UNIXA: "date"
        This command relies on proxy access to UNIXA. 
        It does an "$RSH UNIXA date" command.

   $ TELL_DEFAULT_NODES == "MVAX"
   $ TELL "" SHOW ERROR
        This command uses the symbol tell_default_nodes to obtain the
	  nodename and relies on proxy access to node MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX.

   $ TELL/OUTPUT=SYS$LOGIN:TELL.OUT MVAX SHOW ERROR
        This command relies on proxy access to MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX with the output
           directed to the file sys$login:tell.out

   $ TELL MVAX"KINGSMILL PASSWORD":: SHOW ERROR
        this command supplies access control to accounts that do not have 
        proxy access

   $ TELL MVAX"KINGSMILL":: SHOW ERROR
        Under VMS V5.x you can have a number of different proxy users pointed
        to one account. This example show how to gain access to a non-default
        proxy account. Note that only the username needs to be specified.

   $ TELL MVAX,TVAX,SVAX SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ DECA_CLUSTER :== MVAX,TVAX,SVAX
   $ TELL 'DECA_CLUSTER' SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ TYPE DECA_CLUSTER.DAT
   MVAX
   TVAX
   SVAX
   $ TELL @DECA_CLUSTER SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ TELL MVAX,UVAX: "SHOW ERROR"|"SHOW NET"
        this command will do both a show error and a show net on 
        MVAX (using DECnet) and UVAX (using TCPIP [RSH]).

   $ TELL MVAX,TVAX "SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=MAXPS1" | "CREATE/TERM &"
        this command will create a detached decterm on both MVAX and TVAX

   $ TELL MVAX
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> SHOW ERROR
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> SET PROC/PRIV=OPER
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> MCR NCP SHOW EXEC
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> EXIT
   $
        This is an example of an interactive session. The prompt indicates
        the remote nodename and username, whilst the ">>" is used to
        distinguish between a local and remote session. 
    
   $ TELL MVAX TELL TVAX SHOW ERROR
   $ TELL MVAX::TVAX:: SHOW ERROR
        Both of these commands perform the same function. 
        The first performs a nested TELL, ie. TELL node MVAX to TELL node
          TVAX to do a $ show error. Only command mode is valid with 
          this syntax and you must specify the command as TELL not @tell.
        The second example show how to do the same thing using Poor Mans
          Routing (PMR). This is far more efficent than the first examples
          and it supports both command and interactive modes.

   CONFIGURATION SETUPS:
     This file needs to exist on the local node and the remote node if a decnet
     nodename is specified. It requires the user to either specify node access 
     control or for the remote account to be set up for proxy access. TELL can 
     simply reside in sys$login on the remote node, which requires each user to 
     have their own copy -or- TELL can be defined as a DECnet object, requiring 
     each system to have only one copy.
   
     To install TELL as a network object the system manager should enter the
     following commands:
   DECnet/IV
     $ MCR NCP
     NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TELL NUMBER 0 FILE SYS$MANAGER:TELL.COM PROXY BOTH
     NCP> SET OBJECT TELL ALL
     NCP> EXIT
     $
   DECnet/OSI
     $@sys$startup:net$configure application_add tell "" -
     "{name=tell}||sys$manager:tell.com|true|true|true|true|true||||1" 

    If TELL is not installed as a network object then by default no other setups
    are required. However if the DECnet object task has been modified to disable
    proxy access then tell will fail. In this case the system manager should 
    enter the following ncp command or equivalent ncl command.
     $ MCR NCP
     NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TASK PROXY BOTH
     NCP> SET OBJECT TASK ALL
     NCP> EXIT
     $

     PROXY accounts allow one user direct access to another users account
     without having to specify username and password. 
   DECNET
     The system manager can set up proxy account access from within AUTHORIZE. 
     Example:  $ MCR AUTHORIZE>
               UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL KINGSMILL/DEFAULT
               UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::OLSENK KINGSMILL
               UAF> EXIT
   TCPIP:
     To prevent the need to use passwords on the RSH command proxies can be
     set up to authorize remote user access. To set up remote user access
     on a UNIX machine, or TCPWARE/MULTINET under VMS you specify the remote
     node and username in the .rhosts file which resides in the users home
     directory. With UCX you use the "UCX> ADD PROXY command"
      Example:  [TCPWARE/MULTINET]
                 $type sys$login:.rhosts 
                 mvax kingsmill
                 mvax olsenk
                 $
               [UNIX]
                 #more .rhosts 
                 mvax kingsmill
                 mvax olsenk
               [UCX]
                 UCX> ADD PROXY KINGSMILL/HOST=MVAX/REMOTE_USER=KINGSMILL
                 UCX> ADD PROXY KINGSMILL/HOST=MVAX/REMOTE_USER=OLSENK

     This examples allows remote user KINGSMILL and OLSENK on node MVAX
     into the local KINGSMILL account. The default switch enables you to
     specify just the nodename when addressing this node:-
       eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX::
     If Default access is not specified then you need to specify the 
     nodename and username when addressing this node:-
       eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"KINGSMILL"::
     If you do not have proxy access then you need to specify the   
     nodename, username and password when addressing a remote node:-
       eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"KINGSMILL password"::

     The following logicals can be used to alter the default TELL behaviour.
     TELL_INHIBIT_SUMMARY to disable the statistics printout.
     SYS$SCRATCH - temporary files are written to sys$scratch. If you don't
       want the temporary files written to sys$login then define sys$scratch.

   TROUBLESHOOTING:
     The following logicals can be used to aid in troubleshooting.
     TELL_VERBOSE to display the progress of both local and remote events.
       This can also be enabled by setting the version prefix from "V" to "X"
     TELL_VERIFY to turn on verify and verbose.
     Netserver.log on the remote node may also aid in troubleshooting.
     TELL_'pid'_*.TMP temporary file on the remote node shows the created
       command file if detached qualifier was specified.
     TELL_'pid'_*.LOG temporary file on on the remote node showing the output
       from tell_'pid'_*.tmp

TO, UTILITIES, SET DEFAULT program - saves typing

TO.COM is a set-default program that works on Files-11 ODS-2 disks. I
haven't tried it on an ODS-5 disk so I don't know how well it would
work with ODS-5. 

Features:

o  Correct processing of nested logical names.
o  Smart Logical-Name Recall Stack... 
   - holds last 9 defaults plus the current default (the stack size 
     is adjustable)
   - assigns convenient logical names to stack entries
   - uses numbers to reference stack entries in TO.COM
   - avoids duplicate entries 
o  New default is checked for validity and existence.
o  Filename stripping: If P1 is a logical name pointing to a file, 
   TO.COM looks for the file and sets default to the directory in 
   which that file resides. If no file is found, the device and 
   directory are extracted from P1 and TO.COM sets default to the 
   result.
o  Has logic to handle situations in which the default was changed by 
   another program. 
o  Directory brackets are optional (logical names must still be 
   defined properly).
o  Shortcuts for MFD, top level of current tree, up n levels
o  Two-step default function (saves typing)
o  Superfluous 000000's are removed from new defaults.
o  23-line quick-help page function

VILE, UTILITIES, VI-LIKE-EMACS text editor

vile is a text editor which is extremely compatible with vi in terms of
"finger feel".  In addition, it has extended capabilities in many areas,
notably multi-file editing and viewing, key rebinding, and real X window
system support.

Version 5.4 appeared on the second OpenVms Freeware CDROM.  Version 6.1,
which appeared on the third Freeware CDROM upgraded the source to ANSI C
(from extended C).

Version 8.2 (on the 4th CDROM) added support for user-definable modes and
makes procedures executable just like the builtin commands.  The
minibuffer (aka the ex command line) is editable with vi-style commands.

Version 9.2 (on the 5th CDROM) focused on syntax highlighting
(not yet ported to VMS).  However, as usual, there are lots of bug fixes.

This is a pre-release version of vile 9.4

The authors of vile are Tom Dickey (current maintainer), Paul Fox, Kevin
Buettner and Rick Sladkey.

1. Getting started                                      *vms-started* 
 
Vim (Vi IMproved) is an almost 100% compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  
Vim runs on nearly every operating system known to humanity (almost any Unix  
flavor, MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, MS-Windows 95/98/NT/2000, OS/2, Atari MiNT,  
BeOS, RISC OS, Macintosh, Amiga). Now use Vim on OpenVMS too, in character 
or X/Motif environment.  It is fully featured and absolutely compatible with 
Vim on other operating systems with multi level undo, syntax highlighting,  
command line history, filename completion, block operations, etc.  
 
Vim is especially recommended for editing programers who use to change 
development palatforms quite often.

WINFX, UTILITIES, Windows File Exchange Utility

The WINFX utility provides the capability to exchange disk-resident
files between OpenVMS and Windows operating systems. It supports the
FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 file systems on floppy disks and partitioned
hard disks, including ZIP disks. It can also construct and access
these file systems within container files.

The WINFX utility works on both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha.
On VAX systems, version 7.1 or higher is recommended, and on
Alpha systems, version 7.1-2 or higher is recommended. It may work
on older versions, but it will depend on the level of SCSI support
in the base operating system and applied ECOs (some work, some don't).
WINFX was compiled using DEC C version 6.2 on Alpha and version 6.0 on
VAX. It was tested under OpenVMS versions 6.2, 7.1-2, 7.2-2, 7.3 and
7.3-1 on Alpha, and version 7.2 on VAX.

The WINFX utility is a command-driven program. Please see the help
within WINFX for detailed information. Following is a brief summary
of the commands it supports.

  USE           Associates a drive letter (A-Z) with a file system.

  DISUSE        Releases a drive letter file system association.

  FORMAT        Creates a new empty file system.

  PARTITION     Partitions a hard disk.

  IMPORT (WRITE)
                Copies files into a file system from OpenVMS. Binary
                and text modes are supported. Can create and import
                an associated FDL file.

  EXPORT (READ) Copies files from a file system to OpenVMS. Binary and
                text modes are supported. Can use an FDL file when
                creating exported files.

  DIRECTORY     Lists the contents of a directory. Several attributes
                of the files can be displayed, and a MSDOS-like display
                is supported.

  CREATE/FILE_SYSTEM
                Creates an empty container file in which one or more
                file systems can be constructed.

  CREATE/DIRECTORY (MKDIR)
                Creates a new empty directory.

  DELETE        Deletes a set of files.

  DELETE/DIRECTORY (RMDIR)
                Deletes a directory.

  HELP          Get help about a command or function.

  SET PATH (CD) Sets the default directory path.

  SET STYLE     Sets long or short file name style.

  SHOW PATH (PWD)
                Shows the current default directory path.

  SHOW DRIVE    Shows information about a drive and its associated
                file system.

  SHOW PARTITION
                Shows partition information for a hard disk.

WOLF3D, GAMES, Wolfenstein 3D for OpenVMS

This is a port of the classic shoot-em-up Wolfenstein 3D. The code this port
was derived from was collected from:

	http://www.icculus.org/wolf3d/wolf3d-20011028.tar.gz

Running:

In order to run Wolf3D the WOLF3D_DATA logical needs to be defined. It
must point to the location of the Wolf3D data files, eg:

	$ DEFINE WOLF3D_DATA DUA0:[WOLF3D.DATA]

The files for shareware Wolf3D are provided in the [.DATA] directory. If you
have Spear of Destiny or the full version of Wolf3D then read the linking
instruction.

If you intend to load/save games you need to define the logical WOLF3D_SAVE,
eg:

	$ DEFINE WOLF3D_SAVE DUA0:[WOLF3D.SAVE]


Read FREEWARE_DEMO.TXT for more information.

Linking:

Linking is simple. Change to the directory [.SRC] and execute
BUILD_WOLF3D.COM. If there are objects in the directory it will pick them up
and use them instead of compiling from source.

Because the different versions of Wolfenstein require different executables
I have included the objects for all four versions in ZIP files:

For Alpha:
    WOLF3D_WL1_AXP.ZIP	=> Wolfenstein 3D Shareware
    WOLF3D_WL6_AXP.ZIP	=> Wolfenstein 3D
    WOLF3D_SDM_AXP.ZIP	=> Spear of Destiny Demo
    WOLF3D_SOD_AXP.ZIP	=> Spear of Destiny

For VAX:
    WOLF3D_WL1_VAX.ZIP	=> Wolfenstein 3D Shareware
    WOLF3D_WL6_VAX.ZIP	=> Wolfenstein 3D
    WOLF3D_SDM_VAX.ZIP	=> Spear of Destiny Demo
    WOLF3D_SOD_VAX.ZIP	=> Spear of Destiny

Simply unzip the contents of the relevant file into [.SRC] and execute the
build procedure:

    $ UNZIP WOLF3D_xxx_yyy.ZIP -d [.SRC]
    $ SET DEFAULT [.SRC}
    $ @BUILD_WOLF3D

Building:

To build Wolf3D from source you will need to delete all the objects in [.SRC],
set the correct version number and execute the build procedure:

    $ SET DEFAULT [.SRC]
    $ DELETE *.AXP_*;*	! For Alpha users
    $ DELETE *.VAX_*;*	! For VAX users

To set the version edit VERSION.H and modify the value of WMODE. From the
source:

From VERSION.H:

    #define WMODE 0

    /* Change WMODE to point to the executable you would like to build: */
    /* WL1 = 0 Wolfenstein 3D Shareware */
    /* WL6 = 1 Wolfenstein 3D */
    /* SDM = 2 Spear of Destiny Demo */
    /* SOD = 3 Spear of Destiny */

Then build Wolf3D:

    $ @BUILD_WOLF3D

Documentation:

The [.DOC] directory contains the documentation from the original package.
There is also a Wolfenstein 3D FAQ which contains cheats, etc.

Help:

From "-help":

        -debugmode
        -demotest
        -help           prints this message
        -nojoy          disables joystick input
        -nomouse        disables mouse input
        -noshm          disables X MIT-SHM support
        -nowait 	skip intro screen
        -version        prints software version
        -x2             increase window size x2, 640x480(default is 320x200)
        -x3             increase window size x3, 960x600

I pulled the following out of some of the source:

	Escape		Main Menu
	F1/Help		Help
	F2		Save game
	F3		Load game
	F4		Configure sound
	F5		Change view
	F6		Configure controls
	F7		End game
	F8		Quick save
	F9		Quick load
	F10		Quit
	Do		Pause

Build system:

The Alpha objects were built on:

    Alpha Evaluation Board 166 5/333 128Mb RAM
    OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-1
    DECwindows 1.3
    Compaq C V6.5-001
    2x Powerstorm 3D30

The Alpha executable was built on:

    Alpha XP1000 6/500
    OpeVMS Alpha V7.3-1
    DECwindows 1.2-6
    2x 3DLabs Oxygen VX1

The VAX objects and executable were built on:

    VAXstation 4000-90
    OpenVMS VAX V7.3
    DECwindows 1.2-6
    Compaq C V6.4-005
    LCSPX 8-plane graphics module

Changes:

I have made some changes to the code as listed below:

    o. Added -x2 and -x3 support to the X driver.
    o. Implemented WOLF3D_DATA logical. Everything used to have to be in
       the same directory.
    o. Implemented WOLF3D_SAVE logical. Somewhere to put your save files.
    o. Added -help
    o. Added support for all Fx keys, Help, Do and LK escape key.
    o. Wrote some macro to handle quadword arithmetic need for FixedByFrac()
       on the VAX, uses EMUL.
    o. Added XBell PC speaker emulation, a little bit slow, but still fun.

I would like to add sound support and the ability to change versions without
having to re-compile/re-link. Maybe one day :)

Problems:

There is an issue with the VAX version where keypresses seem to disappear.
I haven't had a chance to really look into this because it's so close to
the Freeware submission date (other things have come up).

There is no sound other than PC Speaker emulation using XBell(). If some one
wants to write a VAX or MMOV driver (or both) that would be good. I haven't
got any sound on any of my Alphas. I did try to get the Multia going, but the
MMOV server crashes with an access violation everytime I try to access the
device. The virtual address is 4 (from memory), this might mean something to
someone. If you are one such someone contact me, I wouldn't mind knowing
what is going on.

As far as I know this still doesn't work with the Oxygen card. If someone
wants to either fix this or let me know what is going on, so I can fix it,
it would be much appreciated.

Misc:

The glob() and globfree() come from the GNV source for the make utility. They
have been modified slightly so they can exist on their own and run on VAX.

Support:

This was/is a lunchtime/Friday afternoon project. I don't know how quickly I
will be able to respond to problems, etc. but I will try to answer any
queries (provided I'm not repeating what's in this document). Just
remember that I have work, a life and my own projects to work on also.

Supported graphics:

The following graphics cards have been tested and are known to work with
Wolfenstein 3D:

    ATI Mach64 (PB2GA-FA/FB)............not tested, but should work (I did
					DOOM with this card)
    Powerstorm 3D30 (PBXGB-AA)..........use with -noshm
    9FX Motion 331 (PB2GA-JC/JD)........use with -noshm (JA/JB should work)
    21030 (Multia/UBD TGA adapter)......works completely
    LCSPX 8-plane (54-21795-01).........work no problems
    ELSA GLoria Synergy (PBXGK-BB)......use with -noshm

The above list should be correct, if there is one you would like to add, or
something is incorrect then contact me at the address below.

X10_MONITOR, SOFTWARE, Monitor and Control X-10 and Serial Interface Devices

X10_MONITOR and companion application X10_TIMER comprise a powerful, 
flexible system for monitoring and controlling X-10 and other types
of real-time control devices employing a serial port interface from
your OpenVMS system.  Functional diagram:

                  User Interface
                        |
  +------------+        V             +-------------+
  |            |-> Input mailbox  --> |             | <---> Terminal
  | X10_TIMER  |                      | X10_MONITOR |       Serial
  |  Process   |                      |   Process   |       Port
  | (optional) |<- Output mailbox <-- |             |      (Built-in
  +------------+                      +-------------+       or LAT)
        ^
        |           +----------+
        |           |  [Rdb]   |
        +---------->| X10MONDB |<-----> User Interface
                    | Database |      
                    |(optional)|
                    +----------+

Major components:

  - X10_MONITOR is a "message switch" application run in the context of 
    a detached process.  It handles the routing of commands and messages 
    between two mailbox devices and a user-defined terminal port (built-in 
    or LAT). The monitor can operate without the timer component and is
    easily customized for multiple applications.  

  - Optional component X10_TIMER also runs in the context of a detached 
    process.  At a user-defined interval it queries an Oracle Rdb rela-
    tional database for scheduled events.  Selected events are sent to
    X10_MONITOR's input mailbox for routing. The Timer's secondary func-
    tion is to log timestamped message activity to a database table for
    user interface querying and reporting.  Current status for each
    module is maintained based on controller message activity.

  - Supplemental programs for interacting with the monitor, defining the 
    database, populating database tables, generating scheduled events,
    testing, startup and shutdown, etc., are included in this package.

Modules are written in C, COBOL, DCL and SQL.  They are a good example of 
employing many OpenVMS Run-Time Library and System Service routines, ASTs, 
etc. to handle intermittent real-time monitoring and control.  A cross-
reference list can be found in the README.TXT file.  Refer also to the 
documentation file and program source code for additional information.

The author of all modules in the X10_MONITOR package is:

   Jason Brady
   Lynnwood, Washington USA
   jr_brady@earthlink.net

Programs were written and tested on an Alphaserver 300 4/266 running 
OpenVMS AXP 7.2, Compaq C 6.0-001, Compaq COBOL 5.5 and Oracle Rdb 7.0-4.

Xpdf202, Graphics, Display/process Adobe PDF files

Package contents

The Xpdf distribution actually contains seven programs:

Xpdf
  This is the actual Xwindows viewer program and therefore the most visible
  part of the distribution.
pdffonts
  Pdffonts lists the fonts used in a Portable Document Format (PDF) file along
  with various information for each font.
pdfimages
  Pdfimages saves images from a Portable Document Format (PDF) file as
  Portable Pixmap (PPM), Portable Bitmap (PBM), or JPEG files.
pdfinfo
  Pdfinfo prints the contents of the "Info" dictionary (plus some other useful
  information) from a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
pdftopbm
  Pdftopbm converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to
  black-and-white image files in Portable Bitmap (PBM) format.
pdftops
  As the name implies, this filter converts a PDF document to a PS file
  suitable for printing. Graphics elements are preserved by this filter.
pdftotext
  This program extracts the text portions of a PDF document and saves them to
  a plain ASCII file. Useful when working via slow lines.

Building

vms_make.com makes some effort to check the compiler installation. If
it complains about a missing C++ compiler chances are very good, that
actually  you don't have one installed. Note that C++ is an entirely
seperate product from C, so having a C compiler installed on your
system (which is also neccessary) does in no way imply that you also
have C++. If you're not sure contact your system manager or drop me a
note and we'll try to sort out things together.

Parameters

vms_make.com takes up to three parameters:

 1.Configuration settings

  a4
     Use european A4 as the default paper size.
  no_text_select
     Disable text selections in Xpdf
  opi_support
     Compile Xpdf with support for the Open Prepress Interface (OPI)

 2.Compiler detection
  In case you want to override the automatic compiler detection specify either
  DECC or GCC as the second parameter, e.g. @vms_make "" GCC
 3.Global configuration file
  Since version 0.93 Xpdf supports a global configuration file, which
  can be used to provide meaningfull default settings for all users.
  This is by default decw$system_defaults:xpdfrc.dat on OpenVMS, but
  may be overriden during compile time using the third parameter to the
  build procedure, e.g
  @vms_make "" "" sys$manager:xpdfrc.dat

Sample invocation of the script

  
@vms_make a4,opi_support "" 

External libraries

Xpdf uses external libraries for some of its functions. These are
supported via the driver file VMSLIB.DAT. The libraries currently used
by Xpdf are:

T1lib
  Font rasterizer library used to display rotated texts (e.g. in
  tables). The main reason why one actually needs t1lib support for
  Xpdf on OpenVMS is to correctly render rotated strings. While this is
  supported by some Xservers (e.g. XFree on Linux), it is not supported
  natively on OpenVMS (at least up to Motif 1.2.5), so one has to
  resort to using t1lib to add this capability. As a bon t1lib also
  should improve the quality of the display by using antialiasing.
xpm
  Enable Xpm support for Xpdf in icons. For this to work properly you have to
  make sure that the Xpm includes are found in your X11 path.
Freetype2
  Library to process embeded fonts in PDF documents.
Libpaper
  This library adds support for various paper formats to Xpdf.

Decryption?!

Many documents use compressed PDF, which need the decryption routines
to be rendered. Since version 0.91 these are part of the base
distribution, so no further patches are required as it was the case
with earlier versions.

National Language Support

Xpdf may be extended with files describing character mappings for
various different encodings (like e.g the ISO series, BIG-5 etc.).
These can be downloaded separatly and the location of the files needs
to be added to your .xpdfrc file. To facilitate this for OpenVMS users
I did write a short DCL procedure, which will turn the files provided
for the purpose on Unix systems into one which can be used on OpenVMS.
The procedure can be found as mk-xpdfrc.com.

Xresources

Xpdf doesn't use an own Xresource file but relies on the Xresource
information it gets from the Xserver. To set values for this process
you can change decw$xdefaults.dat in your Xresource directory. Changes
in this file only take effect after the next restart of the server. For
experimenting with different settings one is better off using Xrdb,
which allows to load new values for a running Xserver.
If you do use t1lib with Xpdf you need to set one Xresource for each of
the 14 well-known PDF fonts. An example for these settings can be found
in xpdf-font.txt. In case you don't have the needed fonts already on
your  system (they are e.g. part of  Grace), you can get a copy of my
t1lib font collection in file t1fonts.zip.

Example

Just in case you don't have a PDF document handy to check how Xpdf is working,
you can fetch a copy of the VMS book from this server, which contains a short
history of the OpenVMS operating system issued by Digital.

In case you did build a version with Freetype support you might want to
use this PDF file which does contain numerous TrueType Fonts. If it
does display correctly your copy of Xpdf is working fine.

Currently open issues

The following issues were reported by OpenVMS users of Xpdf. They are
acknowledged by the author of Xpdf and should be resolved during the
next couple of maintenance releases

During startup of Xpdf the message Warning: Cannot convert string
"-*-times-medium-r-normal--16-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1" to
type FontStruct is displayed
  This message can be safely ignored. This particular font is used only inside
  of the "About" window of Xpdf. It will be replaced in there by a default
  font. The display of PDF documents is not affected at all by this.
  The solution will make the font settable via an Xresource.
  The same behaviour can be observed on Linux systems.
Slow rendering of of extremely fine patterned areas
  If a document contains extremely fine patterned areas (which most
  probably will look like solid color areas in the result), Xpdf might
  appear to loop, i.e. using an inordinate amount of time to render the
  document. If you are patient enough it will be shown in the end
  though. Documents known to be affected by this are recent editons of
  Shannon knows HPC.
  Most probably the solution will involve cacheing the pattern in memory
  instead of calculating it over and over again.
  The same behaviour can be observed on Linux systems.
Only print to file supported
  Currently Xpdf only can be used to save a PDF file as postscript,
  which subsequently can be printed via DCL. There is no support for
  direct printing. Adding this is not entirely trivial, since the print
  setup under Unix relies on a pipe to whatever print filter is used,
  which does not lend itself easily to an equivalent under OpenVMS.
  Still the print system is supposed to be redesigned and there might
  be an opportunity to get better support there.


The latest version of the OpenVMS port of Xpdf  should always be 
accessible via

XPDF202PL1, UTILITIES, X-Windows based viewer for PDF files

    This is XPDF V2.02pl1.  This packages contains the source code
    necessary to build the following programs:

    XPDF	- displays Portable Document Files (PDF) (sometimes called 
    		  Adobe Acrobat files) on an X-Windows display.  Can also
    		  print PDF files by converting them to postscript and
    		  sending them to a postscript printer.
    PDFFONTS	- displays information about the fonts referenced in a
    		  PDF file.
    PDFIMAGES	- saves images from a PDF file as Portable Pixmap (PPM), 
    		  Portable Bitmap (PBM), or JPEG files.
    PDFINFO	- prints the contents of the 'Info' dictionary (plus some 
    		  other useful information) from a PDF file.
    PDFTOPBM	- converts PDF files to black-and-white image files in 
    		  Portable Bitmap (PBM) format.
    PDFTOPS	- converts PDF files to PostScript so they can be printed.
    PDFTOTXT	- converts PDF files to plain text.


    You will need the following tools in order to unpack and build this
    package:

    UNZIP		(you must use the -V switch when unzipping)
    DEC C compiler
    DEC C++ compiler
    Either MMS or MMK.

    If you do not have all of these tools you will need to get and
    install them before you can build XPDF.

    This package includes all the other packages necessary to build XPDF. 
    You must build the other packages first and then build XPDF. 
    Instructions are as follows (note that all directory references are
    relative to the directory where you unpack the kit):

    First, unpack the distribution kit:

    $ unzip XPDF-2_02PL1.ZIP

    Then, build as follows:

    FREETYPE

    $ Set Default to [.FREETYPE-2_1_3]
    $ MMS		(or MMK if you have that, instead).

    T1LIB

    $ Set Default to [.T1LIB-1_3]
    $ @CONFIGURE
    $ @MAKE
    $!
    $! N.B. T1LIB includes a standalone executable, called XGLYPH, that
    $! is used to view the glyphs from a font file.  This program
    $! requires XAW3D, which I have not included here.  You will get a
    $! note indicating that XGLYPH will not be built.  You may ignore
    $! this.  XGLYPH is not used by XPDF.

    LIBXPM

    $ Set Default to [.XPM-3_4K.LIB]
    $ @MAKE		(will invoke either MMK or MMS)

    XPDF

    $ Set Default to [.XPDF-2_02PL1]
    $ @VMS_MAKE OPI_SUPPORT	(see VMS_MAKE.COM for other options)
    $!
    $! After this build procedure completes, all of the executables will
    $! be found in [.XPDF-2_02PL1.XPDF].


    I have included all of the object files, object libraries, and
    executables that resulted when I built this on my system.  These
    executables were linked on an Alpha running OpenVMS V7.3-1 and
    DECWindows V1.2-6.  If your version of VMS is recent enough, these
    may work for you without having to rebuild the entire kit.  Also,
    every file I had to edit to make this package work and build
    correctly can be found as filename;2 (filename;1 is the original
    version).

ZLIB, Utilities, Compression and Decompression Library

 Tous droits rservs 2003 Jean-Franois PIRONNE

Zlib V1.1.4

Zlib is a compression/decompression library used by several software packages,
including MySQL and Python.

By default, the installation procedure installs this library package in the
SYS$COMMON:[LIBZ] directory. To install it in another directory, dev:[dir], use
the /DESTINATION parameter of the PRODUCT command. In this case, the library
package will be installed in the dev:[dir.LIBZ] directory. Installation

   1. Make the directory which holds the ZIP file your default directory
   2. Extract the PCSI kit from the ZIP archive.

$ UNZIP "-V" ZLIB-V0101-4-1

   3. Install the Zlib package to your chosen destination.

$ PRODUCT INSTALL zlib  (default)

  or ...

$ PRODUCT INSTALL zlib /DESTINATION=dev:[dir]

   4. Finally, run the DCL procedure STARTUP.COM to define the necessary logicals.

(You might want to add the relevant line to your SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM file.)

$ @SYS$COMMON:[LIBZ]STARTUP  (default)

  or ...

$ @dev:[dir.LIBZ]:STARTUP
