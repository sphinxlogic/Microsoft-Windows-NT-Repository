<a name="vax2"><h1><font color=maroon>14.11 What is the layout of the VAX floating point format?</font></h1></a>

<p>
The VAX floating point format is derived from one of the PDP-11 FP 
formats, which helps explain its strange layout. There are four formats 
defined: F 32-bit single-precision, D and G 64-bit double-precision and 
H 128-bit quadruple precision. For all formats, the lowest addressed 
16-bit &quot;word&quot; contains the sign and exponent (and for other 
than H, some of the most significant fraction bits). Each successive 
higher-addressed word contains the next 16 lesser-significant fraction 
bits. Bit 15 of the first word is the sign, 1 for negative, 0 for 
positive. Zero is represented by a biased exponent value of zero and a 
sign of zero; the fraction bits are ignored (but on Alpha, non-zero 
fraction bits in a zero value cause an error.) A value with biased 
exponent zero and sign bit 1 is a &quot;reserved operand&quot; - 
touching it causes an error - fraction bits are ignored. There are no 
minus zero, infinity, denormalized or NaN values.

<p>
For all formats, the fraction is normalized and the radix point assumed 
to be to the left of the MSB, hence the following range: 0.5 less than 
or equal to f and less than 1.0. The MSB, always being 1, is not 
stored. The binary exponent is stored with a bias varying with type in 
bits 14:n of the lowest-addressed word.

biased exponent of 129)

<a name="vax5"><h1><font color=maroon>14.14 What system disk size limit on the MicroVAX and VAXstation 3100?</font></h1></a>

<p>
System disks larger than 1.073 gigabytes (GB)---1fffff hexidecimal 
blocks -- are not supported on any member of the VAXstation 3100 series 
and on certain older members of the MicroVAX 3100 series, and are not 
reliable on these affected systems. (See below to identify the affected 
systems---the more recent members of the MicroVAX 3100 series systems 
are NOT affected.)

<p>
Various of the SCSI commands used by the boot drivers imbedded in the 
console
<a name="index_x_1209"></a>
<a name="index_x_1210"></a>
<a name="index_x_1211"></a>
PROM on all members of the VAXstation 3100 series use "Group 0" 
commands, which allow a 21 bit block number field, which allows access 
to the first 1fffff hexidecimal blocks of a disk. Any disk references 
past 1fffff will wrap---this wrapping behaviour can be of particular 
interest when writing a system crashdump file, as this can potentially 
lead to system disk corruptions should any part of the crashdump file 
be located beyond 1.073 GB.

<p>
More recent systems and console PROMs use "Group 1" SCSI commands, 
which allow a 32 bit block number field.

<p>
There was a similar limitation among the oldest of the MicroVAX 3100 
series, but a console boot PROM was phased into production and was made 
available for field retrofits---this PROM upgrade allows the use of the 
"Group 1" SCSI commands, and thus larger system disks. There was no 
similar PROM upgrade for the VAXstation 3100 series.

<p>
Systems that are affected by this limit:

<ul>
  <li>VAXstation 3100 series, all members. No PROM upgrade is available.
  <li>MicroVAX 3100 models 10 and 20. No PROM upgrade is available.
  <li>MicroVAX 3100 models 10e and 20e. Only systems with console VMB 
  versions prior to V6.4 are affected. A PROM upgrade for these specific 
  systems is (or was once) available.

<a name="vax8"><h1><font color=maroon>14.15 What is the Accuracy of VAX the Time of Year (TOY) Clock?</font></h1></a>

<p>
The VAX Time-Of-Year (TOY) clock (used to save the time over a reboot 
or power failure) is specified as having an accuracy of 0.0025%. This 
is a drift of roughly 65 seconds per month.

<p>
The VAX Interval Time is used to keep the running time, and this has a 
specified accuracy of .01%. This is a drift of approximately 8.64 
seconds per day.

<p>
Any high-IPL activity can interfere with the IPL 22 or IPL 24 (this 
depends on the VAX implementation) clock interrupts---activities such 
as extensive device driver interrupts or memory errors are known to 
slow the clock.

<a name="supp3"><h1><font color=maroon>14.19 Why does my system halt when I power-cycle the console terminal?</font></h1></a>

<p>
Various VAX and Alpha consoles are designed to process the BREAK 
signal, treating it as a HALT request.

<p>
A BREAK is a deliberately-generated serial line framing error.

<p>
When a serial line device such as a terminal powers up (or sometimes 
when powering down) it can generate framing errors. These framing 
errors are indistingushable from a BREAK signal.

<p>
When a BREAK is received on a serial line console for various VAX 
systems---including most VAXstation, MicroVAX, and VAX 4000 series---it 
is typically interpreted as a HALT. Alpha systems will also often 
process a BREAK in a similar fashion, halting the system.

<p>
There is no uniform or generally-available way to disable this 
behaviour on every VAX or Alpha system. On some systems, BREAK 
processing can be disabled in favor of [CTRL/P], or [CTRL/P] is the 
only way to halt the processor.

<p>
The most common way to avoid these halts is to disable the serial line 
console or to simply not power-cycle the console terminal. There is 
certain important system state information that is displayed only on 
the console, OpenVMS expects to always have access to the system 
console.

<a name="supp4"><h1><font color=maroon>14.20 Can I reuse old keyboards, mice and monitors with a PC?</font></h1></a>

<p>
Older HP keyboards (those with the DIGITAL logo and the RJ modular 
jacks), older HP mice (those with the DIGITAL logo and with the RJ 
modular jacks, or with a DIN connector with pins in a configuration 
other than the PC-standard DIN connector pin orientation), and older 
video monitors (with RGB synch-on-green video signaling) all use 
signaling formats and/or communications protocols that differ from the 
PC standards, and are not (easily) interchangable nor (easily) 
compatible with typical PC peripheral device controllers. The LK201 and 
LK401 keyboards, the VSXXX series mice, the VR260 and VR290 monitors, 
etc.,
<a name="index_x_1214"></a>
<a name="index_x_1215"></a>
<a name="index_x_1216"></a>
<a name="index_x_1217"></a>
<a name="index_x_1218"></a>
are incompatible with most PC systems and with most KVM switches.
<a name="index_x_1219"></a>

<p>
Newer HP (and Compaq) keyboards (those with with PC-style DIN plugs, 
and the HP, Compaq or DIGITAL logo), newer HP mice (with PC-pin DIN 
plugs, and the HP, Compaq or DIGITAL logo), and newer video monitors 
(multi-synch) are often interchangeable with "industry standard" PC 
systems, and can often be used with most PC peripheral device 
controllers. LK461, LK463, LK46W, LK471, PC7XS-CA, VRC16, VRC21, 
TFT-series LCD flat-panel displays, etc., are typically reasonably 
compatible with most PC systems, and will usually perform as expected 
within the limits of the hardware.
<a name="index_x_1220"></a>
<a name="index_x_1221"></a>
<a name="index_x_1222"></a>
<a name="index_x_1223"></a>
<a name="index_x_1224"></a>
<a name="index_x_1225"></a>
<a name="index_x_1226"></a>
<a name="index_x_1227"></a>
(For details of CRT and LCD display compatibility, please see 
<a href="vmsfaq_019.html#supp5">Section 14.21</a>.)

<p>
Rule of thumb: if the peripheral device component was sold for use with 
the DEC 2000 (DECpc 150 AXP), an AlphaServer series, an AlphaStation 
series, or a more recent Alpha system, it will probably work with a PC 
peripheral controller or with a PC-compatible KVM switch. If the 
peripheral device component was sold for use with an VT420 or older 
terminal, most VAX, most VAXstation, and most Alpha systems with names 
in the format DEC [four-digit-number], it probably won't work on a PC 
system or with a PC-compatible KVM.
<a name="index_x_1228"></a>

<p>
Note that the above is a general guideline, and should not be read to 
indicate that any particular peripheral device will or will not work in 
any particular configuration, save for those specific configurations 
the device is explicitly supported in.

<p>
Software Integrators sells a video adapter card called Gemini P1 which 
will drive many of the older HP (DIGITAL-logo) fixed-frequency monitors 
on a PC system:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.si87.com/
</ul>

<p>
The DIGITAL part number 29-32540-01 converts the output from the RGB 
cable (3 BNC, synch-on-green) that comes with the VAXstation 3100 and 
VAXstation
<a name="index_x_1229"></a>
<a name="index_x_1230"></a>
4000 series to a female SVGA D connector.

<p>
This adapter will allow PC multisync monitors with the needed frequency 
specifications to be used with the VAXstation series synch-on-green 
video connection. It may well also work with a VAXstation 2000 series 
systems, but specifics and performance of that combination are not 
immediately known at this writing.

<p>
The protocol definition for the old DIGITAL keyboard and mouse 
interfaces is buried at the back of the QDSS section in the old 
VAXstation II manual, specifically, in the back of the VCB02 Video 
Subsystem Technical Manual (EK-104AA-TM). The keyboard wiring and 
protocol is in appendix B, and occupies circa 44 pages. The mouse is in 
appendix C, circa 12 pages.

<a name="supp5"><h1><font color=maroon>14.21 Which video monitor works with which graphics controller?</font></h1></a>

<p>
  To determine the answer to the &quot;will this video monitor or this 
  LCD panel work with this graphics controller?&quot; question, please 
  first locate the resolution(s) and the frequencies that are 
  possible/supported at both ends of the video cable (on the display and 
  on the graphics controller, in other words), and then determine if 
  there are any matching settings available. If there are multiple 
  matches, you will need to determine which one is most appropriate for 
  your needs.

<p>
You will also need to determine if the video monitor or graphics 
controller requires the 3 BNC signaling with the synchronization 
signals on the green wire, or the 5 BNC signalling common on many PCs, 
or other connections such as the DB15 video connector or USB connector 
used on various systems.

<p>
If there are no matches, you will likely need to change the hardware at 
one or both ends of the video cable.

<p>
The refresh frequencies for many devices have been posted to 
comp.os.vms and/or other newsgroups. Search the archives for details.

</ul>

<p>
LCD-based and plasma-based flat-panel displays are generally compatible 
with all recent OpenVMS Alpha systems and supported graphics 
controllers. For best results, you should generally set the graphics 
controller to match the native LCD or plasma display resolution and 
(for LCD displays) also set the controller refresh rate to 60Hz. Check 
your graphics controller and your display documentation for any 
device-specific requirements and/or configuration recommendations.

<a name="supp7"><h1><font color=maroon>14.23 Why does my LK401 keyboard unexpectedly autorepeat?</font></h1></a>

<p>
There are several modes of failure:

<ul>
  <li>Pressing 2 and 3 keys at the same time causes one key to autorepeat 
  when released. Check the hardware revision level printed on the bottom 
  of the keyboard. If the revision level is C01, the keyboard firmware is 
  broken. Call field service to replace the keyboard with any revision 
  level other than C01.
  <li>Pressing certain keys is always broken. Typical symptoms are: 
  delete always causes a autorepeat, return needs to be pressed twice, 
  etc. This is frequently caused by having keys depressed while the 
  keyboard is being initialized. Pressing ^F2 several times or unplugging 
  and replugging the keyboard frequently fix this problem. (Ensure you 
  have current ECO kits applied; there is a patch available to fix this 
  problem.)
  <li>A key that was working spontaneously stops working correctly. This 
  may be either of the two previous cases, or it may be bad console 
  firmware. Ensure that you have the most recent firmware installed on 
  your Alpha system. In particular, an old version of the DEC 3000 SRM 
  firmware is known to have a bug that can cause this keyboard 
  misbehaviour.
</ul>

<a name="supp8"><h1><font color=maroon>14.24 Problem - My LK411 sends the wrong keycodes or some keys are dead</font></h1></a>

<p>
Check the firmware revision on the keyboard. Hardware revision B01 
introduced an incompatability with the device driver which causes the 
keyboard to not be recognized correctly. There is a patch available to 
fix this problem: [AXPDRIV06_061] - the fix is also included in OpenVMS 
V6.2. The rev A01 keyboard, and the LK450 should work without problems.

<p>
If you are working from another operating system platform, please see 
the DECxterm tool and related information on OpenVMS Freeware V5.0.

<a name="supp9"><h1><font color=maroon>14.25 Which DE500 variant works with which OpenVMS version?</font></h1></a>

<p>
Ensure you have a version of the Alpha SRM console with support for the 
DE500 series device. Apply ALL mandatory ECO kits for the OpenVMS 
version in use, and also apply the CLUSIO, ALPBOOT, and ALPLAN kits, 
and apply any available ALPCPU ECO kit for the platform.

<p>
Fast Ethernet (100Base, 100 megabit) controllers such as the DE500 
series have a pair of connections available---while traditional 
Ethernet (10Base, 10 megabit) is inherently a half-duplex protocol, 
Fast Ethernet can be configured to use one or both of the available 
connections, depending on the controller. Fast Ethernet can thus be 
half- or full-duplex depending on the configuration and the 
capabilities of the network controller and the Ethernet network plant. 
Some Fast Ethernet controllers can also operate at traditional Ethernet 
speeds, these controllers are thus often refered to as 10/100 Ethernet 
controllers.

<p>
A wide variety of third-party widgets---SCSI and ATA (IDE) disks and 
tapes, graphics controllers, etc---are obviously widely available and 
are used on various platforms.

<p>
If you purchase third-party "generic" SCSI or ATA (IDE) storage 
devices, you and your device vendor will be responsible for the testing 
and the support of the devices. In general, you can expect that Compaq 
will address non-standards-compliance problems within OpenVMS (changes 
that will also not prevent operations with other supported devices, of 
course), but you and/or the device vendor and/or the device 
manufacturer are responsible for finding and fixing problems in the 
particular third-party device and or controller involved.

<p>
In particular, realize that neither SCSI nor ATA (IDE) is a 
particularly standard interface, these interfaces tend to be a 
collection of optionally-implemented and standardized interface 
features. You should not and can not simply assume that all SCSI nor 
ATA (IDE) storage devices are interchangeable. If you want to try to 
use a generic SCSI device, use V6.2 or later, or (better) V7.1-2 or 
later. If you wish to try to use ATA (IDE), use OpenVMS V7.1-2 or later.

<a name="index_x_1252"></a>
<a name="index_x_1253"></a>

<p>
On older OpenVMS releases, see the disk capacity limits (<a href="vmsfaq_010.html#file5"> Section 9.5</a>).

<p>
With SCSI disks on releases prior to V6.2, ensure that you have the
<a name="index_x_1254"></a>
<a name="index_x_1255"></a>
<a name="index_x_1256"></a>
<a name="index_x_1257"></a>
<a name="index_x_1258"></a>
<a name="index_x_1259"></a>
  ARRE and ARWE settings configured correctly (disabled). (If not, you 
  will see DRVERR fatal drive errors and error log entries.)

<p>
Some SCSI disks set the medium type byte as part of the SCSI size 
field---this is a SET CAPACITY extension to SCSI specs. This problem 
also applies to VAX V7.1 and later.

<p>
Disks with SCSI disk sizes past 8.58 GB and/or with the SET CAPACITY 
extension require ALPSCSI07 ECO or the OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2 or later 
release. (See <a href="vmsfaq_010.html#file5">Section 9.5</a> for further details.)

<p>
Based on the displays of the (undocumented) SYS$ETC:SCSI_INFO tool;
<a name="index_x_1260"></a>
  this tool is present in OpenVMS V6.2 and later:

The E6 indicates that the AWRE and ARRE bits are set, and this is
<a name="index_x_1261"></a>
<a name="index_x_1262"></a>
    not acceptable on OpenVMS versions prior to V6.2. Further along in the 
    SCSI_INFO display, if you also see:

The C0 value means that the AWRE and ARRE values can be changed

<a name="index_x_1265"></a>
<a name="index_x_1266"></a>
<a name="index_x_1267"></a>
    on this particular SCSI device. (This is not always the case.) Use 
    RZDISK from the OpenVMS Freeware, and reset the E6 flag byte
<a name="index_x_1268"></a>
    to hexadecimal 26 (or whatever the remaining mask when you remove bits 
    C0) on page one.

Each SCSI and ATA (IDE) host contains non-trivial SCSI and IDE driver
<a name="index_x_1269"></a>
<a name="index_x_1270"></a>
<a name="index_x_1271"></a>
<a name="index_x_1272"></a>

<a name="index_x_1275"></a>
<a name="index_x_1276"></a>
<a name="index_x_1277"></a>
  software, and each device contains equally non-trivial firmware--- 
  taken together with the mechanical and electronic components, this 
  software and firmware will determine whether or not a particular device 
  will function as expected.

<p>
  Also note that various devices---such as various SCSI CD-R devices 
  ---can implement and can require vendor-specific protocol extensions, 
  and these extensions can require modifications to OpenVMS or the 
  addition of various utilities. In various of these cases, these
<a name="index_x_1278"></a>
<a name="index_x_1279"></a>
<a name="index_x_1280"></a>
<a name="index_x_1281"></a>
<a name="index_x_1282"></a>
<a name="index_x_1283"></a>
  devices perform functions that will require them to use SCSI or ATA 
  (IDE) commands that are (hopefully) architecturally-compatible SCSI or 
  ATA (IDE) command extensions. (Also see <a href="vmsfaq_009.html#util1">Section 7.1</a> and 
  <a href="vmsfaq_011.html#file7">Section 9.7</a>.)

<p>
In order for OpenVMS to officially support a particular device, 
integration and testing work is mandated. There can be no certainty 
that any particular device will operate as expected in any particular 
configuration without first performing this (non-trivial) work.

<p>
It is quite possible to find two devices---both entirely compliant with 
applicable standards or interface documents---that will not 
interoperate.

<p>
The same general statement holds for OpenVMS bootstrapping on an 
unsupported VAX or Alpha platform. It might or might not work. In 
particular, please see the OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD) 
for the list of platforms supported by OpenVMS. OpenVMS is not 
supported on the Personal Workstation -a series, on the Digital Server 
series platforms, on the AlphaServer 2100 series 5/375 CPU, on the 
Multia, on the AlphaServer DS20L, and on a variety of other platforms. 
(You might or might not see success booting OpenVMS on any of these 
platforms.)
