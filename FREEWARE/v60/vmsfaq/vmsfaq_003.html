<a name="doc4"><h1><font color=maroon>3.4 How do I extract the contents of a HELP topic to a text file?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_128"></a>

<p>
To extract all the text of a HELP topic (and its subtopics) to a text 
file for perusal with a text editor, printing out, etc., use the 
following command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ HELP/OUT=filename.txt help-topic [help-subtopic] 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If the help text you want is not in the standard help library (for 
example, it's help for a utility such as MAIL that has its own help 
library), add /LIBRARY=libname after the HELP verb. To see the names of 
help library files, do a directory of SYS$HELP:*.HLB.

<a name="doc5"><h1><font color=maroon>3.5 Does OpenVMS Marketing have an e-mail address?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_129"></a>

<p>
Yes - if you can't get the answers to marketing questions elsewhere, if 
you have comments or complaints about OpenVMS, send mail to 
openvms-info@compaq.com. This address is <em>not</em> a support 
channel, and is solely intended to provide informal method to 
communicate directly with members of OpenVMS Marketing.

<a name="doc10"><h1><font color=maroon>3.6 Where can I learn about OpenVMS executive internals?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_130"></a>

<p>
The OpenVMS Internals and Data Structure manual (IDSM) explains how the 
OpenVMS executive works. The book covers the operating system kernel: 
process management; memory management; the I/O subsystem; and the 
mechanisms that transfer control to, from, and among these. It gives an 
overview of a particular area of the system, followed by descriptions 
of the data structures related to that area and details of the code 
that implements the area.

<p>
The first edition of the OpenVMS Alpha internals book describes Version 
1.5. Although there have been several releases of OpenVMS Alpha since 
Version 1.5 (V6.1, V6.2, V7.0, V7.1, etc) and many details in the book 
are no longer accurate, it continues to provide a strong conceptual 
description of OpenVMS internals.

<p>
This book has been split into five pieces, each to be updated 
separately. The first such volume, published in early 1997, was 
"OpenVMS Alpha Internals and Data Structures: Scheduling and Process 
Control," which covers the Version 7.0 implementation of true 
multithreading and the changed scheduling model it implies.

<p>
The internals books are available through Digital Press, see 
<a href="vmsfaq_003.html#doc11">Section 3.7</a>

<a name="doc11"><h1><font color=maroon>3.7 Where can new users find tutorial information about OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_131"></a>

<p>
First, see if your local site has information on this topic. Each site 
can have site-specific features and configuration. Some sites will have 
site-specific new user's documentation, covering various site-specific 
things that are difficult or impossible for the general OpenVMS 
documentation to cover.

<a name="doc11_1"><h2>3.7.1 Tutorial Websites?</h2></a>

Various websites with OpenVMS information are available; <a href="vmsfaq_003.html#tbl_tutorials">Table 3-3</a>

<a name="index_x_142"></a>

<p>
The results of an international compromise---though some would say an 
international attempt to increase confusion---UTC is refered to as 
&quot;Coordinated Universal Time&quot; (though not as CUT) in English 
and as &quot;Temps Universel Coordinn&eacute;&quot; (though not as TUC) 
in French. (No particular information exists to explain why UTC was 
chosen over the equally nonsensical TCU, according to Ulysses T. 
Clockmeister, one of the diplomats that helped establish the 
international compromise.)

<p>
Universal Time UT0 is solar time, UT1 is solar time corrected for a 
wobble in the Earth's orbit, and UT2 is UT1 corrected for seasonal 
rotational variations in rotation due to the Earth's solar orbit.

<p>
GMT---Greenwich Mean Time---is UT1. GMT is the time at the classic site 
of the since-disbanded Royal Greenwich Observatory; at the most 
widely-known tourist attraction of Greenwich, England.
<a name="index_x_143"></a>
<a name="index_x_144"></a>
<a name="index_x_145"></a>
<a name="index_x_146"></a>
<a name="index_x_147"></a>
<a name="index_x_148"></a>
<a name="index_x_149"></a>
<a name="index_x_150"></a>
<a name="index_x_151"></a>
<a name="index_x_152"></a>
<a name="index_x_153"></a>

<p>
UTC is based on an average across multiple atomic clocks, and is kept 
within 0.9 seconds of GMT, through the insertion (or removal) of 
seconds. In other words, UTC matches GMT plus or minus up to 0.9 
seconds, but UTC is not GMT.

<p>
TDF is the Timezone Differential Factor, the interval of time between 
the local time and UTC. Areas that celebrate daylight savings time 
(DST) will see periodic changes to the TDF value, when the switch-over 
between daylight savings time and standard time occurs. The switch-over 
itself is entirely left to local governmental folks, and can and has 
varied by political entity and politics, and the switch-over has varied 
over the years even at the same location.

<p>
If your local OpenVMS system time is off by one hour (or whatever the 
local DST change) for some or all applications, you probably need to 
reset your local TDF. (For related details, please see sections 
<a href="vmsfaq_004.html#time4">Section 4.4</a> and <a href="vmsfaq_013.html#commonc">Section 10.22.1</a>.)

<a name="time1"><h1><font color=maroon>4.2 A brief history of OpenVMS Timekeeping, please?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_161"></a>

<p>
Why does OpenVMS regards November 17, 1858 as the beginning of time...
<a name="index_x_162"></a>

<p>
The modified Julian date adopted by the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory (SAO)
<a name="index_x_163"></a>
<a name="index_x_164"></a>
for satellite tracking is Julian Day 2400000.5,
<a name="index_x_165"></a>
which turns out to be midnight on November 17, 1858.
<a name="index_x_166"></a>
<a name="index_x_167"></a>

<p>
SAO started tracking satellites with an 8K (nonvirtual) 36-bit IBM 704 
in 1957 when Sputnik went into orbit. The Julian day was 2435839 on 
January 1, 1957. This is 11225377 octal, which was too big to fit into 
an 18-bit field. With only 8K of memory, the 14 bits left over by 
keeping the Julian date in its own 36-bit word would have been wasted. 
SAO also needed the fraction of the current day (for which 18 bits gave 
enough accuracy), so it was decided to keep the number of days in the 
left 18 bits and the fraction of a day in the right 18 bits of one word.

<p>
Eighteen bits allows the truncated Julian Day (the SAO day) to
<a name="index_x_168"></a>
<a name="index_x_169"></a>
grow as large as 262143, which from November 17, 1858, allowed for 7 
centuries. Possibly, the date could only grow as large as 131071 (using 
17 bits), but this still covers 3 centuries and leaves the possibility 
of representing negative time. The 1858 date preceded the oldest star 
catalogue in use at SAO, which also avoided having to use negative time 
in any of the satellite tracking calculations.

<p>
The original Julian Day (JD) is used by astronomers and expressed in 
days since noon January 1, 4713 B.C. This measure of time was 
introduced by Joseph Scaliger in the 16th century. It is named in
<a name="index_x_170"></a>
honor of his father, Julius Caesar Scaliger
<a name="index_x_171"></a>
(note that this Julian Day is different from the Julian calendar
<a name="index_x_172"></a>
that is named for the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar!).
<a name="index_x_173"></a>

<p>
Why 4713 BC? Scaliger traced three time cycles and found that they were 
all in the first year of their cyle in 4713 B.C. The three cycles are 
15, 19, and 28 years long. By multiplying these three numbers (15 * 19 
* 28 = 7980), he was able to represent any date from 4713 B.C. through 
3267 A.D.

<p>
The starting year was before any historical event known to him. In 
fact, the Jewish calendar marks the start of the world as 3761 B.C. 
Today his numbering scheme is still used by astronomers to avoid the 
difficulties of converting the months of different calendars in use 
during different eras.

<a name="time11"><h2>4.2.1 Details of the OpenVMS system time-keeping?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_174"></a>

<a name="time11_details"><h3>4.2.1.1 VAX hardware time-keeping details...</h3></a>

<a name="toyclock"><h4>4.2.1.1.1 TOY clock</h4></a>
This is battery backed up hardware timing circuitry used to keep the 
correct time of year during rebooting, power failures, and system 
shutdown. This clock only keeps track of months, days, and time. The 
time is kept relative to January 1st, at 00:00:00.00 of the year the 
clock was initiailized.

<a name="vax_systime"><h4>4.2.1.1.2 EXE$GQ_SYSTIME</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_175"></a>
This is the OpenVMS VAX system time cell. This cell contains the number 
of 100ns intervals since a known reference. This cell is incremented by 
100000 every 10ms by an hardware interval timer.

<a name="todcbase"><h4>4.2.1.1.3 EXE$GQ_TODCBASE</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_176"></a>
This cell contains the time and date the system time was last adjusted 
by EXE$SETTIME. It uses the same format as EXE$GQ_SYSTIME. On 
adjustment of the system time a copy of EXE$GQ_SYSTIME is stored in 
this cell in both memory and on disk. This cell is used to get the year 
for the system time.

<a name="todr"><h4>4.2.1.1.4 EXE$GL_TODR</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_177"></a>
This cell contains the time and date the system time was last adjusted 
by EXE$SETTIME.
<a name="index_x_178"></a>
It uses the same format as the time of year clock. On adjustment of the 
system time this cell gets saved back to both memory and disk. The 
contents of this cell are used to test the validity of the TOY clock.

<p>
The system parameters SETTIME and TIMEPROMPTWAIT determine how the 
system time will be set.
<a name="index_x_179"></a>
<a name="index_x_180"></a>
<a name="index_x_181"></a>
<a name="index_x_182"></a>
IF SETTIME = 0
<br>
THEN the contents of the TOY clock are compared to those of 
EXE$GL_TODR. IF the TOY clock is more than a day behind EXE$GL_TODR
<br>
THEN the TOY clock is presumed invalid.

  <ul>
    <li>IF the TOY clock is within a day of EXE$GL_TODR
<br>
THEN the system time is calculated as follows:
    <li>EXE$GQ_SYSTIME = EXE$GQ_TODCBASE + ((TOY_CLOCK - EXE$GL_TODR) * 
    100000)
  </ul>
  <li>IF SETTIME = 1 or the TOY clock is invalid
<br>
THEN the value of TIMEPROMPTWAIT determines how to reset the time of 
year. IF TIMEPROMPTWAIT &gt; 0
<br>
THEN the user is prompted for the time and date, for a length of time 
equal to TIMEPROMPTWAIT microfortnights.

  <ul>
    <li>IF TIMEPROMPTWAIT = 0
<br>
THEN the time of year is the value of EXE$GL_TODR + 10ms.
    <li>IF TIMEPROMPTWAIT &lt; 0
<br>
to proceed until they do so.
    <li>THEN the user is prompted for the time and date and unable
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
When booting a CD-ROM containing an OpenVMS VAX system, the system will 
typically be deliberately configured prompt the user to input the time 
-- this is necessary in order to boot with the correct time.

<p>
If either TIMEPROMPTWAIT or SETTIME are set to zero,
<a name="index_x_183"></a>
<a name="index_x_184"></a>
<a name="index_x_185"></a>
<a name="index_x_186"></a>
OpenVMS VAX will use the TOY clock to get the time of year, and the year
<a name="index_x_187"></a>
<a name="index_x_188"></a>
<a name="index_x_189"></a>
<a name="index_x_190"></a>
<a name="index_x_191"></a>
<a name="index_x_192"></a>
will be fetched from the CD-ROM. The value of the year on the CD-ROM 
media (saved within the SYS.EXE image) will most likely be that of when 
the CD-ROM was made, and cannot be changed. Unless the current year 
happens to be the same year as that on the CD-ROM, most likely the year 
will be off. (Further, with the calculation of Leap Year also being 
dependent on the current year, there is a possibility that the date 
could be off too.)
