<a name="vcs"><h2>14.3.8 Console Management Options</h2></a>

<p>
Options to collect multiple consoles into a single server are 
available, with both hardware options and software packages that can 
provide advanced features and capabilities.

<p>
Some of the available console management options for OpenVMS:
<a name="index_x_1144"></a>

<a name="platformsupport"><h1><font color=maroon>14.4 What platforms will OpenVMS operate on?</font></h1></a>

<p>
For the list of boxes that are officially and formally supported by 
OpenVMS Engineering, please see the OpenVMS Software Product 
Description (SPD).

<ul>
  <li>http://www.compaq.com/info/spd/
<br>
OpenVMS typically uses SPD 25.01.xx and/or SPD 41.87.xx.
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes a particular and officially unsupported Alpha box or Alpha 
motherboard will sufficiently resemble a supported box that the 
platform can effectively mimic and can bootstrap OpenVMS. 
Alternatively, somebody (usually one or more engineers within the 
OpenVMS Engineering group) will have put together a bootstrap kit -- 
such as the kit for the Alpha Multia---which permits OpenVMS to 
bootstrap on the platform.

<p>
Contrary to the assumptions of some folks, there are platform-level 
differences within the VAX and within Alpha platforms---hardware-level 
differences that can require moderate to extensive new coding within 
OpenVMS. Within a platform series, and particularly within Alpha 
platforms that support
<a name="index_x_1154"></a>
<a name="index_x_1155"></a>
Dynamic System Recognition (DSR), OpenVMS can usually bootstrap.

<p>
DSR is a mechanism by which OpenVMS Alpha can gather platform-specific 
information, and DSR is the reason why newer Alpha systems can be more 
easily and more commonly supported on older OpenVMS Alpha releases. DSR 
is implemented with OpenVMS Alpha code, with SRM console code, and with 
platform non-volatile memory.

<p>
OpenVMS users with experience on older OpenVMS VAX releases and VAX 
hardware will recall that then-new VAX systems either required an 
OpenVMS VAX upgrade, or that earlier releases would mis-identified 
then-newer VAX systems---such as the case of the VAX 7000 model 800 
being (mis)identified as a VAX 7000 model 600 when bootstrapped on 
OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2. (This (mis)identification was the outcome of a 
deliberate engineering effort to permit the VAX 7000 model 800 to 
bootstrap on V5.5-2; the system manager could configure the VAX 7000 
model 800 to (mis)identify itself as a model 600, to permit the system 
to bootstrap on V5.5-2.) OpenVMS VAX and VAX platforms lack DSR support.

<p>
OpenVMS I64
<a name="index_x_1156"></a>
<a name="index_x_1157"></a>
<a name="index_x_1158"></a>
(please see <a href="vmsfaq_018.html#itan1">Section 14.4.5</a> for Intel Itanium terminology) supports a 
platform-level feature similar to the OpenVMS Alpha DSR mechanism, 
based on the
<a name="index_x_1159"></a>
 ACPI interface and the byte-code interpreter implemented within 
 OpenVMS, within the EFI console, and particularly within non-volatile 
 memory located on (byte-code interpreter compliant) PCI I/O hardware. 
 ACPI tables provide the information that was formerly retrieved from 
 DSR and from the SRM, and the byte-code interpreter can (theoretically) 
 permit at least limited operations with (compliant) PCI hardware, 
 whether or not OpenVMS has a driver for the particular hardware.

<p>
The byte code interpreter may or may not permit operations with any 
particular PCI hardware, and may or may not have sufficient performance 
for local requirements, and PCI hardware may or may not include the 
necessary ROM-based drivers in the PCI hardware non-volatile storage. 
(The intent of this Intel platform-level effort is to move the host 
software drivers out onto the specific PCI hardware, and to permit the 
same byte code to operate regardless of the particular host platform.) 
At least the initial releases of OpenVMS I64 will <em>not</em> have 
support for the byte code interpreter nor for arbitrary PCI or system 
hardware, but will have support for ACPI-based system identification 
and system configuration.

<a name="alpha8"><h2>14.4.1 on the Alpha Multia?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1160"></a>

<p>
Yes, there are a set of unsupported images that permit specific OpenVMS 
Alpha versions to bootstrap on the Multia UDB system. These images and 
the associated instructions are available at the OpenVMS Freeware 
website:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/
</ul>

Look in the Freeware V5.0 /multia/ directory.

<p>
Instructions are included IN the kits. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. PLEASE!

<p>
Some of the restrictions involved when running OpenVMS on the Multia 
system include (but may well not be limited to) the following:

<ul>
  <li>The PCMCIA support was completely removed, because the Intel chip 
  on the Multia was not compatable with the Cirrus chip on the Alphabook. 
  <br>This means, of course, that you will not see and cannot use any 
  PCMCIA cards on a Multia. <br>The Multia uses shared interrupts, and as 
  a result, a special ZLXp-E series graphics device driver---one that 
  does not use interrupts---is needed. This driver is provided in the kit.
  <li>The serial lines don't work.
  <li>If you have a Multia with a PCI slot, you can't use any PCI card 
  that requires interrupts.
  <li>The SRM console on this system is very old and very fragile. (This 
  SRM console was designed only and strictly for diagnostic use, and was 
  not particularly tested or used with OpenVMS.)
  <li>If things don't work for you, don't expect to see any OpenVMS 
  updates, nor SRM console updates, nor any support.
  <li>Do not expect to see any new versions of OpenVMS on the Multia nor 
  on any other unsupported systems. If such new versions do appear and do 
  work, please consider it as a pleasant surprise.
</ul>

<p>
The Multia images are not included on the OpenVMS Freeware V4.0 CD-ROM 
kit, the kit that was distributed with OpenVMS V7.2. (These images 
became available after Freeware V4.0 shipped.)

<a name="alphapc"><h2>14.4.2 on AlphaPC 164LX? AlphaPC 164SX?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1161"></a>
<a name="index_x_1162"></a>
<a name="index_x_1163"></a>
<a name="index_x_1164"></a>

<p>
OpenVMS Alpha is not supported on the AlphaPC 164LX and 164SX series, 
though there are folks that have gotten certain of the LX series to 
load SRM and bootstrap OpenVMS. (The Aspen Durango II variant, 
specifically.)

<p>
One problem has been generally reported: ATA (IDE) bootstraps will 
fail; SCSI storage and a SCSI CD-ROM device is required.

<a name="alpha13"><h3>14.4.2.1 on the NoName AXPpci33 system?</h3></a>

<p>
Information on bootstrapping OpenVMS (using the Multia files described 
in <a href="vmsfaq_018.html#alpha8">Section 14.4.1</a>) on the (unsupported) NoName AXPpci33 module is 
available at:

<ul>
  <li> http://www.jyu.fi/~kujala/vms-in-axppci33.txt
</ul>

Tips for using the Multia files with the AXPpci33:

<ul>
  <li>You have to use the Multia kit and follow the directions in ALPHA8, 
  but do *not* load the Multia SRM firmware into the AXPpci33. Rather, 
  download and use the latest firmware for the AXPpci33 from the HP Alpha 
  firmware website instead.
  <li>64 MB memory is generally necessary.
  <li>you cannot use any PCI cards, and if you plan on networking, you 
  need to find an ISA Ethernet card supported by OpenVMS.
  <li>When the AXPpci33 board bootstraps, it will dump some stuff like a 
  crash dump, but it will continue and---so far---this hasn't caused any 
  particular hassles.
  <li>The system shutdown and reboot procedures do not work properly.
  <li>The serial console is reported to not work, though the serial ports 
  apparently do work. The status of the parallel port is unknown.
  <li>Rumour has it that you have one of the AXPpci33 motherboards with 
  the PS/2 mouse and keyboard connectors and a VGA card (one that will 
  work under DECwindows) and you can run DECwindows on the system.
</ul>

<a name="alpha15"><h2>14.4.3 on the Alpha XL series?</h2></a>

<p>
No.

<p>
OpenVMS Engineering does not formally support the Alpha XL series, nor 
will OpenVMS (informally) bootstrap on the Alpha XL series.

<p>
OpenVMS can not, will not, and does not bootstrap on the Alpha XL 
series. The Alpha XL series was targeted for use (only) with the 
Microsoft Windows NT operating system. 

<p>
The Alpha XL platform does not resemble other supported platforms.

<a name="alpha22"><h2>14.4.4 OpenVMS on the Personal Workstation -a and -au series?</h2></a>

<p>
Though OpenVMS is not supported on the Personal Workstation -a series 
platforms, OpenVMS might or might not bootstrap on the platform.

<p>
If you wish to attempt this, you must ensure that all graphics and all 
I/O controllers in the system are supported by OpenVMS. You must also 
ensure that you have the most current firmware loaded.

<a name="alpha22a"><h3>14.4.4.1 OpenVMS on the Whitebox Windows-Only series Alpha?</h3></a>

<p>
Though OpenVMS is not supported on the &quot;Whitebox&quot; series of 
Alpha platforms, OpenVMS might or might not bootstrap on the platform. 
These systems were specifically configured, targeted and supported only 
for use with the Microsoft Windows NT operating system.

<p>
On some of the &quot;Whitebox&quot; systems, the following sequence of 
console commands can potentially be used to convert the system over to 
unsupported use by and for OpenVMS Hobbyist users. (But please note 
that if you wish to attempt this, you must ensure that all graphics and 
all I/O controllers in the system are supported by OpenVMS, and you 
must ensure that you have the most current SRM firmware loaded. (For 
information on locating and downloading the most current Alpha SRM 
firmware, please see <a href="vmsfaq_017.html#alpha6">Section 14.3.7.1</a>.) And you must realize that the 
resulting Whitebox configuration will be entirely unsupported and may 
or may not be stable and useful.)

command within the editor.

<p>
The above sequence was reportedly tested on the DIGITAL Server 3300 
series, a relative of the AlphaServer 800 series. The DIGITAL Server 
3300 is not supported by OpenVMS, though the AlphaServer 800 series is 
a supported platform. The sequence may or may not work on other 
platforms, and may or may not work on the DIGITAL Server 3300 platform.

<p>
OpenVMS will boot and is supported on the Personal Workstation -au

<a name="index_x_1181"></a>
<a name="index_x_1182"></a>
Intel Saturn I/O (SIO) IDE chip is present in the configuration--- only 
the Cypress IDE controller chip is supported by OpenVMS for IDE 
bootstraps.

<p>
If you have an -au series system, you can determine which IDE chip you 
have using the SRM console command:

</font>
</table>

<p>
If you see &quot;Cypress PCI Peripheral Controller&quot;, you can 
bootstrap OpenVMS from IDE storage. If you see &quot;Intel SIO 
82378&quot;, you will need to use and bootstrap from SCSI.

<a name="index_x_1184"></a>
<a name="index_x_1185"></a>
<a name="index_x_1186"></a>
<a name="index_x_1187"></a>
<a name="index_x_1188"></a>
<a name="index_x_1189"></a>
(A procedure to load DQDRIVER on the Intel SIO---once the system has 
bootstrapped from a SCSI device---is expected to be included as part of 
the contents of the DQDRIVER directory on Freeware V5.0 and later.)

<p>
Many of the -a series systems will include the Intel SIO, and thus 
cannot bootstrap from IDE.

<a name="itan1"><h2>14.4.5 On the Intel Itanium IA-64 platform?</h2></a>

<p>
OpenVMS is being ported to the Intel IA-64 architecture; to HP systems 
based on the Intel Itanium Processor Family.

<p>
The first release of OpenVMS I64 is V8.0, with the first general 
release of OpenVMS I64 expected to be V8.2.

<p>
Some Intel and HP terminology: Itanium Processor Family is the name of 
the current implementation; of the current Intel microprocessor family 
implementing the IA-64 architecture. IA-64 is the name of the Intel and 
HP architecture implementing the VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) 
design known as EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing). I64 
is the name of a family of HP computer systems using Intel Itanium 
processors.

<a name="alpha9"><h1><font color=maroon>14.5 What is the least expensive system that will run OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>

<p>
The cheapest systems that are or have been recently offered by HP that 
will run OpenVMS Alpha are the AlphaServer DS10 server, the 
AlphaStation XP900 workstation, the AlphaStation VS10 workstation, and 
the AlphaStation XP1000 workstation. Other companies sell Alpha-powered 
systems and Alpha motherboards, some of which will run (and can be 
purchased with) OpenVMS---see the OpenVMS Software Product Description 
(SPD) for details on the supported systems and configurations. There 
are also many used AlphaStation, AlphaServer, and DEC 3000 models 
available which are quite suitable. For more experienced OpenVMS system 
managers, the (unsupported) Multia can bootstrap OpenVMS---see 
<a href="vmsfaq_018.html#alpha8">Section 14.4.1</a> for details.

<p>
Depending on the OpenVMS version and configuration, the OpenVMS 
Software Product Description (SPD) is available at:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.openvms.compaq.com/doc/
  <li>http://www.openvms.compaq.com/commercial/
</ul>

<p>
When purchasing a system, ensure that the system itself is supported, 
that the system disk drive is supported or closely compatible, that the 
CD-ROM drive is supported or is closely compatable and that (in the 
case of SCSI devices) it also specifically supports 512 byte block
<a name="index_x_1199"></a>
<a name="index_x_1200"></a>
<a name="index_x_1201"></a>
transfers; no equivalent requirement exists for IDE devices. Also 
particularly ensure that the video controller is supported. Use of 
supported HP hardware will generally reduce the level of integration 
effort involved.

<p>
A CD-ROM, CD-R or DVD drive is required for OpenVMS Alpha installations.

<a name="alpha16"><h1><font color=maroon>14.7 Describe Alpha instruction emulation and instruction subsets?</font></h1></a>

<p>
The Alpha architecture is upward- and downward-compatible, and newer 
instructions are emulated on older platforms, for those cases where the 
compiler is explicitly requested to generate the newer Alpha 
instructions.

<p>
In particular, OpenVMS Alpha V7.1 and later include the instruction 
emulation capabilities necessary for the execution of newer Alpha 
instructions on older Alpha microprocessors. (Instruction emulation 
capabilities are available for user-mode application code, and are not 
available to device drivers or other similar kernel-mode code.)

<p>
Alpha instructions are available in groups (or subsets). Obviously, 
there is the base instruction set that is available on all Alpha 
microprocessors. Then, the following are the current instruction 
extension groups (or subsets) that are available on some of various 
recent Alpha microprocessors:

<ul>
  <li>byte/word extension (BWX):
<br>
LDBU, LDWU, SEXTB, SEXTW, STB, and STW.
  <li>floating-point and square root extension (FIX):
<br>
FTOIS, FTOIT, ITOFF, ITOFS, ITOFT, SQRTF, SQRTG, SQRTS, and SQRTT.
  <li>count extension (CIX):
<br>
CTLZ, CTPOP, and CTTZ.
  <li>multi-media extension (MVI):
<br>
MAXSB8, MAXSW4, MAXUB8, MAXUW4, MINSB8, MINSW4, MINUB8, MINUW4, PERR, 
PKLB, PKWB, UNPKBL, and UNPKBW.
</ul>

<p>
The typical instruction subset that provides the biggest win---and of 
course, your mileage may vary---is typically the instruction set that 
is provided by the EV56 and later; specifically, the byte-word 
instruction subset. To select this subset, use the following:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
/ARCHITECTURE=EV56/OPTIMIZE=TUNE=GENERIC 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The /ARCHITECTURE controls the maximum instruction subset that the 
compiler will generally use, while the /OPTIMIZE=TUNE controls both the 
instruction-level scheduling and also the instructions generated inside 
loops---any code resulting from /OPTIMIZE=TUNE that is specific to an 
instruction subset will be generated only inside loops and will also be 
&quot;protected&quot; by an AMASK-based test that permits the execution
<a name="index_x_1203"></a>
  of the proper code for the particular current Alpha microprocessor.

<p>
Typically /OPTIMIZE=TUNE=GENERIC is the appropriate choice for tuning, 
and the /ARCHITECTURE selects the minimum target architecture for 
general use throughout the generated code.

<p>
generated for later architectures and instruction subsets will run on 
older Alpha systems due to the emulation, but if /ARCHITECTURE is a 
significant benefit, then the emulation might be a performance penalty.

<p>
Please see the OpenVMS Ask The Wizard area for the source code of a 
(non-privileged) tool that looks at the instruction subsets available 
on the particular Alpha microprocessor that the tool is run on. This 
tool demonstrates the use of the Alpha AMASK and IMPLVER instructions.

<a name="alpha17"><h1><font color=maroon>14.8 What is the Accuracy of the Alpha Time of Year (BB_WATCH) Clock?</font></h1></a>

<p>
The specification for maximum clock drift in the Alpha hardware clock 
is 50 parts per million (ppm), that is less than &plusmn;0.000050 
seconds of drift per second, less than &plusmn;0.000050 days of drift 
per day, or less than &plusmn;0.000050 years of drift per year, etc. 
(eg: An error of one second over a day-long interval is roughly 11ppm, 
or 1000000/(24*60*60).) Put another way, this is .005%, which is around 
130 seconds per month or 26 minutes per year.

<p>
The software-maintained system time can drift more than this, primarily 
due to other system activity. Typical causes of drift include extensive 
high-IPL code (soft memory errors, heavy activity at device IPLs, etc) 
that are causing the processing of the clock interrupts to be blocked.

<a name="alpha19"><h1><font color=maroon>14.10 What is byte swizzling?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1206"></a>

<p>
&quot;Swizzling&quot; is the term used to describe the operation needed 
to do partial longword (i.e. byte or word) accesses to I/O space on 
those systems that don't support it directly. It involved shifting the 
offset into an address space by 5 (or 7 for one older system), and 
ORing this into the base address. It then required the size of the 
operation to be ORed into the low order bits.

<p>
That is, because the EV4 and EV5 CPUs did not bring bits 0 and 1 off 
the chip, to do programmed I/O for bytes/words, the information on the 
size/offset of the transfer was encoded into the address data. The data 
itself then had to be shifted into the correct &quot;byte lane&quot; 
(i.e. its actual position within a longword).

<p>
The EV56 CPU supports the byte/word instructions however only some EV56 
systems support byte/word accesses to I/O space. Even on an EV56 system 
that supports byte/word accesses to I/O space, the relevant OpenVMS 
routines do not support byte/word access to I/O space.

<p>
EV6 systems (with the exception of the AlphaServer GS60 and AlphaServer 
GS140 series, for reasons of platform compatability) support a flat, 
byte addressable I/O space.

<p>
If a device driver uses CRAM or IOC$WRITE_IO/IOC$READ_IO, then OpenVMS 
will do the right thing without changing the driver - OpenVMS will 
swizzle and unswizzle as needed.

<p>
To use byte/word operations on MEMORY, you need to tell the compiler to 
use the EV56 or EV6 architecture (/ARCHITECTURE=EV56). Memory 
operations did not swizzle, but the compiler would do long/quad access, 
and extract/insert bytes as needed. Using /ARCHITECTURE=EV56 allows 
smaller, more efficient byte/word access logic to memory.

<p>
If the application is directly doing I/O space access across a range of 
Alpha systems (like the graphics servers), then the driver will need to 
know how to do swizzling for old platforms, and byte access for new 
platforms.
