<a name="mgmt20"><h2>5.41.4 How do I fix a corrupt BACKUP saveset?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_456"></a>

<p>
BACKUP savesets can be corrupted by FTP file transfers and by tools 
such as zip (particularly when the zip tool has not been asked to save 
and restore OpenVMS file attributes or when it does not support OpenVMS 
file attributes), as well as via other means of corruptions.

<p>
If you have problems with the BACKUP savesets after unzipping them or 
after an FTP file transfer, you can try restoring the appropriate 
saveset attributes using the tool:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @RESET_BACKUP_SAVESET_FILE_ATTRIBUTES.COM 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This tool is available on the OpenVMS Freeware (in the [000TOOLS] 
directory). The Freeware is available at various sites---see the 
Freeware location listings elsewhere in the FAQ---and other similar 
tools are also available from various sources.

<p>
In various cases, a SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES command can also be used. As 
the parameters of this command must be varied as the target BACKUP 
saveset attributes vary, this approach is not recommended.

<p>
Also see the "SITE VMS", /FDL, and various other file-attributes 
options available in various FTP tools. (Not all available FTP tools 
support any or all of these options.)

<p>
Browser downloads (via FTP) and incorrect (binary or ascii FTP transfer 
modes) are notorious for causing RMS file corruptions and particularly 
BACKUP saveset corruptions. You can sometimes help encourage the 
browser to select the correct FTP transfer type code (via RFC1738):

<ul>
  <li>ftp://host/urlname.ext;type=i ! request ftp image/binary transfer
  <li>ftp://host/urlname.ext;type=a ! request ftp ascii/text transfer
</ul>

<p>
You can also often configure the particular web browser to choose the 
appropriate transfer mode by default, based on the particular file 
extensions, using a customization menu available in most web browsers. 
You can select that the specific file extentions involved use the FTP 
binary transfer mode, which will reduce the number of corruptions seen.

<a name="mgmt12"><h2>5.41.5 How do I write a BACKUP saveset to a remote tape?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_457"></a>

<p>
How to do this correctly was described at DECUS long ago. On the 
OpenVMS host with the tape drive, create the following SAVE-SET.FDL 
file:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
RECORD 
        FORMAT                  fixed 
        SIZE                    8192 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Then create BACKUP_SERVER.COM:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ ! 
$ ! BACKUP_SERVER.COM - provide remote tape service for BACKUP. 
$ ! 
$ set noon 
$ set rms/network=16 
$ allocate mka500 tapedev 
$ mount/nounload/over:id/block=8192/assist tapedev 
$ convert/fdl=SAVE-SET sys$net tapedev:save-set. 
$ dismount/unload tapedev 
$ stop/id=0 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
On the node where you want to do the backup, use the DCL command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ backup - 
    srcfilespec - 
    node"user pwd"::"task=backup_server"/block=8192/save 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
One area which does not function here is the volume switch; multi-reel 
or multi-cartridge savesets. Since the tape is being written through 
DECnet and RMS and the magtape ACP, BACKUP won't see the media switch 
and will split an XOR group across the reel boundary. BACKUP might well 
be willing to read such a multi-reel or multi-cartridge saveset 
(directly, not over the net) as the XOR blocks are effectively ignored 
until and unless needed for error recovery operations. BACKUP likely 
will not be able to perform an XOR-based recovery across reel or 
cartridge boundaries.

<p>
Unfortunately BACKUP can't read tapes over the network because the RMS 
file attributes on a network task access look wrong; the attributes 
reported include variable length records.

<a name="mgmterase"><h2>5.41.6 How to perform a security disk erasure?</h2></a>

<p>
Sometimes refered to as disk, tape, or media declassification, as 
formatting, as pattern erasure, or occasionally by the generic 
reference of data remanence. While initially easy, characteristics of 
the media and of the device error recovery and bad block handling can 
make this effort far more difficult than it might initially appear.

<p>
Security and sensitivity of the data is central to this discussion, as 
is the value of the storage hardware involved---with data of greater 
value than the disks involved, physical destruction of the platters may 
be the most expedient, economical, and appropriate approach.

<p>
Other potential options include the Freeware RZDISK package, the 
OpenVMS INITIALIZE/ERASE command (and potentially in conjunction with 
the $erapat system service)

<a name="mgmt63"><h3>5.41.7.1 Volume Shadowing MiniCopy vs MiniMerge?</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_465"></a>

<p>
MiniMerge support has been available for many years with OpenVMS 
host-based volume shadowing, so long as you had MSCP controllers (eg: 
HSC, HSJ, or HSD) which supported the Volume Shadowing Assist known as 
&quot;Write History Logging&quot;.
<a name="index_x_466"></a>
<a name="index_x_467"></a>
<a name="index_x_468"></a>
<a name="index_x_469"></a>
<a name="index_x_470"></a>

<p>
If you are interested in minimerge and similar technologies, please see 
the Fibre Channel webpage and the information available there:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.openvms.compaq.com/openvms/fibre/
</ul>

<p>
Minimerge support was originally expected with HSG80 series storage
<a name="index_x_471"></a>
<a name="index_x_472"></a>
controllers and was expected to require ACS 8.7 and OpenVMS Alpha 
V7.3-1. These plans, the original design, and the implementation that 
was under development have been revisited, and it is expected that a 
future OpenVMS release will implement minimerge using the existing 
storage bitmaps technologies; using a different, new and 
controller-independent design.

<p>
Updated information and the current progress of the development work on 
minimerge is not available as of this writing.

<p>
The following sections describe both MiniCopy and MiniMerge, and can 
provide a basis for discussions.

<a name="mgmt63_mc"><h4>5.41.7.1.1 MiniCopy?</h4></a>

<p>
A Shadowing Full Copy occurs when you add a disk to an existing 
shadowset using a MOUNT command; the entire contents of the disk are 
effectively copied to the new member (using an algorithm that goes 
through in 127-block increments and reads one member, compares with the 
target disk, and if the data differs, writes the data to the target 
disk and loops back to the read step, until the data is equal for that 
127-block section). (This is one of the reasons why the traditional 
recommendation for adding new volumes to a shadowset was to use a 
BACKUP/PHYSICAL copy of an existing shadowset volume, simply because 
the reads then usually matched and thus shadowing usually avoided the 
need for the writes.)

<p>
If you warn OpenVMS ahead of time (at dismount time) that you're 
planning to remove a disk from a shadowset but re-add it later, OpenVMS 
will keep a bitmap tracking what areas of the disk have been modified 
while the disk was out of the shadowset, and when you re-add it later 
with a MOUNT command OpenVMS only has to update the areas of the 
returned disk that the bit-map indicates are now out-of-date. OpenVMS 
does this with a read source / write target algorithm, which is much 
faster than the shenanigans the Full Copy does, so even if all of the 
disk has changed, a MiniCopy is faster than a Full Copy.
<a name="index_x_473"></a>

<a name="mgmt63_mm"><h4>5.41.7.1.2 MiniMerge?</h4></a>

<p>
A Shadowing Merge is initiated when an OpenVMS node in the cluster 
(which had a shadowset mounted) crashes or otherwise leaves 
unexpectedly, without dismounting the shadowset first. In this case, 
OpenVMS must ensure that the data is identical, since Shadowing 
guarantees that the data on the disks in a shadowset will be identical. 
In a regular Merge operation, Shadowing uses an algorithm similar to 
the Full Copy algorithm (except that it can choose either of the 
members' contents as the source data, since both are considered equally 
valid), and scans the entire disk. Also, to make things worse, for any 
read operations in the area ahead of what has been merged, Shadowing 
will first merge the area containing the read data, then allow the read 
to occur.

<p>
A Merge can be very time-consuming and very I/O intensive, so some 
controllers have Shadowing Assists to make it faster. If the 
controllers support Write History Logging, the controllers record the 
areas (LBNs) that are the subject of Shadowing writes, and if a node 
crashes, the surviving nodes can query the controllers to find out what 
exact areas of the disk the departed node was writing to just before 
the crash, and thus Shadowing only needs to merge just those few areas, 
so this tends to take seconds as opposed to hours for a regular Merge.

<a name="mail7"><h1><font color=maroon>6.1 MAIL keeps saying I have new messages, but I don't.  What do I do?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_475"></a>
<a name="index_x_476"></a>
<a name="index_x_477"></a>
<a name="index_x_478"></a>

<p>
if you see the <em>%MAIL-W-NONEWMAIL, no new messages</em> error 
reported when MAIL indicates you have messages, then the NEWMAIL count 
has become skewed from reality.

<p>
The count of new mail messages is kept separately from your mail 
folder, and is stored in VMSMAIL_PROFILE.DATA. It sometimes happens 
that this count differs from what is stored in your mail folder. If 
this arises, invoke MAIL and repeatedly enter the READ/NEW command (or 
press the keypad hyphen key on an LK-compatible keyboard) until you see 
no new mail messages. Then enter the command one more time. This will 
resynchronize the counters.

<p>
If you are operating in a cluster and find your mail counts 
inconsistent across cluster members, your customer is likely missing a 
definition of the VMSMAIL_PROFILE logical name---and is probably also 
missing definitions of other logical names associated with other shared 
files---or has one or more inconsistent definitions of this and likely 
of other logical names.

<p>
For details on the configuration data files that must be shared within 
a cluster, please see SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGICALS.TEMPLATE on V7.2 and later.

<a name="mail9"><h1><font color=maroon>6.2 How do I send or read attachments in VMS MAIL?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_480"></a>

<p>
Is there any way to send or read mail with files as attachments from 
VMS?

<p>
Not directly with the OpenVMS MAIL facility, but there are several 
other options:

<ul>
  <li>Install PINE, available commercially from Innosoft or free from 
  Andy Harper. With PINE you can both send and receive MIME messages, if 
  you have the appropriate viewers available.

  <ul>
    <li>http://www.process.com/
    <li>http://www.agh.cc.kcl.ac.uk/files/vms/pine-vms/
    <li>ftp://ftp2.kcl.ac.uk/pub/vms/pine-vms/
  </ul>
  <li>If you are working from an X11 server, use the OpenVMS version of 
  Netscape Navigator or Mozilla. The mail download protocol chosen to 
  access the mail server from the Navigator or Mozilla mail client can be 
  POP or IMAP, with the former causing messages to be downloaded while 
  the latter permits messages to be retained on the mail server. Most 
  folks prefer IMAP for this reason.
  <li>MPACK/MUNPACK. To send a MIME mail, construct the message with 
  attachments manually using MPACK. You cannot send the resulting file 
  directly through MAIL because an extra blank header line will be 
  inserted between your message and the OpenVMS MAIL headers, which will 
  cause the message to appear as plain text in most mail programs. Some 
  TCP/IP stacks provide a work around for this problem, and if that 
  doesn't work, you should generally be able to force the message 
  directly into the SMTP port of your mail machine. Examples of both 
  methods are in:

  <ul>
    <li>http://seqaxp.bio.caltech.edu/pub/SOFTWARE/mmail.com
  </ul>
    <br>To read a MIME mail message, open it in MAIL, extract it to a file, 
    then use MUNPACK to break out and decode the attachments. 
    <br>MPACK/MUNPACK tools are also available on OpenVMS Freeware V5.0.
  <li>With OpenVMS V7.2 and later, use the MIME tool supplied with 
  OpenVMS.
</ul>

<a name="mail10"><h1><font color=maroon>6.3 How can I block SMTP mail relay spam?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_481"></a>

<p>
Use the anti-spam capabilities present in the TCP/IP Services V5.1 and 
later SMTP servers.

<p>
Use a firewall.

<p>
On earlier TCP/IP Services releases, some simple DCL can reportedly 
prevent relay SMTP spam. Use the UCX command SHOW SERVICE SMTP/FULL to 
find the directory containing the UCX$SMTP_RECV_STARTUP.COM file, and 
insert the following DCL:

%OTS-F-INDATCOR internal data corrupted in Run-time Library 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This error can arise with Fortran programs if you are running a recent 
version of OpenVMS Alpha, and are using DECmigrate to translate Fortran 
applications. The DECmigrate Run-Time Library
<a name="index_x_518"></a>
attempts to support mixed translated-native I/O to the same unit by 
sharing the native Fortran RTL's internal data structures, and in 
OpenVMS 7.2 these structures changed and the translated RTL was not 
updated accordingly.

<p>
You can copy DEC$FORRTL.EXE from OpenVMS 7.1, copying it to some spare 
directory, and then defining the logical name DEC$FORRTL to point to it 
before running your translated application. Or rebuilding the 
application to use the available native Fortran compiler. Or you can 
apply the current Fortran RTL kit, which has a fix for this.

<a name="index_x_519"></a>

<p>
Most (all?) IBM EBCDIC-based systems can read and write ANSI-labeled 
ASCII magtapes. Fixed-length records (MOUNT /FOREIGN /BLOCKSIZE=512 
/RECORDSIZE=512, for one-block records) and the DCL COPY command can be 
used to transfer fixed-record-size text files out onto tape media, or 
to read from fixed-record tape media. Please consult the IBM 
documentation for the details and command syntax needed when reading 
and writing ANSI media using IBM JCL
<a name="index_x_520"></a>
 or other applicable IBM command language.

<a name="index_x_525"></a>
<a name="index_x_526"></a>
<a name="index_x_527"></a>

<p>
There exists various freeware around (TAPECOPY, ETAPE, TCOPY, MTEXCH) 
that can read and write EBCDIC tapes. Visit the Encompasserve (DECUS) 
website software archives search engine (via http://www.decus.org/), 
and search for &quot;EBCDIC&quot; for details.

<p>
OpenVMS does not include an integrated tool for EBCDIC tape processing, 
but does provide a character conversion API useful within application 
programs.

<p>
One source for ETAPE is:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.ualr.edu/ftp/vms/ETAPE_SRC/
</ul>

<p>
The OpenVMS Freeware V5.0 distribution included this ETAPE tool, as 
well.

<p>
Using the OpenVMS Freeware tool ZAP:
<a name="index_x_529"></a>
<a name="index_x_530"></a>

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/, look for the Freeware V5.0 
  directory /rms_tools/.
</ul>

<p>
tell ZAP to read a block (bucket) of information based on the virtual 
block number (VBN), using X for hexadecimal. Dump yourself into the 
OpenVMS debugger with R2 pointing into the buffer, EXAMINE/INSTRUCTION 
as needed, alter the buffer as required, GO to get out of the debugger 
and back into ZAP, and use the ZAP W command to write the updated block.
