<a name="alpha_details"><h3>4.2.1.2 Alpha hardware time-keeping details...</h3></a>

<a name="bb_watch"><h4>4.2.1.2.1 Battery-Backed Watch (BB_WATCH) Chip</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_193"></a>
This is battery backed up hardware timing circuitry used to keep the 
correct time of year during rebooting, power failures, and system 
shutdown. This clock keeps track of date and time in 24 hour binary 
format.

<a name="alpha_systime"><h4>4.2.1.2.2 EXE$GQ_SYSTIME</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_194"></a>
This is the OpenVMS Alpha system time cell. This cell contains the 
number of 100ns intervals since November 17, 1858 00:00:00.00. This 
cell is incremented by 100000 every 10ms by an hardware interval timer.

<a name="hwclock"><h4>4.2.1.2.3 EXE$GQ_SAVED_HWCLOCK</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_195"></a>
This cell is used by OpenVMS Alpha to keep track of the last time and 
date that EXE$GQ_SYSTIME was adjusted. It keeps the same time format as 
EXE$GQ_SYSTIME. The value in this cell gets updated in memory and on 
disk, every time EXE$GQ_SYSTIME gets adjusted.

<ul>
  <li>The system parameters SETTIME and TIMEPROMPTWAIT determine how the 
  system time will be set.
  <li>If SETTIME = 0 then EXE$INIT_HWCLOCK reads the hardware clock to 
  set the system time.

  <ul>
    <li>IF TIMEPROMPTWAIT &gt; 0
<br>
THEN the value of TIMEPROMPTWAIT determines how long the user is 
prompted to enter the time and date. If time expires and no time has 
been entered the system acts as if TIMEPROMPTWAIT = 0.
    <li>IF TIMEPROMPTWAIT = 0
<br>
THEN the system time is calculated from the contents of 
EXE$GQ_SAVED_HWCLOCK + 1.
    <li>IF TIMEPROMPTWAIT &lt; 0
<br>
THEN the user is prompted for the time and date and unable to continue 
until the information is entered.
  </ul>
</ul>

Unlike the VAX, the Alpha hardware clock tracks the full date and time, 
not just the time of year. This means it is possible to boot from the 
CD-ROM media without entering the time at the CD-ROM bootstrap. (This 
provided that the time and date have been initialized, of course.)

<p>
IA-64 (Itanium) hardware time-keeping details to be added...

<a name="time9"><h3>4.2.1.3 Why does VAX need a SET TIME at least once a year?</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_196"></a>

<p>
Because the VAX Time Of Year (TOY) has a resolution of 497 days, the 
VAX system time is stored using both the TOY and the OpenVMS VAX system 
image SYS.EXE. Because of the use of the combination of the TOY and 
SYS.EXE, you need to issue a SET TIME command (with no parameters) at 
least once between January 1st and about April 11th of each year, and 
whenever you change system images (due to booting another OpenVMS VAX 
system, booting the standalone BACKUP image, an ECO that replaces 
SYS.EXE, etc).

<p>
The SET TIME command is automatically issued during various standard 
OpenVMS procedures such as SHUTDOWN, and it can also obviously be 
issued directly by a suitably privileged user. Issuing the SET TIME 
command resets the value stored in the TOY, and (if necessary) also 
updates the portion of the time (the current year) saved in the SYS.EXE 
system image.

<p>
This VAX TOY limit is the reason why OpenVMS VAX installation kits and 
standalone BACKUP explicitly prompt for the time during bootstrap, and 
why the time value can "get weird" if the system crashes outside the 
497 day window (if no SET TIME was issued to update the saved values), 
and why the time value can "get weird" if a different 
SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.EXE is used (alternate system disk, standalone BACKUP, 
etc).

<a name="time2"><h2>4.2.2 How does OpenVMS VAX maintain system time?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_197"></a>

<p>
VAX systems maintain an interval clock, and a hardware clock.

<p>
The VAX hardware clock is called the TOY ("Time Of Year") clock. The 
register associated with the clock is called the TODR ("Time Of Day 
Register").
<a name="index_x_198"></a>
<a name="index_x_199"></a>
<a name="index_x_200"></a>
<a name="index_x_201"></a>
<a name="index_x_202"></a>
<a name="index_x_203"></a>

<p>
The TOY clock---as used---stores time relative to January first of the 
current year, starting at at 00:00:00.00. It is a 100 Hz, 32-bit 
counter, incremented every 10ms, and thus has a capacity of circa 497 
days.

<p>
OpenVMS (on the VAX platform) stores system date information---and in 
particular, the current year---in the system image, SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.EXE.

<p>
The TOY is used, in conjunction with the base date that is stored and 
retrieved from the system image, to initialize the interval clock value 
that is stored in EXE$GQ_SYSTIME.

<p>
Once the interval clock is loaded, the system does not typically 
reference the TOY again, unless a SET TIME (with no parameters) is 
issued. The interval clock value is updated by a periodic IPL22 or 
IPL24 (depending on the specific implementation) interrupt. (When these 
interrupts are blocked as a result of the activity of higher-IPL 
code---such as extensive driver interrupt activity or a hardware error 
or a correctable (soft) memory error---the clock will &quot;loose&quot; 
time, and the time value reported to the user with appear to have 
slowed down.)

<p>
On most (all?) VAX systems, the battery that is associated with the TOY 
clock can be disconnected and replaced if (when) it fails---TOY clock 
failures are quite commonly caused by a failed nickel-cadmium (NiCd) or 
lithium battery, or by a failed Dallas chip.

<a name="time6"><h1><font color=maroon>4.3 Keeping the OpenVMS system time synchronized?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_204"></a>

<p>
To help keep more accurate system time or to keep your system clocks 
synchronized, TCP/IP Services NTP, DECnet-Plus DECdtss, DCE DTSS, and 
other techniques are commonly used. If you do not have IP access to a 
time-base, then you could use dial-up access to NIST or other 
authoritative site.
<a name="index_x_205"></a>
<a name="index_x_206"></a>

<p>
There exists code around that processes the digital (ie: binary) format 
time that is available via a modem call into the NIST clock (the 
Automated Computer Telephone Service (ACTS)), and code that
<a name="index_x_207"></a>
<a name="index_x_208"></a>
<a name="index_x_209"></a>
grabs the time off a GPS receiver digital link, or a receiver 
(effectively a radio and a codec) that processes the time signals from 
radio station WWV, WWVH, WWVB, or similar. (Processing these time 
protocols often involves little more than reading from an EIA232 
(RS232) serial line from the receiver, something that is possible from 
most any language as well as directly from DCL.)

<p>
One example of acquring a time-base involves the IRIG time format
<a name="index_x_210"></a>
<a name="index_x_211"></a>
(IRIG-A, -B, -G), a binary signal containing the current time in hours, 
minutes, seconds and days since the start of the current year. IRIG can 
also contain the time of day as the number of seconds since midnight. 
HP Custom Systems and third-party vendors offer various IRIG-based 
reader/generator modules for OpenVMS systems.

<p>
Differing time servers (DECnet-Plus DTSS, DCE DTSS, NTP, etc) do not
<a name="index_x_212"></a>
<a name="index_x_213"></a>
<a name="index_x_214"></a>
<a name="index_x_215"></a>
coexist particularly well, particularly if you try to use all these 
together on the same node. Please pick and use just one. (If needed, 
you can sometimes configure one package to acquire its timebase from 
another protocol, but one and only one time server package should have 
direct control over the management of and drifting of the local OpenVMS 
system time. In the specific case of DECnet-Plus DTSS, older product 
versions and versions V7.3 and later provide a provider module, a 
module which permits DTSS to acquire its time from NTP. For details on 
this, please see the comments in the module DTSS$NTP_PROVIDER.C.)

<a name="time3"><h2>4.3.1 Why does my OpenVMS system time drift?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_217"></a>

<p>
Memory errors, hardware problems, or most anything operating at or 
above IPL 22 or IPL 24 (clock IPL is system family dependent; code 
executing at or above the clock IPL will block the processing of clock 
interrupts), can cause the loss of system time. Clock drift can also be 
caused by normal (thermal) clock variations and even by the expected 
level of clock drift.
<a name="index_x_218"></a>
<a name="index_x_219"></a>

<p>
When clock interrupts are blocked as a result of the activity of 
high-IPL code---such as extensive driver interrupt activity or a 
hardware error or a correctable (soft) memory error---the clock will 
&quot;loose&quot; time, and the time value reported to the user with 
appear to have slowed down. Correctable memory errors can be a common 
cause of system time loss, in other words. Heavy PCI bus traffic can 
also cause lost time.

<p>
One bug in this area involved the behaviour of certain graphics 
controllers including the ELSA GLoria Synergy PBXGK-BB; the PowerStorm 
3D10T effectively stalling the PCI bus. See <a href="vmsfaq_007.html#mgmt24">Section 5.15</a> for details on 
the ELSA GLoria Synergy controller, and make certain you have the 
current GRAPHICS ECO kit installed.

<p>
Clock drift can also be (deliberately) caused by the activity of the 
DTSS or NTP packages.

<p>
Also see <a href="vmsfaq_018.html#alpha17">Section 14.8</a>, <a href="vmsfaq_019.html#vax8">Section 14.15</a>, and <a href="vmsfaq_004.html#time8">Section 4.3.2</a>.

<a name="time8"><h2>4.3.2 How can I drift the OpenVMS system time?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_220"></a>

<p>
With DECdts and TCP/IP Services NTP, the system time value is "drifted" 
(rather than changed), to avoid the obvious problems that would arise 
with "negative time changes". The same basic clock drifting technique 
is used by most (all?) time servers operating on OpenVMS, typically 
using the support for this provided directly within OpenVMS.

<p>
An example of the technique used (on OpenVMS VAX) to drift the system 
time is the SETCLOCK tool on the OpenVMS Freeware.
<a name="index_x_221"></a>
<a name="index_x_222"></a>
<a name="index_x_223"></a>

<p>
For information on the use of the EXE$GL_TIMEADJUST and 
EXE$GL_TICKLENGTH cells on OpenVMS Alpha, see <em>OpenVMS AXP Internal 
and Data Structures</em>, located on page 348.
<a name="index_x_224"></a>
<a name="index_x_225"></a>
<a name="index_x_226"></a>

<p>
For those areas which switch between daylight savings time (DST) and 
standard time, the time value is <em>not</em> drifted. The time is 
adjusted by the entire interval. This procedure is inherent in the 
definition of the switch between DST and standard time.

<a name="time7"><h2>4.3.3 How can I configure TCP/IP Services NTP as a time provider?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_227"></a>

<p>
An NTP time provider provides its idea of the current time to NTP 
clients via the NTP protocol. Most systems are NTP clients, but...

<p>
NTP has a heirarchy of layers, called strata. The further away from the 
actual NTP time source (Internet time servers are at stratum 1), the 
lower the strata (and the larger the number assigned the statum).

<p>
NTP explicity configured at stratum one provides time to NTP operating 
at lower strata, and the provided time is acquired based on the local 
system time or via some locally-accessible external time source.

<p>
NTP at other (lower) strata both receive time from higher strata and 
can provide time to lower strata, and automatically adjust the local 
stratum. The highest stratum is one, and the lowest available stratum 
is fifteen.

<p>
The TCP/IP Services NTP package can operate at any stratum, and can be 
configured as a peer, as a client, or as a broadcast server. NTP can 
also provide time to a DECnet-Plus DTSS network, see <a href="vmsfaq_004.html#time6">Section 4.3</a>.

<p>
With TCP/IP Services V5.0 and later, the only supported reference clock 
is the LCL (local system clock). If your system has an excellent clock 
or if the system time is being controlled by some other time service or 
peripheral (such as DTSS services, GPS services, a cesium clock, a GPIB 
controller or other similar time-related peripheral), you can configure 
NTP to use the system clock as its reference source. This will mimic 
the master-clock functionality, and will configre NTP as a stratum 1 
time server. To do this, enter the following commands in TCPIP$NTP.CONF:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
server 127.127.1.0 prefer 
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 0 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
For local-master functionality, the commands are very similiar. Use:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
server 127.127.1.0 
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 8 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The difference between these two is the stratum, and the omission of 
the prefer keyword. Specifying a higher stratum allows the node to act 
as a backup NTP server, or potentially as the sole time server on an 
isolated network. The server will become active only when all other 
normal synchronization sources are unavailable. The use of "prefer" 
causes NTP to always use the specified clock as the time 
synchronization source.

<p>
With the TCP/IP Services versions prior to V5.0, the NTP management is 
rather more primitive. To configure the local OpenVMS system from an 
NTP client to an NTP server (on TCP/IP Services versions prior to 
V5.0), add the following line to the sys$specific:[ucx$ntp]ucx$ntp.conf 
file:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
master-clock 1 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Also, for TCP/IP Services prior to V5.0, see the NTP template file:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SYS$SPECIFIC:[UCX$NTP]UCX$NTP.TEMPLATE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Note that NTP does <em>not</em> provide for a Daylight Savings Time 
(DST)
<a name="index_x_228"></a>
<a name="index_x_229"></a>
switch-over, that switch must arise from the timezone rules on the 
local system and/or from the SYS$EXAMPLES:DAYLIGHT_SAVINGS procedure.
<a name="index_x_230"></a>
<a name="index_x_231"></a>
(Further, there is a known bug in SYS$EXAMPLES:DAYLIGHT_SAVINGS.COM in 
V7.3, please obtain the available ECO kit.)

<p>

<a name="time4"><h1><font color=maroon>4.4 Managing Timezones, Timekeeping, UTC, and Daylight Savings?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_232"></a>

<p>
You will want to use the command procedure:

<ul>
  <li>SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM
</ul>

<a name="index_x_233"></a>

<p>
to configure the OpenVMS Timezone Differential Factor (TDF) on OpenVMS 
V6.0 and later. Select the BOTH option. This configures the OpenVMS TDF 
settings, though it may or may not configure the TDF and the timezone 
rules needed or used by other software packages. Please do NOT directly 
invoke the following command procedures:

<ul>
  <li>SYS$MANAGER:UTC$CONFIGURE_TDF.COM ! do not directly use
  <li>SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIMEZONE_SETUP.COM ! do not directly use
</ul>

<a name="index_x_234"></a>
<a name="index_x_235"></a>

<p>
TCP/IP Services V5.0 and later use the OpenVMS TDF, UTC, and timezone 
support. Earlier versions use a TDF mechanism and timezone database 
that is internal to the TCP/IP Services package. Also on the earlier 
versions, the TDF must be manually configured within TCP/IP Services, 
in addition to the OpenVMS configuration of the TDF.

<p>
DECnet-Plus in V7.3 and later uses the OpenVMS TDF, UTC, and timezone 
support, and displays its timezone prompts using UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM. 
Earlier versions use a TDF TDF mechanism, timezone database, and 
automatic switch-over that is internal to the DECnet-Plus package. Also 
on earlier versions, the TDF must be configured within the DECnet-Plus 
DECdtss package, in addition to the OpenVMS configuration of the TDF.

<p>
Application code using HP C (formerly Compaq C, formerly DEC C) will 
use the OpenVMS UTC and TDF mechanisms when the C code is compiled on 
OpenVMS V7.0 and later (and when the macro _VMS_V6_SOURCE is NOT 
defined). HP C does NOT use the OpenVMS UTC and TDF mechanisms when the 
C code is
<a name="index_x_236"></a>
<a name="index_x_237"></a>
<a name="index_x_238"></a>
<a name="index_x_239"></a>
compiled on OpenVMS releases prior to V7.0, or when the preprocessor 
declaration _VMS_V6_SOURCE is declared.
<a name="index_x_240"></a>

<p>
DCE DTSS TDF details TDB.

<p>
In OpenVMS Alpha V6.1, V6.2, and V6.2-1Hx, the TDF value is written to 
SYS$BASE_IMAGE.EXE.
<a name="index_x_241"></a>
With OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 and later and with OpenVMS VAX V6.0 and later, 
SYS$SYSTEM:SYS$TIMEZONE.DAT
<a name="index_x_242"></a>
contains the TDF. This means that OpenVMS Alpha systems will need to 
have the TDF value reset manually---usually within 
SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM---on reboots prior to V7.0.

<p>
During OpenVMS Bootstrap, the SYSINIT module reads SYS$TIMEZONE.DAT to 
acquire the TDF for use in the system global cell EXE$GQ_TDF. This is
<a name="index_x_243"></a>
<a name="index_x_244"></a>
done to ensure that the system boots with a valid TDF (a value which 
may be zero). The UTC system services get the TDF from this cell. These 
services, as well as the HP C RTL, must have a valid TDF. (Prior to 
OpenVMS V7.3, if either DECnet-Plus or DECnet/VAX Extensions is 
configured and run, the image DTSS$SET_TIMEZONE.EXE is invoked and can 
override the
<a name="index_x_245"></a>
TDF and timezone rule settings from SYSINIT or from 
UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM---
<a name="index_x_246"></a>
this image runs even if DTSS is disabled. If the settings do not match 
(due to inconsistencies in timezone specification in UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM 
and NET$CONFIGURE.COM), DTSS will reset the values to match its 
definitions.)

<p>
Prior to OpenVMS V7.3, daylight savings time switchover is handled 
automatically only when DCE DTSS or DECnet-Plus DTSS is in use. In 
V7.3, OpenVMS can be configured to automatically switch over to 
daylight savings time, and also generates an event that interested 
applications can use to detect the switch-over between standard time 
and daylight time.

<p>
The manual switchover between daylight savings time and standard time 
is correctly accomplished via the SYS$EXAMPLES:DAYLIGHT_SAVINGS.COM 
command procedure procedure.

<p>
Note: NTP (alone) does <em>NOT</em> provide automatic switch-over.

<p>
Note: The DST switch-over does <em>NOT</em> drift the time value; the 
switch-over applies the entire difference as a unit.

<p>
If you switch the TDF or daylight savings time setting, you will also 
want to restart or reconfigure any time-sensitive applications (those 
not using the time differential factor (TDF) change event available in 
V7.3 and later). Examples of these applications include the need to 
restart the NFS client and (yes) NTP. (NTP will want to try to "drift" 
the time (see <a href="vmsfaq_004.html#time6">Section 4.3</a>), and will find the daylight savings time 
switch-over to be far too large to "drift". Hence the NTP restart.) You 
can also use the (undocumented) TCP/IP Services (prior to V5.0) 
commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SET TIME/DIFF=[positive or negative TDF integer]

</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
to reset the value of the logical name UCX$TDF.
<a name="index_x_247"></a>

<p>

<table border=0>
  <tr>

$ SETTZ :== $SYS$SYSTEM:DTSS$SET_TIMEZONE 
$ SETTZ MODIFY 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
can be used to modify the settings of the SYS$TIMEZONE_DAYLIGHT_SAVING, 
SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL, and SYS$TIMEZONE_NAME system logical names 
based on the SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE.

This is an OpenVMS Alpha system prior to V7.0 and the startup is not 
invoking the procedure:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>

<a name="index_x_266"></a>

<p>
This is an OpenVMS system prior to V6.0, where there is no OpenVMS TDF 
nor UTC available.

<p>
The version of the application does not use the OpenVMS TDF. This 
includes TCP/IP Services prior to V5.0, applications using HP C built 
on or targeting OpenVMS prior to V7.0, and systems using the 
DECnet-Plus DTSS mechanisms prior to the release associated with 
OpenVMS V7.3. (DCE TDF TBD.)

<p>
If you should find either of the following two timezone-related 
database files located in SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE]:

<ul>
  <li>SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE]SYS$TIMEZONE.DAT
  <li>SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE]SYS$TIMEZONE_SRC.DAT
</ul>

<a name="index_x_267"></a>
<a name="index_x_268"></a>

<p>
These two files are in an erroneous location and must be recreated in 
the correct directory:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE] 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If the DCL command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DIRECTORY SYS$SYSTEM:SYS$TIMEZONE*.DAT 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
shows these files in SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSEXE], then delete them and use 
SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM to recreate them.

<p>
On OpenVMS versions prior to V7.3, if the file:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SYS$STARTUP:DTSS$UTC_STARTUP.COM 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_269"></a>

<p>
is present on your system, then you may need to invoke:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @SYS$UPDATE:DTSS$INSTALL_TIMEZONE_RULE.COM 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_270"></a>

<p>
to recreate the timezone files correctly. Invoke this command 
immediately after [re]executing SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM.)

<p>
If SYS$UPDATE:DTSS$INSTALL_TIMEZONE_RULE.COM is not present on your 
system, then you may need to execute the following commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DELETE SYS$STARTUP:DTSS$UTC_STARTUP.COM 
$ DEASSIGN/SYSTEM/EXEC SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE. 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

If your system time is being reported as being off by one hour (or 
whatever the local DST change), please see sections <a href="vmsfaq_003.html#time12">Section 4.1</a>, 
<a href="vmsfaq_004.html#time4">Section 4.4</a> and <a href="vmsfaq_013.html#commonc">Section 10.22.1</a>.

<a name="index_x_277"></a>

<p>
Individual, local, and regional differences on the use (or the lack of 
use) of Daylight Savings Time (DST) are quite common.

<p>
If you need to add (or remove) daylight savings time for your area or 
otherwise alter the rules for your local area, you will probably end up 
creating a variation to an existing timezone rule.

<p>
The necessary zone line to add for WhereEverLand will probably look 
something like this:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
# Zone  NAME            GMTOFF  RULES/SAVE      FORMAT  [UNTIL] 
Zone    WhereEver       2:00    -               WhereEver 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The OpenVMS source file for the timezone rules here:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SYS$COMMON:[SYS$ZONEINFO.SYSTEM.SOURCES] 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You'll then want to ZIC this to create your own timezone definiton.
<a name="index_x_278"></a>
<a name="index_x_279"></a>

<p>
ZIC is documented in the OpenVMS Documentation Set, in the HP C 
Run-Time Library Reference Manual. (Despite the name of the manual, it 
is part of the OpenVMS documentation set and not the C manuals.)

<p>
Once you have created the new rule, use SYS$MANAGER:UTC$TIME_SETUP.COM
<a name="index_x_280"></a>
to select the new timezone---with V7.3 and later, this tool will notice 
the new timezone and will offer it, on earlier releases, you may/will 
have to hack the tool somewhat. (Don't even think of trying to define 
the TZ
<a name="index_x_281"></a>
<a name="index_x_282"></a>
logical name (found on older configurations), or the SYS$TIMEZONE_NAME 
logical name,
<a name="index_x_283"></a>
<a name="index_x_284"></a>
or any other time- or timezone-related logical names directly yourself.)

<p>
For various timezone rules, see the tar.gz files (these are gzipped tar 
archives) available at:
