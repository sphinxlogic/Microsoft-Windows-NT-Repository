<a name="dcl1"><h1><font color=maroon>8.1 How do I run a program with arguments?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_531"></a>

<p>
The RUN command does not accept arguments. To pass arguments to a 
program, you must use what is called a "foreign command". For example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ unzip :== $disk:[dir]unzip.exe 
$ unzip -? 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The leading $ in the equivilence name for the symbol definition is what 
makes the DCL symbol a foreign command. If the device and directory are 
omitted, SYS$SYSTEM: is assumed.

<p>
Under OpenVMS V6.2 and later, DCL supports automatic foreign command 
definition via the logical name DCL$PATH:. An example of a definition 
of this logical name is:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DEFINE DCL$PATH SYS$DISK:[],ddcu:[mytooldir],SYS$SYSTEM: 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_532"></a>
<a name="index_x_533"></a>
<a name="index_x_534"></a>
<a name="index_x_535"></a>

<p>
DCL will first look for a command in the DCL command table, and if no 
match is found and if DCL$PATH is defined, it will then look for 
command procedures and executable images with filenames matching the 
command specified, in the directories specified via DCL$PATH. The first 
match found is invoked, and under OpenVMS, the DCL$PATH support will 
cause a command procedure to be activated in preference to an 
executable image.

<p>
For more information on foreign commands or on automatic foreign 
command support, see the <em>OpenVMS User's Manual</em>.

<p>
See also <a href="vmsfaq_011.html#prog2">Section 10.3</a>.

<p>
If you want to create a detached process that takes arguments from a 
command line, it must be run under the control of a command line 
interpreter (CLI) (typically DCL). This is done by placing the command 
line in a file, specifying SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT.EXE as the image to run 
and the command file as the input. For example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ OPEN/WRITE CMD TEMP_INPUT.COM 
$ WRITE CMD "$ MYCOMMAND arguments" 
$ CLOSE CMD 
$ RUN/DETACHED SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT /INPUT=TEMP_INPUT.COM 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Various OpenVMS library calls (such as lib$spawn(), cli$dcl_parse(), 
and the C library system() call) require access to a command line 
interpreter such as DCL to perform requested actions, and will not 
operate if a CLI is not available.

<p>
When a CLI is not available, these calls typically return the error 
status SS$_NOCLI.
<a name="index_x_536"></a>
<a name="index_x_537"></a>
And as mentioned above, invoke the image LOGINOUT to cause a CLI (such 
as DCL) to be mapped into and made available in the context of the 
target process.

<p>
For examples of how TCP/IP Services sets up its foreign commands (which 
includes tools such as uuencode and uudecode), please see the DCL 
command procedure SYS$STARTUP:TCPIP$DEFINE_COMMANDS.COM.

<a name="dcl3"><h1><font color=maroon>8.2 How can I clear the screen in DCL?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_538"></a>

<p>
The simplest way is the TYPE/PAGE NLA0: command.

<p>
You can set up a symbol to clear the screen in your LOGIN.COM:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ CLS :== TYPE/PAGE NLA0:

</table>

<a name="dcl4"><h1><font color=maroon>8.3 Using REPLY/LOG from DCL?  Disabling Console OPCOMs?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_539"></a>

<p>
Your terminal must be enabled as an operator terminal before the 
REPLY/LOG command can be used, but a DCL procedure (batch command file, 
system startup, etc) does not have an associated terminal. To make this 
work, use the following sequence to enable the OPA0: console as the 
operator terminal, then the REPLY/LOG command will be accepted:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DEFINE/USER SYS$COMMAND _OPA0: 
$ REPLY/LOG 
$ DEFINE/USER SYS$COMMAND _OPA0: 
$ REPLY/ENABLE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
To disable the system console terminal (OPA0:) as an operator terminal, 
use the following command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DEFINE/USER SYS$COMMAND _OPA0: 
$ REPLY/DISABLE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

the system console (OPA0:) as an operator terminial and the specific 
contents and behaviour of the system operator log file OPERATOR.LOG.

<a name="dcl5"><h1><font color=maroon>8.4 How do I generate a random number in DCL?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_542"></a>

<p>
Here is a random number generator, just do a GOSUB RAND and the global 
symbol RANDOM will contain a randomly generated number. You can feed 
the generator a ceiling value (__CEIL) or a new seed (__SEED).

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>

<a name="dcl6"><h1><font color=maroon>8.5 What does the MCR command do?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_543"></a>

<p>
The MCR is an artifact of RSX compatibility mode, the operating system 
from which OpenVMS is descended. MCR is the Monitor Console Routine, 
and the command is intended to activate RSX compatibility mode 
utilities. When used on OpenVMS, the command is most commonly used to 
run the specified image and---because the tool detects the image is not 
a compatibility-mode image---it acts as a form of RUN command with the 
default file specification of SYS$SYSTEM:.EXE. MCR passes any 
(optional) command line arguments in a fashion similar to a foreign 
command. In other words:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ MCR FOO BAR 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
is equivalent to:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
 $ FOO :== $FOO 
 $ FOO BAR 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
MCR is not documented. Use of a foreign command or the DCL$PATH 
mechanism is preferred. For details on this, see <a href="vmsfaq_010.html#dcl1">Section 8.1</a>.

<a name="dcl7"><h1><font color=maroon>8.6 How do I change the OpenVMS system prompt?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_544"></a>

<p>
You can use the SET PROMPT command for this purpose. SET PROMPT sets 
the DCL prompt to the specified string.

<p>
When you want to display variable information, you will need to 
establish a tie-in that provides the information to the SET PROMPT 
command as required.

<p>
If you wish to display the default directory for instance, you will 
have to establish a tie between the SET DEFAULT command and the SET 
PROMPT commands, as there is no direct way to get the default directory 
as the DCL prompt. You can easily acquire or create a set of DCL 
command procedures that perform the SET DEFAULT and SET PROMPT for you. 
These DCL command procedures often use a command such as:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ set prompt='f$environment("default")' 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
More advanced users could implement a system service or other 
intercept, and use these tools to intercept the directory change and 
reset the prompt accordingly. (This approach likely involves some 
kernel-mode programming, and requires write access to various 
undocumented OpenVMS data structures.)

<p>
There are related tools available from various sources, including the 
following web sites:

<ul>
  <li>ftp://ftp.hhs.dk/pub/vms/setpmt/
  <li>ftp://ftp.tmesis.com/sys_service_hook.src
  <li>James F. Duff has also made available a Macro32 tool known as 
  TIME_PROMPT, a tool that sets the prompt to the current system time.
  <li>Many folks have contributed DCL procedures to perform this task. 
  Visit the newsgroup archives for information and examples.

<a name="dcl8"><h1><font color=maroon>8.7 Can I do DECnet task-to-task communication with DCL?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_545"></a>

<p>
Yes, you can do this with DCL.

<p>
The OpenVMS DECnet documentation shows various simple examples using 
the task object and the TYPE command to trigger the execution of a DCL 
command procedure on a remote node. An example DCL command procedure 
that is rather more advanced than using the TYPE command as a trigger 
is included in the Ask The Wizard area:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/wizard/
</ul>

<a name="index_x_546"></a>
<a name="index_x_547"></a>

<p>
DCL does not include support asynchronous I/O, thus a predetermined 
protocol or a predetermined "turn-around" command sequence must be 
implemented in order to avoid protocol deadlocks---cases where both 
tasks are trying to write or both tasks are trying to read. The task 
that is writing messages to the network must write (or write and read) 
a predetermined sequence of messages, or it must write a message that 
tells the reader that it can now start writing messages. (This is the 
essence of a basic half-duplex network protocol scheme.)

<a name="dcl11"><h1><font color=maroon>8.10 Use of RUN/DETACH, LOGINOUT, and logical names?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_550"></a>

<p>
With a command to create a detached process such as:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RUN/DETACHED SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT /INPUT=TEMP_INPUT.COM 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If you are trying to use a logical name as the /INPUT, /OUTPUT or 
/ERROR on a RUN/DETACH command, then you must translate the logical 
name specifications to physical references before passing them, or the 
definitions must reside in a logical name table that is visible to the 
newly-created process.

<p>
Also note that LOGINOUT only creates the SYS$LOGIN, SYS$LOGIN_DEVICE, 
and SYS$SCRATCH
<a name="index_x_551"></a>
<a name="index_x_552"></a>
<a name="index_x_553"></a>
<a name="index_x_554"></a>
<a name="index_x_555"></a>
<a name="index_x_556"></a>
  logical names if it is processing a login that is based on the contents 
  of a SYSUAF record---without access to the associated SYSUAF record, 
  this information is not available to LOGINOUT. (If you want to see 
  these particular logical names created, then please specify the 
  /AUTHORIZE qualifier on the RUN/DETACHED command.)

<p>
If you do not specify LOGINOUT as the image, then there is no easy way 
to get these logical names. Also, any logical names that are used in 
the target image file specification must also be in a logical name 
table accessible (by default) by the newly-created detached process. 
Shared tables include the group (if the process is in the same UIC 
group) and the system table. (If the target process is to be in another 
UIC group, a suitablly privileged user or application can create the 
necessary logical name(s) directly in the other group logical name 
table.)

<p>
When in doubt, create a short DCL command file as input, and use a SHOW 
LOGICAL and similar commands to examine the context. (And use physical 
device and directory references on the RUN/DETACH of the LOGINOUT 
image, when specifying this command file as /INPUT.) Also remember to 
check both security auditing and system accounting when troubleshooting 
problems with the RUN/DETACH.

<a name="file1"><h1><font color=maroon>9.1 How can I undelete a file?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_558"></a>

<p>
OpenVMS doesn't have an &quot;undelete&quot; function. However, if you 
are quick to write-protect the disk or if you can guarantee that no new 
files get created or existing files extended, your data is still on the 
disk and it may be possible to retrieve it. The FLORIAN tool available 
from various websites can potentially recover the file, see question 
<a href="vmsfaq_015.html#soft1">Section 13.1</a> for pointers. Other alternatives here include the DFU 
tool, available on the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM distribution.

<a name="index_x_561"></a>
<a name="index_x_562"></a>

<p>
If you are setting up a user environment for yourself or for others, it 
is quite easy to use DCL to intercept the DELETE command, using a 
symbol:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DEL*ETE :== @SYS$LOGIN:MYDELETE.COM 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The DELETE symbol will cause the procedure to be invoked whenever the 
user enters the DELETE command, and it can copy the file(s) to a 
&quot;trashcan&quot; subdirectory before issuing a &quot;real&quot; 
DELETE on the files. Other procedures can retrieve the file(s) from the 
&quot;trashcan&quot; subdirectory, and can (and should) clean out the 
&quot;trashcan&quot; as appropriate. (Realize that this DELETE symbol 
can interfere with DELETE/GLOBAL and other similar DCL commands.)

<a name="file2"><h1><font color=maroon>9.2 Why does SHOW QUOTA give a different answer than DIR/SIZE?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_563"></a>

<p>
DIRECTORY/SIZE doesn't take into account the size of file headers which 
are charged to your quota. Also, unless you use DIRECTORY/SIZE:ALL, you 
will see only the &quot;used&quot; size of the file, not the allocated 
size which is what gets charged against your quota. Also, you may have 
files in other directories.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DIRECTORY/SIZE=ALL/GRAND [username...] 
Grand total of D1 directories, F1 files, B1/B2 blocks. 
$ DIRECTORY/SIZZ=ALL/GRAND [-]username.DIR 
Grand total of 1 directory, 1 file, B3/B4 blocks. 
$ SHOW QUOTA 
User [username] has B5 blocks used, B6 available 
of B7 authorized and permitted overdraft of B8 blocks on disk 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If the user has no files in other directories and all file-headers are 
only 1 block, then the following should apply:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
  B5=B2+B4+F1+1 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If the diskquota has drifted out of synchronization, then the 
system-manager can force a quota rebuild---due to various factors, the 
quota file can potentially drift from the actual use over time, and a 
periodic rebuild can be performed at appropriate intervals.

<p>
Also be aware that the DIRECTORY/SIZE command can report larger values 
than might otherwise be expected when used to evaluate files and/or 
directories that are alias links---such as the system roots on OpenVMS 
system disks---as the command reports a total that is cumulative over 
all of the files and directories examined, without regard for which 
ones might be alias entries and which are not. (In other words, a 
DIRECTORY/SIZE of an entire OpenVMS system disk will report a disk 
useage value larger than the (usually more accurate) value reported by 
the SHOW DEVICE command. This as a result of the alias entries linking 
each SYS$SYSDEVICE:[SYSCOMMON]SYS*.DIR directory file and the 
SYS$SYSDEVICE:[000000]VMS$COMMON.DIR file together.)

<a name="index_x_564"></a>

<p>
If your application must absolutely guarantee that data is available, 
no matter what, there's really no substitute for RMS Journaling and 
host- or controller-based shadowing. However, you can achieve a good 
degree of data integrity by issuing a SYS$FLUSH RMS call at appropriate
<a name="index_x_565"></a>
<a name="index_x_566"></a>
<a name="index_x_567"></a>
<a name="index_x_568"></a>
<a name="index_x_569"></a>
<a name="index_x_570"></a>
<a name="index_x_571"></a>
times (if you're using RMS, that is.) If you're using a high-level 
language's I/O system, check that language's documentation to see if 
you can access the RMS control blocks for the open file. In C you can 
use fflush followed by fsync.

<a name="file4"><h1><font color=maroon>9.4 What are the limits on file specifications and directories?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_578"></a>

<p>
A file specification has an aggregate maximum size of 255 characters at 
present. The node and device specification may be up to 255 characters 
each - file name and file types may be up to 39 characters each. File 
versions are from 1 through 32767, though 0 (latest version), -0 
(oldest version) and -n (n'th previous version) can be used in most 
contexts. A file specification may not have more than 8 directories and 
subdirectories - while it is possible to create subdirectories of 
greater depth, accessing them is problematic in most cases and this 
should be avoided.

<p>
Application developers should use OpenVMS-supplied routines for parsing 
file specifications - this ensures that changes in what is allowable 
will not tend to break your application. Consider that various parts of 
the file specification may contain quoted strings with embedded spaces 
and other punctuation! Some routines of interest are SYS$FILESCAN, 
SYS$PARSE and LIB$TRIM_FILESPEC. For further information, see the 
OpenVMS Guide to File Applications.

Performance of larger directory files improves (greatly) with OpenVMS 
V7.2 and later---operations on directory files of 128 blocks and larger 
were rather slower on earlier OpenVMS releases due to the smaller size 
of the directory cache and due to the directory I/O processing logic.

<p>
For fastest directory deletions, consider a reverse deletion---delete 
from the last file in the directory to the first. This reversal speeds 
the deletion operation by avoiding unnecessary directory I/O operations 
as the files are deleted. Tools such as the Freeware DFU can be used 
for this purpose,
<a name="index_x_584"></a>
<a name="index_x_585"></a>
as can various available reverse-DELETE DCL command procedures.

<a name="file5"><h1><font color=maroon>9.5 What is the largest disk volume size OpenVMS can access?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_586"></a>

<p>
One Terabyte (TB; 2**31 blocks of 2**9 bytes; 0x07FFFFFFF blocks). 255 
volumes in a volume set. The largest contiguous allocation possible for 
any particular file is 0x03FFFFFFF blocks.

<p>
Prior to the release of V6.0, the OpenVMS file system was limited to 
disk volumes of 8.38 GB (2**24 blocks, 16777216 blocks) or less.

<p>
On some systems, there are restrictions in the console program that 
limit the size of the OpenVMS system disk. Note that data disks are not 
affected by console program limits. For example, all members of the 
VAXstation 3100
<a name="index_x_587"></a>
<a name="index_x_588"></a>
<a name="index_x_589"></a>
<a name="index_x_590"></a>
series are limited to a system disk to 1.073 GB or less due to the 
console, though larger data disks are possible. This limit due to the 
SCSI drivers used by and built into the console ROM to read the OpenVMS 
bootstrap files, and these same drivers are also used by OpenVMS to 
write the system crashump.

<p>
There are numerous discussions of this VAXstation 3100 in the 
comp.os.vms newsgroup archives. Please use Google newsgroup search to 
search the archives for further details, for discussions of the 
workarounds, and for details of the potential for a simple failed 
bootstrap and particularly for discussions of the potential for severe 
system disk corruptions on crashes.

<p>
Some SCSI disks with capacities larger than 8.58 gigabytes (GB) will 
require the use of an OpenVMS ECO kit (eg: ALPSCSI04_062 or later; see 
<a href="vmsfaq_019.html#misc21">Section 14.26</a> for details) for new SCSI device drivers. Failure to use 
this ECO can cause "rounding errors" on the SCSI disk device 
capacity---OpenVMS will not use nor display the full capacity of the 
drive---and "%sysinit-e-error mounting system device status equals 
000008C4" (8C4 -&gt; "%SYSTEM-?-FILESTRUCT, unsupported file structure 
level") errors during bootstrap. (One workaround for the bootstrap when 
the bitmap is located far into the disk is the use of 
INIT/INDEX=BEGIN.) The problem here involves the particular extensions 
and fields used for larger capacity disks within the SCSI 
specifications and within the various intepretations of same.

For ATA (IDE) disk drives:

<ul>
  <li>Versions of SYS$DQDRIVER *BEFORE* X-15 topped out at 8.455 GB. 
  <br>Fixed drivers (equal or greater than "X-15") were shipped in:

  <ul>
    <li>OpenVMS Alpha V7.2-1, and later
    <li>V7.2 UPDATE V1.0 ECO, and later
    <li>V7.1-2 UPDATE V1.0 ECO, and later
    <li>V7.1-2 UPDATE V3.0 ECO, and later
  </ul>
  <li>The newer SYS$DQDRIVER driver operates to disks up to 33 GB without 
  (known) problems, and effectively works with rather larger disks (up to 
  circa 137 GB) but is known to report an incorrect number of "cylinders" 
  with disks above 33 GB.
</ul>

<p>
See <a href="vmsfaq_018.html#alpha23">Section 14.4.4.2</a> for additional ATA SYS$DQDRIVER information.

<p>
Be aware that a known restriction in certain older versions of the 
Alpha SRM Console prevents booting most ATA (IDE) drives larger than 
8.455 GB, depending on exactly where the various files are located on 
the volume. Updated SRM consoles for systems with SRM and ATA (IDE) 
drive support are (will be) available. (OpenVMS Engineering has 
successfully bootstrapped 20GB ATA (IDE) disks using the appropriate 
SRM console version.)

<p>
NOTE: All ATA-related disk sizes listed in this section are stated in 
units of "disk (base ten) gigabytes" (1 GB = 10^9 bytes) and NOT in 
units of "software (base two) gigabytes" (1 GB = 2^30 (1073741824.) 
bytes. See <a href="vmsfaq_019.html#misc21">Section 14.26</a>.

<p>
Be aware that larger disks that are using an extension of SCSI-2---
<a name="index_x_599"></a>
<a name="index_x_600"></a>
<a name="index_x_601"></a>
disks that are using a mode page field that the SCSI-2 specifications 
normally reserved for tape devices---to permit a larger disk volume 
size will require a SCSI driver update for OpenVMS, and this change is 
part of V7.1-2 and later, and also part of ALPSCSI07_062 and later. 
(These larger disks disks will typically report a DRVERR, or will see 
the volume size "rounded down".) SCSI disks larger than 16777216 blocks 
cira 8.455 GB (base ten); 8GB (base two) require this ECO, or require 
the use of OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2 or later.

<p>
Applications written in C can be limited to file sizes of two gigabytes 
and less, as a result of the use of longword values within C file 
operations, and specifically off_t. This restriction is lifted in 
OpenVMS V7.3-1 and later, and with the application of the C ECO kits 
available for specific earlier releases. The use of a longword for 
off_t restricts applications using native C I/O to file sizes of two 
gigabytes or less, or these applications must use native RMS or XQP 
calls for specific operations.
