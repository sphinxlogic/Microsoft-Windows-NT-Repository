          2        General Information



          __________________________________________________________
          2.1  What is OpenVMS? What is its history?

                   OpenVMS, originally called VMS (Virtual Memory System),
                   was first conceived in 1976 as a new operating system
                   for the then-new, 32-bit, virtual memory line of
                   computers, eventually named VAX (Virtual Address
                   eXtension).

                   The first VAX model, the 11/780, was code-named "Star",
                   hence the code name for the VMS operating system,
                   "Starlet", a name that remains to this day the name
                   for the system library files (STARLET.OLB, etc.).

                   VMS version X0.5 was the first released to customers,
                   in support of the hardware beta test of the VAX-11/780,
                   in 1977. VAX/VMS Version V1.0 shipped in 1978, along
                   with the first revenue-ship 11/780s.

                   OpenVMS was designed entirely within HP and
                   specifically within the former Digital Equipment
                   Corporation (DIGITAL). Two of the principal designers
                   were Dave Cutler and Dick Hustvedt, though with a wide
                   variety of other contributors. OpenVMS was conceived
                   as a 32-bit, virtual memory successor to the RSX-
                   11M operating system for the PDP-11. Many of the
                   original designers and programmers of OpenVMS had
                   worked previously on RSX-11M, and many concepts from
                   RSX-11M were carried over to OpenVMS.

                   OpenVMS VAX is a 32-bit, multitasking, multiprocessing
                   virtual memory operating system. Current
                   implementations run on VAX systems from HP and other
                   vendors.

                   OpenVMS Alpha is a 64-bit multitasking, multiprocessing
                   virtual memory operating system. Current
                   implementations run on Alpha systems from HP, and other
                   vendors.

                                                                       2-1

                   Work to port OpenVMS to systems based on the Intel
                   IA-64 architecture and specifically to the Itanium
                   Processor Family is presently underway.

          2.2  What is the difference between VMS and OpenVMS?

                   VMS and OpenVMS are two names for the same operating
                   system. Originally, the operating system was called
                   VAX-11/VMS; it changed to VAX/VMS at around VAX/VMS
                   V2.0. When the VMS operating system was ported to the
                   Alpha platform, it was renamed OpenVMS, for both VAX
                   and Alpha (and for the Itanium Processor Family), in
                   part to signify the high degree of support for industry

                   2-2

 





                   General Information




                   standards such as POSIX, which provides many features
                   of UNIX systems.

                   For those versions with POSIX, an OpenVMS license
                   allows you to install and run POSIX for OpenVMS at
                   no additional charge; all you need is the media and
                   documentation which can be found on the Consolidated
                   Distribution and On-Line Documentation CD-ROMs. Support
                   for the POSIX package on more recent OpenVMS releases
                   is not available, various parts of POSIX such as calls
                   from the API are being integrated more directly into
                   OpenVMS. For more information on POSIX for VMS see
                   question SOFT2

                   What became confusing is that the OpenVMS name was
                   introduced first for OpenVMS AXP V1.0 causing the
                   widespread misimpression that OpenVMS was for Alpha
                   AXP only, while "regular VMS" was for VAX. In fact,
                   the official name of the VAX operating system was
                   changed as of V5.5, though the name did not start to be
                   actually used in the product until V6.0.

                   The proper names for OpenVMS on the two platforms
                   are now "OpenVMS VAX" and "OpenVMS Alpha", the latter
                   having superseded "OpenVMS AXP".

          2.2.1  How do I port from VMS to OpenVMS?

                   You already did. Wasn't that easy? Please see
                   Section 2.2 for details.

          __________________________________________________________
          2.3  Which is better, OpenVMS or UNIX?

                   This question comes up periodically, usually asked by
                   new subscribers amd new posters who are long-time UNIX
                   or Linux users. Sometimes, the question is ignored
                   totally; other times, it leads to a long series of
                   repetitive messages that convince no one and usually
                   carry little if any new information. Please do everyone
                   a favor and avoid re-starting this perpetual, fruitless
                   debate.

                                                                       2-3

 





                   General Information




                   That said, OpenVMS and the better implementations of
                   UNIX are all fine operating systems, each with its
                   strengths and weaknesses. If you're in a position
                   where you need to choose, select the one that best
                   fits your own requirements, considering, for example,
                   whether or not the layered products or specific OS
                   features you want are available, and considering the
                   expected cost-of-ownership over the lifetime of the
                   system installation.

          __________________________________________________________
          2.4  Is HP continuing funding and support for OpenVMS?

                   Yes.

                   Active development of new OpenVMS releases is underway,
                   as well as the continuation of support.

          2.6  In what language is OpenVMS written?

                   OpenVMS is written in a wide variety of languages.

                   In no particular order, OpenVMS components are
                   implemented using Bliss, Macro, Ada, PLI, VAX and DEC
                   C, Fortran, UIL, VAX and Alpha SDL, Pascal, MDL, DEC
                   C++, DCL, Message, and Document. And this is certainly
                   not a complete list. However, the rumor is NOT true
                   that an attempt was made to write pieces of OpenVMS in
                   every supported language so that the Run-Time Libraries
                   could not be unbundled. (APL, BASIC, COBOL and RPG are
                   just some of the languages NOT represented!)

                   There are a large variety of small and not-so-small
                   tools and DCL command procedures that are used as part
                   of the OpenVMS build, and a source code control system
                   capable of maintaining over a hundred thousand source
                   files across multiple parallel development projects,
                   and overlapping releases.

          2.7.1  Questions asked by Hobbyist OpenVMS licensees?

                   If you are a member of an HP-recognized user group
                   (eg: Encompass, Enterex, DECUS), and are considering
                   acquiring and using a VAX or Alpha system for
                   hobbyist (non-commercial) use, (free) license product
                   authorization keys (PAKs) for OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS
                   Alpha, and layered products are available.

                   In addition to the license keys, OpenVMS VAX and
                   Alpha distribution CD-ROM distribution kits are
                   available with OpenVMS, DECwindows Motif, DECnet
                   and TCP/IP networking, compilers, and a variety
                   of layered products. (While the hobbyist CD-ROM
                   distributions are intended for and tailored for
                   OpenVMS Hobbyists, the contents and capabilities of
                   the Hobbyist installation kits included within the
                   OpenVMS Hobbyist distribution do not differ from the
                   standard distribution installation kits. The products
                   are chosen to reflect the most popular products and the
                   space available on the media.)

                   If you have questions on what else is authorized by the
                   license agreement and on what other distribution media
                   is available to you, well, please read the applicable

          2.9  OpenVMS Ports? Itanium? Ports to Intel (IA-32) systems?

                   OpenVMS has been ported to and is operational on three
                   architectures: VAX, Alpha, and IA-64. VAX is the
                   oldest, and limited to 32-bit virtual and up to 34-
                   bit physical addressing. Alpha and IA-64 architectures
                   are both 64-bit architectures, with 64-bit virtual
                   addressing available.

                   The most common commodity platform available in the
                   industry is clearly the Intel IA-32 series, with 32-bit
                   addressing. Technically, OpenVMS and specifically the
                   OpenVMS VAX 32-bit environment is already available on
                   IA-32 systems. For information on how this is possible,
                   please see one of the available VAX emulator products
                   referenced over in Section 13.13.

                   As for (the lack of) a native port for IA-32, OpenVMS
                   Engineering presently and continues to believe that
                   there would be insufficient market (read: profit,
                   customer interest) to justify the cost involved in
                   a native port of OpenVMS to systems using the Intel
                   IA-32 architecture. In addition to the direct costs
                   involved in any port and in addition to the substantial
                   effort involved in moving backwards from a 64-bit

                                                                       2-9

                   environment on Alpha and on IA-64 to a 32-bit platform
                   (such as IA-32), and the exceedingly non-trivial device
                   qualification costs and the costs in moving backwards
                   into older PCI and I/O environments (IA-32 systems
                   more than a few years old have equivalently aged I/O
                   support and buses), each organization and each person
                   maintaining a product or a package for OpenVMS will
                   have to justify a port to "OpenVMS Pentium" or "OpenVMS
                   Athalon", akin to the decisions and effort involved in
                   porting a product from OpenVMS VAX to OpenVMS Alpha, or
                   to OpenVMS I64.

                   Platform ports of many of the various products can
                   be easy. Other products can depend on platform-
                   specific features, and the associated ports can be
                   more involved. Ports of operating systems are very
                   large and involved projects. The prerequisite product
                   requirements for a port are also non-trivial, as well-
                   compilers in particular are obviously required, and
                   the suite of compilers provided must maintain a very
                   high degree of source-level compatibility across the
                   platforms. In the case of the HP Integrity port,
                   OpenVMS I64 V8.0 used cross-compilers and cross-
                   tools operating on OpenVMS Alpha systems, while V8.1
                   is expected to have native compilers available. The
                   OpenVMS I64 port was centrally built using the existing
                   OpenVMS Alpha environment and around the work and the
                   knowledge from the OpenVMS Alpha port, and OpenVMS
                   Engineering fully expects that customers and ISVs will
                   use and will continue to use OpenVMS Alpha systems to
                   assist with their own ports to OpenVMS I64.

                   OpenVMS Engineering is well aware of the AMD Opteron
                   AMD64 (64-bit) platform, and of terms such as Hammer
                   and Sledgehammer. (At least one of the VAX emulators
                   can reportedly utilize the Opteron instruction
                   set, please contact the VAX emulator vendor(s) or
                   maintainer(s) for assistance and details on their
                   products.) OpenVMS Engineering has also heard many
                   of the various "Yamhill" rumors as well. There are no
                   plans to provide a native port of HP OpenVMS for any
                   systems based on AMD Opteron.

                   General Information




                   As part of the work leading to the Itanium port, senior
                   engineers had extensively evaluated the products and
                   the architectures available across the high-end 64-
                   bit computing space, and chosen to target Itanium
                   for 64-bit environments-this while under the Compaq
                   organization. This included looking at IA-32. HP (a co-
                   developer of Itanium with Intel) had seperately chosen
                   to target Intel Itanium for its high-end computer
                   products. Compaq then announced plans for the future
                   of Alpha through EV79 products and platforms, and HP
                   (entirely seperately) announced plans for PA-RISC
                   products and platforms. The Itanium target has been
                   maintained consistently since the Itanium port was
                   announced by Compaq, and has also been consistently
                   maintained by HP and by the combined company. For those
                   folks prefering to follow the schedules and the product
                   deliveries, OpenVMS Engineering had OpenVMS I64 V8.0
                   ready (internally) ahead of schedule-and with more
                   features available within the release than had been
                   originally planned for the release. (For information
                   on and for schedules of future OpenVMS releases,
                   please see the roadmap that is available at the OpenVMS
                   website.)

                   OpenVMS I64 itself does not require and does not plan
                   to utilize the Itanium IA-32 32-bit environment for
                   the operation of OpenVMS itself. OpenVMS I64 V8.0 runs
                   natively on the Itanium processor family, with no use
                   of IA-32 instructions; this starting with the initial
                   release of OpenVMS I64 V8.0, and the fully-native
                   operations of OpenVMS are expected to continue through
                   future releases. While OpenVMS can and does support
                   32-bit applications and addressing on Itanium, this is
                   done with sign-extension addressing techniques entirely
                   analogous to what was done with 32-bit applications
                   operating in the 64-bit Alpha environment.

                   But yes, a native IA-32 port or a native AMD Opteron
                   port of OpenVMS would certainly be nice to have-this,
                   of course, following the traditional Linux preference
                   for having a Linux port available for most (all?)
                   computer architectures known, and even for certain
                   high-end refrigerators and toasters and similar
                   appliances and appliance-like devices. (The downside

                                                                      2-11

                   of this all-encompassing approach: this requires
                   near-infinite engineering and support costs from
                   the various vendors involved, and the qualification
                   efforts and costs of most everything-everywhere. Or
                   reduced or eliminated testing and support efforts. Or
                   an unfortunate combination of these two. These costs
                   are huge, and the benefits derived from the work are
                   comparatively small when given the comparable costs of
                   more targeted (and thus supported and supportable)
                   hardware configurations- the platform targets are
                   and must be carefully selected and considered by
                   each vendor. Put another way, there are no plans to
                   provide a native port of HP OpenVMS for systems based
                   on Intel IA-32 processors, nor for systems based on
                   AMD Opteron processors. (There are even still a few
                   computer systems and platforms that lack Linux ports,
                   after all.)

                   All this material having been written, have you
                   looked at the system configurations and pricing of
                   the available HP Integrity Intel Itanium systems? Low-
                   end computer hardware is clearly a commodity product,
                   and the systems are priced, serviced, upgraded, and
                   replaced accordingly. Intel Itanium is a commodity
                   microprocessor presently used in platforms available
                   from various hardware vendors, including (obviously)
                   from HP. Further, Itanium is a microprocessor available
                   from and supported by Intel, a semiconductor vendor
                   known for exceedingly high-volume microprocessor
                   fabrication process and production capabilities.

          2.13  Porting applications to OpenVMS?

                   Porting can range from simple to rather complex, and
                   depends on the features used on the original platform.

                                                                      2-15

 





                   General Information




                   This section covers generic porting, and porting from
                   OpenVMS VAX to OpenVMS Alpha. (Porting from OpenVMS VAX
                   to OpenVMS Alpha is often quite simple and involves
                   little more than rebuilding from source, though a
                   few applications using features specific to VAX will
                   require some additional effort to port.)

                   Several manuals on porting from OpenVMS VAX to OpenVMS
                   Alpha are available in the OpenVMS documentation set,
                   including information on porting VAX Macro32 assembler
                   code to the Macro32 compiler on OpenVMS Alpha, on
                   management differences, on upgrading privileged code,

          2.15  memory management, resource management, process
                scheduling, etc?

                   So you have been instructed to write a school research
                   paper on OpenVMS, and you need technical content
                   on the OpenVMS Virtual Memory System, on any memory
                   segmentation, on OpenVMS Resource Management, on the

                                                                      2-17

 





                   General Information




                   OpenVMS File System, on the OpenVMS user interface,
                   etc.

                   Invariably, your professor/instructor/teacher will
                   ask you a series of questions. Most commonly, the
                   questions will request descriptions of one or more of
                   the following items, and at varying levels of detail:

                   o  process scheduling algorithm(s)

                   o  Interprocess comunications

                   o  Process or system synchronization constructs

                   o  Memory management and/or virtual memory
                      implementation

                   o  RMS or XQP file structures

                   o  Resource management

                   o  History of HP OpenVMS

                   o  History of Compaq and/or of Digital Equipment
                      Corporation (DEC)

                   Any particular presentation or research paper, and
                   particularly a scholastic presentation, can have
                   many different potential target audiences, and very
                   different presentation levels. Further, the usual
                   underlying reason for scholastic presentations and
                   scholastic research projects really has little to do
                   with the subject matter, it is a task specifically
                   intended to teach the student(s) (eg: you) how to
                   perform the research. The instructor already knows
                   most of (all of?) the information that you have been
                   asked to collect.

                   For very technical details on OpenVMS and OpenVMS
                   internals, the book you want is the Internals and Data
                   Structures Manual (IDSM), available in your school
                   or computing center library, and the IDSM can also be
                   purchased. Additional technical details of the Alpha
                   microprocessor are available in the Alpha Architecture
                   Reference Manual documentation that is available for
                   download. (Pointers to Alpha technical documentation
                   are available in Section 14.6, and elsewhere.)

                   General Information




                   For higher-level (less technical) details, the OpenVMS
                   documentation set is available on-line. The Programming
                   Concepts and the File Systems manual are probably the
                   best manuals to start with, depending on the particular
                   level of detail the research requires.

                   And please understand the hesitation of various folks
                   to provide you with a completely-written research
                   report on your topic. Why? We might have to work with
                   you after you graduate-you need to know how to perform
                   at least basic research on your own, regardless of the
                   topic.

                   of measurement for disk and memory storage, and related
                   abbreviations also typically exist. This section
                   covers the most common units, and the associated
                   abbreviations.

          2.16.1  How many bytes are in a disk block?

                   A disk block is the minimum unit of disk storage
                   allocation in OpenVMS.

                   Under OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha, the disk volume
                   block size is consistent, with each block containing
                   512 bytes.

                   The minimum disk allocation granularity actually
                   permissible (in the ODS-2 and ODS-5 volume structures
                   commonly used on OpenVMS) is determined on a per-volume
                   basis, and is typically based on a combination of the
                   total number blocks on the disk volume and the total
                   size of the volume storage bitmap. The allocation
                   granularity is known as the volume cluster factor-
                   the cluster factor is the number of blocks in a disk
                   cluster, and it is the smallest number of blocks that
                   can be allocated on a particular disk volume.


                                                                      2-19

 





                   General Information




                   Prior to OpenVMS V7.2, the maximum permissible size of
                   the bitmap requires larger cluster factors as volume
                   sizes increase. Starting with V7.2, the bitmap can be
                   larger, and cluster factors as small as one block can
                   be used.

                   The number of bytes in a file can be determined by
                   multiplying the number of blocks allocated for the file
                   times the number of bytes in a block. For sequential
                   files (only), the FFB (XAB$W_FFB, in the File Header
                   XAB) value can be used to find out how much of the
                   last (XAB$L_EBK) block is used. FFB and EBK are
                   meaningful only for sequential files, and only in
                   a limited context-partial block allocations are not
                   permitted. For other file formats, the EOF marker is
                   not meaningful.

                   Disk allocations always occur only in units of the
                   cluster factors, which can be from one block up to
                   (potentially) clusters of eighteen blocks or more,
                   depending on the volume cluster factor. (OpenVMS V7.2
                   and later optionally provide for a cluster factor of
                   one up to volumes of approximately 137 gigabytes.)

                   OpenVMS assumes that the device driver and the
                   underlying storage device will present the file system
                   with addressable units of storage of 512 bytes in size,
                   or the appearance of same. Various third-party CD-ROM
                   devices, for instance, support only 2048 byte blocks,
                   and such devices are incompatible with the standard
                   OpenVMS device drivers.

                   To determine the number of bytes required for a file
                   from DCL, one option uses the f$file_attributes item
                   EOF, multiplied by the size of a block in bytes (512).
                   This does not account for the unused space in the last
                   block of a sequential file, but it also does not have
                   to differentiate sequential files from other files.

          2.16.2  How many bytes are in a memory page?

                   A memory page is the minimum unit of memory allocation
                   in OpenVMS. With OpenVMS VAX, the memory page size
                   matches the disk block size: it is always 512 bytes.

                   With OpenVMS Alpha, the memory page size is variable,
                   and it can range from 8192 bytes (8 kilobytes) up
                   to 64 kilobytes. The current system page size can be
                   determined using the sys$getsyi or f$getsyi PAGE_SIZE
                   item. Programs with hardcoded constants for the memory
                   page size (or page alignment) should always assume a
                   page size of 64 kilobytes.

                   On OpenVMS Alpha, a 512 byte area of memory-equivilent
                   in size to an OpenVMS VAX memory page-is refered to as
                   a pagelet.

          2.16.3  How do I convert? Disk Blocks? KB, MB, GB, TB?

                   The smallest granularity of disk storage addressing is
                   called a disk block, or sometimes a disk sector. Groups
                   of disk blocks are usually organized together into
                   the smallest unit of storage that can be allocated,
                   and this unit is called a disk cluster. The number
                   of blocks in a cluster is the cluster factor, and is
                   established when the disk volume is initialized.

                   Each individual disk block is composed of five hundred
                   twelve (512) bytes, or one-half kilobyte. Each byte is
                   comprised of eight bits. A bit represents the smallest
                   unit of information, typically refered to as a one or a
                   zero.

                   OpenVMS tends to uses base two notation for disk
                   storage, while disk storage capacity specifications
                   from most storage vendors (including Compaq) will
                   generally use base ten notation.

                   An OpenVMS disk block is 512 bytes in size; this is
                   one-half kilobyte in base two notation.


                                                                      2-21

 





                   General Information




                   The following table describes the prefix, the
                   abbreviation, and the associated base ten (marketing)
                   and base two (OpenVMS) values.

                               Base Ten                        Base Two
                               -----------------------------   ----------------------
                     Kilobyte  (KB)  10**3              1000   2**10             1024
                     Megabyte  (MB)  10**6           1000000   2**20          1048576
                     Gigabyte  (GB)  10**9        1000000000   2**30       1073741824
                     Terabyte  (TB)  10**12    1000000000000   2**40    1099511627776
                     Petabyte  (PB)  10**15 1000000000000000   2**50 1125899906842624

                   The base ten representation of the 2**40 value is
                   1099511627776, which is obviously rather ugly. When
                   viewed as a base eight or base sixteen (octal or
                   hexadecimal, respectively) value, the value is far
                   nicer. Specifically, the value is 10000000000 and
                   40000000 when represented in octal and hexadecimal,
                   respectively.

                   Notational note: Within the OpenVMS FAQ, a thousand
                   bits (either assuming base two or base ten, as
                   determined by the context) is refered to as kilobit,
                   and is always represented by the appreviation Kb,
                   while a Kilobyte is always represented as KB. Similar
                   notational usage also holds for Megabits (Mb) and
                   Megabytes (MB), and for the various other units.

                   OpenVMS operating system references to system and
                   storage are generally to the base-two version (eg:
                   1024, in the case of a kilobyte or kilobit) while
                   storage hardware references and hardware specifications
                   are generally to the base-ten version (eg: 1000).

                   To convert OpenVMS disk blocks to (base two) kilobytes
                   (KB; 1024 bytes), simply divide by two. To convert
                   blocks to (base two) megabytes, divide by 2048. Blocks
                   to (base two) gigabytes (GB), divide by 2097152.
                   These particular divisions can also be performed using
                   bitshifts: to divide a value by two, shift the binary
                   value rightward by one bit position.

                   To convert OpenVMS disk blocks to (base ten) kilobytes,
                   divide by approximately 1.953125.

          3.4  How do I extract the contents of a HELP topic to a text
               file?

                   To extract all the text of a HELP topic (and its
                   subtopics) to a text file for perusal with a text
                   editor, printing out, etc., use the following command:

                   $ HELP/OUT=filename.txt help-topic [help-subtopic]

                   If the help text you want is not in the standard
                   help library (for example, it's help for a utility
                   such as MAIL that has its own help library), add
                   /LIBRARY=libname after the HELP verb. To see the
                   names of help library files, do a directory of
                   SYS$HELP:*.HLB.

          3.5  Does OpenVMS Marketing have an e-mail address?

                   Yes - if you can't get the answers to marketing
                   questions elsewhere, if you have comments or complaints
                   about OpenVMS, send mail to openvms-info@compaq.com.
                   This address is not a support channel, and is solely
                   intended to provide informal method to communicate
                   directly with members of OpenVMS Marketing.

          3.6  Where can I learn about OpenVMS executive internals?

                   The OpenVMS Internals and Data Structure manual
                   (IDSM) explains how the OpenVMS executive works.
                   The book covers the operating system kernel: process
                   management; memory management; the I/O subsystem; and
                   the mechanisms that transfer control to, from, and
                   among these. It gives an overview of a particular area
                   of the system, followed by descriptions of the data
                   structures related to that area and details of the code
                   that implements the area.

                   The first edition of the OpenVMS Alpha internals book
                   describes Version 1.5. Although there have been several
                   releases of OpenVMS Alpha since Version 1.5 (V6.1,
                   V6.2, V7.0, V7.1, etc) and many details in the book are
                   no longer accurate, it continues to provide a strong
                   conceptual description of OpenVMS internals.

                   Documentation




                   This book has been split into five pieces, each to be
                   updated separately. The first such volume, published
                   in early 1997, was "OpenVMS Alpha Internals and
                   Data Structures: Scheduling and Process Control,"
                   which covers the Version 7.0 implementation of true
                   multithreading and the changed scheduling model it
                   implies.

                   The internals books are available through Digital
                   Press, see Section 3.7

          3.7  Where can new users find tutorial information about
               OpenVMS?

                   First, see if your local site has information on this
                   topic. Each site can have site-specific features and
                   configuration. Some sites will have site-specific new
                   user's documentation, covering various site-specific
                   things that are difficult or impossible for the general
                   OpenVMS documentation to cover.

          4.1  UTC vs GMT vs vs UT1/UT1/UT2 TDF? What are these acronyms?

                   The results of an international compromise-though
                   some would say an international attempt to increase
                   confusion-UTC is refered to as "Coordinated Universal
                   Time" (though not as CUT) in English and as "Temps
                   Universel Coordinn" (though not as TUC) in French.
                   (No particular information exists to explain why UTC
                   was chosen over the equally nonsensical TCU, according
                   to Ulysses T. Clockmeister, one of the diplomats that
                   helped establish the international compromise.)

                   Universal Time UT0 is solar time, UT1 is solar time
                   corrected for a wobble in the Earth's orbit, and UT2
                   is UT1 corrected for seasonal rotational variations in
                   rotation due to the Earth's solar orbit.

                   GMT-Greenwich Mean Time-is UT1. GMT is the time
                   at the classic site of the since-disbanded Royal
                   Greenwich Observatory; at the most widely-known tourist
                   attraction of Greenwich, England.

                   UTC is based on an average across multiple atomic
                   clocks, and is kept within 0.9 seconds of GMT, through
                   the insertion (or removal) of seconds. In other words,
                   UTC matches GMT plus or minus up to 0.9 seconds, but
                   UTC is not GMT.

                   TDF is the Timezone Differential Factor, the interval
                   of time between the local time and UTC. Areas that
                   celebrate daylight savings time (DST) will see periodic
                   changes to the TDF value, when the switch-over between
                   daylight savings time and standard time occurs.
                   The switch-over itself is entirely left to local
                   governmental folks, and can and has varied by political
                   entity and politics, and the switch-over has varied
                   over the years even at the same location.

                                                                       4-1

                   If your local OpenVMS system time is off by one
                   hour (or whatever the local DST change) for some or
                   all applications, you probably need to reset your
                   local TDF. (For related details, please see sections
                   Section 4.4 and Section 10.22.1.)

          4.2  A brief history of OpenVMS Timekeeping, please?

                   Why does OpenVMS regards November 17, 1858 as the
                   beginning of time...

                   The modified Julian date adopted by the Smithsonian
                   Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) for satellite tracking
                   is Julian Day 2400000.5, which turns out to be midnight
                   on November 17, 1858.

                   SAO started tracking satellites with an 8K (nonvirtual)
                   36-bit IBM 704 in 1957 when Sputnik went into orbit.
                   The Julian day was 2435839 on January 1, 1957. This is
                   11225377 octal, which was too big to fit into an 18-bit
                   field. With only 8K of memory, the 14 bits left over by
                   keeping the Julian date in its own 36-bit word would
                   have been wasted. SAO also needed the fraction of the
                   current day (for which 18 bits gave enough accuracy),
                   so it was decided to keep the number of days in the
                   left 18 bits and the fraction of a day in the right 18
                   bits of one word.

                   Eighteen bits allows the truncated Julian Day (the SAO
                   day) to grow as large as 262143, which from November
                   17, 1858, allowed for 7 centuries. Possibly, the date
                   could only grow as large as 131071 (using 17 bits),
                   but this still covers 3 centuries and leaves the

                   possibility of representing negative time. The 1858
                   date preceded the oldest star catalogue in use at SAO,
                   which also avoided having to use negative time in any
                   of the satellite tracking calculations.

                   The original Julian Day (JD) is used by astronomers and
                   expressed in days since noon January 1, 4713 B.C. This
                   measure of time was introduced by Joseph Scaliger in
                   the 16th century. It is named in honor of his father,
                   Julius Caesar Scaliger (note that this Julian Day is
                   different from the Julian calendar that is named for
                   the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar!).

                   Why 4713 BC? Scaliger traced three time cycles and
                   found that they were all in the first year of their
                   cyle in 4713 B.C. The three cycles are 15, 19, and 28
                   years long. By multiplying these three numbers (15 * 19
                   * 28 = 7980), he was able to represent any date from
                   4713 B.C. through 3267 A.D.

                   The starting year was before any historical event known
                   to him. In fact, the Jewish calendar marks the start
                   of the world as 3761 B.C. Today his numbering scheme
                   is still used by astronomers to avoid the difficulties
                   of converting the months of different calendars in use
                   during different eras.
