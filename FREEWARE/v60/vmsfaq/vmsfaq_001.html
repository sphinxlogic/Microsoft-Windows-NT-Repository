</font>

<a name="vms1"><h1><font color=maroon>2.1 What is OpenVMS?  What is its history?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_33"></a>

<p>
OpenVMS, originally called VMS (Virtual Memory System), was first 
conceived in 1976 as a new operating system for the then-new, 32-bit, 
virtual memory line of computers, eventually named VAX (Virtual Address 
eXtension).

<p>
The first VAX model, the 11/780, was code-named &quot;Star&quot;, hence 
the code name for the VMS operating system, &quot;Starlet&quot;, a name 
that remains to this day the name for the system library files 
(STARLET.OLB, etc.).

<p>
VMS version X0.5 was the first released to customers, in support of the 
hardware beta test of the VAX-11/780, in 1977. VAX/VMS Version V1.0 
shipped in 1978, along with the first revenue-ship 11/780s.

<p>
OpenVMS was designed entirely within HP and specifically within the 
former Digital Equipment Corporation (DIGITAL). Two of the principal 
designers were Dave Cutler and Dick Hustvedt, though with a wide 
variety of other contributors. OpenVMS was conceived as a 32-bit, 
virtual memory successor to the RSX-11M operating system for the 
PDP-11. Many of the original designers and programmers of OpenVMS had 
worked previously on RSX-11M, and many concepts from RSX-11M were 
carried over to OpenVMS.

<p>
OpenVMS VAX is a 32-bit, multitasking, multiprocessing virtual memory 
operating system. Current implementations run on VAX systems from HP 
and other vendors.

<p>
OpenVMS Alpha is a 64-bit multitasking, multiprocessing virtual memory 
operating system. Current implementations run on Alpha systems from HP, 
and other vendors.

<p>
Work to port OpenVMS to systems based on the Intel IA-64 architecture 
and specifically to the Itanium Processor Family is presently underway.

<p>
For more details on OpenVMS and its features, please read the OpenVMS 
Software Product Description at:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.compaq.com/info/spd/
<br>
OpenVMS typically uses SPD 25.01.xx and/or SPD 41.87.xx.
</ul>

<a name="vms2"><h1><font color=maroon>2.2 What is the difference between VMS and OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_34"></a>

<p>
VMS and OpenVMS are two names for the same operating system. 
Originally, the operating system was called VAX-11/VMS; it changed to 
VAX/VMS at around VAX/VMS V2.0. When the VMS operating system was 
ported to the Alpha platform, it was renamed OpenVMS, for both VAX and 
Alpha (and for the Itanium Processor Family), in part to signify the 
high degree of support for industry standards such as POSIX, which 
provides many features of UNIX systems.

<p>
For those versions with POSIX, an OpenVMS license allows you to install 
and run POSIX for OpenVMS at no additional charge; all you need is the 
media and documentation which can be found on the Consolidated 
Distribution and On-Line Documentation CD-ROMs. Support for the POSIX 
package on more recent OpenVMS releases is not available, various parts 
of POSIX such as calls from the API are being integrated more directly 
into OpenVMS. For more information on POSIX for VMS see question SOFT2

<p>
What became confusing is that the OpenVMS name was introduced first for 
OpenVMS AXP V1.0 causing the widespread misimpression that OpenVMS was 
for Alpha AXP only, while &quot;regular VMS&quot; was for VAX. In fact, 
the official name of the VAX operating system was changed as of V5.5, 
though the name did not start to be actually used in the product until 
V6.0.

<p>
The proper names for OpenVMS on the two platforms are now &quot;OpenVMS 
VAX&quot; and &quot;OpenVMS Alpha&quot;, the latter having superseded 
&quot;OpenVMS AXP&quot;.

<a name="vms3"><h2>2.2.1 How do I port from VMS to OpenVMS?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_35"></a>

<p>
You already did. Wasn't that easy? Please see <a href="vmsfaq_001.html#vms2">Section 2.2</a> for details.

<a name="vms4"><h1><font color=maroon>2.3 Which is better, OpenVMS or UNIX?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_36"></a>

<p>
This question comes up periodically, usually asked by new subscribers 
amd new posters who are long-time UNIX or Linux users. Sometimes, the 
question is ignored totally; other times, it leads to a long series of 
repetitive messages that convince no one and usually carry little if 
any new information. Please do everyone a favor and avoid re-starting 
this perpetual, fruitless debate.

<p>
That said, OpenVMS and the better implementations of UNIX are all fine 
operating systems, each with its strengths and weaknesses. If you're in 
a position where you need to choose, select the one that best fits your 
own requirements, considering, for example, whether or not the layered 
products or specific OS features you want are available, and 
considering the expected cost-of-ownership over the lifetime of the 
system installation.

<a name="vms5"><h1><font color=maroon>2.4 Is HP continuing funding and support for OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_37"></a>

<p>
Yes.

<p>
Active development of new OpenVMS releases is underway, as well as the 
continuation of support.

<a name="vms8"><h1><font color=maroon>2.6 In what language is OpenVMS written?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_39"></a>

<p>
OpenVMS is written in a wide variety of languages.

<p>
In no particular order, OpenVMS components are implemented using Bliss, 
Macro, Ada, PLI, VAX and DEC C, Fortran, UIL, VAX and Alpha SDL, 
Pascal, MDL, DEC C++, DCL, Message, and Document. And this is certainly 
not a complete list. However, the rumor is NOT true that an attempt was 
made to write pieces of OpenVMS in every supported language so that the 
Run-Time Libraries could not be unbundled. (APL, BASIC, COBOL and RPG 
are just some of the languages NOT represented!)

<p>
There are a large variety of small and not-so-small tools and DCL 
command procedures that are used as part of the OpenVMS build, and a 
source code control system capable of maintaining over a hundred 
thousand source files across multiple parallel development projects, 
and overlapping releases.

<p>
If you are a member of an HP-recognized user group (eg: Encompass, 
Enterex, DECUS), and are considering acquiring and using a VAX or Alpha 
system for hobbyist (non-commercial) use, (free) license product 
authorization keys (PAKs) for OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS Alpha, and layered 
products are available.
<a name="index_x_43"></a>
<a name="index_x_44"></a>
<a name="index_x_45"></a>

<p>
In addition to the license keys, OpenVMS VAX and Alpha distribution 
CD-ROM distribution kits are available with OpenVMS, DECwindows Motif, 
DECnet and TCP/IP networking, compilers, and a variety of layered 
products. (While the hobbyist CD-ROM distributions are intended for and 
tailored for OpenVMS Hobbyists, the contents and capabilities of the 
Hobbyist installation kits included within the OpenVMS Hobbyist 
distribution do not differ from the standard distribution installation 
kits. The products are chosen to reflect the most popular products and 
the space available on the media.)

<p>
If you have questions on what else is authorized by the license 
agreement and on what other distribution media is available to you, 
well, please read the applicable software license agreement(s).

<ul>
  <li>http://www.openvmshobbyist.org/
</ul>

<p>
On the OpenVMS Hobbyist license registration form at the above website 
(as of June 2003), you are offered the choice of the &quot;OpenVMS 
VAX&quot; license(s), the &quot;OpenVMS Alpha&quot; license(s), and the 
&quot;Layered Products&quot; licenses. You will want the operating 
system license for your particular OpenVMS platform <em>and</em> you 
will want the &quot;Layered Products&quot; licenses. You will want to 
select and to acquire <em>two</em> sets of license PAKs.

<p>
For vendors wishing to license products specifically for hobbyist use 
(and to not issue hobbyist PAKs), the program provides hobbyists with 
the license PAK OPENVMS-HOBBYIST.

<a name="vms11"><h1><font color=maroon>2.9 OpenVMS Ports?  Itanium?  Ports to Intel (IA-32) systems?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_59"></a>

<p>
OpenVMS has been ported to and is operational on three architectures: 
VAX, Alpha, and IA-64. VAX is the oldest, and limited to 32-bit virtual 
and up to 34-bit physical addressing. Alpha and IA-64 architectures are 
both 64-bit architectures, with 64-bit virtual addressing available.

<p>
The most common commodity platform available in the industry is clearly 
the Intel IA-32 series, with 32-bit addressing. Technically, OpenVMS 
and specifically the OpenVMS VAX 32-bit environment is already 
available on IA-32 systems. For information on how this is possible, 
please see one of the available VAX emulator products referenced over 
in <a href="vmsfaq_016.html#vaxemul">Section 13.13</a>.

<p>
As for (the lack of) a native port for IA-32, OpenVMS Engineering 
presently and continues to believe that there would be insufficient 
market (read: profit, customer interest) to justify the cost involved 
in a native port of OpenVMS to systems using the Intel IA-32 
architecture. In addition to the direct costs involved in any port and 
in addition to the substantial effort involved in moving backwards from 
a 64-bit environment on Alpha and on IA-64 to a 32-bit platform (such 
as IA-32), and the exceedingly non-trivial device qualification costs 
and the costs in moving backwards into older PCI and I/O environments 
(IA-32 systems more than a few years old have equivalently aged I/O 
support and buses), each organization and each person maintaining a 
product or a package for OpenVMS will have to justify a port to
<a name="index_x_60"></a>
<a name="index_x_61"></a>
&quot;OpenVMS Pentium&quot; or &quot;OpenVMS Athalon&quot;, akin to the 
decisions and effort involved in porting a product from OpenVMS VAX to 
OpenVMS Alpha, or to OpenVMS I64.

<p>
Platform ports of many of the various products can be easy. Other 
products can depend on platform-specific features, and the associated 
ports can be more involved. Ports of operating systems are very large 
and involved projects. The prerequisite product requirements for a port 
are also non-trivial, as well---compilers in particular are obviously 
required, and the suite of compilers provided must maintain a very high 
degree of source-level compatibility across the platforms. In the case 
of the HP Integrity
<a name="index_x_62"></a>
 port, OpenVMS I64 V8.0 used cross-compilers and cross-tools operating 
 on OpenVMS Alpha systems, while V8.1 is expected to have native 
 compilers available. The OpenVMS I64 port was centrally built using the 
 existing OpenVMS Alpha environment and around the work and the 
 knowledge from the OpenVMS Alpha port, and OpenVMS Engineering fully 
 expects that customers and ISVs will use and will continue to use 
 OpenVMS Alpha systems to assist with their own ports to OpenVMS I64.

<p>
OpenVMS Engineering is well aware of the AMD Opteron AMD64 (64-bit) 
platform, and of terms such as Hammer and Sledgehammer. (At least one 
of the VAX emulators can reportedly utilize the Opteron instruction 
set, please contact the VAX emulator vendor(s) or maintainer(s) for 
assistance and details on their products.) OpenVMS Engineering has also 
heard many of the various &quot;Yamhill&quot; rumors as well.

There are <em>no</em> plans to provide a native port of HP OpenVMS for 
any systems based on AMD Opteron.

<p>
As part of the work leading to the Itanium port, senior engineers had 
extensively evaluated the products and the architectures available 
across the high-end 64-bit computing space, and chosen to target 
Itanium for 64-bit environments---this while under the Compaq 
organization. This included looking at IA-32. HP (a co-developer of 
Itanium with Intel) had seperately chosen to target Intel Itanium for 
its high-end computer products. Compaq then announced plans for the 
future of Alpha
<a name="index_x_72"></a>
through EV79 products and platforms, and HP (entirely seperately) 
announced plans for PA-RISC
<a name="index_x_73"></a>
 products and platforms. The Itanium target has been maintained 
 consistently since the Itanium port was announced by Compaq, and has 
 also been consistently maintained by HP and by the combined company. 
 For those folks prefering to follow the schedules and the product 
 deliveries, OpenVMS Engineering had OpenVMS I64 V8.0 ready (internally) 
 ahead of schedule---and with more features available within the release 
 than had been originally planned for the release. (For information on 
 and for schedules of future OpenVMS releases, please see the roadmap
<a name="index_x_74"></a>
 that is available at the OpenVMS website.)

<p>
OpenVMS I64 itself does not require and does not plan to utilize the 
Itanium IA-32 32-bit environment for the operation of OpenVMS itself. 
OpenVMS I64 V8.0 runs natively on the Itanium processor family, with no 
use of IA-32 instructions; this starting with the initial release of 
OpenVMS I64 V8.0, and the fully-native operations of OpenVMS are 
expected to continue through future releases. While OpenVMS can and 
does support 32-bit applications and addressing on Itanium, this is 
done with sign-extension addressing techniques entirely analogous to 
what was done with 32-bit applications operating in the 64-bit Alpha 
environment.

<p>
But yes, a native IA-32 port or a native AMD Opteron port of OpenVMS 
would certainly be nice to have---this, of course, following the 
traditional Linux preference for having a Linux port available for most 
(all?) computer architectures known, and even for certain high-end 
refrigerators and toasters and similar appliances and appliance-like 
devices. (The downside of this all-encompassing approach: this requires 
near-infinite engineering and support costs from the various vendors 
involved, and the qualification efforts and costs of most 
everything---everywhere. Or reduced or eliminated testing and support 
efforts. Or an unfortunate combination of these two. These costs are 
huge, and the benefits derived from the work are comparatively small 
when given the comparable costs of more targeted (and thus supported 
and supportable) hardware configurations--- the platform targets are 
and must be carefully selected and considered by each vendor. Put 
another way, there are <em>no</em> plans to provide a native port of HP 
OpenVMS for systems based on Intel IA-32 processors, nor for systems 
based on AMD Opteron processors. (There are even still a few computer 
systems and platforms that lack Linux ports, after all.)

<p>
All this material having been written, have you looked at the system 
configurations and pricing of the available HP Integrity Intel Itanium 
systems?
<a name="index_x_77"></a>
<a name="index_x_78"></a>
  Low-end computer hardware is clearly a commodity product, and the 
  systems are priced, serviced, upgraded, and replaced accordingly. Intel 
  Itanium is a commodity microprocessor presently used in platforms 
  available from various hardware vendors, including (obviously) from HP. 
  Further, Itanium is a microprocessor available from and supported by
<a name="index_x_79"></a>
 Intel, a semiconductor vendor known for exceedingly high-volume 
 microprocessor fabrication process and production capabilities.

<p>
For information on supported platforms and processors, please see the 
OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD) at:

OpenVMS typically uses SPD 25.01.xx and/or SPD 41.87.xx.
