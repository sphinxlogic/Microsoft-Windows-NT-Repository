          10.21  How to resolve LINK-I-DATMISCH errors?

                   The message LINK-I-DATMISCH is informational, and
                   indicates that the version of the specified shareable
                   image found in the system shareable image directory
                   does not match the version of the shareable image that
                   was originally loaded into IMAGELIB.OLB, one of the
                   OpenVMS libraries typically searched by the LINKER.

                   From a privileged username, you can usually completely
                   repair this via the following DCL command:

                   $ LIB/REPLACE/SHARE SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB SYS$SHARE:LIBRTL.EXE

                   This command assumes that the shareable image that
                   was found in the SYS$SHARE: area is valid and upward-
                   compatiable, and that the image has simply replaced an
                   older version without also updating IMAGELIB.

          10.22  Compaq C and other OpenVMS C Programming Considerations?

                   VAX C V3.2 was released for OpenVMS VAX systems in
                   1991. DEC C V4.0 replaced VAX C V3.2 in 1993 as the HP
                   C compiler for OpenVMS VAX systems. HP C is the ANSI
                   C compiler for OpenVMS Alpha systems. VAX C predates
                   the ANSI C standards, and has various areas that are
                   not compliant with ANSI C requirements. HP C is an ANSI
                   C compiler, and can also compile most VAX C code when
                   /STANDARD=VAXC is specified. Versions of this compiler
                   between V3.2 and V6.5 (exclusive) were known as DEC C,
                   DIGITAL C, and Compaq C.

                   Both compilers can be installed at the same time on the
                   same OpenVMS VAX system, allowing a migration from VAX
                   C to DEC C, and allowing the same DEC C code to be used
                   on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha.

                   The system manager can choose the system default C
                   compiler when HP C is installed on a system with VAX C,
                   and a C programmer can explicitly select the required
                   compiler for a any particular compilation.

                   A current "C" license PAK allows access to both VAX C
                   and HP C on the same OpenVMS VAX system.

                                                                     10-17

 





                   OpenVMS Programming Information




                   Various HP C versions can be installed on OpenVMS VAX
                   V5.5-2 and later. OpenVMS VAX releases such as V5.5-2
                   and V6.0 will require the installation of a HP C RTL
                   kit, a kit that is included with the HP C compiler.
                   OpenVMS VAX versions V6.1 and later do not require a
                   seperate RTL kit, but HP C RTL ECO kits are available
                   to resolve problems found with the C RTL on various
                   OpenVMS releases.

                   With HP C, for automatic resolution of the standard C
                   library routines by the LINKER utility, use the /PREFIX
                   qualifier, such as /PREFIX=ALL_ENTRIES. If a particular
                   application program replaces an existing C library
                   routine, use /PREFIX=(ALL_ENTRIES,EXCEPT=(...)). (VAX
                   C required explicit specification of an RTL shareable
                   image or C object library during the link.)

                   When the /PREFIX is requested, the compiler generates
                   a "decc$" prefix on the specified symbols. This prefix
                   allows the LINKER to resolve the external symbols
                   against the symbols present in the DECC$SHR library.
                   The DECC$SHR library is included in the IMAGELIB.OLB
                   shareable image library, and IMAGELIB is searched by
                   default when any program (written in any language) is
                   LINKed. Because the standard C library routine names
                   are very likely to match application routines written
                   in other languages, a prefix "decc$" is added to the C
                   symbol names to assure their uniqueness; to prevent
                   symbol naming conflicts. C programs, however, can
                   sometimes have private libraries for various purposes,
                   and the external routines share the same names as
                   the library routines. (This is not recommended, but
                   there are applications around that use this technique.)
                   Thus the need to explicity specify whether or not the
                   "decc$" prefix should be prepended to the external
                   symbol names by the compiler.

                   The qualifiers, and most (all?) with associated
                   pragmas, that may be of interest when migrating VAX
                   C code to HP C include:

                   o  /PREFIX=ALL_ENTRIES

                      As mentioned above. Failure to specificy this
                      qualifier can cause the compiler to not add the
                      prefixes for the names of the C library routines
                      into the references placed in the object module,
                      which can in turn cause problems resolving the
                      external symbols in the library when the object
                      code is linked.

                   o  /ASSUME=WRITABLE_STRING_LITERALS

                      Some VAX C programs erroneously write to the string
                      literals. By default, HP C does not allow the
                      constants to change.

                   o  /SHARE_GLOBALS

                      Enables sharing ("shr") of globals and of extern
                      variables. HP C sets externs as non-shareable
                      ("noshr"), VAX C as "shr".

                   o  /EXTERN_MODE=COMMON_BLOCK

                      VAX C assumes common block model for external
                      linkages.

                   o  /[NO]MEMBER_ALIGNMENT

                      Refers to the padding placed between member elements
                      within a struct. Disabling member alignment packs
                      the data more tightly into memory, but this
                      packaging has performance implications, both on
                      OpenVMS VAX and particularly on OpenVMS Alpha
                      systems.

                   Permit structure members to be naturally aligned
                   whenever possible, and avoid using /NOMEMBER_
                   ALIGNMENT. If you need to disable member alignment,
                   use the equivilent #pragma to designate the specific
                   structures. The alignment of structure members normally
                   only comes into play with specific unaligned data
                   structures-such as the sys$creprc quota itemlist-
                   and with data structures that are using data that was
                   organized by a system using byte or other non-member
                   alignment.

                                                                     10-19

 





                   OpenVMS Programming Information




                   Versions of HP C such as V6.0 include the capability to
                   extract the contents of the standard header libraries
                   into directories such as SYS$SYSROOT:[DECC$LIB...],
                   and provide various logical names that can be defined
                   to control library searches. With HP C versions such
                   as V6.0, the default operations of the compiler match
                   the expectations of most OpenVMS programmers, without
                   requiring any definitions of site-specific library-
                   related logical names. (And logical names left from
                   older DEC C versions can sometimes cause the compiler
                   troubles locating header files.)

                   HP C V5.6 and later include a backport library, a
                   mechanism by which HP C running on older OpenVMS
                   releases can gain access to newer RTL routines added
                   to the RTL in later OpenVMS releases-the language RTLs
                   ship with OpenVMS itself, and not with the compilers.

                   Example C code is available in SYS$EXAMPLES:, in
                   DECW$EXAMPLES (when the DECwindows examples are
                   installed), in TCPIP$SERVICES (or on older releases,
                   UCX$EXAMPLES) when HP TCP/IP Services is installed), on
                   the Freeware CD-ROMs, and at web sites such as

          10.22.1  Other common C issues

                   The localtime()  function and various other functions
                   maintain the number of years since 1900 in the "struct
                   tm" structure member tm_year. This field will contain a
                   value of 100 in the year 2000, 101 for 2001, etc., and
                   the yearly incrementation of this field is expected to
                   continue.

                   The C epoch typically uses a longword (known as time_
                   t) to contain the number of seconds since midnight
                   on 1-Jan-1970. At the current rate of consumption of
                   seconds, this longword is expected to overflow (when
                   interpreted as a signed longword) circa 03:14:07 on

                   10-20

 





                   OpenVMS Programming Information




                   19-Jan-2038 (GMT), as this time is circa 0x7FFFFFFF
                   seconds since the C base date. (The most common
                   solution is to ensure that time_t is an unsigned.)

                   If C does not correctly handle the display of the
                   local system time, then check the UTC configuration
                   on OpenVMS-the most common symptom of this is a skew of
                   one hour (or whatever the local daylight savings time
                   change might be). This skew can be caused by incorrect
                   handling of the "is_dst" setting in the application
                   program, or by an incorrect OpenVMS UTC configuration
                   on the local system. (See section Section 4.4.)

                   Floating point is prohibited in OpenVMS Alpha inner-
                   mode (privileged) code, and in any process or other
                   execution context that does not have floating point
                   enabled. C programmers developing and working with
                   OpenVMS Alpha high-IPL kernel-mode code such as device
                   drivers will want to become familiar with the floating
                   point processing available in the environment, and with
                   the C compiler qualifier /INSTRUCTION_SET=[NO]FLOATING_
                   POINT. Device drivers and other similar kernel-mode C
                   code must be compiled with /INSTRUCTION_SET=FLOATING_
                   POINT and /EXTERN_MODEL=STRICT_REFDEF.

                   Additionally, the SYS$LIBRARY:SYS$LIB_C.TLB/LIBRARY
                   parameter will be needed to be appended to the module
                   specification or declared via the C compiler's include
                   library logical name mechanism when the C compiler is
                   resolving kernel-mode data structures and definitions.
                   This library contains OpenVMS kernel-mode and other
                   system declaractions, and particularly a mixture
                   of undocumented definitions and declarations, and
                   particularly definitions and declarations that are
                   subject to change (and that can accordingly lead to
                   requirements for the recompilation of application
                   code).

          10.22.2  Other common C++ issues

                   HP C++ (a separate compiler from HP C) provides
                   both symbol mangling and symbol decoration. Some
                   of the details of working with longer symbol names
                   and the resulting symbol name mangling in mixed
                   language environments are listed in the shareable
                   image cookbook, and in the C++ documentation. Symbol
                   name decoration permits the overloading of functions
                   (by adding characters to the external symbol for
                   the function to indicate the function return type
                   and the argument data types involved), and mixed-
                   language external references can and often do need to
                   disable this decoration via the extern "C" declaration
                   mechanism:

                         extern "C"
                           {
                           extern int ExternSymbol(void *);
                           extern int OtherExternSymbol(void *);
                           }

                   Also see Section 14.7 for information on /ARCHITECTURE
                   and /OPTIMIZE=TUNE.

                   Constructs such as the order of incrementation or
                   decrementation and the order of argument processing
                   within an argument list are all implementation-defined.
                   This means that C coding constructs such as:

                       i = i++;
                       a[i] = i++;
                       foo( i, i++, --i);

                   are undefined and can have (adverse) implications when
                   porting the C code to another C compiler or to another
                   platform. In general, any combination of ++, -, =, +=,
                   -=, *=, etc operators that will cause the same value to
                   be modified multiple times (between what the ANSI/ISO C
                   standard calls "sequence points") produce undefined and
                   implementation-specific results.

                   Within C, the following are the "sequence points":
                   the ";" at the end of a C statment, the ||, &&, ?:,
                   and comma operators, and a call to a function. Note
                   specifically that = is NOT a sequence point, and that
                   the individual arguments contained within a function
                   argument list can be processed from right to left, from
                   left to right, or at any random whim.

                   HP C for OpenVMS VAX (formerly DEC C) and VAX C do
                   differ in the related processing.

                   So you are looking for OpenVMS-specific definitions
                   (include files)?

                   UCBDEF.H, PCBDEF.H and other OpenVMS-specific
                   definitions-these are considered part of OpenVMS and
                   not part of the C compiler kit-are available on all
                   recent OpenVMS Alpha releases.

                   To reference the version-dependent symbol library
                   sys$share:sys$lib_c.tlb, use a command similar to the
                   following for compilation:

                   $ CC sourcea+SYS$LIBRARY:SYS$LIB_C/LIB

                   You can also define DECC$TEXT_LIBRARY to reference the
                   library.

                   You will want to review the Programming Concepts
                   manual, and specifically take a quick look at Chapter
                   21.

                                                                     10-23

                   And some general background: the STARLET definitions
                   (and thus the sys$starlet_c.tlb library) contain the
                   symbols and the definitions that are independent of
                   the OpenVMS version. The LIB definitions (and thus
                   sys$lib_c) contain symbols and definitions that can
                   be dependent on the OpenVMS version. You won't need to
                   rebuild your code after an OpenVMS upgrade if you have
                   included definitions from STARLET. The same cannot be
                   said for some of the definitions in LIB-you might need
                   to rebuild your code. (The UCB structure can and has
                   changed from release to release, for instance.)

                   Recent versions of C automatically search sys$starlet_
                   c.tlb. Explicit specification of sys$lib_c.tlb is
                   required.

                   The use of a longword for off_t restricts applications

                   less, or these applications must use native RMS or XQP

                   DECthreads V7.3 and the HP C compiler (also known as
                   Compaq C and DEC C) V6.4 are presently expected to
                   be the last updates and the last releases of these
                   development packages for use on OpenVMS VAX. The run-
                   time support for both DECthreads (CMA$RTL) and for C
                   (DECC$CRTL) will continue to be maintained, and will
                   continue to be available on OpenVMS VAX. The VAX C
                   V3.2 compiler is the final VAX C compiler release for
                   OpenVMS VAX, and the VAX C Run-Time Library (VAXCRTL)
                   will also continue to be available.

          11.1  How do I let someone else display something on my
                workstation?

                   On a workstation, you will want to use the "Customize"
                   menu of the session manager utility and select
                   "Security". When the pop-up box appears, you can
                   select the host node, username, and tranport that will
                   allow you to launch an application that targets the
                   workstation display.

                   If this does not provide you with access to the
                   display, You need a checklist of sorts:

                   o  Make sure that you've specified the X-windows
                      "display" correctly on the remote host. For a
                      DECnet transport, the specification uses two colons,
                      while the TCP/IP transport typically uses one. The
                      X Windows server and the X Windows screen follow
                      the host specification, delimited by a period. For
                      example:

                   csh

                             # setenv DISPLAY vms.domain:0.0

                   sh and ksh

                             # $ DISPLAY=vms.domain:0.0 ; export DISPLAY

                   DCL

                             $ SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=vms.domain -
          ___________________/TRANSPORT=TCPIP/SERVER=server/SCREEN=screen_

                   o  If you have verified the command is correct and
                      things are still not working, ensure the Security
                      settings on the OpenVMS host side will allow the

                                                                      11-1

                      incoming connection: Pull down the "Options" menu
                      in the Session Manager, and select "Security...". If
                      you do not find your host and username and transport
                      listed among the authorized users, you will need to
                      add an entry.

                     o  There are various transports available, including
                        LOCAL, DECNET, LAT, and TCPIP. You must Select
                        the transport appropriate to the incoming
                        connection.

                     o  If the transport is "DECnet", do NOT add the
                        double colon (::) to the node name.

                     o  If the transport is "TCPIP", "Username" must
                        be an asterisk (*). Why? Because unlike DECnet,
                        the TCP/IP protocol does not provide the remote
                        username information in the incoming connection.

                     o  If the connection is "TCPIP", it is best to use
                        a full domain name (e.g. Node.Subd.Domain).
                        However, you may have to use the IP address
                        itself, if your host does not have a way to
                        resolve the address via DNS. If you have the
                        luxury of fixed addresses (eg: you are not using
                        DHCP), then it can be helpful to add two entries
                        for each TCP/IP host, one that specifies the host
                        name and one that specifies the host address.

                     o  There are various TCP/IP packages for OpenVMS,
                        and you must use syntax appropriate to the
                        transport installed.

                     o  If a TCP/IP connection is still not working,
                        ensure that the transport you want has been
                        activated for use with DECwindows. See
                        Section 11.15 for details of configuring TCP/IP
                        as a transport.

                   o  There is a log file created in SYS$MANAGER: which
                      can tell you which transports are loaded, and
                      also tell you what connect attempts were rejected,
                      including showing what the presented credentials
                      were. This file is SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_
                      ERROR.LOG, although the 0 could be another number
                      if you have multiple servers on the workstation. I

                      have found this file to be very useful for tracking
                      down what needs to be put in the Session Manager
                      Security entries.

          __________________________________________________________
          11.2  How do I create a display on another workstation?

                   To create a display from an OpenVMS host to a remote X
                   Windows display, use one of the following DCL commands:

                   $ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=net_transport /NODE=remote_node
                   $ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=LAT /NODE=remote_node
                   $ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=DECnet /NODE=remote_node
                   $ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=TCPIP /NODE=remote_node

                   Note that LAT is typically used only for the VXT series
                   X Windows terminals, but it can also be used from
                   OpenVMS to OpenVMS systems on various OpenVMS releases,
                   such as on OpenVMS Alpha V6.1 and later. For details on
                   configuring the TCP/IP transport, see Section 11.15.

                   If you are interested in X Windows terminals and have
                   an older VAXstation system around, please see the EWS
                   package on Freeware V5.0.

          __________________________________________________________
          11.3  How can I get the information from SHOW DISPLAY into a
                symbol?

                   Use the undocumented SHOW DISPLAY/SYMBOL, and then
                   reference the symbols DECW$DISPLAY_NODE, DECW$DISPLAY_
                   SCREEN, DECW$DISPLAY_SERVER and/or DECW$DISPLAY_
                   TRANSPORT.

                   An example of calling the underlying (and also
                   undocumented) sys$qio programming interface for the
                   WSDRIVER (WSAn:) is available at:

                   http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/

          11.4  How do I get a log of a DECterm session?

                   If you are working from a Decterm, you can use the
                   AutoPrint feature. Choose the "Printer..." menu item
                   from the "Options" menu, set the printing destination
                   to the name of the file you want, and set "Auto Print
                   Mode". You are now free to continue.

                   It should be noted that all of the characters and
                   escape sequences are captured, but if you display the
                   resulting log file on a DECterm, then you will see
                   exactly what was originally displayed.

          __________________________________________________________
          11.5  Why does the DELETE key delete forward instead of
                backward?

                   This involves the Motif virtual key bindings. When
                   a Motif application starts, it looks at the vendor
                   string returned in the display connection information
                   and attempts to match the string to a table of virtual
                   bindings.

                   You can override the default bindings in your
                   decw$xdefaults.dat file. Here is the entry you would
                   make to get the default VMS bindings.

                   First check to see if there is a graphics device,
                   usually a G* device. (eg: On a DEC 2000 model 300,

                      (for Tru64 UNIX and OpenVMS) and reboot. This is
                      necessary only on EISA-based systems.

                   o  You have an EISA-based system (such as the DEC
                      2000 model 300) and do not have a HP (Compaq)
                      QVision video card. This EISA graphics card should
                      have Compaq printed on it, and identifies itself
                      as a CPQ3011 or a CPQ3111. If it is not one of
                      these two EISA devices, then OpenVMS does not
                      support it. (There are no other supported EISA
                      graphics controllers, and EISA graphics are normally
                      used with DECwindows only on the DEC 2000 series
                      systems.)

                   o  You have a PCI-based system, and do not have a
                      supported graphics controller-examples of supported
                      controllers include the following:

                      See Section 5.15 for further information on some of
                      these graphics controllers.

                   o  You have booted the system minimally, or have
                      otherwise disabled the device autoconfiguration
                      process.

                   If there is a G* graphics device present:

                   o  There may have been a severe error in the
                      DECwindows startup. Type the contents of
                      SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_ERROR.LOG for any
                      information on errors starting the server.

                   o  The system parameter WINDOW_SYSTEM is not set to
                      1. While this was a common way for system managers
                      to disable the DECwindows server startup, it is
                      not particularly reliable as DECwindows can now
                      "correct" this setting.

                      loaded. To check for the two most common types of
                      Motif product authorization keys (PAKs), use the
                      following DCL commands:

                      $ LICENSE LIST NET-APP-SUP*/FULL

                      and examine the information displayed. Make sure
                      that one of these licenses is present, valid and

                      Section 5.5.2.

                   o  Check that the DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM is
                      correct for the graphics controller in use. For
                      instance:

          11.7  How do I set the title on a DECterm window?

                   If you are creating a new DECterm window, check

                   $ HELP CREATE /TERMINAL /WINDOW_ATTRIBUTES

                   If you want to change the title of an existing window,
                   use the following control sequences, where <esc> is the
                   ANSI escape code, value decimal 27, and "text label" is
                   what you want to display:

                   To set the DECterm title, send:

          <esc>
                   ]21;text label<esc>\

                   To set the icon label, send:

          <esc>
                   ]2L;text label<esc>\

                   To set both the DECterm title and icon to the full
                   device name:

                   $  esc[0,7] = 27
                   $  fulldevnam = F$Edit(F$GetDVI("TT","FULLDEVNAM"),"UPCASE,COLLAPSE")
                   $  write sys$output esc+ "]21;" + fulldevnam + esc + "\"
                   $  write sys$output esc+ "]2L;" + fulldevnam + esc + "\"

                   You can also change the title and the icon using the
                   Options-Window... menu.

                   Also see Section 12.1 and Section 8.11.

          11.8  How do I customize DECwindows, including the login screen?

                   To customize various DECwindows Motif characteristics

                   attributes, see the example file:

                   $ SYS$STARTUP:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.TEMPLATE

                   This example template file is typically copied over
                   to the filename SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]DECW$PRIVATE_
                   APPS_SETUP.COM and then modified to meet site-specific
                   requirements.

                   Additionally, various X tools such as xsetroot, bitmap
                   and xrdb-some these can be useful in customizing the
                   appearance of an application or of the DECwindows Motif
                   display-are provided in the DECW$UTILS: area.

                   When using DECwindows V1.2-4 and later on OpenVMS
                   Alpha, the default desktop is the Common Desktop
                   Environment (CDE). You can select your preferred
                   desktop (CDE or DECwindows Motif) when logging in,
                   or you can change the default to the DECwindows
                   Motif desktop using the DCL symbol decw$start_new_
                   desktop in the DECwindows private application setup
                   command procedure. See SYS$STARTUP:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_
                   SETUP.TEMPLATE for further details, and how to create
                   DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM.

                   Note that with DECwindows CDE, the root window is
                   no longer visible by default. The root window is
                   hidden behind the "backdrop" window of the current
                   CDE workspace. To make the root window visible, use the
                   CDE style manager selection "backdrop none", and use
                   information such as that in the OpenVMS FAQ to set the
                   root window.

                   To add a new backdrop to the DECwindows CDE
                   environment, the backdrop must first be in or be
                   converted into X11 pixmap format. (This conversion
                   is often possible using tools such as xv.) Then (if
                   necessary) create the default backdrop directory
                   SYS$COMMON:[CDE$DEFAULTS.USER.BACKDROPS]. Place the
                   X11 pixmap file containing the desired image into the
                   backdrops directory, ensure that it has a filename
                   extension of .PM. (The xv default filename extension
                   for the X11 pixmap file is .XPM, while CDE expects
                   only to see files with .PM.) Now invoke the CDE style
                   manager and select a new backdrop. You will find

                                                                      11-9

          11.9  Why doesn't XtAppAddInput() work on OpenVMS?

                   Yes, XtAppAddInput()  does work on OpenVMS. The MIT
                   definition of the X Windows call XtAppAddInput()
                   includes platform-specific arguments.

                   On platforms where C is the typically the primary
                   programming language for the platform, the file
                   descriptor mask is one of the arguments to the
                   XtAppAddInput()  call.

                   On OpenVMS, the platform-specific arguments to this
                   call include an event flag and an IOSB, as these are
                   the traditional OpenVMS constructs used to synchronize
                   the completion of asynchronous operations. While it
                   would be easier to port non-OpenVMS C code that calls
                   XtAppAddInput()  over to OpenVMS if the arguments
                   included the C file descriptor, this would make the
                   call unusable from other OpenVMS languages, and would
                   make it extremely difficult to use OpenVMS features
                   such as ASTs and sys$qio calls.

                   One restriction on the event flag: the event flag
                   chosen must be from event flag cluster zero. When using
                   the traditional lib$get_ef and lib$free_ef calls to
                   allocate and deallocate event flags, you must first
                   explicitly call lib$free_ef to free up some event flags
                   in event flag cluster zero. Please see the event flag
                   documentation for specific details on these calls and
                   for specific event flags that can be freed in event
                   flag cluster zero.

                   Here is some example code that covers calling this
                   routine on OpenVMS:

                   Congratulations, you have just stumbled into "dead

          11.13  How can I reset the warning bell volume?

                   With DECwindows CDE drivers and ECOs starting with ECOs
                   for the DECwindows keyboard driver SYS$IKBDRIVER.EXE
                   in OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2 and V7.2-1 and with the
                   SYS$IKBDRIVER.EXE included in OpenVMS V7.2-1H1 and
                   later, the DECwindows CDE controls will now correctly
                   manage the setting of the warning bell volume.

                   Unfortunately, the equivalent controls in the older
                   DECwindows Motif interface are not compatible and can
                   no longer manage the warning bell volume.

                   If you need to manage the volume with DECwindows Motif,
                   consider using the following approach:

                   $ @decw$utils:decw$define_utils
                   $ xset b 1 100 100

                   The numerics are the volume, pitch, and duration,
                   respectively.

                   Why? When OpenVMS first started supporting the PC-style
                   keyboards, the X Windows Server and the keyboard driver
                   interface did not support the pitch and duration, and
                   neither did DECwindows Motif. The DECwindows keyboard
                   driver was accordingly changed to use the volume from
                   the keyclick setting (keyclick is not available in
                   a PC-style keyboard) and the bell volume setting to
                   control the pitch and duration.

                   DECwindows CDE does provide sliders for setting pitch
                   and duration, so the keyboard driver and X Windows
                   Server were modified to provide all of the information,
                   and now the DECwindows CDE sliders work. This change is
                   unfortunately incompatible with the old scheme used on
                   the pre-CDE desktops, and the volume controls are now
                   incompatible with the current keyboard drivers. Hence
                   the use of xset.

          11.14  How can I alter the DECwindows CDE backdrop?

                   To select a separate backdrop to be displayed on each
                   screen using DECwindows CDE:

                   o  Click on the Application Manager. This is the drawer
                      icon on the CDE toolbar.

                   o  Click on Desktop Tools

                   o  Click on Set Default Screen and select the required
                      screen

                   o  Click on the Style Manager. This is the one
                      containing the mouse and ttt on the CDE toolbar

                   o  Now change the background.

          11.15  How can I enable the DECwindows TCP/IP Transport

                   To configure the TCP/IP transport for DECwindows,
                   first ensure that a TCP/IP package is installed and
                   configured. Then set the DCL symbol DECW$SERVER_
                   TRANSPORTS in SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_
                   SETUP.COM to the appropriate local value, based on
                   the comments in that file. If you do not have a copy of
                   SYS$STARTUP:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM, the use the
                   following COPY command to create this file based on the
                   provided template file:

          12.1  Where can I find information on escape and control
                sequences?

                   Information on escape and control sequences can be
                   found in the OpenVMS I/O User's Reference Manual, in
                   the chapter on the terminal driver. The chapter also
                   includes details on the general format and content of
                   these sequences.

                   Specific details on the escape and control sequences
                   supported by a particular serial device are typically
                   found in the documentation provided with the specific
                   device. Information on the sequences supported by
                   DECwindows DECterm terminal emulator are included in
                   the DECwindows documentation.

                   Examples of common escape and control sequences-
                   those typically used by the OpenVMS screen management
                   package-can be found in the OpenVMS system file
                   SYS$SYSTEM:SMGTERMS.TXT.

                   The following refers to the function keys on the LK-
                   series keyboards found on the VT-series terminals such
                   as the VT220 and VT510, and the LK-series keyboards
                   found on the OpenVMS workstations, and the keyboards
                   found on compatible terminals. (Though note that the
                   keyboard itself does not generate the sequence, the
                   terminal or terminal emulator generates the sequence
                   in response to user input.) In the following, {CSI} is
                   decimal code 155 and can be replaced by the sequence
                   "{ESC}[" (without the quotes) particularly for seven-
                   bit operations, SS3 is decimal code 143 and can be
                   replaced by "{ESC}O" particularly for seven-bit
                   operations. Older VT1xx series terminals and any
                   other terminals operating with seven-bit characters
                   should not be sent eight-bit operators such as {CSI}
                   and {SS3}.

          12.2  Does DECprint (DCPS) work with the LRA0 parallel port?

                   The parallel printing port LRA0: found on many
                   OpenVMS Alpha systems is capable of some bidirectional
                   communications, with enough for basic operations with
                   most parallel printers.

                   DECprint (DCPS) requires more than just the simple
                   handshaking provided by the LRA0: port, therefore DCPS
                   does not work with the LRA0: port.

          12.3  How do I check for free space on a (BACKUP) tape?

                   You cannot know for certain, though you can certainly
                   estimate the remaining capacity.

                   Tape media is different than disk media, as disks
                   have a known and pre-determined fixed capacity. Modern
                   disks also appear logically perfect, based on bad block
                   revectoring support and the extra blocks hidden within
                   the disk structure for these bad block replacements.

                   The capacity of tape media is not nearly as pre-
                   determined, and the capacity can vary across different
                   tape media (slightly different media lengths or
                   different foil markers or other variations, for
                   instance) and even on the same media over time (as bad
                   spots in the media arise). Tapes can vary the amount of
                   recording media required, depending on the remaining
                   length of the tape, the numbers of correctable and
                   uncorrectable media errors that might occur, the
                   numbers and sizes of the inter-record gaps and related
                   tape structure overhead, the particular media error
                   recovery chosen, the tape density, the efficiently of
                   any data compression in use, and the storage overhead
                   required by BACKUP, tar, and other similar commands.

                   BACKUP using with the default settings results in
                   approximately 15% overhead, in terms of saveset size.
                   (eg: Assuming a 500 KB input, the total size would be
                   575 KB.)

                   Assuming no compression:
                   4 GB media / 575 KB saveset = 7294 savesets

                                                                      12-3

 





                   Miscellaneous Information




                   Assuming 1:2 compression:
                   8 GB media / 575 KB saveset = 14588 savesets

                   Note: There are no inter-record gaps on DAT tapes.
                   (When determining media capacity, you have to consider
                   these with nine-track magtape media. Not with DAT
                   (DDS). However, the block structure underneath
                   the variable length record recording is based on a
                   block size of circa 124 KB. Further, writing doubles
                   filemarks and such can cause a loss of up to the
                   underlying block size. Thus even though there are no
                   inter-record gaps on DAT, larger savesets are still
                   usually best.

                   The compression algorithms used on various devices are
                   generally not documented-further, there is no way to
                   calculate the effective data compression ratio, the
                   tape mark overhead, and similar given just the data
                   to be stored on tape-short of actually trying it, of
                   course.

                   A typical compression ratio found with "everyday" data
                   is somewhere around 1:1.8 to 1:2.

                   Note: OpenVMS often uses the term COMPACTION for
                   compression control, as in the qualifier /MEDIA_
                   FORMAT=COMPACTION.

          12.4  So what happened to sys$cmsuper?

                   There is no SYS$CMSUPR service.

                   The typical wisdom for getting into supervisor access
                   mode (from user mode) is to execute a routine in
                   executive mode (via a call to SYS$CMEXEC and the
                   appropriate privilege) and then issue a SYS$DCLAST with
                   the ASTADR parameter pointing to your routine entry
                   point and the ACMODE parameter specified as PSL$C_
                   SUPER.

                   Alternatively, you can reset mode in the call stack
                   return path and unwind from executive or kernel out
                   into supervisor mode.

          __________________________________________________________
          12.5  Correctly using license PAKs and LMF?

                   If you have multiple LMF$LICENSE.LDB databases in
                   your OpenVMS Cluster, then each and every PAK must
                   be installed in each and every license database present
                   in an OpenVMS Cluster. Even if you use /EXCLUDE or
                   /INCLUDE, you need to have a consistent set of PAKs
                   registered across all licensing databases present in
                   the OpenVMS Cluster.

                   If your software license permits it, you can use the
                   following two commands to transfer license PAKs:

                   $ LICENSE COPY...
                   $ LICENSE ISSUE/PROCEDURE/OUTPUT=file product,...

                   To display the particular license(s) required (such as
                   when you receive a NOLICENSE error), use the following
                   DCL sequence:

                   $ SET PROCESS/PRIVILEGE=ALL
                   $ REPLY/ENABLE
                   $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE LMF$DISPLAY_OPCOM_MESSAGE

                   This logical name will cause all license failures
                   to generate OPCOM messages, and this will hopefully
                   show which license(s) you need- there may well also
                   be additional license failures displayed, as various
                   products can check for and can be enabled by multiple
                   license PAKs. You will want to deassign this logical
                   name when done.

                   Some of the more common license PAKs:

                     DECnet Phase IV:   DVNETRTG, DVNETEND, DVNETEXT, or NET-APP-SUP*
                     DECnet-Plus:       DVNETRTG, DVNETEND, DVNETEXT, or NET-APP-SUP*
                     TCP/IP Services:   UCX, or NET-APP-SUP*
                     OpenVMS Alpha:     OPENVMS-ALPHA and OPENVMS-ALPHA-USER
                     OpenVMS VAX:       VAX-VMS
                     OpenVMS Galaxy:    OPENVMS-GALAXY
                     Cluster (Alpha):   VMSCLUSTER, NET-APP-SUP*
                     Cluster (VAX):     VAXCLUSTER, NET-APP-SUP*


                                                                      12-5

 





                   Miscellaneous Information




                   Various NET-APP-SUP (NAS) license packages are
                   available, each with differing collections of products
                   authorized. See the various NAS Software Product
                   Description (SPD) documents for specific details.

                   o  http://www.compaq.com/info/spd/
                      OpenVMS typically uses SPD 25.01.xx and/or SPD
                      41.87.xx.

                   To determine which license PAK is failing (via a
                   license check failure OPCOM message), use the command:

                   $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE LMF$DISPLAY_OPCOM_MESSAGE TRUE

                   Realize that defining this logical name will
                   cause license checks that are otherwise hidden
                   (unimplemented, latent, or part of a check for any
                   of a series of licenses) to become visible. In other
                   words, expect to see some spurious license check calls
                   when you define this.

                   For information on PAKGEN and on generating license
                   PAKs, please see Section 10.10.

                      As of this writing, the port only runs on OpenVMS
                      Alpha, but an investigation of an OpenVMS VAX port
                      is reportedly under consideration.

                      interactive manipulation of images. The package
                      includes tools for image conversion, annotation,
                      compositing, animation, and creating montages.
                      ImageMagick can read and write many of the more
                      popular image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, XPM,

                      Also available on the Freeware.

                      Beware: the XPDF tool included on OpenVMS Freeware
                      V4.0 is dated, and has been found to have various
                      bugs. Use the Freeware V5.0 version of the XPDF kit,
                      or later.

                      A Java-based PDF viewer is available from Adobe,
                      and is known to operate on recent OpenVMS Alpha

                      on the Freeware.

                   o  An Archie clone is available at INFO.CS.PUB.RO.
                      Telnet to that machine, and login as VMSARCI. It
                      contains now listings for over 30 ftp servers with
                      over 14 gigabytes of OpenVMS software.

                      The most useful commands are LIST, which generates a
                      list of scanned ftp servers, and FIND string, whichs
                      looks for a file containing "string" in the name;
                      the search modes are only "substring" [default] and
                      "exact", and regex search is not supported (so FIND
                      EMACS will work, but FIND *EMACS* or FIND *EMACS*.*
                      will not). The search is case-insensitive.

                      The maintainer of the site (stfp@roipb.cs.ipb.ro)
                      requests that anyone submit notifications of FTP
                      servers with OpenvMS software that are not listed on
                      the site.
