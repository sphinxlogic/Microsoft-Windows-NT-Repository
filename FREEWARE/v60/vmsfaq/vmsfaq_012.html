<a name="prog9"><h1><font color=maroon>10.9 How do I get the argument count in a Fortran routine?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_717"></a>

<p>
On VAX, many programmers would use a MACRO routine which accessed the 
AP register
<a name="index_x_718"></a>
<a name="index_x_719"></a>
of the caller to get the address of the argument list and hence the 
argument count. This was not guaranteed to work on VAX, but usually 
did. However, it doesn't work at all on OpenVMS Alpha, as there is no 
AP register. On Alpha systems, you must use a language's built-in 
function to retrieve the argument count, if any. In Fortran this is 
IARGCOUNT, which is also available in DEC Fortran on OpenVMS VAX.
<a name="index_x_720"></a>
<a name="index_x_721"></a>

<p>
Note that omitting arguments to Fortran routines is non-standard and is 
unsupported. It will work in many cases - read the DEC Fortran release 
notes for additional information.

<a name="prog10"><h1><font color=maroon>10.10 How do I get a unique system ID for licensing purposes?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_722"></a>

<p>
Many software developers desire to use a unique hardware ID to 
&quot;lock&quot; a given copy of their product to a specific system. 
Most VAX and Alpha systems do not have a unique hardware-set 
&quot;system ID&quot; that can be used for this purpose. HP OpenVMS 
products do not use hardware IDs in the licensing methods, as many 
users consider a hardware-based licensing scheme to be negative 
attribute when considering software purchases.
<a name="index_x_723"></a>
<a name="index_x_724"></a>
<a name="index_x_725"></a>

<p>
HP OpenVMS uses a software-based system called the License Management 
Facility (LMF). This provides for software keys (Product Authorization 
Keys or PAKS) which support capacity and user-based license checking. 
HP offers an LMF PAK Generator to CSA members---see <a href="vmsfaq_002.html#vms14">Section 2.12</a>.
<a name="index_x_726"></a>
<a name="index_x_727"></a>
<a name="index_x_728"></a>
<a name="index_x_729"></a>
<a name="index_x_730"></a>

<p>
For information on licensing, please see <a href="vmsfaq_014.html#misc20">Section 12.5</a>.

<p>
However, if a hardware-based method is required, the most common method 
is based on an Ethernet adaptor hardware address. Sample source code 
for implementing this is available at:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/wizard/
</ul>

<a name="prog11"><h1><font color=maroon>10.11 What is an executable, shareable, system or UWSS image?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_733"></a>

<p>
Executable code in OpenVMS typically resides in an image---an image is 
a file---the file extension is typically .EXE---that contains this 
code. Common types of images include executable images, shareable 
images, system images, and protected (UWSS) images.
<a name="index_x_734"></a>
<a name="index_x_735"></a>

<p>
Executable images are programs that can be directly executed. These 
images can grant enhanced privileges, with an INSTALL
<a name="index_x_736"></a>
      of the image with /PRIVILEGE, or can grant enhanced access with the 
      specification of a subsystem identifier on the ACL associated with the 
      image.
<a name="index_x_737"></a>
<a name="index_x_738"></a>

<p>
Shareable images contain code executed indirectly, these images are 
referenced from executable images and/or from other shareable images. 
These images can not grant enhanced privileges, even with the use of 
INSTALL with /PRIVILEGE
<a name="index_x_739"></a>
<a name="index_x_740"></a>
<a name="index_x_741"></a>
       or a subsystem identifier. These shareable images can be dynamically 
       activated (a LINK that occurs at run-time) via the 
       LIB$FIND_IMAGE_SYMBOL run-time library (RTL) routine.
<a name="index_x_742"></a>
       (See `protected images' for information on `privileged shareable 
       images'.)
<a name="index_x_743"></a>
<a name="index_x_744"></a>

<p>
System images are intended to run directly on the VAX or Alpha 
hardware---these are normally used for the kernel code that comprises 
an operating system.
<a name="index_x_745"></a>
<a name="index_x_746"></a>
<a name="index_x_747"></a>
<a name="index_x_748"></a>
<a name="index_x_749"></a>

<p>
Protected images---also refered to as User-Written System Services 
(UWSS), or as privileged shareable images---are similiar in some ways 
to a standard shareable images, but these images include a `change 
mode' handler, and execute in an `inner' processor mode (privileged 
mode; executive or kernel), and code executing in inner modes has 
implicit SETPRV privilege. Must be INSTALLed with /PROTECT. Note that 
inner-mode code has restrictions around calling library routines, 
around calling various system services, and around calling code located 
in other protected or shareable images.
<a name="index_x_750"></a>
<a name="index_x_751"></a>
<a name="index_x_752"></a>
<a name="index_x_753"></a>
<a name="index_x_754"></a>

<p>
Loadable images and device drivers are images that can be used to add 
code into the OpenVMS kernel. Pseudo-device drivers are a particularly 
convenient way to add executable code, with associated driver-defined 
data structures, into the kernel. The pseudo-device driver includes the 
UCB and DDB data structures,
<a name="index_x_755"></a>
<a name="index_x_756"></a>
   and a calling interface with support for both privileged and 
   unprivileged access to the driver code via sys$qio[w] calls.
<a name="index_x_757"></a>
<a name="index_x_758"></a>

<p>
A cookbook approach to creating OpenVMS shareable images is available 
at the URL:

<a name="prog12"><h1><font color=maroon>10.12 How do I do a file copy from a program?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_761"></a>

<p>
There are several options available for copying files from within a 
program. Obvious choices include using lib$spawn(), system(), 
sys$sndjbc() or sys$creprc() to invoke a DCL COPY command. Other common 
alternatives include using the callable convert routines and the BACKUP 
application programming interface (V7.1 and later).
<a name="index_x_762"></a>

<a name="prog13"><h1><font color=maroon>10.13 What is a descriptor?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_768"></a>

<p>
A descriptor is a data structure that describes a string or an array. 
Each descriptor contains information that describes the type of the 
data being referenced, the size of the data, and the address of the 
data. It also includes a description of the storage used for the data, 
typically static or dynamic. Descriptors are passed by reference.

<p>
The following are examples of creating and using descriptors in C, with 
the use of the angle brackets normally expected by the C include 
statements deliberately altered in deference to HTML:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
    #include {descrip.h} 
    #include {lib$routines.h} 
    #include {stsdef.h} 
    int RetStat; 
    char TxtBuf[TXTSIZ] 
    struct dsc$descriptor StaticDsc = 
      { 0, DSC$K_DTYPE_T, DSC$K_CLASS_S, NULL }; 
    struct dsc$descriptor DynDsc = 
      { 0, DSC$K_DTYPE_T, DSC$K_CLASS_D, NULL }; 
    int DynDscLen = 255; 
    $DESCRIPTOR( ConstDsc, "This is a string" ); 
 
    /* finish setting up a static descriptor */ 
    StaticDsc.dsc$w_length      = TXTSIZ; 
    StaticDsc.dsc$a_pointer     = (void *) TxtBuf; 
 
    /* finish setting up a dynamic descriptor */ 
    RetStat = lib$sget1_dd( &amp;DynDscLen, &amp;DynDsc ); 
    if ( !$VMS_STATUS_SUCCESS( RetStat ) ) 
      return RetStat; 
 
    /* release the dynamic storage */ 
    RetStat = lib$sfree1_dd( &amp;DynDsc ); 
    if (!$VMS_STATUS_SUCCESS( RetStat )) 
      return RetStat; 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_769"></a>
<a name="index_x_770"></a>
<a name="index_x_771"></a>

<p>
Static descriptors reference storage entirely under application program 
control, and the contents of the descriptor data structure can be 
modified as required (by the application). OpenVMS routines do not 
modify the contents of a static descriptor, nor do they alter the 
address or length values stored in the static descriptor. (The term 
"static" refers to the descriptor data structure, and not necessarily 
to the storage referenced by the descriptor.)

<p>
Dynamic descriptors reference storage under the control of the run-time 
library, and the contents of a dynamic descriptor data structure---once 
initialized---can only be modified under control of run-time library 
routines. The dynamic storage referenced by the dynamic descriptor is 
allocated and maintained by the run-time library routines. Various 
OpenVMS routines do alter the contents of the descriptor data 
structure, changing the value for the amount and the address of the 
storage associated with the dynamic descriptor, as required. Routines 
can obviously access and alter the contents of the storage referenced 
by the descriptor.

<p>
OpenVMS languages that include support for strings or arrays are 
expected to use descriptors for the particular structure. Most OpenVMS 
languages, such as Fortran and BASIC, use descriptors entirely 
transparently. Some, like DEC C, require the programmer to explicitly 
create and maintain the descriptor.

<p>
For further information on string descriptors, see the <em>OpenVMS 
Programming Concepts</em> manual, part of the OpenVMS documentation set.

<p>
Fortran defaults to passing integers by reference and characters by 
descriptor. The following sites discuss mixing Fortran and C source 
code in the same application:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hhs.dk/anonymous/pub/vms/misc/FORTRAN_C_CALL.COM
  <li>ftp://ftp.hhs.dk/pub/vms/misc/FORTRAN_C_CALL.COM
</ul>

<a name="prog16"><h1><font color=maroon>10.14 How do I create a process under another username?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_772"></a>

<p>
Many server processes can operate within the context of the target user 
using privileges, using calls such as sys$chkpro and (more commonly in 
this context) sys$check_access as needed to determine if access would 
be permitted for the specified user within the current security model.

<p>
With OpenVMS V6.2 and later, the persona system services 
(SYS$PERSONA_*) can be used to assume the persona of the specified 
user---these allow the server to operate as the specified user, in a 
controlled fashion. The persona services can be used as a "wrapper" 
around a sys$creprc process creation call, as well---this will create a 
seperate process entirely under the assumed persona.

<p>
Information on the persona system services is included in the OpenVMS 
V6.2 new features documentation, and in the OpenVMS V7.1 and later 
system services documentation. These system services exist and are 
supported in OpenVMS V6.2 and later releases.

<p>
Typical mechanisms for creating a process under another username 
include:

<ul>
  <li>personna services around a sys$creprc call. See above.
  <li>via DECnet task-to-task, using explicit specification of username 
  and password, or using a DECnet proxy. This creates a network-mode job 
  under the target user. The network-mode job might do little more than a 
  RUN/DETACH of an image passed in via task-to-task---task-to-task 
  communications are fully available using strictly DCL-to-DCL 
  processing, or using a compiled language and DCL, etc.)
  <li>SUBMIT/USER, or the username argument on the sys$sndjbc call. This 
  creates a batch-mode job under the specified username. The batch-mode 
  job might do little more than a RUN/DETACH of an image passed in via a 
  parameter.
  <li>the UIC argument on the sys$creprc call. This mimics the UIC of the 
  target user, and is certainly not the prefered mechanism for this task.
  <li>Via pseudo-terminals...
</ul>

<p>
There are likely a few other mechanisms around... There are various 
tools available from DECUS and other sources that allow various forms 
of user impersonation, as well. These tools will require 
version-dependent kernel code and enhanced privileges for some of (or 
all of) their operations.

<a name="prog17"><h1><font color=maroon>10.15 Why do lib$spawn, lib$set_symbol fail in detached processes?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_773"></a>

<p>
The processing within run-time library (RTL) calls such as lib$attach, 
lib$disable_ctrl, lib$do_command, lib$enable_ctrl, lib$get_symbol, 
lib$run_program, lib$set_symbol, lib$set_logical, and lib$spawn, is 
dependent on and requires the presence of a command language 
interpreter (CLI), such as DCL. Without a CLI present in the current 
process, these calls will fail with a "NOCLI, no CLI present to perform 
function" error.

<p>
Detached processes typically do not have a CLI present.

<p>
In place of lib$spawn, sys$creprc can often be used. The context of the 
parent process (symbols and logical names) will not be propogated into 
the subprocess when sys$creprc is used, though when there is no CLI 
present in the process this (lack of) propogation is moot.

<p>
To create a detached process with a CLI, you must specify LOGINOUT as 
the target image as discussed elsewhere in the FAQ, or only use these 
calls (and any other calls requiring a CLI) from images that are 
running in an "interactive", "batch", or "other" mode process.

<p>
Also note that the lib$spawn and the C system call will fail in a 
CAPTIVE login environment. The lib$spawn call can be gotten to work in 
this environment with the specification of the TRUSTED flag.

<a name="prog18"><h1><font color=maroon>10.16 Where can I obtain Bliss, and the libraries and supporting files?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_774"></a>

<a name="prog19"><h1><font color=maroon>10.17 How can I open a file for shared access?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_798"></a>

<p>
When creating a file, it is often useful to allow other applications 
and utilities---such as TYPE---to share read access to the file. This 
permits you to examine the contents of a log file, for instance.

<p>
A C source example that demonstrates how to do this is available in 
topic (2867) in the OpenVMS Ask The Wizard area:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/wizard/
</ul>

<a name="index_x_799"></a>
<a name="index_x_800"></a>

<p>
Depending on the environment, you may need to use C calls such as fsync 
and fflush, and---in specific cases---the setvbuf(_IONBF) call.

Use the GNM tools on the OpenVMS Freeware to have common sources for 
MSG (message) files and SDML (Document) documentation files. Use the 
DOCUMENT command to convert the SDML documentation into the necessary 
formats (Text, Postscript, HTML, etc). Use the MESSAGE/SDL tool (latent 
in OpenVMS) to create an SDL file based on the messages. Then use the 
SDL tool (available on the OpenVMS Freeware) to convert the SDL file 
into language-specific definitions. (There is also a converter around 
to convert SDL into SDML, if you want to get pictures of the data 
structures for your documentation.)

to operate in big-endian and potentially in bi-endian mode. HP-UX 
typically operates big-endian.

<p>
With little-endian byte order, the least significant byte is always the 
first byte; the byte at the lowest address. With big-endian byte 
ordering, the byte storage order in memory is dependent on the size of 
the data (byte, word, longword) that is being referenced.

<p>
Endian-ness is a problem has been solved many times before. Some of the 
typical solutions include htonl/htons and ntohl/ntohs in the standard C 
library and the TCP/IP Services XDR (eXternal Data Representation) 
libraries. One of the more recently introduced network formats, and one 
that is seeing extensive press and marketing coverage, is XML.

<p>
The message LINK-I-DATMISCH is informational, and indicates that the 
version of the specified shareable image found in the system shareable 
image directory does not match the version of the shareable image that 
was originally loaded into IMAGELIB.OLB, one of the OpenVMS libraries 
typically searched by the LINKER.

<p>
From a privileged username, you can usually completely repair this via 
the following DCL command:

      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ LIB/REPLACE/SHARE SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB SYS$SHARE:LIBRTL.EXE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This command assumes that the shareable image that was found in the 
SYS$SHARE: area is valid and upward-compatiable, and that the image has 
simply replaced an older version without also updating IMAGELIB.

VAX C V3.2 was released for OpenVMS VAX systems in 1991. DEC C V4.0 
replaced VAX C V3.2 in 1993 as the HP C compiler for OpenVMS VAX 
systems. HP C is the ANSI C compiler for OpenVMS Alpha systems. VAX C 
predates the ANSI C standards, and has various areas that are not 
compliant with ANSI C requirements. HP C is an ANSI C compiler, and can 
also compile most VAX C code when /STANDARD=VAXC is specified. Versions 
of this compiler between V3.2 and V6.5 (exclusive) were known as DEC C, 
DIGITAL C, and Compaq C.

<p>
Both compilers can be installed at the same time on the same OpenVMS 
VAX system, allowing a migration from VAX C to DEC C, and allowing the 
same DEC C code to be used on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha.

<p>
The system manager can choose the system default C compiler when HP C 
is installed on a system with VAX C, and a C programmer can explicitly 
select the required compiler for a any particular compilation.

<p>
A current "C" license PAK allows access to both VAX C and HP C on the 
same OpenVMS VAX system.

<p>
Various HP C versions can be installed on OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2 and later. 
OpenVMS VAX releases such as V5.5-2 and V6.0 will require the 
installation of a HP C RTL kit, a kit that is included with the HP C 
compiler. OpenVMS VAX versions V6.1 and later do not require a seperate 
RTL kit, but HP C RTL ECO kits are available to resolve problems found 
with the C RTL on various OpenVMS releases.

<p>
With HP C, for automatic resolution of the standard C library routines 
by the LINKER utility, use the /PREFIX qualifier, such as 
/PREFIX=ALL_ENTRIES. If a particular application program replaces an 
existing C library routine, use /PREFIX=(ALL_ENTRIES,EXCEPT=(...)). 
(VAX C required explicit specification of an RTL shareable image or C 
object library during the link.)

<p>
When the /PREFIX is requested, the compiler generates a "decc$" prefix 
on the specified symbols. This prefix allows the LINKER to resolve the 
external symbols against the symbols present in the DECC$SHR library. 
The DECC$SHR library is included in the IMAGELIB.OLB shareable image 
library, and IMAGELIB is searched by default when any program (written 
in any language) is LINKed. Because the standard C library routine 
names are very likely to match application routines written in other 
languages, a prefix "decc$" is added to the C symbol names to assure 
their uniqueness; to prevent symbol naming conflicts. C programs, 
however, can sometimes have private libraries for various purposes, and 
the external routines share the same names as the library routines. 
(This is not recommended, but there are applications around that use 
this technique.) Thus the need to explicity specify whether or not the 
"decc$" prefix should be prepended to the external symbol names by the 
compiler.

<p>
The qualifiers, and most (all?) with associated pragmas, that may be of 
interest when migrating VAX C code to HP C include:

<ul>
  <li>/PREFIX=ALL_ENTRIES
<br>
    <br>As mentioned above. Failure to specificy this qualifier can cause 
    the compiler to not add the prefixes for the names of the C library 
    routines into the references placed in the object module, which can in 
    turn cause problems resolving the external symbols in the library when 
    the object code is linked.
  <li>/ASSUME=WRITABLE_STRING_LITERALS
<br>
    <br>Some VAX C programs erroneously write to the string literals. By 
    default, HP C does not allow the constants to change.
  <li>/SHARE_GLOBALS
<br>
    <br>Enables sharing ("shr") of globals and of extern variables. HP C 
    sets externs as non-shareable ("noshr"), VAX C as "shr".
  <li>/EXTERN_MODE=COMMON_BLOCK
<br>
    <br>VAX C assumes common block model for external linkages.
  <li>/[NO]MEMBER_ALIGNMENT
<br>
    <br>Refers to the padding placed between member elements within a 
    struct. Disabling member alignment packs the data more tightly into 
    memory, but this packaging has performance implications, both on 
    OpenVMS VAX and particularly on OpenVMS Alpha systems.
</ul>

<p>
Permit structure members to be naturally aligned whenever possible, and 
avoid using /NOMEMBER_ALIGNMENT. If you need to disable member 
alignment, use the equivilent #pragma to designate the specific 
structures. The alignment of structure members normally only comes into 
play with specific unaligned data structures---such as the sys$creprc 
quota itemlist---and with data structures that are using data that was 
organized by a system using byte or other non-member alignment.

<p>
Versions of HP C such as V6.0 include the capability to extract the 
contents of the standard header libraries into directories such as 
SYS$SYSROOT:[DECC$LIB...], and provide various logical names that can 
be defined to control library searches. With HP C versions such as 
V6.0, the default operations of the compiler match the expectations of 
most OpenVMS programmers, without requiring any definitions of 
site-specific library-related logical names. (And logical names left 
from older DEC C versions can sometimes cause the compiler troubles 
locating header files.)

<p>
HP C V5.6 and later include a backport library, a mechanism by which HP 
C running on older OpenVMS releases can gain access to newer RTL 
routines added to the RTL in later OpenVMS releases---the language RTLs 
ship with OpenVMS itself, and not with the compilers.

<p>
Example C code is available in SYS$EXAMPLES:, in DECW$EXAMPLES (when 
the DECwindows examples are installed), in TCPIP$SERVICES (or on older 
releases, UCX$EXAMPLES) when HP TCP/IP Services is installed), on the 
Freeware CD-ROMs, and at web sites such as
