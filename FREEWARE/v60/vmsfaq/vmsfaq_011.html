<a name="file6"><h1><font color=maroon>9.6 What is the maximum file size, and the RMS record size limit?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_602"></a>

<p>
RMS can store individual files of a size up to the maximum supported 
volume size. Under OpenVMS V6.0 and later, the volume size and the RMS 
maximum file size limit is 2**31 * 512 bytes---one terabyte (1 TB).

<p>
&quot;Use a volume set to provide a large, homogeneous public file 
space. You must use a volume set to create files that are larger than a 
single physical disk volume. (The file system attempts to balance the 
load on the volume sets, for example, by creating new files on the 
volume that is the least full at the time.)&quot;

<p>
&quot;You can add volumes to an existing volume set at any time. The 
maximum number of volumes in a volume set is 255.&quot;
<a name="index_x_603"></a>
<a name="index_x_604"></a>
<a name="index_x_605"></a>

<p>
The RMS formats---sequential, relative, and indexed---are limited by 
the one terabyte maximum volume size. RMS relative files are further 
limited to a number of records that will fit in 32 bits---4 billion 
records. Sequential and indexed formats do not have a record limit.

<br>Versions of CDRECORD (non-DVD) are latent in OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-1 
and later. Commercial versions of CDDRECORD---with DVD 
capabilities---are also available for various platforms, and 
particularly a variant of CDRECORD known as CDRECORD-ProDVD.
<a name="index_x_632"></a>
<a name="index_x_633"></a>
    <br>Beware the tool chosen: some versions and configurations of 
    CDRECORD can record DVD media, as can the DVDRECORD package, as can the 
    commercial DVDwrite package.
<a name="index_x_634"></a>
  Many versions of CDRECORD cannot record DVD media, including the 
  version of CDRECORD latent within OpenVMS and the version found on 
  Freeware V6.0; these versions cannot record DVD media.
  <li>Build the contents of the disk on the LD device partition.
  <li>Use the chosen recording tool to record the contents of the LD 
  partition directly onto the CD-R or CD-RW media.

<p>
While folks have had success getting PC-based CD-R/RW or DVD-R/RW or 
DVD+R/RW tools to work with OpenVMS partitions, it is far easier and 
more reliable to use the OpenVMS-based versions of these tools and 
directly-attached devices.

<p>
More details: Creation of CD recordable or DVD recordable media under 
OpenVMS typically involves one of two approaches: the use of the 
optional CD-R (`Scribe')
<a name="index_x_635"></a>
<a name="index_x_636"></a>
capabilities available for the InfoServer or other "offline" hardware 
packages (PC-based packages will be included in this), or the use of a 
host-based package such as the CDRECORD or CDWRITE13_VMS or other 
utilities, OpenVMS ports of common open-source tools made available by 
Dr. Eberhard Heuser-Hofmann and others.
<a name="index_x_637"></a>
Dr. Heuser-Hofmann has DVDwrite
<a name="index_x_638"></a>
, a commercial package which can record DVD media. 
(http://home.tiscali.de/dvd4openvms)

<p>
OpenVMS can read ODS-2, ODS-5, and ISO-9960 format CD-ROMs.
<a name="index_x_639"></a>
<a name="index_x_640"></a>
<a name="index_x_641"></a>
(If you are very careful, you can create a dual-format CD-R; a CD-R 
with both ODS-2 and ISO-9660 or both ODS-5 and ISO-9660 or both.)

<p>
InfoServer
<a name="index_x_642"></a>
 hardware configurations are no longer available from HP, but may 
 potentially be acquired through other means; as used equipment.

<p>
Packages related to the use of DVD archiving are also available, see 
the multi-volume capabilities of the DVDarchive/restore Freeware.

<p>
Also see <a href="vmsfaq_011.html#rrd42">Section 9.7.2</a> for details on access to recorded media on older 
CD-ROM drives.

<a name="filedvdcd"><h2>9.7.1 CD and DVD notation, terminology?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_655"></a>

<p>
CD-ROM is pre-recorded Compact Disk media, and is the original and 
oldest CD format. The original CD media was physically stamped, a 
recording process that is now largely reserved to the highest-volume 
media reproduction requirements.

<p>
CD-R is CD Recordable, a write-once storage medium that can be read by 
all but the oldest of CD drives; a format which can be read and often 
even recorded by most CD-RW drives.

<p>
CD-RW is CD ReWritable, a format which is readable by many CD drives 
and by most CD-R drives, and with media that can be recorded and 
re-recorded by CD-RW drives.

<p>
CD media recording speeds are listed as multiples of 150 kilobytes per 
second, so a 10X drive records at 1500 kilobytes (1.5 megabytes) per 
second. 600 MB (70 minutes) and 700 MB (80 minutes) recording 
capacities are both widely available. The minutes designation is 
derived from the traditional audio-format recording capacity of the 
particular media.

<p>
DVD-R/RW is the older of two common Digital Versatile Disk
<a name="index_x_656"></a>
recording formats, and the DVD-R Recordable or DVD-RW ReWritable media 
can be read by many DVD drives. As with CD-R formats in older CD 
drives, older DVD and particularly first-generation DVD players may 
have problems reading this media format.

<p>
DVD+R/RW is the newer of the two common Digital Versatile Disk 
recording formats, and the DVD+R Recordable or DVD+RW ReWritable media 
can be read by many DVD drives. Akin to DVD-R/RW media, older and 
particularly first-generation DVD drives can have problems reading this 
media format.

<p>
The DVD Plus-series drives and media tend to record faster than Minus 
drives, as (as of this writing) the Plus (+) drives do not require an 
initial media formatting pass and the Minus (-) drives do. While the 
appropriate Plus (+) or Minus (-) DVD raw media must be chosen for the 
particular DVD recorder (and DVD recording drives that are compatible 
with and capable of using both Plus and Minus media are available), the 
resulting recorded media is generally readable (playable) in all recent 
DVD drives and DVD players, regardless of type. (Compatibility is best 
within the same media-series devices of course, but be certain to 
verify compatibility across devices regardless of the particular device 
or particular recording media chosen.)

<p>
Presently Plus (+) media is slightly more expensive than Minus (-), but 
with the prices of all CD and all DVD media continuing to consistently 
fall, the differences in DVD media costs are becoming irrelevent for 
all but the production of huge volumes of DVD media.

<p>
The rated DVD recording speeds are in multiples of 1353 kilobytes per 
second, thus a DVD 1X drive is roughly equivalent to a CD 9X drive in 
I/O requirements and transfer speed.

<p>
DVD drive recording speed can and does vary. DVD disk drive recording 
speed is limited by the rated recording speed of the media used, so the 
slower (and cheaper) DVD media will not record any more quickly in a 
faster drive. A 2.4X DVD drive loaded with 1X media will record at 1X.

<a name="rrd42"><h2>9.7.2 Use of RRD42 and other older (embossed-media) CD drives?</h2></a>

<p>
The RRD42
<a name="index_x_657"></a>
 series SCSI CD-ROM drive is sufficiently old that it can have problems 
 processing CD-R and CD-RW media. Other very old CD drives can have 
 equivalent media compatibility problems when attempting to read (much) 
 newer CD media and newer CD media technologies. These older CD drives 
 are generally intended for use with the so-called
<a name="index_x_658"></a>
<a name="index_x_659"></a>
 embossed media, rather than with non-embossed recorded (recordable) 
 media now in common circulation.

<p>
Please consider using a slightly-less-ancient CD-ROM or CD-R or CD-RW 
drive when working with non-embossed recorded CD media.

<p>
To paraphrase one knowledgable---though deliberately nameless---storage 
engineer, &quot;The RRD42 drive is just past the drooling idiot 
stage&quot;.

<a name="file8"><h1><font color=maroon>9.8 What I/O transfer size limits exist in OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_660"></a>

<p>
The maximum transfer size is an attribute of the particular I/O device, 
controller and driver combination; there is no inherent limit imposed 
by OpenVMS (other than the fact that, today, byte counts and LBNs are 
generally limited to 32 bits).

<p>
The maximum size of a device I/O request is limited by the value in 
UCB$L_MAXBCNT, which is set by the device driver based on various 
factors. (Also check the setting of the MAXBUF system parameter for 
buffered I/O transfers, and check the process quotas.)
<a name="index_x_661"></a>
<a name="index_x_662"></a>
<a name="index_x_663"></a>
<a name="index_x_664"></a>
<a name="index_x_665"></a>

<p>
Currently, SCSI drivers limit I/O transfers to FE00(16) bytes, 65024 
bytes (decimal). The reasons for this transfer size limitation are 
largely historical. Similarly, DSSI devices are limited to the same 
value, this for hardware-specific reasons. Transfers to HSC and HSJ 
device controllers via the CI are limited to 1,048,576 bytes. Client 
MSCP-served devices are limited to 65535 bytes---to help ensure that 
the I/O fragmentation processing happens on the client and not on the 
server system.

<p>
Parts of the OpenVMS I/O subsystem are optimized for data transfers 
less than 64KB, because (obviously) most I/O operations are 
(substantially) less than that. OpenVMS can handle larger transfers, if 
the driver and the device can handle it.

<p>

<a name="file9"><h1><font color=maroon>9.9 Can I use ODBC to connect to OpenVMS database files?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_666"></a>

<p>
Yes, you can use various available third-party packages that permit 
remote ODBC clients to access RMS files and various commercial 
databases via the network.
<a name="index_x_667"></a>
<a name="index_x_668"></a>

<p>
For RMS, consider acquiring one of the packages available from 
EasySoft, Attunity Connect (formerly known as ISG Navigator), Oracle 
(DB Integrator), SolutionsIQ, and Synergex.

<p>
For specific commercial databases (other than RMS, of course), contact 
the database vendor directly for assistance.

<a name="filexfc"><h1><font color=maroon>9.10 If my disks are shown as VIOC Compatible, am I using XFC?</font></h1></a>

<p>
Yes, you are using XFC caching.

<p>
Disks that are using XFC caching use communication and coordination 
protocols that are compatible with the older VIOC caching 
implementation. With the initial implementation of XFC on OpenVMS, you 
can use the command SHOW MEMORY/CACHE to see no disks reported in full 
XFC mode;
<a name="index_x_669"></a>
all disks shown will be listed in &quot;VIOC Compatable Mode&quot;.
<a name="index_x_670"></a>

<p>
If you have the OpenVMS system parameter VCC_FLAGS set to 2 and are 
using OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-1 or later, or are using OpenVMS Alpha V7.3 
with the VMS73_XFC V2.0 ECO kit or later or with the UPDATE kits, you 
are using XFC.
<a name="index_x_671"></a>
<a name="index_x_672"></a>
<a name="index_x_673"></a>
<a name="index_x_674"></a>

<p>
Another confusion: the XFC product version is and remains V1.0 in all 
released configurations, please do not confuse the internal XFC product 
version (displayed by various commands) with the version number 
associated with the various ECO kit(s). XFC V1.0 does not permit 
volumes to enter full XFC caching, as displayed by the &quot;Vols in 
Full XFC mode&quot;
<a name="index_x_675"></a>
 portion of the DCL command SHOW MEMORY/CACHE output.

<a name="prefixes"><h1><font color=maroon>10.1 Modular Programming, Facility Prefixes and Symbol Naming?</font></h1></a>

<p>
Please first review the OpenVMS Programming Concepts Manual and the 
Guide to Modular Programming manuals. Both are available within the 
OpenVMS documentation set, and provide details of the expected norms 
for OpenVMS programs.

<ul>
  <li>Learn about the facility prefix, and use a the appropriate prefix 
  uniformly throughout all external symbols, all logical names, and all 
  files located in shared directories. The prefix and the use of the 
  dollar sign (<kbd>[]</kbd>$) and the underscore (<kbd>[]</kbd>_) help 
  avoid collisions with other products. Use of the dollar sign is 
  reserved to registered products.
  <li>Please consider use of tools such as the Freeware SDL package, and 
  the GNM package. These permit you to generate include files and message 
  documentation akin to that of OpenVMS, providing users of your product 
  with a familiar environment.
  <li>For product installations, consider use of the PCSI installation 
  utility, and provide a product-specific configuration DCL command 
  procedure (usually SYS$MANAGER:prefix$CONFIG.COM) if configuration is 
  required.
  <li>The product startup file is usually named 
  SYS$STARTUP:prefix$STARTUP.COM, and the shutdown file (if needed) is 
  usually SYS$STARTUP:prefix$SHUTDOWN.COM.
</ul>

<p>
OpenVMS provides a registry for facility prefixes and for MESSAGE 
message compiler codes. To request a prefix and a message facility code 
for a product you are reselling, send your request in a mail message 
addressed to product[-at-sign-]hylndr.sqp.zko.dec.com, requesting the 
submission form and details of the registration process.

<p>
As for details of argument passing, most OpenVMS system services and 
RTL routines pass string arguments by descriptor. Languages which 
support native string data types create descriptors automatically; 
those which do not (eg., C) require that you set them up explicitly. 
For further details on using descriptors and particularly for using 
descriptors from C, please see <a href="vmsfaq_012.html#prog13">Section 10.13</a>.

<a name="prog2"><h1><font color=maroon>10.3 How do I get the arguments from the command line?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_691"></a>

<p>
If you're writing a program and want to accept arguments from a foreign 
command, you can use LIB$GET_FOREIGN to get the command line and parse 
it yourself, or if you're programming in C, use the normal argc/argv 
method.

<p>
To write an application which uses the normal DCL 
verb/qualifier/parameter syntax for invocation, see the description of 
the CLI$ routines in the OpenVMS Callable Utility Routines Reference 
Manual.

<p>
It is possible to write an application which can be used both ways; if 
a DCL verb isn't used to invoke the image, the application parses the 
command line itself. One way to do this is to call CLI$GET_VALUE for a 
required
<a name="index_x_692"></a>
parameter. If it is not present (or you get an error), call 
LIB$GET_FOREIGN to get the command line and do the manual parse.

<p>
See also <a href="vmsfaq_010.html#dcl1">Section 8.1</a>.

<a name="prog3"><h1><font color=maroon>10.4 How do I get a formatted error message in a variable?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_694"></a>

<p>
Use the SYS$PUTMSG system service with an action routine that stores 
the message line(s) in the variable of your choice. Be sure the action 
routine returns a "false" (low bit clear) function value so that 
SYS$PUTMSG
<a name="index_x_695"></a>

<a name="prog5"><h1><font color=maroon>10.6 How do I do a SET DEFAULT from inside a program?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_703"></a>

<p>
The problem is that SYS$SETDDIR only changes the default directory - 
NOT the default disk. The default disk is determined by the logical 
SYS$DISK. If you want to change the default disk within a program, then 
call LIB$SET_LOGICAL to change the logical SYS$DISK. You will need to 
call both LIB$SET_LOGICAL and SYS$SETDDIR to change both default disk 
and the default directory!

<a name="prog7"><h1><font color=maroon>10.7 How do I turn my Fortran COMMON into a shareable image on Alpha?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_708"></a>

<p>
You need to add SYMBOL_VECTOR=(&lt;common-name&gt;=PSECT) to your 
options file. On OpenVMS VAX all OVR/REL/GBL psects were automatically 
exported into the shareable image's Global Symbol Table. On OpenVMS 
Alpha you have to tell the linker that you want this done by means of 
the PSECT keyword in the SYMBOL_VECTOR options file statement.
<a name="index_x_709"></a>
<a name="index_x_710"></a>

<p>
This has several advantages over OpenVMS VAX. First, you don't have to 
worry about the address of the psect when you try to create a new, 
upwardly compatible version of the shareable image. Second, you can 
control which psects, if any, are made visible outside the shareable 
image.

<p>
By default, COMMON PSECTs in HP Fortran for OpenVMS Alpha (as well as 
most other OpenVMS Alpha compilers) are NOSHR. On VAX, the default was 
SHR which required you to change the attribute to NOSHR if you wanted 
your COMMON to be in a shareable image but not write-shared by all 
processes on the system. If you do want write-sharing, use:

      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
CDEC$ PSECT common-name=SHR 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
in the Fortran source code (the CDEC$ must be begin in column 1) or a 
linker options file PSECT_ATTR statement to set the COMMON PSECT 
attribute to SHR.

<a name="prog8"><h1><font color=maroon>10.8 How do I convert between IEEE and VAX floating data?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_715"></a>

<p>
In OpenVMS V6.1 and later, the routine CVT$CONVERT_FLOAT is documented 
in the LIB$ Run-Time Library Reference Manual, and can perform floating 
point conversions between any two of the following floating datatypes: 
VAX (F,D,G,H), little-endian IEEE (single, double, quad), big-endian 
IEEE (single, double, quad), CRAY and IBM System\370, etc.
<a name="index_x_716"></a>

<p>
HP Fortran (all OpenVMS platforms) has a feature which will perform 
automatic conversion of unformatted data during input or output. See 
the HP Fortran documentation for information on "non-native data in 
I/O" and the CONVERT= OPEN statement keyword.

<p>
There are floating-point conversion source code packages available for 
various platforms.
