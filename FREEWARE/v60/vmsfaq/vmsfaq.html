<h1><font color=maroon>FAQ File Formats and Production 
Information</font></h1>

<p>
This FAQ is available in ASCII text, Postscript, Bookreader, HTML, and 
other document file formats.

<p>
As the HTML-format FAQ is not a single monolithic (and accordingly 
large) HTML file, it is the most difficult format to search using the 
most common standard (platform-local) tools. Accordingly, the FAQ 
editor recommends downloading, using and searching the ASCII text FAQ 
format.

<p>
The OpenVMS FAQ is maintained in DECdocument SDML format and all FAQ 
maintenance and the primary output file format conversions are 
performed on OpenVMS systems. For information on the DECdocument

<a name="intro_newsgroups"><h1><font color=maroon>1.2 What are the OpenVMS Usenet Newsgroups?</font></h1></a>

<p>
There are a huge number of newsgroups available, some of which discuss 
topics of interest to folks using OpenVMS operating system. Key among 
these are the comp.os.vms newsgroup and the vmsnet.* heirarchy of 
newsgroups.

<a name="intro1"><h2>1.2.1 What is the scope of the comp.os.vms newsgroup?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_5"></a>

<p>
The comp.os.vms newsgroup is the primary newsgroup for discussion of 
the HP OpenVMS operating system and the computer systems on which it 
runs. Questions about layered products which run on OpenVMS are also 
welcome, though many of them (in particular, language compilers and 
database systems) have more specific newsgroups. If a question has some 
relationship to OpenVMS, it belongs in comp.os.vms.

<a name="intro2"><h2>1.2.2 What newsgroups carry VMS-related information?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_6"></a>

<p>
The vmsnet.* hierarchy is operated by the Encompass users group 
(formerly known as DECUS), and contains various newsgroups of interest, 
including vmsnet.misc and vmsnet.alpha.

<p>
Sprechen Sie Deutsch? Besuchen Sie bitte den newsgroup de.comp.os.vms.
<a name="index_x_7"></a>

<p>
The comp.sys.dec newsgroup carries general discussions about various HP 
computer systems, and specifically systems that were acquired by HP as 
part of the acquisition of Compaq, systems which had previously been 
acquired by Compaq as part of the acquisition of Digital Equipment 
Corporation (DIGITAL).

<p>
Also of interest are resources and conferencing systems including 
Encompasserve (formerly known as DECUServe), Ken Farmer's OpenVMS.Org 
forums,
<a name="index_x_8"></a>
<a name="index_x_9"></a>
<a name="index_x_10"></a>
<a name="index_x_11"></a>
and the Compaq Working Group folks:

<ul>
  <li>telnet://eisner.decus.org/
  <li>http://www.openvms.org/
  <li>http://www.compaqworkinggroup.org/
</ul>

<a name="intro7"><h2>1.2.3 What newsgroup archives are available?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_12"></a>

<p>
Extensive archives of INFO-VAX mailings
<a name="index_x_13"></a>
and comp.os.vms postings are archived and available at 
ftp://crvax.sri.com/info-vax/.
<a name="index_x_14"></a>
Google
<a name="index_x_15"></a>
 also has extensive newsgroup archives available at 
 http://www.google.com/.

<a name="intro3"><h2>1.2.4 What is the INFO-VAX mailing list?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_16"></a>
<a name="index_x_17"></a>

<p>
INFO-VAX is a mailing list which is bidirectionally gatewayed to the 
comp.os.vms newsgroup. This means that postings to comp.os.vms get 
automatically sent to INFO-VAX subscribers and messages sent to the 
INFO-VAX list are automatically posted to comp.os.vms. INFO-VAX can be 
a useful way to participate in the newsgroup if you can't access the 
newsgroup directly through a newsreader. Note that INFO-VAX is a closed 
mailing list, which means that only subscribers may post to it. Please 
see <a href="vmsfaq.html#intro4">Section 1.2.4.1</a> for information on how to subscribe, and how you can 
subscribe such that you can post from multiple addresses but still 
receive no more than one copy of the mailings.

<p>
Please remember that propogation delays can and do vary, meaning that 
mailings and postings may be delayed or even lost. It is quite possible 
that postings may not be delivered for several days, and that some 
postings will appear out of the expected order.

<p>
For details on the available archives, please see <a href="vmsfaq.html#intro7">Section 1.2.3</a>.

<a name="intro4"><h3>1.2.4.1 How do I subscribe to or unsubscribe from INFO-VAX?</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_18"></a>
<a name="index_x_19"></a>

<p>
The address for subscription requests is 
Info-VAX-Request[at]Mvb.Saic.Com. Subscription requests are handled 
automatically by a mail server. This mail server ignores the subject 
line and processes each line of the message as a command.

<p>
The syntax for subscribing and unsubscribing, as well as setting 
various parameters on your subscription, is:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX      (ADD is a valid synonym) 
UNSUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX (REMOVE, SIGNOFF, and SIGN-OFF are valid synonyms) 
SET INFO-VAX DIGEST     (to receive in Digest format) 
SET INFO-VAX NODIGEST   (to receive each message individually) 
SET INFO-VAX NOMAIL     (to establish an email address for posting, 
                          though not receiving, mail.) 
SET INFO-VAX MAIL       (to establish an email address for both posting 
                          and receiving mail.) 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The mail server is not case-sensitive; case is irrelevant. Attempts to 
fetch copies of the mailing list are rejected for reasons of 
confidentiality. Any message not understood by the mailserver will be 
returned entirely unprocessed.

<p>
The INFO-VAX moderator can be contacted directly at the email address 
Mark.Berryman[at]Mvb.Saic.Com.
<a name="index_x_20"></a>
<a name="index_x_21"></a>

<p>
If you are on Bitnet, send a mail message containing the text SUBSCRIBE 
INFO-VAX to LISTSERVE[at][nearest-Listserv-system). To unsubscribe, 
send a message containing the text SIGNOFF INFO-VAX to the same 
Listserv system.

<p>
If you are on the Internet in the UK, send a message containing the 
word SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE to info-vax-request[at]ncdlab.ulcc.ac.uk.

<a name="intro5"><h1><font color=maroon>1.3 What is [n]etiquette?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_22"></a>

<p>
Before posting or emailing a question, please use the available local 
resources, such as the OpenVMS manuals, the HELP, and the resources and 
information in and referenced by this FAQ. Please use these first. Also 
please specifically read the release notes and (if appropriate) the 
cover letter for the product you are using. (The release notes are 
generally placed in SYS$HELP:.) Quite often, these simple steps will 
allow you to quickly find the answer to your own question---and more 
quickly than waiting for a response to question posted to a newsgroup, 
too. These steps will save you time, and will also help ensure you have 
a good reputation with the folks that might be included to answer one 
of your future questions, a question not covered in these resources. 
Put another way, if you do not want your questions to be ignored in the 
future---and please remember that the folks in the newsgroups do 
<em>not</em> have to answer your questions---you won't want to 
&quot;annoy the natives&quot; by asking a question that has already 
been answered far more times more than you might have realized, or a 
question whose answer is readily available had you made a small effort.

<p>
When posting, please consider the following suggestions:

<ul>
  <li>There is <em>no</em> particularly reliable way to recall, erase, 
  delete, or otherwise hide a message once it is emailed or once posted. 
  Once your message has reached an external email server or multiple news 
  servers, the entire text is effectively a permanent fixture of the 
  network. And using the available search engines, a fixture that is easy 
  to locate and to correlate. <br>For details on some of the many 
  available archives, please see <a href="vmsfaq.html#intro7">Section 1.2.3</a>.
  <li>Include a valid e-mail address in the text of your posting or in a 
  "signature" appended to the end. Reply-to addresses in headers often 
  get garbled. Anonymous addresses can also simply be ignored, as fake 
  addresses are regularly used by folks that are &quot;trolling&quot; and 
  by folks that are spamming. (Though to avoid spam-harvesting of your 
  email address, consider adding characters or a field into the 
  address---but remember to include details around which characters or 
  fields should be removed or altered if you decide to be particularly 
  clever here.)
  <li>If you are submitting a question, please be as specific as you can. 
  Include relevant information such as processor type, product versions 
  (OpenVMS and layered products that apply), error message(s), DCL 
  command(s) used, and a short, reproducible example of problems. Say 
  what you've tried so far, so that effort isn't duplicated. Keep in mind 
  that there's not yet a telepathy protocol for the Internet. (The more 
  detailed your description, the better that people can help you with 
  your question.)
  <li>If responding to a posting, include in your reply only as much of 
  the original posting as is necessary to establish context. As a 
  guideline, consider that if you've included more text than you've 
  added, you've possibly included too much. Never include signatures and 
  other irrelevant material.
  <li>Please be polite. If the question isn't worded the way you think is 
  correct or doesn't include the information you want, try to imagine 
  what the problem might be if viewed from the poster's perspective. 
  Requests for additional detailed information are often better sent 
  through mail rather than posted to the newsgroup.
  <li>If you have a problem with HP (or any other vendor's) product, 
  please use the appropriate support channel. Do not assume that 
  newsgroup postings will get read, will be responded to by the 
  appropriate developers, or will be later followed up upon.
  <li>If you are posting from a web browser, news reader or if you are 
  posting via email sent to INFO-VAX, please turn off MIME, vcard, 
  attachments, and other mechanisms that assume anyone reading the post 
  has the corresponding capability---use the text-only option of your web 
  browser, news reader, or mailer. Usenet is traditionally a text-only 
  medium, and many comp.os.vms participants will use tools that have this 
  support disabled, or that do not have this support. If the message uses 
  MIME or attachments or such, the text of your message will be buried in 
  a large pile of gibberish, and some tools will send multiple copies of 
  the text within a single posting.
  <li>If you find that the postings of a particular user are 
  uninteresting, annoying, or off-topic, most newsreaders include a 
  filter or killfile mechanism, and many mail clients have similar 
  filtering capabilities. <em>Please do not &quot;flame&quot;---to email 
  or to post vitriol -- any individual that might annoy you, please 
  enable and filter all of that users postings.</em> Posting of vitriol 
  and flames <em>will</em> eventually come back to haunt you. Similarly, 
  readers that decide that your postings are not worthy of reading will 
  similarly tend to filter or to killfile <em>all</em> of your postings. 
  Please play nice, in other words.
</ul>

<p>
Before posting your question to the comp.os.vms newsgroup or sending 
your message to the INFO-VAX
<a name="index_x_23"></a>
 list, also please take the time to review available etiquette 
 information, such as that included in the following documents:

<ul>
  <li>ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/usenet/primer/part1
  <li>ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/usenet/faq/part1

  <li>ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/usenet/posting-rules/part1
</ul>

<p>
This information will document the etiquette of newsgroups, as well as 
providing you with the knowledge the vast amount of newsgroup-related 
information that is readily available to you, and where to find it...

<em>Please do not post security holes or system crashers</em>

<p>
Rather, please report these problems directly to HP. Why? So that HP 
has a chance to resolve and distribute a fix before other customer 
sites can be affected.

<p>
Most folks in the newsgroups are honest and deserve to know about 
potential security problems, but a few folks can and will make 
nefarious use of this same information. Other sites will hopefully 
return the courtesy, and will not post information that will 
potentially compromise your site and your computer environment. </font>
