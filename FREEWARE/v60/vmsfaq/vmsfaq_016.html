<a name="xwindows"><h2>13.2.3 X Windows utilities and routines</h2></a>

<p>
Various X Windows utilities are available for DECwindows. DECwindows is 
an implementation of the X Windows environment and libraries, and 
provides various libraries, and provides various desktop interfaces, 
including COE, Motif, and XUI.

<p>
xwd, xev, mosaic web browser, xrdb, bmtoa and atobm, xpr, ico, etc. are 
available. Look in DECW$UTILS: in DECwindows Motif V1.2-3 and later. 
Also see DECW$EXAMPLES: for example X and C programs.

<p>
Miscellaneous tools and examples are also available. Examples include 
the older DWAUTH (X Windows SYSUAF authorize-like tool) tool, various 
versions of grep, fgrep, yacc, vmstar, uuencode, gawk, etc. html tools, 
the mx SMTP mail exchange package, X windows flight simulator, the mxrn 
X windows news reader, the OSU HTTPD WWW server, a WWW gopher browser, 
etc. are all on the various Freeware distributions.

<a name="tcpiptools"><h2>13.2.4 TCP/IP Tools and Utilities for OpenVMS?</h2></a>

<p>
TCP/IP Services (formerly known as UCX) contains tools such as ping, 
uuencode, smtp, snmp, rcp, nfs, tnfs, etc.

<p>
OpenVMS V6.2 and later includes DCL-integrated support for various IP 
tools, with commands such as SET HOST/TELNET, and COPY/FTP. This 
interface requires the installation of an IP stack, and UCX V3.3 and 
later as well as any current third-party IP stack can be used. Once the 
IP stack is installed and configured, the DCL command qualifiers such 
as /FTP, /RCP, /RLOGIN, /TELNET, and /TN3270 are available on the 
various DCL commands.

<a name="soft3"><h1><font color=maroon>13.3 Where can I get the Mozilla Web Browser?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1066"></a>

<p>
Mozilla.org is an open source organization providing HTML-related 
tools; software that is the basis for various utilities including the 
Mozilla web browser.

<p>
OpenVMS Engineering is continuously porting Mozilla.org's web browser 
to OpenVMS, and OpenVMS ports of the current Mozilla baselevels and 
releases are available. The OpenVMS Mozilla port includes the web 
browser, the mail client, the Composer HTML editor, an IRC chat client, 
a netnews (NNTP) reader, and various other tools.

<p>
A hardware configuration appropriate for Mozilla generally involves an 
OpenVMS Alpha system with an EV56 Alpha microprocessor, or an EV6 or 
more recent processor, and with 256 megabytes of system memory. The 
performance of Mozilla on EV5-based and earlier Alpha microprocessor 
systems is generally viewed as inadequate, this due to the extensive 
use of an Alpha instruction subset that is first available with the 
EV56 microprocessor generation.

<p>
Mozilla is not available for OpenVMS VAX.

<p>
Various versions of the Netscape Navigator web browser are based on the 
Mozilla code-base.

presently expired.

<a name="soft4"><h1><font color=maroon>13.4 Where can I get Java for OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1080"></a>
<a name="index_x_1081"></a>
<a name="index_x_1082"></a>
<a name="index_x_1083"></a>

<p>
Java is available on and is included with OpenVMS Alpha, starting with 
the OpenVMS Alpha V7.2 and later releases. Java download kits are 
available for OpenVMS Alpha V7.1 and later releases.

<p>
Java is not available on OpenVMS VAX. As for why: the Java language 
definition requires a floating point format (IEEE) that is not native 
to VAX, and this would require the emulation of all floating point 
operations within Java applications. Further, the C source code used to 
implement for Java itself is heavily dependent on passing IEEE floating 
point values around among the many internal subroutines, and adding 
support for VAX would entail changes to the HP C compiler for OpenVMS 
VAX---and specifically to the VAX VCG code generator that is used by HP 
C on OpenVMS VAX systems---in order to add support for passing 
IEEE-format floating point doubles around. Alternatively, extensive 
changes to the Java source code to remove the assumption that the 
double is an IEEE floating point value.

<p>
There are currently no plans to make a version of Java available for 
OpenVMS VAX. (A prototype version of Java was created for OpenVMS VAX, 
and performance was found to be inadequate. At best.)

<p>
If Java2 or other environment lifts the requirements for IEEE floating 
point as part of the language definition, this decision may be 
revisited.

<p>
If you are having problems with Display Postscript, you need to upgrade 
your Java kit---1.2.2-3 and later remove the requirement for Display 
Postcript extensions, and Java 1.2.2-3 is required with DECwindows 
V1.2-6 and later.

<p>
For additional information on Java for Alpha systems, please see the 
OpenVMS documentation (V7.2 and later), and the following site:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.compaq.com/java/alpha/index.html
</ul>

<p>
HP (Compaq) Secure Web Server (CSWS) includes CSWS_JAVA, which provides 
the following Apache Tomcat technologies: JavaServer Pages 1.1, Java 
Servlet 2.2, and MOD_JK. (CSWS is based on the Apache web server. See 
SOFT1.)

<a name="soft6"><h1><font color=maroon>13.5 Obtaining user input in DCL CGI script?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1084"></a>
<a name="index_x_1085"></a>

<p>
If you choose to use the GET method, then the form data is available in 
the DCL symbol QUERY_STRING, in URL-encoded format.

<p>
If you use the POST method, then you need to read the form data from 
stdin. For a DCL CGI script running under the Netscape FastTrack web 
server, you can read the data using the following READ command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ READ SYS$COMMAND postdata 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
to read the information in.

<p>
The following describes the use of DCL command procedures as CGI 
scripts with the OSU web server:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.levitte.org/~ava/cgiscripts_other.htmlx
</ul>

DCL CGI is also discussed in the Writing Real Programs in DCL book, and 
in the Ask The Wizard website.

<a name="soft7"><h1><font color=maroon>13.6 How can a batch job get its own batch entry number?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1086"></a>
<a name="index_x_1087"></a>

<p>
To have a batch procedure retrieve its own batch entry number, use the 
following:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ Entry = F$GETQUI("DISPLAY_ENTRY", - 
    "entry_number","display_entry","this_job") 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Remember that the entry numbers issued by the OpenVMS Job Controller 
are always opaque longword values. Do <em>not</em> assume you know the 
format of the entry number, nor the range of entry numbers you might 
see, nor the algorithm that is used to assign enty numbers. You should 
simply assume <em>opaque longword</em>.

<a name="soft8"><h1><font color=maroon>13.7 How do I convert to new CMS or DTM libraries?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1088"></a>
<a name="index_x_1089"></a>
<a name="index_x_1090"></a>

<p>
A change was made to the format of the CMS database for CMS libraries 
starting with V3.5-03---to ensure that earlier versions of CMS are 
unable to access the database once the &quot;conversion&quot; to 
V3.5-05 and later is made, you must issue the following two commands 
when upgrading from V3.5-03 and prior. (The only differences between 
CMS version V3.5-03 and CMS version V3.5-05 involve changes to ensure 
that no earlier version of CMS can access the &quot;converted&quot; 
database, and corrupt it.)

<p>
To perform the &quot;conversion&quot;, issue the following commands for 
each CMS library present:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RENAME disk:[directory]00CMS.* 01CMS.* 
$ COPY NLA0: disk:[directory]00CMS.CMS 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The new file 00CMS.CMS must have the same security settings as the 
01CMS.CMS file, and is created solely to ensure continued compatibility 
with tools that expect to find a 00CMS.CMS file (eg: various versions 
of the Language-Sensitive text editor LSEDIT).
<a name="index_x_1091"></a>
<a name="index_x_1092"></a>

<p>
If you choose to install and use the longer variant names support that 
is available with CMS V4.1 or later, you cannot mix earlier CMS 
versions within a cluster. If you attempt to mix older and newer 
versions, you will typically
<a name="index_x_1093"></a>
<a name="index_x_1094"></a>
 see the following BADLIB and BADTYPSTR error sequence when accessing 
 the CMS library from the older CMS versions:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
%CMS-F-BADLIB, there is something wrong with your library 
-CMS-F-BADTYPSTR, header block type is 145; it should be 17 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Please see the CMS V4.1 release notes for additional details on this.

<p>
To perform the equivalent &quot;conversion&quot; for DEC Test Manager 
(DTM) V3.5 and prior versions to V3.6 and later versions, issue the 
following DCL commands for each DTM library present:
<a name="index_x_1095"></a>
<a name="index_x_1096"></a>
<a name="index_x_1097"></a>
<a name="index_x_1098"></a>
<a name="index_x_1099"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RENAME disk:[directory]00DTM.* 01DTM.* 
$ COPY NLA0: disk:[directory]00DTM.DTM 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Like CMS, this change is intended to prevent older versions of DTM from 
accessing newer libraries, and corrupting the contents. Like CMS, once 
the libraries are renamed, they cannot and should not be renamed back 
to the older names; like CMS, the changes are not downward-compatible.

<p>
To convert version 1 (ancient) DTM and CMS libraries forward, please 
see the DTM CONVERT and the CMS CONVERT commands.

<a name="soft9"><h1><font color=maroon>13.8 Where can I get new certificates for Netscape Navigator?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1100"></a>

<p>
The URLs that are available for adding or updating root certificates 
are:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.entrust.net/customer/generalinfo/import.htm entrust
  <li>http://www.thawte.com/ thwate
  <li>https://www.verisign.com/server/prg/browser/root.html verisign
</ul>

<p>
To update certificates in Netscape Navigator V3.03 on OpenVMS, use the 
following:

<p>
Thawte Server certificate which expired in 1998:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Under the Options Menu choose "Security Preferences..."
  <li>Select the "Site Certificates" tab
  <li>Select "Thawte Server CA" in the list of certificates
  <li>Select "Delete Certificate" and then "OK"
  <li>Go to http://www.thawte.com/serverbasic.crt
  <li>Follow the instructions on the popup dialog box to accept the 
  certificate This involves hitting the &quot;Next&quot; button and 
  clicking an accept button, and then naming the resulting certificate. 
  The certificate is usually named with the same name as the original.
</ol>

<p>
VeriSign/RSA Server certificate which expired 31-Dec-1999:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Under the Options Menu choose "Security Preferences..."
  <li>Select the "Site Certificates" tab
  <li>Select "Verisign/RSA Secure Server CA" in the list of certificates
  <li>Select "Delete Certificate" and then "OK"
  <li>Go to https://www.verisign.com/server/prg/browser/root.html
  <li>Follow the instructions on the popup dialog box to accept the 
  certificate This involves hitting the &quot;Next&quot; button and 
  clicking an accept button, and then naming the resulting certificate. 
  Verisign suggests using the name &quot;VeriSign CA&quot;.
</ol>

<a name="soft10"><h1><font color=maroon>13.9 Why doesn't DCL symbol substitution work?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1101"></a>

<p>
The DCL symbol substitution processing occurs only at the DCL prompt, 
not within data and not within files. If you wish to perform symbol 
substitution in this environment, you typically write a small file 
containing the command(s) and data to be invoked---potentially only the 
data---and you then invoke the created procedure or reference the 
specified data.

<p>
In this case, use of a file containing nolinemode commands or other 
techniques might be useful---you will want to ensure that the text 
editor you use does not attempt to use screen mode or similar, as this 
is not generally considered adventageous within a command procedure.

<p>
Tools such as FTP have alternatives: COPY/FTP.

<p>
DCL symbol substitution occurs in two passes, using the ampersand and 
the apostrophe. In most cases, only the apostrophe is necessary. In a 
few cases---such as the DCL PIPE command---you will may need to use the 
ampersand to get the substitution to work. The following example uses 
ampersand substitution to transfer the contents of the header into a 
logical name:
<a name="index_x_1102"></a>
<a name="index_x_1103"></a>
<a name="index_x_1104"></a>
<a name="index_x_1105"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ PIPE CC/VERSION | (READ SYS$PIPE hdr ; DEFINE/JOB/NOLOG hdr &amp;hdr ) 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
A logical name (in the job logical name table; shared by all processes 
in the current job) was used as DCL symbols cannot be returned back out 
from a DCL PIPE or other spawned subprocess.

<a name="index_x_1106"></a>
<a name="index_x_1107"></a>

<p>
OpenVMS support is included in the standard distribution of Perl, the 
popular scripting language created by Larry Wall. In addition to nearly 
all of the functionality available under Unix, OpenVMS-specific Perl 
modules provide interfaces to many native features, as well as access 
to Oracle, Ingres, and Sybase databases via the Perl DBI available on 
OpenVMS.

<p>
A website useful for getting started with Perl on OpenVMS---where you 
will find such things as download links, instructions, auxiliary tools, 
and sample scripts---is available at:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.sidhe.org/vmsperl
</ul>

<p>
If you have a C compiler, the best way to obtain Perl is to download 
and build it yourself. The latest production quality source kit is 
available from:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/stable.tar.gz
</ul>

<p>
You will need GUNZIP and VMSTAR (both available from the OpenVMS 
Freeware CD, or from other sites) to unpack the archive; once you've 
done that, read the instructions in the README.vms file.

<p>
Binary distributions for most Alpha and VAX environments are available 
on the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM and from various websites, including the 
following:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.sidhe.org/vmsperl/prebuilt.html
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/

There are OpenVMS-specific Perl modules that implement interfaces to a 
subset of the VMS System Services. With these modules, you can get (and 
often set) device, job, queue, user, system, and performance 
information. The lock manager, RMS indexed files, screen management 
utilities, and Intracluster Communication Services are also accessible 
via Perl. The relevant modules are all available from:

<p>
Many packages are provided in ZIP, GZIP, or BZIP2 format, which 
requires you to acquire the associated unzip tool to unpack it. You can 
get ZIP and UNZIP and related and similar tools from the following 
areas:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/
  <li>ftp://ftp.process.com/vms-freeware/unzip.alpha_exe
  <li>ftp://ftp.process.com/vms-freeware/unzip.vax_exe

  <li>http://www.djesys.com/zip.html
  <li>http://www.djesys.com/unzip.html
</ul>

<p>
or you can request the FILESERV_TOOLS package from the e-mail server.

<p>
Beware: The [000TOOLS...] pre-built versions of ZIP on the OpenVMS 
Freeware V4 (http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/ Freeware V4.0) 
CD-ROM will erroneously return BILF errors on OpenVMS V7.2 and later. 
Use of the source on the Freeware V4 to rebuild the ZIP image(s), or 
acquiring a pre-built ZIP image from one of the above areas can avoid 
this. The pre-built version of ZIP on the Freeware V4 kit is older than 
the included ZIP sources, and it contains a latent bug.]

<p>

available at:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/, look in a recent unzip* 
  directory. With the UNZIP542 directory from Freeware V5.0, look for the 
  file UNZIPSFX.TXT.
</ul>

<p>
If you want to build the zip images for yourself (eg: for an older 
OpenVMS version), pull over the entire contents of a recent unzip 
directory.

HP OpenVMS Engineering uses a tool known as FTSV for creating 
self-extracting compressed files using the OpenVMS DCX compression 
tools, as seen with various OpenVMS ECO (patch) kits. sfx provides 
better compression than does DCX. The FTSV and its related FTSO package 
have only limited availability outside HP, and are not standard 
products.
