<p>
Various folks have successfully used common third-party disk disk 
devices with OpenVMS, such as the ATA (IDE) and SCSI variants of the 
Iomega Zip250 removable disk device.

Common SCSI CD-R/CD-RW devices such as the Plextor PlexWriter 12/10/32S 
SCSI
<a name="index_x_1293"></a>
 series and the HP DVD200i series (recording CD-R) have also been 
 successfully utilized with various AlphaStation and VAXstation systems, 
 and with tools such as CDRECORD. (A Plextor PlexWriter burn of 
 614400000 bytes (300000 sectors) requires just over six minutes at 12x, 
 using an AlphaStation XP1000 666 MHz EV67 system UltraSCSI host.)

If you choose to attempt to use third-party devices, ensure that you 
have the most current OpenVMS version and the most current ECO kit(s) 
applied. In the specific case of the ATA (IDE) Iomega Zip250 drive, 
ensure that you have the most current revision of SYS$DQDRIVER 
installed.

<a name="wires3"><h1><font color=maroon>14.29 What is flow control and how does it work?</font></h1></a>

<p>
XON/XOFF is one kind of flow control.
<a name="index_x_1359"></a>
<a name="index_x_1360"></a>

<p>
In ASCII, XON is the <kbd>[CTRL/Q]</kbd> character, and XOFF is the 
<kbd>[CTRL/S]</kbd>.

<p>
XON/XOFF flow control is typically associated with asynchronous serial 
line communications. XON/XOFF is an in-band flow control, meaning that 
the flow control is mixed in with the data.

<p>
CTS/RTS is another type of flow control, and is sometimes called 
hardware flow control. Out-of-band means that seperate lines/pins from 
the data lines (pins) are used to carry the CTS/RTS signals.

<p>
Both kinds of flow control are triggered when a threshold is reached in 
the incoming buffer. The flow control is suppose to reach the 
transmitter in time to have it stop transmitting before the receiver 
buffer is full and data is lost. Later, after a sufficient amount of 
the receiver's buffer is freed up, the resume flow control signal is 
sent to get the transmitter going again.

<p>
DECnet Phase IV on OpenVMS VAX supports the use of asynchronous serial 
communications as a network line; of
<a name="index_x_1361"></a>
 asynch DECnet. The communication devices (eg. modems, and drivers) 
 <em>must not</em> be configured for XON/XOFF flow control. The 
 incidence of these (unexpected) in-band characters will corrupt data 
 packets. Further, the serial line device drivers might normally remove 
 the XON and XOFF characters from the stream for terminal applications, 
 but DECnet configures the driver to pass <em>all</em> characters 
 through and requires that all characters be permitted. (The 
 communication devices must pass through not only the XON and XOFF 
 characters, they must pass <em>all</em> characters including the 8-bit 
 characters. If data compression is happening, it must reproduce the 
 source stream exactly. No addition or elimination of null characters, 
 and full data transparency.

<p>
An Ethernet network is rather different than an asynchronous serial 
line. Ethernet specifies the control of data flow on a shared segment 
using CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access, with Collision Detect) An
<a name="index_x_1362"></a>
<a name="index_x_1363"></a>
<a name="index_x_1364"></a>
Ethernet station that is ready to transmit listens for a clear channel 
(Carrier Sense). When the channel is clear, the station begins to 
transmit by asserting a carrier and encoding the packet appropriately. 
The station concurrently listens to its own signal, to permit the 
station to detect if another station began to transmit at the same 
time---this is called collision detection. (The collision corrupts the 
signal in a way that can reliably be detected.) Upon detecting the 
collision, both stations will stop transmitting, and will back off and 
try again a little later. (You can see a log of this activity in the 
DECnet NCP network counters.)

<p>
DECnet
<a name="index_x_1365"></a>
provides its own flow control, above and beyond the flow control of the 
physical layer (if any). The end nodes handshake at the beginning to 
establish a transmit window size---and a transmitter will only send 
that much data before stopping and waiting for an acknowledgement. The 
acknowledgement is only sent when the receiver has confirmed the packet 
is valid. (A well-configured DECnet generally avoids triggering any 
underlying (out-of-band) flow control mechanism.)

<a name="index_x_1367"></a>
<a name="index_x_1368"></a>
<a name="index_x_1369"></a>
<a name="index_x_1370"></a>
generally handled transparently by SYS$DQDRIVER, and SYS$DQDRIVER will 
transparently block and de-block the media-native 2048 byte disk blocks 
with the 512 byte blocks expected by OpenVMS and by native OpenVMS 
software.

<p>
Read access to CD-ROM, CD-R and CD-RW devices on SCSI is handled by 
DKDRIVER, though SYS$DKDRIVER
<a name="index_x_1371"></a>
<a name="index_x_1372"></a>
<a name="index_x_1373"></a>
will not transparently de-block the native 2048 byte disk blocks into 
the 512 byte blocks expected by OpenVMS. The drive or external software 
is expected to provide this de-blocking, thus either a 512-byte-block 
capable drive (such as all RRD-series SCSI CD-ROM drives) is required, 
or host software is required for a 2048-byte block drive. SCSI drives 
with UNIX or 512-byte selectors will generally operate.

<p>
At least some of the Plextor PlexWriter SCSI drives can be accessed from
<a name="index_x_1374"></a>
<a name="index_x_1375"></a>
OpenVMS, and at least one Pioneer SCSI DVD drive (for CD media). The 
Pioneer
<a name="index_x_1376"></a>
 SCSI DVD drive switches to 2048 byte blocks for DVD media, and a 
 block-size conversion tool (written by Glenn Everhart) or other similar 
 tool can be applied.

<p>
OpenVMS also has supported HP DVD drives for the ATA (IDE) bus.

<a name="net100"><h2>15.2.2 Connecting to an IP Printer?</h2></a>

<p>
To connect a printer via the IP telnet or lpr/lpd protocols, you will 
need to install and configure an IP stack on OpenVMS, and configure the 
appropriate print queue.
<a name="index_x_1381"></a>
<a name="index_x_1382"></a>
<a name="index_x_1383"></a>
<a name="index_x_1384"></a>
<a name="index_x_1385"></a>

<p>
With current OpenVMS IP implementations, the choice of telnet or 
lpr/lpd really amounts to determining which of these works better with 
the particular printer involved.

<p>
To support network printing, the printer must include an internal or 
external
<a name="index_x_1386"></a>
<a name="index_x_1387"></a>
 NIC or JetDirect; an adapter connecting the network and the printer.

<p>
While it is normally possible to use a host-connected printer---when 
the host supports an LPD or telnet daemon, and OpenVMS and most other 
operating systems have the ability to serve locally-attached printers 
to other hosts on the network---it is generally far easier and far more 
effective to use a printer that is directly attached to the network. If 
your present printer does not have a NIC or a JetDirect, acquire an 
internal (if available) or external NIC or JetDirect. Or replace the 
printer. And obviously, most any operating system that can serve its 
local printers usually also provides a client that can access remote 
network-connected printers.

<p>
please see the Ask The Wizard area topics---starting with topic 
(1020)---for additional information on IP-based network printing.

<a name="mgmt6"><h2>15.2.3 How do I connect a PostScript printer via TCP/IP?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1390"></a>

<p>
Using TCP/IP Services (UCX) as the TCP/IP stack, it is possible to 
configure queues using the UCX$TELNETSYM (TCP/IP Services prior to 
V5.0) or TCPIP$TELNETSYM (with V5.0 and later) in order to print to 
Postscript printers. This assumes however that the printer itself can 
convert whatever is passed to it into something intelligible. As an 
example, if the printer has an IP address of 123.456.789.101 and jobs 
should be passed to port 9100 then :

The port number of 9100 is typical of HP JetDirect cards but may be 
different for other manufacturers cards.

<p>
As a better alternative, DCPS Version 1.4 and later support IP queues 
using either HP TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software or Process Software
<a name="index_x_1391"></a>
 Multinet
<a name="index_x_1392"></a>
 for OpenVMS. The usage of this type of interface is documented in the 
 DCPS documentation or release notes, and the DCPS$STARTUP.TEMPLATE 
 startup template file.

<a name="mgmt28"><h2>15.2.4 How do I set a default IP route or gateway on OpenVMS?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1395"></a>

<p>
If you have TCP/IP Services, then use the command for TCP/IP Services 
V5.0 and later:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ TCPIP 
SET ROUTE/GATE=x.x.x.x/DEFAULT/PERMANENT 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
And for earlier TCP/IP Services versions, use the command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ UCX 
SET ROUTE/GATE=x.x.x.x/DEFAULT/PERMANENT 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="mgmt36"><h2>15.2.5 How can I set up reverse telnet (like reverse LAT)?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1396"></a>

<p>
Though it may seem obvious, Telnet and LAT are quite different---with 
differing capabilities and design goals.

<p>
Please see the documentation around the TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS 
TELNET command CREATE_SESSION. This command is the equivilent of the 
operations performed in LTLOAD.COM or LAT$SYSTARTUP.COM. There is no 
TELNET equivilent to the sys$qio[w] control interface for LTDRIVER (as 
documented in the I/O User's Reference Manual) available, though 
standard sys$qio[w] calls referencing the created TN device would 
likely operate as expected.

<a name="misc9"><h2>15.2.6 Why can't I use PPP and RAS to connect to OpenVMS Alpha?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1397"></a>
<a name="index_x_1398"></a>
<a name="index_x_1399"></a>

<p>
OpenVMS Alpha IP PPP does not presently support authentication, and the 
Microsoft Windows NT option to disable authentication during a RAS 
connection apparently doesn't currently work---RAS connections will 
require authentication---and this will thus prevent RAS connections.

<p>
Future versions of OpenVMS and TCP/IP Services may add this, and future 
versions of Microsoft Windows may permit operations with authentication 
disabled.

<a name="vmsdecnet"><h1><font color=maroon>15.3 OpenVMS and DECnet Networking?</font></h1></a>

<p>
The following sections contain information on OpenVMS and DECnet 
networking.

<a name="net200"><h2>15.3.1 Can DECnet-Plus operate over IP?</h2></a>

<p>
Yes. To configure DECnet-Plus to operate over IP transport and over IP 
backbone networks, install and configure DECnet-Plus, and install and 
configure the PWIP
<a name="index_x_1400"></a>
 mechanism available within the currently-installed IP stack. Within 
 TCP/IP Services, this is a PWIPDRIVER configuration option within the 
 UCX$CONFIG (versions prior to V5.0) or TCPIP$CONFIG (with V5.0 and 
 later) configuration tool.

<a name="misc6"><h2>15.3.2 What does "failure on back translate address request" mean?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1401"></a>

<p>
The error message:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
BCKTRNSFAIL, failure on the back translate address request 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_1402"></a>

<p>
indicates that the destination node is running DECnet-Plus, and that 
its naming service (DECnet-Plus DECdns, LOCAL node database, etc) 
cannot locate a name to associate with the source node's address. In 
other words, the destination node cannot determine the node name for 
the node that is the source of the incoming connection.
<a name="index_x_1403"></a>

<p>
Use the DECNET_REGISTER mechanism (on the destination node) to register 
or modify the name(s) and the address(es) of the source node. Check the 
namespace on the source node, as well.

<p>
Typically, the nodes involved are using a LOCAL namespace, and the node 
name and address settings are not coherent across all nodes. Also check 
to make sure that the node is entered into its own LOCAL namespace. 
This can be a problem elsewhere, however. Very rarely, a cache 
corruption has been known to cause this error. To flush the cache, use 
the command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCL 
flush session control naming cache entry "*" 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Also check to see that you are using the latest ECO for DECnet-Plus for 
the version you are running. DECnet-Plus can use the following 
namespaces:

<ul>
  <li>DECdns: DECnet-Plus distributed name services.
<a name="index_x_1404"></a>
  <li>LocalFile: a local file containing names and addresses.
<a name="index_x_1405"></a>
  <li>DNS/BIND: the TCP/IP distributed name services mechanism.
<a name="index_x_1406"></a>
<a name="index_x_1407"></a>
  <li>The TCP/IP Services (UCX) local host file.
</ul>

<p>
Of these, searching DNS/BIND and LocalFile, respectively, is often the 
most appropriate configuration.
