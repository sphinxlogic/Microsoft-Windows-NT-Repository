<a name="misc7"><h1><font color=maroon>15.4 How to determine the network hardware address?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1411"></a>

<p>
Most Alpha and most VAX systems have a console command that displays 
the network hardware address. Many systems will also have a sticker 
identifying the address, either on the enclosure or on the network 
controller itself.

<p>
The system console power-up messages on a number of VAX and Alpha 
systems will display the hardware address, particularly on those 
systems with an integrated Ethernet network adapter present.

<p>
If you cannot locate a sticker on the system, if the system powerup 
message is unavailable or does not display the address, and if the 
system is at the console prompt, start with the console command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
HELP 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
A console command similar to one of the following is typically used to 
display the hardware address:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SHOW DEVICE 
SHOW ETHERNET 
SHOW CONFIG 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
On the oldest VAX Q-bus systems, the following console command can be 
used to read the address directly off the (DELQA, DESQA, or the 
not-supported-in-V5.5-and-later DEQNA) Ethernet controller:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
E/P/W/N:5 20001920 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Look at the low byte of the six words displayed by the above command. 
(The oldest VAX Q-bus systems---such as the KA630 processor module used 
on the MicroVAX II and VAXstation II series---lack a console HELP 
command, and these systems typically have the primary network 
controller installed such that the hardware address value is located at 
the system physical address 20001920.)

<p>
If the system is a VAX system, and another VAX system on the network is 
configured to answer Maintenance and Operations Protocol (MOP) 
bootstrap requests (via DECnet Phase IV, DECnet-Plus, or LANCP), the 
MOM$SYSTEM:READ_ADDR.EXE tool can be requested:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
B/R5:100 ddcu 
Bootfile: READ_ADDR 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Where ddcu is the name of the Ethernet controller in the above command. 
The primarly local DELQA, DESQA, and DEQNA Q-bus controllers are 
usually named XQA0. An attempt to MOP download the READ_ADDR program 
will ensue, and (if the download is successful) READ_ADDR will display 
the hardware address.

<p>
If the system is running, you can use DECnet or TCP/IP to display the 
hardware address with one of the following commands.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>

$! TCP/IP versions V5.0 and later 
$ TCPIP 
SHOW INTERFACE/FULL 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
A program can be created to display the hardware address, reading the 
necessary information from the network device drivers. A complete 
example C program for reading the Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 network 
controller hardware address (via sys$qio calls to the OpenVMS network 
device driver(s)) is available at the following URL:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/wizard/
</ul>

<p>
To use the DECnet Phase IV configurator tool to watch for MOP SYSID 
activity on the local area network:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCP 
SET MODULE CONFIGURATOR KNOWN CIRCUIT SURVEILLANCE ENABLED 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Let the DECnet Phase IV configurator run for at least 20 minutes, and 
preferably longer. Then issue the following commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCP 
SHOW MODULE CONFIGURATOR KNOWN CIRCUIT STATUS TO filename.txt 
SET MODULE CONFIGURATOR KNOWN CIRCUIT SURVEILLANCE DISABLED 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The resulting file (named filename.txt) can now be searched for the 
information of interest. Most DECnet systems will generate MOP SYSID 
messages identifying items such as the controller hardware address and 
the controller type, and these messages are generated and multicast 
roughly every ten minutes.

<p>
Information on the DECnet MOP SYSID messages and other parts of the 
maintenance protocols is included in the DECnet network architecture 
specifications referenced in section DOC9.

On recent OpenVMS releases:

  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>

<a name="mgmt14"><h2>15.4.2 How do I install DECnet Phase IV on VMS 7.1?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1413"></a>

<p>
On OpenVMS V7.1, all DECnet binaries were relocated into separate 
installation kits---you can selectively install the appropriate 
network: DECnet-Plus (formerly known as DECnet OSI), DECnet Phase IV, 
and HP TCP/IP Services (often known as UCX).

<p>
On OpenVMS versions prior to V7.1, DECnet Phase IV was integrated, and 
there was no installation question. You had to install the DECnet-Plus 
(DECnet/OSI) package on the system, after the OpenVMS upgrade or 
installation completed.

<p>
During an OpenVMS V7.1 installation or upgrade, the installation 
procedure will query you to learn if DECnet-Plus should be installed. 
If you are upgrading to V7.1 from an earlier release or are installing 
V7.1 from a distribution kit, simply answer "NO" to the question asking 
you if you want DECnet-Plus. Then---after the OpenVMS upgrade or 
installation completes -- use the PCSI PRODUCT INSTALL command to 
install the DECnet Phase IV binaries from the kit provided on the 
OpenVMS software distribution kit.

<p>
If you already have DECnet-Plus installed and wish to revert, you must 
reconfigure OpenVMS. You cannot reconfigure the "live" system, hence 
you must reboot the system using the V7.1 distribution CD-ROM. Then 
select the DCL ($$$ prompt) option. Then issue the commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$$$ DEFINE/SYSTEM PCSI$SYSDEVICE DKA0: 
$$$ DEFINE/SYSTEM PCSI$SPECIFIC DKA0:[SYS0.] 
$$$ PRODUCT RECONFIGURE VMS /REMOTE/SOURCE=DKA0:[VMS$COMMON] 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The above commands assume that the target system device and system root 
are &quot;DKA0:[SYS0.]&quot;. Replace this with the actual target 
device and root, as appropriate. The RECONFIGURE command will then 
issue a series of prompts. You will want to reconfigure DECnet-Plus off 
the system, obviously. You will then want to use the PCSI command 
PRODUCT INSTALL to install the DECnet Phase IV kit from the OpenVMS 
distribution media.

<p>
Information on DECnet support, and on the kit names, is included in the 
OpenVMS V7.1 installation and upgrade documentation.

<p>
Subsequent OpenVMS upgrade and installation procedures can and do offer 
both DECnet Phase IV and DECnet-Plus installations.

<a name="misc15"><h1><font color=maroon>15.5 How can I send (radio) pages from my OpenVMS system?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_1414"></a>

<p>
There are third-party products available to send messages to radio 
paging devices (pagers), communicating via various protocols such as 
TAP (Telocator Alphanumeric Protocol); paging packages.
<a name="index_x_1415"></a>
<a name="index_x_1416"></a>
<a name="index_x_1417"></a>

<p>
RamPage (Ergonomic Solutions)
<a name="index_x_1418"></a>
<a name="index_x_1419"></a>
is one of the available packages that can generate and transmit 
messages to radio pagers. Target Alert (Target Systems; formerly the 
DECalert product) is another.
<a name="index_x_1420"></a>
<a name="index_x_1421"></a>
Networking Dynamics Corp has a product called Pager Plus. The
<a name="index_x_1422"></a>
<a name="index_x_1423"></a>
System Watchdog package can also send pages. The Process Software
<a name="index_x_1424"></a>
<a name="index_x_1425"></a>
package PMDF can route specific email addresses to a paging service, as 
well.

<p>
Many commercial paging services provide email contact addresses for 
their paging customers---you can simply send or forward email directly 
to the email address assigned to the pager.

<p>
Some people implement the sending of pages to radio pagers by sending 
commands to a modem to take the "phone" off the "hook", and then the 
paging sequence, followed by a delay, and then the same number that a 
human would dial to send a numeric page. (This is not entirely 
reliable, as the modem lacks "call progress detection", and the program 
could simply send the dial sequence when not really connected to the 
paging company's telephone-based dial-up receiver.)

The following sections contain information on OpenVMS and Clusters, 
Volume Shadowing, and Cluster-related system parameters.

<a name="vmsscs"><h2>15.6.1 OpenVMS Cluster Communications Protocol Details?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_1426"></a>

<p>
The following sections contain information on the OpenVMS System 
Communications Services (SCS) Protocol.
<a name="index_x_1427"></a>

<a name="misc19"><h3>15.6.1.1 OpenVMS Cluster (SCS) over DECnet?  Over IP?</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_1428"></a>
<a name="index_x_1429"></a>

<p>
The OpenVMS Cluster environment operates over various network 
protocols, but the core of clustering uses the System Communications 
Services (SCS) protocols, and SCS-specific network datagrams. Direct 
(full) connectivity is assumed.

<p>
An OpenVMS Cluster <em>does not</em> operate over DECnet, nor over IP.

<p>
No SCS protocol routers are available.

<p>
Many folks have suggested operating SCS over DECnet or IP over the 
years, but SCS is too far down in the layers, and any such project 
would entail a major or complete rewrite of SCS and of the DECnet or IP 
drivers. Further, the current DECnet and IP implementations have large 
tracts of code that operate at the application level, while SCS must 
operate in the rather more primitive contexts of the system and 
particularly the bootstrap---to get SCS to operate over a DECnet or IP 
connection would require relocating major portions of the DECnet or IP 
stack into the kernel. (And it is not clear that the result would even 
meet the bandwidth and latency expectations.)

<p>
The usual approach for multi-site OpenVMS Cluster configurations 
involves FDDI, Memory Channel (MC2), or a point-to-point remote bridge, 
brouter, or switch. The connection must be transparent, and it must 
operate at 10 megabits per second or better (Ethernet speed), with 
latency characteristics similar to that of Ethernet or better. Various 
sites use FDDI, MC2, ATM, or point-to-point T3 link.

This section discusses OpenVMS Cluster communications, cluster 
terminology, related utilities, and command and control interfaces.

<a name="mgmt47scsterm"><h4>15.6.1.2.1 Cluster Terminology?</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_1431"></a>
<a name="index_x_1432"></a>
<a name="index_x_1433"></a>

<p>
SCS: Systems Communication Services. The protocol used to communicate 
between VMSCluster systems and between OpenVMS systems and SCS-based 
storage controllers. (SCSI-based storage controllers do not use SCS.)

<p>
PORT: A communications device, such as DSSI, CI, Ethernet or FDDI. Each 
CI or DSSI bus is a different local port, named PAA0, PAB0, PAC0 etc. 
All Ethernet and FDDI busses make up a single PEA0 port.

<p>
VIRTUAL CIRCUIT: A reliable communications path established between a 
pair of ports. Each port in a VMScluster establishes a virtual circuit 
with every other port in that cluster.

<p>
All systems and storage controllers establish "Virtual Circuits" to 
enable communications between all available pairs of ports.

<p>
SYSAP: A "system application" that communicates using SCS. Each SYSAP 
communicates with a particular remote SYSAP. Example SYSAPs include:

<p>
VMS$DISK_CL_DRIVER connects to MSCP$DISK
<br>
The disk class driver is on every VMSCluster system. MSCP$DISK is on 
all disk controllers and all VMSCluster systems that have SYSGEN 
parameter MSCP_LOAD set to 1
<a name="index_x_1434"></a>
<a name="index_x_1435"></a>

<p>
VMS$TAPE_CL_DRIVER connects to MSCP$TAPE
<br>
The tape class driver is on every VMSCluster system. MSCP$TAPE is on 
all tape controllers and all VMSCluster systems that have SYSGEN 
parameter TMSCP_LOAD set to 1
<a name="index_x_1436"></a>
<a name="index_x_1437"></a>

<p>
VMS$VAXCLUSTER connects to VMS$VAXCLUSTER
<br>
This SYSAP contains the connection manager, which manages cluster 
connectivity, runs the cluster state transition algorithm, and 
implements the cluster quorum algorithm. This SYSAP also handles lock 
traffic, and various other cluster communications functions.

<p>
SCS$DIR_LOOKUP connects to SCS$DIRECTORY
<br>
This SYSAP is used to find SYSAPs on remote systems

<p>
MSCP and TMSCP
<br>
The Mass Storage Control Protocol and the Tape MSCP servers are SYSAPs 
that provide access to disk and tape storage, typically operating over 
SCS protocols. MSCP and TMSCP SYSAPs exist within OpenVMS (for OpenVMS 
hosts serving disks and tapes), within CI- and DSSI-based storage 
controllers, and within host-based MSCP- or TMSCP storage controllers. 
MSCP and TMSCP can be used to serve MSCP and TMSCP storage devices, and 
can also be used to serve SCSI and other non-MSCP/non-TMSCP storage 
devices.

<p>
SCS CONNECTION: A SYSAP on one node establishes an SCS connection to 
its counterpart on another node. This connection will be on ONE AND 
ONLY ONE of the available virtual circuits.

<a name="mgmt47scsutil"><h4>15.6.1.2.2 Cluster Communications Control?</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_1438"></a>

<p>
When there are multiple virtual circuits between two OpenVMS systems it 
is possible for the VMS$VAXCLUSTER to VMS$VAXCLUSTER connection to use 
any one of these circuits. All lock traffic between the two systems 
will then travel on the selected virtual circuit.

<p>
Each port has a "LOAD CLASS" associated with it. This load class helps 
to determine which virtual circuit a connection will use. If one port 
has a higher load class than all others then this port will be used. If 
two or more ports have equally high load classes then the connection 
will use the first of these that it finds. Normally all CI and DSSI 
ports have a load class of 14(hex), while the Ethernet and FDDI ports 
will have a load class of A(hex).

<p>
For instance, if you have multiple DSSI busses and an FDDI, the 
VMS$VAXCLUSTER connection will chose the DSSI bus as this path has the 
system disk, and thus will always be the first DSSI bus discovered when 
the OpenVMS system boots.

<p>
To force all lock traffic off the DSSI and on to the FDDI, for 
instance, an adjustment to the load class value is required, or the 
DSSI SCS port must be disabled.

<p>
Note that with PE ports, you can typically immediately re-enable the 
path, permitting failover to occur should congestion or a problem 
arise---a running average of the path latency is checked when the 
virtual circuit is formed, and at periodic intervals (circa every three 
seconds), and when a problem with a virtual circuit arises.

<p>
In the case of PEDRIVER, the driver handles load balancing among the 
available Ethernet and FDDI connections based on the lowest latency 
path available to it. Traffic will be routed through that path until an 
event occurs that requires a fail-over.

<a name="mgmt47scstool"><h4>15.6.1.2.3 Cluster Communications Control Tools and Utilities?</h4></a>
<a name="index_x_1442"></a>

<p>
In most OpenVMS versions, you can use the tools:

<ul>
  <li>SYS$EXAMPLES:LAVC$STOP_BUS
  <li>SYS$EXAMPLES:LAVC$START_BUS
</ul>

<p>
These tools permit you to disable or enable all SCS traffic on the on 
the specified paths.

<p>
You can also use a preferred path mechanism that tells the local MSCP 
disk class driver (DUDRIVER) which path to a disk should be used. 
Generally, this is used with dual-pathed disks, forcing I/O traffic 
through one of the controllers instead of the other. This can be used 
to implement a crude form of I/O load balancing at the disk I/O level.

<p>
Prior to V7.2, the preferred path feature uses the tool:

<ul>
  <li>SYS$EXAMPLES:PREFER.MAR
</ul>

<p>
In OpenVMS V7.2 and later, you can use the following DCL command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SET PREFERRED_PATH 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_1443"></a>

<p>
The preferred path mechanism does not disable nor affect SCS operations 
on the non-preferred path.

<p>
With OpenVMS V7.3 and later, please see the SCACP utility for control 
over cluster communications, SCS virtual circuit control, port 
selection, and related.

<a name="clusterparams"><h2>15.6.2 Cluster System Parameter Settings?</h2></a>

<p>
The following sections contain details of configuring cluster-related 
system parameters.

<a name="mgmt10"><h3>15.6.2.1 What is the correct value for EXPECTED_VOTES in a VMScluster?</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_1445"></a>

<p>
The VMScluster connection manager uses the concept of votes and quorum 
to prevent disk and memory data corruptions---when sufficient votes are 
present for quorum, then access to resources is permitted. When 
sufficient votes are not present, user activity will be blocked. The 
act of blocking user activity is called a "quorum hang", and is better 
thought of as a "user data integrity interlock". This mechanism is 
designed to prevent a partitioned VMScluster, and the resultant massive 
disk data corruptions. <em>The quorum mechanism is expressly intended 
to prevent your data from becoming severely corrupted.</em>

<p>
On each OpenVMS node in a VMScluster, one sets two values in SYSGEN:
<a name="index_x_1446"></a>
<a name="index_x_1447"></a>
<a name="index_x_1448"></a>
<a name="index_x_1449"></a>
VOTES, and EXPECTED_VOTES. The former is how many votes the node 
contributes to the VMScluster. The latter is the total number of votes 
expected when the full VMScluster is bootstrapped.

<p>
Some sites erroneously attempt to set EXPECTED_VOTES too low, believing 
that this will allow when only a subset of voting nodes are present in 
a VMScluster. It does not. Further, an erroneous setting in 
EXPECTED_VOTES is automatically corrected once VMScluster connections 
to other nodes are established; user data is at risk of severe 
corruptions during the earliest and most vulnerable portion of the 
system bootstrap, before the connections have been established.

<p>
One can operate a VMScluster with one, two, or many voting nodes. With 
any but the two-node configuration, keeping a subset of the nodes 
active when some nodes fail can be easily configured. With the two-node 
configuration, one must use a primary-secondary configuration (where 
the primary has all the votes), a peer configuration (where when either 
node is down, the other hangs), or (preferable) a shared quorum disk.

<p>
Use of a quorum disk does slow down VMScluster transitions somewhat -- 
the addition of a third voting node that contributes the vote(s) that 
would be assigned to the quorum disk makes for faster transitions---but 
the use of a quorum disk does mean that either node in a two-node 
VMScluster configuration can operate when the other node is down.

<p>
If you choose to use a quoum disk, a QUORUM.DAT file will be 
automatically
<a name="index_x_1450"></a>
created when OpenVMS first boots and when a quorum disk is specified -- 
well, the QUORUM.DAT file will be created when OpenVMS is booted 
without also needing the votes from the quorum disk.

<p>
In a two-node VMScluster with a shared storage interconnect, typically 
each node has one vote, and the quorum disk also has one vote. 
EXPECTED_VOTES is set to three.

<p>
Using a quorum disk on a non-shared interconnect is unnecessary---the 
use of a quorum disk does not provide any value, and the votes assigned 
to the quorum disk should be assigned to the OpenVMS host serving 
access to the disk.

<p>
For information on quorum hangs, see the OpenVMS documentation. For 
information on changing the EXPECTED_VOTES value on a running system, 
see the SET CLUSTER/EXPECTED_VOTES command, and see the documentation 
for the AMDS and Availability Manager tools. Also of potential interest 
is the OpenVMS system console documentation for the processor-specific 
console commands used to trigger the IPC (Interrrupt Priority Level 
%x0C; IPL C) handler. AMDS, Availability Manager, and the IPC handler 
can each be used to clear a quorum hang. Use of AMDS and Availability 
Manager is generally recommended over IPC, particularly because IPC can 
cause CLUEXIT bugchecks if the system should remain halted beyond the 
cluster sanity timer limits.

<p>
The quorum scheme is a set of &quot;blade guards&quot; deliberately 
implemented by OpenVMS Engineering to provide data integrity---remove 
these blade guards at your peril. OpenVMS Engineering did <em>not</em> 
implement the quorum mechanism to make a system manager's life more 
difficult--- <em>the quorum mechanism was specifically implemented to 
keep your data from getting scrambled.</em>

<a name="mgmt61"><h3>15.6.2.2 Explain disk (or tape) allocation class settings?</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_1451"></a>

<p>
The allocation class mechanism provides the system manager with a way 
to configure and resolve served and direct paths to storage devices 
within a cluster. Any served device that provides multiple paths should 
be configured using a non-zero allocation class, either at the MSCP (or 
TMSCP) storage controllers, at the port (for port allocation classes), 
or at the OpenVMS MSCP (or TMSCP) server. All controllers or servers 
providing a path to the same device should have the same allocation 
class (at the port, controller, or server level).

<p>
Each disk (or tape) unit number used within a non-zero disk (or tape) 
allocation class must be unique, regardless of the particular device 
prefix. For the purposes of multi-path device path determination, any 
disk (or tape) device with the same unit number and the same disk (or 
tape) allocation class configuration is assumed to be the same device.

<p>
If you are reconfiguring disk device allocation classes, you will want 
to avoid the use of allocation class one ($1$) until/unless you have 
Fibre Channel storage configured. (Fibre Channel storage specifically 
requires the use of allocation class $1$. eg: $1$DGA0:.)

<a name="index_x_1452"></a>

<p>
The HSZ allocation class is applied to devices, starting with OpenVMS 
V7.2. It is considered a port allocation class (PAC), and all device 
names with a PAC have their controller letter forced to "A". (You might 
infer from the the text in the "Guidelines for OpenVMS Cluster 
Configurations" that this is something you have to do, though OpenVMS 
will thoughtfully handle this renaming for you.)

<p>
You can force the device names back to DKB by setting the HSZ 
allocation class to zero, and setting the PKB PAC to -1. This will use 
the host allocation class, and will leave the controller letter alone 
(that is, the DK controller letter will be the same as the SCSI port 
(PK) controller). Note that this won't work if the HSZ is configured in 
multibus failover mode. In this case, OpenVMS requires that you use an 
allocation class for the HSZ.

<p>
When your configuration gets even moderately complex, you must pay 
careful attention to how you assign the three kinds of allocation 
class: node, port and HSZ/HSJ, as otherwise you could wind up with 
device naming conflicts that can be painful to resolve.

<p>
The display-able path information is for SCSI multi-path, and permits 
the multi-path software to distinguish between different paths to the 
same device. If you have two paths to $1$DKA100, for example by having 
two KZPBA controllers and two SCSI buses to the HSZ, you would have two 
UCBs in a multi-path set. The path information is used by the 
multi-path software to distinguish between these two UCBs.

<p>
The displayable path information describes the path; in this case, the 
SCSI port. If port is PKB, that's the path name you get. The device 
name is no longer completely tied to the port name; the device name now 
depends on the various allocation class settings of the controller, 
SCSI port or node.

<p>
The reason the device name's controller letter is forced to "A" when 
you use PACs is because a shared SCSI bus may be configured via 
different ports on the various nodes connected to the bus. The port may 
be PKB on one node, and PKC on the other. Rather obviously, you will 
want to have the shared devices use the same device names on all nodes. 
To establish this, you will assign the same PAC on each node, and 
OpenVMS will force the controller letter to be the same on each node. 
Simply choosing "A" was easier and more deterministic than negotiating 
the controller letter between the nodes, and also parallels the 
solution used for this situation when DSSI or SDI/STI storage was used.

<p>
To enable port allocation classes, see the SYSBOOT command SET/BOOT, 
and see the DEVICE_NAMING system parameter.
