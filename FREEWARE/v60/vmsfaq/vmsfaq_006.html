<a name="mgmt9"><h1><font color=maroon>5.6 How do I change the node name of an OpenVMS System?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_349"></a>

<p>
The first step is to get a BACKUP of the system disk before making any 
changes---use the system disk backup procedures as documented in the 
OpenVMS System Management Manual, making sure to use the procedures and 
commands appropriate for the system disk.

<p>
Changing the node name involves a number of steps---the node name tends 
to be imbedded in a number of different data files around the system.
<a name="index_x_350"></a>
<a name="index_x_351"></a>

<ul>
  <li>Update the SCSNODE in MODPARAMS.DAT, and then run AUTOGEN as far as 
  the SETPARAMS phase. (Do not reboot yet.)
  <li>Modify the DECnet node name. (NETCONFIG is the DECnet Phase IV 
  tool, and NET$CONFIGURE is the DECnet-Plus tool.)
  <li>Modify the IP node name. (The TCP/IP Services tool is UCX$CONFIG 
  prior to V5.0, and is TCPIP$CONFIG in V5.0 and later releases.)
  <li>Modify the host node name on the various queues in the queue 
  database. (each queue has a host name, and it defaults to the SCS node 
  name of the queue's host system. See the command INIT/QUEUE/ON=node for 
  information.)
  <li>Modify the node name saved in any application databases, or any 
  local node-conditional operations present in the site-specific system 
  startup, etc. (SEARCH for the node name, specifying all types of files.)
  <li>Use the AUTHORIZE utility command RENAME/IDENTIFIER to rename the 
  SYS$NODE_oldnodename rightslist identifier to match the new node name. 
  (Do not change the binary value of this identifier, and do not delete 
  the identifier.) <br>If you have erroneously deleted or duplicate the 
  identifier, you can locate existing references to the binary identifier 
  value using the Freeware DFU package, and specifically the commands 
  SEARCH/ACE and /OWNER. You must (re)create the correctly-named 
  identifier using the binary value that is often stored in various 
  Access Control List Entry (ACE)
<a name="index_x_352"></a>
<a name="index_x_353"></a>
structures and object owner fields associated with files and objects 
present in the OpenVMS system.
  <li>Reset any license PAKs that are restricted to the old node name to 
  the new node name.
  <li>If the node name is part of a disk volume label, see <a href="vmsfaq_006.html#mgmt19">Section 5.12</a>.
  <li>Reboot the node or---if in a VMScluster---reboot the whole 
  VMScluster. (This tends to catch any errors immediately.)
</ul>

<p>
There are likely a few other areas where the nodename will be stored.

<p>
If the system is configured in a VMScluster and you change 
<em>either</em> the SCSNODE or the SCSSYSTEMID---but <em>not</em> both 
values---then you
<a name="index_x_354"></a>
<a name="index_x_355"></a>
<a name="index_x_356"></a>
<a name="index_x_357"></a>
will have to reboot the entire VMScluster. (The VMScluster remembers 
the mapping between these two values, and will assume that a 
configuration problem has occured if a mismatched pair appears, and 
will refuse to let a node with a mismatched pair join the VMScluster.)

<p>
To calculate the correct SCSSYSTEMID value, multiply the DECnet Phase
<a name="index_x_358"></a>
<a name="index_x_359"></a>
<a name="index_x_360"></a>
<a name="index_x_361"></a>
IV area number by 1024, and add the DECnet Phase IV node number. For 
example, the SCSSYSTEMID value for a DECnet node with address 19.22 is 
19478. ((19 * 1024) + 22 = 19478)

<p>
This may well have missed one or two configuration tools (or more!) 
that are needed at your site---the node name tends to get stored all 
over the place, in layered products, and in local software...

<p>

<a name="mgmt11"><h1><font color=maroon>5.7 Why doesn't OpenVMS see the new memory I just added?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_362"></a>
When adding memory to an OpenVMS system, one should check for an 
existing
<a name="index_x_363"></a>
<a name="index_x_364"></a>
<a name="index_x_365"></a>
<a name="index_x_366"></a>
definition of the PHYSICALPAGES (OpenVMS VAX) or PHYSICAL_MEMORY 
(OpenVMS Alpha) parameter in the SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT parameter 
database, use a text editor to reset the value in the file to the new 
correct value as required, and then perform the following command:
<a name="index_x_367"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT FEEDBACK 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This AUTOGEN command will reset various system parameters based on 
recent system usage (FEEDBACK), and it will reset the value for the 
PHYSICALPAGES parameter to the new value. It will also reboot the 
OpenVMS system.

<p>
PHYSICALPAGES and PHYSICAL_MEMORY can also be used to deliberately 
lower the amount of memory available for use by OpenVMS. This ability 
can be useful in a few specific circumstances, such as testing the 
behaviour of an application in a system environment with a particular 
(lower) amount of system memory available.

<p>
PHYSICALPAGES and PHYSICAL_MEMORY can be set to -1 (on OpenVMS Alpha) 
or (better and simpler) the entry can be removed from the MODPARAMS.DAT 
file, to indicate that all available memory should be used.

<a name="mgmt15"><h1><font color=maroon>5.8 How do I change the text in a user's UIC identifier?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_368"></a>

<p>
The text translations of the numeric User Identification Code (UIC) are 
based on identifiers present in the OpenVMS rightslist. Documentation 
on this area is included in the _Guide to OpenVMS System Security_ 
manual.

<p>
To control the identifiers shown for a user's UIC, you use AUTHORIZE. 
Each user has an associated group identifier, and an identifier 
specific to the user. And each user should have a unique UIC.

<p>
To alter the text of a user or group identifier, use commands such as:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE 
UAF&gt; rename/ident oldgroupid newgroupid 
UAF&gt; rename/ident olduserid  newuserid 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If you should find yourself missing an identifier for a particular 
user, you can add one for the user's UIC using a command such as:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
UAF&gt; add/ident/value=uic=[group,user] newuserid 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The UIC user identifier text is assigned when the username is created, 
and is the text of the username. The UIC group group identifier is 
assigned when the first username is created in the UIC group, and the 
text is based on the account name specified for the first user created 
in the group. The value of this identifier is [groupnumber, 177777]. To 
add a missing group identifier, use an asterisk as follows:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
UAF&gt; add/ident/value=uic=[group,*] newgroupid 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You may find cases where an identifier is missing from time to time, as 
there are cases where the creation of a UIC group name identifier might 
conflict with an existing username, or a user identifier might conflict 
with an existing group identifier. When these conflicts arise, the 
AUTHORIZE utility will not create the conflicting group and/or user 
identifier when the username is created.

<p>
You can can add and remove user-specified identifiers, but you should 
avoid changing the numeric values associated with any existing 
identifiers. You should also avoid reusing UICs or identifiers when you 
add new users, as any existing identifiers that might be present on 
objects in the system from the old user will grant the same access to 
the new user. Please see the security manual for details.

<p>
Note that OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 does not include support for hardware 
and/or configurations first supported in OpenVMS Alpha V6.2-1H1, 
V6.2-1H2, or V6.2-1H3; one must upgrade to OpenVMS VAX V7.1.

<p>
One cannot update directly to a V6.2-1Hx Limited Hardware Release (LHR) 
from any release prior to the baseline V6.2 release. The same 
prohibition holds for performing updates directly to V7.1-1Hx from any 
release prior to V7.1---this is not supported, and does not produce the 
expected results. The LHR kits can, however, be directly booted and can 
be directly installed, without regard to any operating system that 
might be present on the target disk.

<p>
OpenVMS Alpha updates for LHRs (through V7.1-1Hx) require the use of 
VMSINSTAL for the update. These LHR releases use PCSI for the 
installation, but not for the update. Non-LHR releases use PCSI for 
installs and upgrades.

<p>
OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2 and later use PCSI for LHRs and for OpenVMS 
upgrades and for all OpenVMS ECO kit installations. VMSINSTAL OpenVMS 
ECO kits are not used on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2 and later. Prior to 
V7.1-2, VMSINSTAL-based ECO kits are used for OpenVMS.

<a name="cluster_path"><h2>5.9.3 OpenVMS Cluster Rolling Upgrade Paths</h2></a>

<p>
Rolling Upgrades require multiple system disks. Rolling upgrades permit 
the OpenVMS Cluster to remain available while individual systems are 
being upgraded to a new OpenVMS release.

<p>
OpenVMS Cluster rolling upgrades for both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha 
may (will) have different, or additional upgrade requirements, and have 
requirements around which versions of OpenVMS can coexist in a OpenVMS 
Cluster than what is listed here.

<p>
See the OpenVMS Upgrade and Installation Manual for the particular 
release, and the OpenVMS Software Product Descriptions for OpenVMS and 
for OpenVMS Cluster software:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.compaq.com/info/spd/
<br>
OpenVMS typically uses SPD 25.01.xx and/or SPD 41.87.xx.
</ul>

<p>
for further details on the rolling upgrade, and for support 
information. The documentation for older releases of OpenVMS VAX 
includes various platform-specific manuals, manuals that include 
instructions that are specific to installing and upgrading on the 
platform.

<a name="terminology"><h2>5.9.5 OpenVMS Alpha Terminology</h2></a>

<p>
The following terms apply to OpenVMS Alpha upgrades and installations.

<ul>
  <li>Update
<br>
Typically used for Limited Hardware Releases (LHR) releases. Performed 
via VMSINSTAL. Applies only to the OpenVMS release that the LHR is 
based on, or to an intermediate LHR. (eg: V7.1-1H2 applies only to 
V7.1-1H1 and to V7.1, not to any other releases.) LHRs within a series 
are cumulative, containing all files and features of previous LHRs in 
the same series.
  <li>Upgrade
<br>
Performed via PCSI. Upgrades can typically be applied to a 
release-specific (and documented) range of prior OpenVMS releases.
  <li>Install
<br>
Performed via PCSI. With an installation, no existing version of the 
operating system is assumed present, nor are any files from any copy of 
the operating system might be present preserved, and the entire 
contents of the target disk are destroyed via a disk initialization.
  <li>preserve
<br>
Performed via PCSI. Otherwise similar to an installation, this option 
skips the disk reinitialization. User files on the target disk are 
preserved. Any existing operating system files on the target disk are 
clobbered.
  <li>LHR
<br>
Limited Hardware Release. LHRs are specific to and are targeted at new 
hardware configurations, and are not shipped to customers with support 
contracts. At least one LHR kit must be specifically acquired when 
purchasing new hardware, new hardware that is not (yet) supported by 
any mainline (non-LHR) release. LHRs have an "H" in the OpenVMS version 
string, indicating a "Hardware" release.
</ul>

<a name="mgmt17"><h1><font color=maroon>5.10 Why do I have a negative number in the pagefile reservable pages?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_374"></a>

<p>
Seeing a negative number in the reservable pages portion of the SHOW 
MEMORY/FULL command can be normal and expected, and is (even) 
documented behaviour. A pagefile with a negative number of reservable 
pages is overcommitted, which is generally goodness assuming that every 
process with reserved pages does not try to occupy all of the reserved 
pagefile space at the same time.

<p>
To understand how the pagefile reservation process works, think about 
how a traditional bank operates when accepting customer deposits and 
making loans. It's the same idea with the pagefile space. There is less 
money in the bank vault than the total deposits, because much of the 
money has been loaned out to other customers of the bank. And the 
behaviour parallels that of the pagefile down to the problems that a 
"run on the bank" can cause for banking customers. (Though there is no 
deposit insurance available for pagefile users.)

<p>
If all of the running applications try to use the reserved space, the 
system manager will need to enlarge the pagefile or add one or more 
additional pagefules.

<p>
To determine if the pagefile is excessively overcommitted, watch for 
"double overcommitment"---when the reservable space approaches the 
negatation of the available total space---and watch that the total 
amount of free space available in the pagefile remains adequate. If 
either of these situations arises, additional pagefile storage is 
required.

<p>
Additional pagefile information: Additional pagefiles can typically be 
created and connected on a running OpenVMS system. New processes and 
new applications will tend to use the new pagefile, and existing 
applications can be restarted to migrate out of the more congested 
pagefiles. Pagefiles are generally named PAGEFILE.SYS, and multiple 
pagefiles are generally configured on separate disk spindles to spread 
the paging I/O load across the available disk storage. When multiple 
pagefiles are present on recent OpenVMS versions, each pagefile file 
should be configured to be approximately the same total size as the 
other pagefiles.

<p>
For additional information on pagefile operations and related commands, 
see the system management and performance management manuals in the 
OpenVMS documentation set.

<p>
With OpenVMS V7.3 and later, the displays have been changed and these 
negative values are no longer visible.

<a name="mgmt18"><h1><font color=maroon>5.11 Do I have to update layered products when updating OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_375"></a>

<p>
The Software Public Rollout Reports for OpenVMS list the current and 
future availability of HP software products shipping on the OpenVMS 
Software Products Library kits (CDROM consolidations) for OpenVMS Alpha 
and/or OpenVMS VAX. Specifically, the required minimum versions for 
product support are listed.

<p>
Comprehensive Public Rollout Information, listing previous product 
versions as well as currently shipping versions, has been compiled into 
a separate set of reports. The product information is grouped to show 
Operating System support.

<p>
You may or may not be able to use older versions of local applications, 
third-party products, and various HP OpenVMS layered products with more 
recent versions of OpenVMS. User-mode code is expected to be upward 
compatible. Code executing in a privileged processor mode---typically 
either executive or kernel mode---may or may not be compatible with 
more recent OpenVMS versions.

<p>
These reports are updated regularly. Please see:

<p>
Dismount the disk, and mount it privately. If the disk is mounted by 
more than one node in an OpenVMS Cluster, dismount it from all other 
nodes. If this disk is an OpenVMS system disk, shut down all other 
nodes that are bootstrapped from this disk.

<p>
Issue the SET VOLUME/LABEL command, specifying the new label.

On OpenVMS V6.0 and later, issue the following PCSI command to reset 
the label information stored within the PCSI database to reflect the

Locate any references in the system startup (typically including the 
disk MOUNT commands) and any DISK$label references in application 
files, and change the references appropriately.

<p>
If this is a system disk (for the host or for a satellite), also check 
the DECnet MOP or LANCP boot database, as well as any references to the 
disk created by CLUSTER_CONFIG*.COM.

<p>
If Compaq Analyze is in use, check the system startup procedures for 
the Compaq Analyze tool. Certain versions of Compaq Analyze will record 
specific disk volume labels within the startup procedures.

<p>
Remount the disk appropriately.

<a name="mgmt21"><h1><font color=maroon>5.13 How can I set up a shared directory?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_377"></a>

<p>
To set up a shared directory---where all files created in the directory 
are accessible to the members of specified group of users---you can use 
an access control list (ACL) and an identifier.

<p>
The following also shows how to set up a resource identifier, which 
further allows the disk resources to be charged to the specified 
identifier rather than each individual user. (If you don't want this, 
then omit the attributes option on the identifier creation and omit the 
entry added in the disk quota database.

<p>
Add an identifier using the AUTHORIZE utility:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
ADD/IDENTIFER/ATTRIBUTES=RESOURCE groupidentifier 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Grant the identifier to each user in the group using AUTHORIZE:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
GRANT/IDENTIFIER groupidentifier username 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If disk quotas are in use, add an entry via SYSMAN for each disk:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
DISKQUOTA ADD groupidentifier/PERMQUOTA=pq/OVERDRAFT=od/DEVICE=ddcu: 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Set the shared directory to have an ACL similar to the following using 
the SET SECURITY (V6.0 and later) or SET ACL (versions prior to V6.0) 
command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
(DEFAULT_PROTECTION,S:RWED,O:RWED,G,W) 
(IDENTIFIER=groupidentifier,OPTIONS=DEFAULT,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE) 
(IDENTIFIER=groupidentifier,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE) 
(CREATOR,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+ACCESS+DELETE) 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If there are files already resident in the directory, set their 
protections similarly. (The OPTIONS=DEFAULT, DEFAULT_PROTECTION, and 
CREATOR ACEs apply to directories.)

<p>
The default protection mask is used to establish the default file 
protection mask, this mask does not prevent the users holding the 
specified groupidentifier from accessing the file(s), as they can 
access the file via the explicit identifier granting access that is 
present in the ACL.

<p>
For further information, see the <em>OpenVMS Guide to System Security 
Manual</em>, specifically the sections on ACLs and identifiers, and 
resource identifiers.
