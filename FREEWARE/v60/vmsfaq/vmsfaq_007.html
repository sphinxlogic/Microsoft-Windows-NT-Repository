<a name="index_x_381"></a>

<p>
This section contains information on various graphics controllers 
supported by OpenVMS Alpha, and specifically information on where and 
how to obtain device drivers for specific early OpenVMS releases--- 
device drivers for controllers are integrated into and shipped with 
OpenVMS Alpha, but versions of these device drivers are sometimes made 
available for specific earlier OpenVMS releases.

<a name="elsa"><h2>5.15.1 The ELSA GLoria Synergy</h2></a>

<p>
On OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2, V7.2, and V7.2-1, acquire the appropriate 
GRAPHICS PCSI kit, and all prerequisite OpenVMS ECO kits:

<ul>
  <li>VMS712_GRAPHICS-V0300 or later
  <li>VMS72_GRAPHICS-V0100 or later
  <li>VMS712_GRAPHICS-V0300 or later
</ul>

<p>
The ELSA GLoria Synergy is the PBXGK-BB; the PowerStorm 3D10T.
<a name="index_x_382"></a>
<a name="index_x_383"></a>
<a name="index_x_384"></a>
Please ensure you have the most current ECOs for this and other 
graphics controllers installed; check for and install the current 
GRAPHICS kit. (See <a href="vmsfaq_004.html#time3">Section 4.3.1</a> for some unexpectedly related details.)

<p>
On OpenVMS Alpha V7.2-1, the files necessary for this graphics 
controller are located in the distribution CD-ROM directory:

<p>
<table border=0>

</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Also check for any available (later) ECO kits.

<p>
An earlier kit (ALP4D20T01_071) (for V7.1, V7.1-1H1, and V7.1-1H2) was 
once available, but has been superceded and is not recommended. Use of 
V7.1-2 or later (and use of one the above GRAPHICS kits as required) is 
typically the best approach.

<p>
OpenVMS V7.2-2 and later mainline releases directly support the 
controller.

<a name="mgmt27"><h1><font color=maroon>5.17 How do I move the queue manager database?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_402"></a>

<p>
To move the location of the queue database, the 
SYS$QUEUE_MANAGER.QMAN$QUEUES and SYS$QUEUE_MANAGER.QMAN$JOURNAL files, 
to a disk that is fast(er), has
<a name="index_x_403"></a>
plenty of free space, and that is not heavily used. If the queue 
database is on a (busy) OpenVMS system disk, you can and probably 
should move it off the system disk to another disk spindle.

<p>
To move the queue database:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Checkpoint the journal file. This reduces the file size to the 
  in-memory database size. This will cause the noted delay.

<a name="mgmt30"><h1><font color=maroon>5.18 How do I delete an undeletable/unstoppable (RWAST) process?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_405"></a>

<p>
&quot;Undeleteable&quot; jobs are usually &quot;undeleteable&quot; for 
a reason---this can track back to insufficient process quotas, to a 
kernel-mode error in OpenVMS or a third-party device driver, or to 
other odd problems.

<p>
These undeletable jobs typically become of interest because they are 
holding onto a particular resource (eg: tape drive, disk drive, 
communications widget) that you need to use... If the particular device 
supports firmware, ensure that the device firmware is current -- TQK50 
controllers are known for this when working with old firmware. (That, 
and the infamous "MUA4224" firmware bug.) If this device has a driver 
ECO kit available, acquire and apply it... If the particular relevant 
host component has an ECO, acquire and apply it.

<p>
Useful tools include SDA (to see what might be going on) and DECamds 
(which increase and thus potentially fix quota-related problems). (nb: 
Applications with quota leaks will obviously not stay fixed.)

<p>
If the stuck application is BACKUP, ensure you have the current BACKUP 
ECO and are directly following the V7.1 or (better) V7.2 or later 
process quota recommendations for operator BACKUP accounts. Quota 
details are in the <em>OpenVMS System Manager's Manual</em>.

<p>
If the firmware and ECO levels are current, the best approach is to 
take a system crashdump, and pass a copy of the dump file along to 
whomever is maintaining the device driver for the particular 
device/widget/driver involved, with any details on how you got into 
this situation. (The reboot involved with taking the crashdump will 
obviously clear the problem.)

<p>
There was some kernel-mode code (typically for OpenVMS VAX) that can 
reset the device ownership field, but that is rather obviously only an 
interim solution---the real fix is avoiding the loss of the IRP, the 
process quota leak, or whatever else is "jamming up" this particular 
process...

<a name="mgmt31"><h1><font color=maroon>5.19 How do I reset the error count(s)?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_406"></a>

<p>
The system reboot is the only supported approach, but it is obviously 
undesirable in various situations---there is presently no supported 
mechanism to reset error counts once the error(s) have been logged.

<p>
As for an unsupported approach---and be aware of the potential for 
causing a system crash...

<p>
To reset the error count, one needs to determine the system address of 
the error count field. For a device, this is at an offset within the 
device's UCB structure. On VAX, the field is at an offset symbolically 
defined as UCB$W_ERRCNT. On Alpha, this field's offset is symbolically 
defined as UCB$L_ERRCNT. The former is a word in size; the latter is a 
longword. (Could it be that Alpha devices are more error prone? ;)

<p>
You now need to locate the system address of the UCB$%_ERRCNT field of 
the device you wish to reset. Enter SDA. In the following, you will see 
designations in {} separated by a /. The first item in braces is to be 
used on the VAX and the second item should be used on an Alpha. (ie. 
{VAX/Alpha})

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ ANALYZE/SYSTEM 
SDA&gt;  READ SYS${SYSTEM/LOADABLE_IMAGES}:SYSDEF.STB 
SDA&gt;  SHOW DEVICE &lt;ddnc:&gt;    ! device designation of device with error 
SDA&gt;  EVALUATE UCB+UCB${W/L}_ERRCNT 
Hex = hhhhhhhh   Decimal = -dddddddddd         UCB+offset 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Record the hexadecimal value 'hhhhhhhh' returned.

<p>
You can now exit from SDA and $ RUN SYS$SHARE:DELTA or do what I prefer 
to do, issue the following:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SDA&gt; SPAWN RUN SYS$SHARE:DELTA 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
On both VAX and Alpha, the DELTA debugger will be invoked and will 
ident- ify itself. On Alpha, there will be an Alpha instruction 
decoded. For those unfamiliar with DELTA, it does not have a prompt and 
only one error message---Eh? (Well, for sake of argument, there might 
be another error produced on the console if you're not careful---aka. a 
system crash!)

<p>
If you are on a VAX, enter the command: [W

<p>
If you are on Alpha, enter the command: [L

<p>
These set the prevailing mode to word and longword respectively. Remem- 
ber the UCB${W/L)_ERRCNT differences?

<p>
Now issue the command 1;M

<p>
DELTA will respond with 00000001

<p>
You are now poised to ZAP the error count field. To do so you need to 
en- ter the system address and view its contents. The format of the 
command to do this is of the form:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
IPID:hhhhhhhh/ 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
For an IPID, use the IPID of the SWAPPER process. It is always: 00010001

<p>
Thus, to ZAP the error count, you would enter:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
00010001:hhhhhhhh/ 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
When you enter the / SDA will return the content of the address 
hhhhhhhh. This should be the error count (in hexadecimal) of the device 
in question. If it is not, you did something wrong and I'd suggest you 
type a carriage return and then enter the command EXIT to get out of 
DELTA. Regroup and see where your session went awry.

<p>
If you entered your address correctly and the error count was returned 
as in the following example, you can proceed.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
00010001:80D9C6C8/0001                          ! output on VAX    1 error 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
00010001:80D9C6C8/00000001                      ! output on Alpha  1 error 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You can now ZAP the error count by entering a zero and typing a 
carriage return. For example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
00010001:80D9C6C8/0001 0<kbd>[return]</kbd>           ! output on VAX    1 error 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
00010001:80D9C6C8/00000001 0<kbd>[return]</kbd>       ! output on Alpha  1 error 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Now type the command EXIT and a carriage return.

<p>
Alternatively, reboot the system.

<a name="mgmt32"><h1><font color=maroon>5.20 How do I find out if the tape drive supports compression?</font></h1></a>

<a name="mgmt33"><h1><font color=maroon>5.21 Can I copy SYSUAF to another version? To VAX? To Alpha?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_408"></a>

<p>
The format of the SYSUAF.DAT, RIGHTSLIST, and associated files are 
upward-compatible, and compatible across OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha 
systems. (This compatibility is a a basic requirement of mixed-version 
OpenVMS Cluster configurations and OpenVMS upgrades---for specific 
support information, please see the OpenVMS Cluster rolling upgrade and 
mixed-version requirements.) That said, it's the contents of the SYSUAF 
and RIGHTSLIST files that will make this more interesting.

<p>
The same basic steps necessary for moving RIGHTSLIST and SYSUAF files 
to another node are rather similar to the steps involved in merging 
these files in an OpenVMS Cluster---see the appendix of the OpenVMS 
Cluster documentation for details of merging files. (You might not be 
merging the contents of two (or more) files, but you are effectively 
merging the contents of the files into the target system environment.)

<p>
Considerations:

<ul>
  <li>applications often hold SYSUAF or RIGHTSLIST open, meaning a system 
  reboot is often the best way to activate new files.
  <li>the meanings of the RESTRICTED and CAPTIVE flags settings on the 
  UAF entries have changed over time.
  <li>the new NET$PROXY.DAT file that is initially created based on the 
  contents of the NETPROXY.DAT during the OpenVMS VAX V6.1 upgrade and 
  during the OpenVMS Alpha V6.2 upgrade. This file is maintained in 
  parallel with NETPROXY.DAT.
  <li>the RIGHTSLIST identifier values and UIC values that end up 
  scattered around the target system must be rationalized with the 
  contents of the new RIGHTSLIST and SYSUAF files.
</ul>

<p>
The lattermost case---resolving the identifier values---is often the 
most interesting and difficult part. If you find that an identifier 
value (or identifier name) from the source RIGHTSLIST collides with 
that of an identifier existing on the target system, you must first 
determine if the two identifiers perform the same function. In most 
cases, they will not. As such, you will have to find and chance all 
references to the identifier value(s) (or name(s)) to resolve the 
"collision".

<p>
If you encounter a collision, changing both of the identifier binary 
values (or names) involved in the collision to new and unique values 
can prevent security problems if you should miss a couple of 
identifiers embedded somewhere on the target system during the whole 
conversion process---rather than the wrong alphanumeric value for the 
identifier being displayed, you'll simply see the binary format for the 
identifier displayed, and no particular access will be granted. And any 
DCL commands or such that reference the old alphanumeric name will 
fail, rather than silently (and potentially erroneously) succeeding.

<p>
Similar requirements exist for UIC values, as these too tend to be 
scattered all over the system environment. Like the binary identifier 
values, you will find UIC values associated with disks, ACLs, queues, 
and various other structures.

<p>
For a list of the various files shared in an OpenVMS Cluster and that 
can be involved when relocating an environment from one node to another

Procedures to extract the contents of a (potentially corrupt) queue 
database are provided on the OpenVMS Freeware (V5) and can be used to 
combine two queue databases together while shuffling files between 
OpenVMS Cluster hosts.

<a name="mgmt34"><h1><font color=maroon>5.22 How do I delete (timeout) idle processes?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_412"></a>

<p>
There is no such command integrated within OpenVMS, though there are 
(optional) timers available within certain terminal servers and similar 
devices, and there is an integrated time-of-day mechanism that provides 
control over when a user can access OpenVMS.

<p>
As for available tools, there are DECUS, freeware, and third-party 
tools known variously as &quot;idle process killers&quot; (IPK) or 
&quot;terminal timeout&quot; programs, as well as various other names. 
Examples include: Saiga Systems Hitman, Watchdog, MadGoat
<a name="index_x_413"></a>
<a name="index_x_414"></a>
<a name="index_x_415"></a>
Watcher (via the MadGoat site or the OpenVMS Freeware), Kblock, the 
Networking Dynamics tool known as Assassin, and the Zap tool. Also 
available is the XLNperformance system management utility, from 
XLNsystems.

<a name="index_x_417"></a>

<p>
A related package (for DECwindows sessions) is xtermlock.

<p>
If the forgetful users are in an application menu environment, the menu 
can potentially be extended to provide this capability.

<a name="mgmt37"><h1><font color=maroon>5.23 Do I need a PAK for the DECevent (HP Analyze) tool?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_418"></a>

<p>
DECevent and HP (Compaq) Analyze are available to customers with 
support contracts. The PAK is required only for the advanced functions 
of DECevent, the basic bits-to-text translation of the error log does 
not require a license PAK. Ignore the prompt, in other words. (The PAK 
should be available to you if you have a hardware support contract or 
warrantee, and the PAK enables the use of the advanced error analysis 
and notification capabilities within DECevent.)

<a name="mgmt38"><h1><font color=maroon>5.24 INITIALIZE ACCVIO and ANSI tape label support?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_423"></a>

<p>
A change was made (back in 1988) to (as it was then known) VAX/VMS 
V5.1-1 that added support for the then-new ANSI X3.27-1987 magnetic 
tape label standard. Prior to the ANSI X3.27-1987 standard, the date 
field in the ANSI HDR1 record permits dates only as far as the end of 
Year 1999. With ANSI X3.27-1987, dates through Year 1999 and dates from 
Years 2000 to 2099 are permitted.

<p>
Versions of INIT.EXE and MTAACP.EXE from VAX/VMS releases prior to
<a name="index_x_424"></a>
<a name="index_x_425"></a>
<a name="index_x_426"></a>
V5.1-1 will potentially have problems properly processing ANSI magnetic 
tapes when Y2K
<a name="index_x_427"></a>
<a name="index_x_428"></a>
<a name="index_x_429"></a>
and later dates are involved---the DCL INITIALIZE command is known to 
encounter access violation (ACCVIO) errors.

<p>
The available solutions include upgrades, or setting the date back. 
Direct initialization of the tape with the new headers (via $qio) is 
also clearly possible, though the limitation within the old MTAACP.EXE 
magtape ACP image is not nearly so easy to bypass.

<a name="mgmt39"><h1><font color=maroon>5.25 How do I recover from INSVIRMEM errors?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_430"></a>

<p>
Prior to OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 and on all OpenVMS VAX releases, 
VIRTUALPAGECNT and PGFLQUOTA limit the amount of virtual address space 
that is available to each process.

<p>
Further limiting the amount of address space is the size of system 
space (S0 and S1 space). On OpenVMS Alpha versions prior to V7.0 and on 
all OpenVMS VAX releases, VIRTUALPAGECNT and MAXPROCESSCNT together 
determine the size of the page table data structures that occupy large 
tracts of system space. When no system virtual address space is 
available for the stuff that needs it---this includes the page tables, 
non-paged pool, and various other structures---then the values of 
VIRTUALPAGECNT and MAXPROCESSCNT cannot be increased.

<p>
In OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 and later, the page table data structures have 
been moved out of S0 and S1 space and into page table space. In OpenVMS 
Alpha V7.2 and later, certain large data structures found in non-paged 
pool (eg: lock management structures) have been moved into 64-bit 
space, thus freeing up room in non-paged pool and in S0 and S1 space 
(where non-paged pool resides) while also permitting much larger data 
structures.
