<a name="time10"><h1><font color=maroon>4.5 Why does the SET TIME command fail?  Help managing DTSS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_286"></a>

<p>
If you try to set the system time with the SET TIME command, and see 
one of the following messages:
<a name="index_x_287"></a>
<a name="index_x_288"></a>
<a name="index_x_289"></a>
<a name="index_x_290"></a>
<a name="index_x_291"></a>
<a name="index_x_292"></a>
<a name="index_x_293"></a>
<a name="index_x_294"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
%SET-E-NOTSET, error modifying time 
-SYSTEM-F-IVSSRQ, invalid system service request 
 
%SET-E-NOTSET, error modifying time 
-SYSTEM-E-TIMENOTSET, time service enabled; enter a time service command to update the time 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This occurs if the time on the local system is controlled by a time 
service software, for example the distributed time service software 
(DTSS) provided as part of the DECnet-Plus installation. The DTSS 
software communicates with one or more time servers to obtain the 
current time. It entirely controls the local system time (for 
DECnet-Plus, there is a process named DTSS$CLERK for this);
<a name="index_x_295"></a>
<a name="index_x_296"></a>
therefore, the usage of the SET TIME command (and the underlying 
$SETTIM system service) is disabled.
<a name="index_x_297"></a>
<a name="index_x_298"></a>

<p>
The first message is displayed on systems running DECnet-Plus V6.1 and 
earlier. On systems with newer DECnet-Plus software, the second (and 
more informative) message is given.

<p>
You shouldn't have to change the time manually - you should be doing 
this through the time server - but if you insist... you'll have to 
shutdown DTSS:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCL 
DISABLE DTSS 
DELETE DTSS 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This will shutdown DTSS$CLERK. You may then change the system time as 
usual. To restart the DTSS software, type

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @SYS$STARTUP:DTSS$STARTUP 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_299"></a>

<p>
You will need a number of privileges to ussue this command, and you 
must also be granted the NET$MANAGE identifer to shutdown and to 
restart DTSS.

<p>
If you wish to &quot;permanently&quot; disable DTSS on a system running 
DECnet-Plus, the above NCL sequence must be performed each time the 
system is bootstrapped. (On DECnet-Plus V7.3 and later, you can define 
the logical name NET$DISABLE_DTSS
<a name="index_x_300"></a>
 to disable the DTSS startup. This logical name must be defined in the 
 command procedure SYLOGICALS.COM,
<a name="index_x_301"></a>
 as this logical name must be present and defined sufficiently early in 
 the OpenVMS system bootstrap sequence for it to function.)

<p>
If DTSS is running and no time servers are configured, you can (and 
will) see the following messages at regular intervals:
<a name="index_x_302"></a>
<a name="index_x_303"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>

</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You can either configure the appropriate number of time servers, or you 
can disable DTSS, or you can ignore it and (if OPCOM is set to write to 
the log via via the logical names in 
SYLOGICALS.COM/SYLOGICALS.TEMPLATE) clean out OPERATOR.LOG regularly.
<a name="index_x_304"></a>
<a name="index_x_305"></a>

<p>
You can also simply disable the display of these messages:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ run sys$system:ncl 
block event dispatcher outbound stream local_stream global filter - 
    ((Node, DTSS), Too Few Servers Detected) 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
If you wish to disable the automatic TDF adjustment for daylight 
savings time (on OpenVMS versions prior to V7.3), you can use the 
command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ run sys$system:ncl 
set dtss automatic TDF change = false 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
or alternatively, you can set the local timezone to one that does not 
include the automatic daylight savings time change-over.

<p>
OpenVMS V7.3 and later simplify time and timezone management.

</font>

<a name="mgmt1"><h1><font color=maroon>5.1 What is an installed image?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_306"></a>

<p>
The term "install" has two distinct meanings in OpenVMS. The first 
relates to "installing a product", which is done with either the 
SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL.COM command procedure or the POLYCENTER Software 
Installation (PCSI) utility (PRODUCT command). The second meaning 
relates to the use of the INSTALL utility, which is what concerns us 
here.

<p>
The INSTALL utility is used to identify to OpenVMS a specific copy of 
an image, either executable or shareable, which is to be given some set 
of enhanced properties. For example, when you issue the SET PASSWORD 
command, the image SYS$SYSTEM:SETP0.EXE is run. That image needs to 
have elevated privileges to perform its function.

<p>
The other important attribute is /SHARED. This means that shareable 
parts of the image (typically read-only code and data) are loaded into 
memory only once and are shared among all users on a system. Executable 
images can be installed /SHARED as well as shareable library images. 
(The term "shareable" has dual meanings here, too. See the <em>OpenVMS 
Programming Concepts Manual</em> for further details.)

<p>
It's important to note that there is no such thing as "installing a 
shareable image with privileges". The INSTALL utility will let you do 
it, but the privileges you specify will be ignored. To have a callable 
routine run with enhanced privileges that are not available to its 
caller, you must construct your routines as "user-written system 
services" and install the shareable image with the /PROTECT qualifier. 
See the <em>OpenVMS Programming Concepts Manual</em> for more 
information on user-written system services. Note also that in many 
cases the need to grant privileges to an image can be replaced with the 
use of the "Protected Subsystems" feature that grants a rights 
identifier to an image. See the <em>OpenVMS Guide to System 
Security</em> for information on Protected Subsystems.

<a name="mgmt2"><h1><font color=maroon>5.2 Are there any known viruses for OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_307"></a>

<p>
Viruses and worms are common on personal computers because the 
operating systems involved, such as the Microsoft MS-DOS, Windows 95, 
Windows 98 and Windows ME variants, do not particularly protect the 
operating system or the file system against hostile action by programs. 
Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP do implement 
protections for specific configurations and do implement memory 
protection models, but many users of these systems choose to operate 
with full adminstrator access and thus the available protections are 
entirely defeated and entirely not relevent, and any program that can 
activate itself or can cause the user to activate the code can subvert 
the operating system and take over the hardware, at which point the 
malicious code can do most anything it wishes, including hiding copies 
of itself in other programs or in the file system, redistributing 
itself via mail, IM, or network connections, or can be used as a zombie 
in staging attacks on other systems.

<p>
This is less likely with multi-user systems such as OpenVMS, Unix, 
Linux, MVS and other platforms for various reasons. First, the 
operating system runs in a privileged mode in memory that is protected 
against modification by normal user programs. Any program cannot simply 
take over the hardware as it can on operating systems without security 
and particularly without memory page protections. Secondly, multi-user 
systems can be set up so that non-privileged programs cannot modify 
system programs and files on disk, and this is normal for most 
installations. Both of these protection schemes mean that traditional 
viral infections don't work on these OSes. Third, typical applications 
and configurations tend to prevent the uncontrolled execution of 
untrusted code as part of received mail messages or web access; one of 
the central vulnerabilities of the Microsoft Windows platform involves 
its intentionally easy ability to dynamically (and transparently) 
activate code and macros that are embedded within mail messages and 
within data files.

<p>
It is possible for OpenVMS and other multi-user systems to become 
infected by viruses or worms, but to do so, the program containing the 
virus must be run from a user account that has amplified privileges. So 
long as the system administrator is careful that only trusted 
applications are run from such accounts (and this is generally the 
case) and so long as there are no OpenVMS system security breaches (due 
to malicious operator activity, OpenVMS errors, or errors within 
trusted and privileged product packages) there is no of modifications 
to the operating system or other protected files from the virus or the 
worm.

<p>
The FAQ maintainer is aware of a few (and very old) DECnet worms that 
have affected OpenVMS systems on DECnet networks, but is aware of no 
OpenVMS viruses that are loose in the field.

<p>
To protect against viruses and other attempts at system interference or 
misuse, please follow the security recommendations in the <em>OpenVMS 
Guide to System Security</em>. Additionally, you will want to keep your 
OpenVMS ECOs current and you will want to apply all mandatory ECO kits 
and any security MUPs
<a name="index_x_308"></a>
 for OpenVMS and OpenVMS products, and you will want to keep to OpenVMS 
 releases with Prior Version Support (PVS) or with Current Version 
 Support. (This is obviously a general system maintenance 
 recommendation, in addition to being a good system security 
 recommendation---new security features and capabilities are implemented 
 in more recent OpenVMS releases, for instance.) You may also want to 
 consider optional software products which can monitor your system for 
 intrusion or infection attempts. Computer Associates (CA)
<a name="index_x_309"></a>
<a name="index_x_310"></a>
offers various products in this area, as to other vendors.

<p>
Rocksoft offers the Veracity data integrity tool (for info, send mail to
<a name="index_x_311"></a>
<a name="index_x_312"></a>
 demo@rocksoft.com). MD5
<a name="index_x_313"></a>
 tools are also available.

<p>
Tools to scan OpenVMS file systems for Microsoft Windows infections are 
also available, including a commercial package from Sophos.
<a name="index_x_314"></a>
These scanning tools are particularly useful for systems running Samba 
or Advanced Server (PATHWORKS), as these servers tend to have a higher 
population of files intended for Microsoft Windows systems users, and 
as common virus and worm attacks can find and infect files on the file 
shares that these products can provide.
<a name="index_x_315"></a>
<a name="index_x_316"></a>
<a name="index_x_317"></a>
These infections do not target OpenVMS itself, though the OpenVMS 
server (and any other platform and any other server capable of storing 
files for Windows systems) can silently host files containing common 
Microsoft Windows infections.

<a name="mgmt3"><h1><font color=maroon>5.3 How do I mount an ISO-9660 CD on OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_318"></a>

<p>
ISO-9660 support was added in the following releases:

<ul>
  <li>OpenVMS VAX V6.0
  <li>OpenVMS AXP V1.5
</ul>

<p>
An add-on ISO-9960 kit was also available for OpenVMS VAX V5.5, V5.5-1, 
V5.5-2, and V5.5-2H4. This requires the installation of the F11CD kit 
from the InfoServer CD, from the Consolidated Distribution CD under the 
InfoServer area, Customer Support Center kit CSCPAT #1071012, or the 
F11CD ECO kit. (Upgrades to V6 and later are strongly recommended.)

<p>
By default, OpenVMS senses the specific type of media. If you are 
working with dual-format media---media that uses both the ODS-2 and 
ISO-9660 formats on the same CD-ROM---then MOUNT will first detect and 
then default to the ODS-2 format. If you wish to override this and 
explicitly mount the media using ISO-9660, use the command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ MOUNT/MEDIA_FORMAT=CDROM  device-name[:] [volume-label] 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
In most circumstances, you will not need nor will you want to include 
an explicit /MEDIA_FORMAT specification. For further information, 
please refer to the OpenVMS MOUNT Utility Manual. Particularly note the 
information on the MOUNT /MEDIA_FORMAT and /UNDEFINED_FAT qualifiers.

<p>
The MOUNT /UNDEFINED_FAT qualifier is of interest because ISO-9660 
media can be mastered on a wide variety of operating system platforms, 
and these platforms do not necessarily support the semantics needed for 
files containing predefined record formats. The /UNDEFINED_FAT allows 
you to specify the default attributes for files accessed from volumes 
using the ISO-9660 format.

<p>
An example which works for most CD-ROMs is:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ MOUNT/MEDIA_FORMAT=CDROM/UNDEFINED_FAT=STREAM:2048 DUA0: FREEWARE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This particular MOUNT command forces access to the CD-ROM media using 
the ISO-9660 volume structure, and the use of the MOUNT /UNDEFINED_FAT 
qualifier causes any file whose file attributes are "undefined" to be 
returned with "stream" attributes with a maximum record length 2048.

<p>
On OpenVMS, the ISO-9660 format is (internally) considered to be the 
ODS-3 file structure, while the High Sierra extensions to the standard 
are considered to be the ODS-4 file structure. The Rock Ridge 
extensions are not currently available on OpenVMS.

<p>
For details on ODS-1 and ODS-2 file specifications, see Kirby McCoy's 
<em>VMS File System Internals Manual</em> (published by Digital Press, 
but potentially out of print), and see:

<ul>
  <li>http://pdp-11.trailing-edge.com/www/ods1.txt
  <li>http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/, look in Freeware V5.0 
  directory /ods2/.
</ul>

<a name="mgmt4"><h1><font color=maroon>5.4 How do I extract the contents of a PCSI kit?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_319"></a>

<p>
A growing number of OpenVMS products are being provided in PCSI 
(POLYCENTER Software Installation) kits which are installed using the 
PRODUCT INSTALL command. These are alternatives to or replacement for 
VMSINSTAL kits which were BACKUP savesets. PCSI kits are not BACKUP 
savesets and are structured differently from VMSINSTAL kits.

<p>
If you want to extract product files from a PCSI kit, create a 
directory into which the kit should be expanded and use the following 
command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ PRODUCT COPY prodname /SOURCE=[where-the-kit-is] - 
    /DEST=[destination-directory] /FORMAT=REFERENCE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
A PCSI kit file has a file specification of the following form:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
DEC-VAXVMS-FORTRAN-V0603-141-1.PCSI 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
In this example, "FORTRAN" is the "prodname". PCSI will expand the kit 
files into the directory you specify and subdirectories beneath such as 
[SYSEXE], [SYSLIB], etc., reflecting the eventual destination of files 
found there. Most of the actual product files (images, etc.) will be in 
the subdirectories. In the top-level directory will be a file with the 
file type PCSI$DESCRIPTION that specifies where various files should 
go. For more details, see the <em>POLYCENTER Software Installation 
Developer's Guide for OpenVMS</em>, which can be found in the OpenVMS 
documentation on the Consolidated Online Documentation CD-ROM.

<a name="mgmt5"><h1><font color=maroon>5.5 Emergency (Conversational) System Startup?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_320"></a>

<p>
If you need to perform system management operations on an OpenVMS 
system and cannot access the system through normal means---the password 
on the SYSTEM username was forgetten and no other privileged usernames 
are available, or one or more core system product authorization key 
(PAK) software licenses are unavailable or expired---then you must 
perform a conversational (emergency) bootstrap.

<p>
Here are the steps:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Halt the system. Exactly how this is done depends on the specific 
  system model: Depending on the model, this can involve pressing the 
  <kbd>[HALT]</kbd> button, entering <kbd>[CTRL/P]</kbd> on the console, 
  or pressing the <kbd>[BREAK]</kbd> key on the console.
  <li>At the console prompt, use a console command to boot into the 
  SYSBOOT utility. (SYSBOOT allows conversational changes to system 
  parameters.) The syntax for the conversational bootstrap varies by 
  system model---this typically involves specifying a flag of 1, for 
  example: <br>On VAX, use one of the following three commands depending 
  on the particular model of VAX system involved:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
B/R5:1 
B/1 
@GENBOO 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

    <br>On Alpha:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
b -flags 0,1 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

    <br>If your system has a non-zero system root (such as root SYSE, shown 
    here), you will have to use a console command such as the following: 
    <br>On VAX:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
B/E0000001 
B/R5:E0000001 
@&lt;console media procedure name varies widely&gt; 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

    <br>On Alpha:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
b -flags e,1 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

    <br>If your system has a hardware password (various systems support a 
    password that prevents unauthorized access to the console), you will 
    need to know theis password and will need to enter it using the LOGIN 
    command at the console. If you get an "Inv Cmd" error trying to perform 
    a conversational bootstrap, and you do not have the hardware console 
    password for the console LOGIN command, you are stuck---you will need 
    to call for hardware service in order to reset the hardware console 
    password. The syntax used for the console password mechanism varies.
  <li>Once at the SYSBOOT prompt, request that OpenVMS read the system 
  startup commands directly from the system console, that the window 
  system (if any) not be started, and that OpenVMS not record these 
  particular parameter changes for subsequent system reboots:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SET/STARTUP OPA0: 
SET WINDOW_SYSTEM 0 
SET WRITESYSPARAMS 0 
CONTINUE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_321"></a>
<a name="index_x_322"></a>
<a name="index_x_323"></a>
<a name="index_x_324"></a>
  <li>At the $ prompt, the system will now be accepting startup commands 
  directly from the console. Type the following two DCL commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SPAWN 
$ @SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

  <li>You should now see the dollar ($) prompt of DCL. <br>The result of 
  these two commands will be the normal system startup, but you will be 
  left logged in on the console, running under a fully privileged 
  username. Without the use of the SPAWN command, you would be logged out 
  when the startup completes. <br>Perform the task(s) required, such as 
  resetting the password on the SYSTEM username as described in 
  <a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5a">Section 5.5.1</a> or registering one or more license product authorization 
  keys (PAKs) as described in <a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5b">Section 5.5.2</a>.
  <li>Once you log out of this session, the system will complete the 
  startup and can be used normally. You can choose to reboot the system, 
  but that is not necessary.
</ol>

<p>
Some system managers will suggest a method using the UAFALTERNATE 
system parameter rather than the SET/STARTUP OPA0: command shown.
<a name="index_x_325"></a>
<a name="index_x_326"></a>
This approach is not always available and is accordingly less commonly 
recommended, as there can easily be an alternate user authorization 
database (SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAFALT.DAT) configured on the system. With a 
system manager that has configured an alternate SYSUAFALT.DAT file, the 
UAFALTERNATE method will fail---well, assuming you do not know the 
password of a privileged username stored within SYSUAFALT.DAT, of 
course.

<p>
The UAFALTERNATE system parameter is used to trigger what is sometimes 
known as the console backdoor.
<a name="index_x_327"></a>
<a name="index_x_328"></a>
The OPA0: system console is critical to system operations and system 
security, and will allow access when the SYSUAF system authorization 
database is unavailable or corrupted, when core product license PAKs 
are not registered, expired or disabled (NOLICENSE errors),
<a name="index_x_329"></a>
 or in various other cases of system failures.
<a name="index_x_330"></a>
<a name="index_x_331"></a>
All this is in addition to the role of the console in the display of 
certain system-critical event messages. <em>Access to the OPA0: console 
has a security exposure that is equivalent to direct access to the 
system hardware.</em>

<p>
When LOGINOUT detects an error (such as a SYSUAF corruption, by a 
missing SYSUAF, missing product licenses, or other trigger), it will 
prevent access to the OpenVMS system from all terminals except the 
system console.
<a name="index_x_332"></a>
<a name="index_x_333"></a>
The OPA0: system console will be allowed access, and the resulting 
process will be fully privileged. Resetting the UAFALTERNATE system 
parameter---in the absence of an alternate SYSUAF system authorization 
database---will cause the console backdoor to be opened simply because 
LOGINOUT cannot locate
<a name="index_x_334"></a>
<a name="index_x_335"></a>
SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAFALT.DAT. When the authorization database cannot be 
located, access will be granted from the console only.

<p>
For further information on emergency startup and shutdown, as well as 
for the official OpenVMS documentation on how to change the SYSTEM 
password from the console in an emergency, please see the <em>OpenVMS 
System Manager's Manual</em> in the OpenVMS documentation set.

<p>
For information and recommendations on setting up OpenVMS system 
security, please see the NCSC Class C2 appendix of the
<a name="index_x_336"></a>

<a name="index_x_338"></a>
Guide to OpenVMS System Security manual, also in the OpenVMS 
documentation set.

<p>
You can also use the conversational bootstrap technique shown earlier 
(the steps until SET/STARTUP) to alter various system parameters, as 
well. At the SYSBOOT
<a name="index_x_339"></a>
<a name="index_x_340"></a>
prompt, you can enter new parameters values:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
SHOW MAXPROCESSCNT 
SET . 64 
CONTINUE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The "." is a shorthand notation used for the last parameter examined 
within SYSGEN and SYSBOOT.
<a name="index_x_341"></a>
<a name="index_x_342"></a>

<a name="mgmt5a"><h2>5.5.1 I've forgotten the SYSTEM password - what can I do?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_343"></a>

<p>
If you have forgotten or do not have the password for the SYSTEM 
username, you must perform the conversational bootstrap as described in 
<a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5">Section 5.5</a>, and must enter the following commands once you have 
reached the dollar ($) prompt:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM:  ! or wherever your SYSUAF.DAT resides 
$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE 
MODIFY SYSTEM /PASSWORD=newpassword 
EXIT 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You have now reset the password on the SYSTEM username.

<a name="mgmt5b"><h2>5.5.2 My product licenses have expired - what can I do?</h2></a>

<p>
If you have a system with no licenses for OpenVMS or for OpenVMS users 
and thus cannot log into the OpenVMS system normally, you should be 
able to log into the console serial terminal---this is the terminal 
device known as OPA0:---and perform the commands necessary.

<p>
For systems that are not configured with an accessable console serial 
terminal---as can be the case with how some DECwindows workstations are 
configured---you must log in over the network or from a local serial 
connection. If you cannot log in over a network connection (SET HOST, 
telnet, etc) or from another local serial terminal connection, you will 
have to halt the system and perform a conversational bootstrap as 
described in <a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5">Section 5.5</a>. You must then enter licensing-related 
commands once the conversational bootstrap has reached the dollar ($) 
prompt.

<p>
Use the following DCL command to invoke a menu that allows you to 
manage and to register new or replacement license PAKs:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_344"></a>

<p>
You have now registered the license PAKs. Direct use of the DCL 
commands LICENSE and SHOW LICENSE and such is also obviously available.

<p>
If you wish to connect a serial console on your DECwindows workstation, 
please see <a href="vmsfaq_017.html#vax10">Section 14.3.3.3</a>, <a href="vmsfaq_017.html#alpha7">Section 14.3.6</a>, <a href="vmsfaq_014.html#decw13">Section 11.11</a>, and <a href="vmsfaq_019.html#supp3">Section 14.19</a>.
