                   installation kit is included on the consolidated
                   distribution CD-ROM kit, and installation kits are
                   also available separately.

                   The POSIX package is no longer supported on OpenVMS,
                   components of the POSIX standard such as parts of the
                   POSIX API are being added into OpenVMS. Versions of
                   POSIX generally do not operate on V7.x OpenVMS VAX and
                   OpenVMS Alpha releases.

          13.3  Where can I get the Mozilla Web Browser?

                   Mozilla.org is an open source organization providing
                   HTML-related tools; software that is the basis for
                   various utilities including the Mozilla web browser.

                   OpenVMS Engineering is continuously porting
                   Mozilla.org's web browser to OpenVMS, and OpenVMS ports
                   of the current Mozilla baselevels and releases are
                   available. The OpenVMS Mozilla port includes the web
                   browser, the mail client, the Composer HTML editor, an
                   IRC chat client, a netnews (NNTP) reader, and various
                   other tools.

                   The Mozilla web browser download and the development
                   and release schedules for this and for other Mozilla-
                   related tools are available at:

                   o  http://www.mozilla.org/

                   The available Compaq Secure Web Browser (CSWB) kit is a
                   packaged version of the Mozilla Web Browser.

                   A hardware configuration appropriate for Mozilla
                   generally involves an OpenVMS Alpha system with an
                   EV56 Alpha microprocessor, or an EV6 or more recent
                   processor, and with 256 megabytes of system memory.
                   The performance of Mozilla on EV5-based and earlier
                   Alpha microprocessor systems is generally viewed as
                   inadequate, this due to the extensive use of an Alpha
                   instruction subset that is first available with the
                   EV56 microprocessor generation.

                   Mozilla is not available for OpenVMS VAX.

                   Various versions of the Netscape Navigator web browser
                   are based on the Mozilla code-base.

                   See section Section 13.8 for information on various
                   certificates for the Netscape Navigator V3.03 web
                   browser; certificates that have presently expired.

          13.4  Where can I get Java for OpenVMS?

                   Java is available on and is included with OpenVMS
                   Alpha, starting with the OpenVMS Alpha V7.2 and later
                   releases. Java download kits are available for OpenVMS
                   Alpha V7.1 and later releases.

                   Java is not available on OpenVMS VAX. As for why: the
                   Java language definition requires a floating point
                   format (IEEE) that is not native to VAX, and this would
                   require the emulation of all floating point operations
                   within Java applications. Further, the C source code
                   used to implement for Java itself is heavily dependent
                   on passing IEEE floating point values around among the
                   many internal subroutines, and adding support for VAX
                   would entail changes to the HP C compiler for OpenVMS
                   VAX-and specifically to the VAX VCG code generator that
                   is used by HP C on OpenVMS VAX systems-in order to add
                   support for passing IEEE-format floating point doubles
                   around. Alternatively, extensive changes to the Java
                   source code to remove the assumption that the double is
                   an IEEE floating point value.

                   There are currently no plans to make a version of Java
                   available for OpenVMS VAX. (A prototype version of Java
                   was created for OpenVMS VAX, and performance was found
                   to be inadequate. At best.)

                   If Java2 or other environment lifts the requirements
                   for IEEE floating point as part of the language
                   definition, this decision may be revisited.

                   If you are having problems with Display Postscript, you
                   need to upgrade your Java kit-1.2.2-3 and later remove
                   the requirement for Display Postcript extensions, and
                   Java 1.2.2-3 is required with DECwindows V1.2-6 and
                   later.

                   For additional information on Java for Alpha systems,
                   please see the OpenVMS documentation (V7.2 and later),
                   and the following site:

          13.5  Obtaining user input in DCL CGI script?

                   If you choose to use the GET method, then the form
                   data is available in the DCL symbol QUERY_STRING, in
                   URL-encoded format.

                   If you use the POST method, then you need to read the
                   form data from stdin. For a DCL CGI script running
                   under the Netscape FastTrack web server, you can read
                   the data using the following READ command:

                   $ READ SYS$COMMAND postdata

                   to read the information in.

                   The following describes the use of DCL command
                   procedures as CGI scripts with the OSU web server:

          13.6  How can a batch job get its own batch entry number?

                   To have a batch procedure retrieve its own batch entry
                   number, use the following:

                   $ Entry = F$GETQUI("DISPLAY_ENTRY", -
                       "entry_number","display_entry","this_job")

                   Remember that the entry numbers issued by the OpenVMS
                   Job Controller are always opaque longword values. Do
                   not assume you know the format of the entry number,
                   nor the range of entry numbers you might see, nor the
                   algorithm that is used to assign enty numbers. You
                   should simply assume opaque longword.

                                                                     13-19

          13.7  How do I convert to new CMS or DTM libraries?

                   A change was made to the format of the CMS database
                   for CMS libraries starting with V3.5-03-to ensure
                   that earlier versions of CMS are unable to access the
                   database once the "conversion" to V3.5-05 and later is
                   made, you must issue the following two commands when
                   upgrading from V3.5-03 and prior. (The only differences
                   between CMS version V3.5-03 and CMS version V3.5-05
                   involve changes to ensure that no earlier version of
                   CMS can access the "converted" database, and corrupt
                   it.)

                   To perform the "conversion", issue the following
                   commands for each CMS library present:

                   $ RENAME disk:[directory]00CMS.* 01CMS.*
                   $ COPY NLA0: disk:[directory]00CMS.CMS

                   The new file 00CMS.CMS must have the same security
                   settings as the 01CMS.CMS file, and is created solely
                   to ensure continued compatibility with tools that
                   expect to find a 00CMS.CMS file (eg: various versions
                   of the Language-Sensitive text editor LSEDIT).

                   If you choose to install and use the longer variant
                   names support that is available with CMS V4.1 or later,
                   you cannot mix earlier CMS versions within a cluster.
                   If you attempt to mix older and newer versions, you
                   will typically see the following BADLIB and BADTYPSTR
                   error sequence when accessing the CMS library from the
                   older CMS versions:

                   %CMS-F-BADLIB, there is something wrong with your library
                   -CMS-F-BADTYPSTR, header block type is 145; it should be 17

                   Please see the CMS V4.1 release notes for additional
                   details on this.

                   To perform the equivalent "conversion" for DEC Test
                   Manager (DTM) V3.5 and prior versions to V3.6 and later
                   versions, issue the following DCL commands for each DTM
                   library present:

                   $ RENAME disk:[directory]00DTM.* 01DTM.*
                   $ COPY NLA0: disk:[directory]00DTM.DTM

                   Finding and using Software




                   Like CMS, this change is intended to prevent older
                   versions of DTM from accessing newer libraries, and
                   corrupting the contents. Like CMS, once the libraries
                   are renamed, they cannot and should not be renamed
                   back to the older names; like CMS, the changes are not
                   downward-compatible.

                   To convert version 1 (ancient) DTM and CMS libraries
                   forward, please see the DTM CONVERT and the CMS CONVERT
                   commands.

          13.9  Why doesn't DCL symbol substitution work?

                   The DCL symbol substitution processing occurs only
                   at the DCL prompt, not within data and not within
                   files. If you wish to perform symbol substitution in
                   this environment, you typically write a small file
                   containing the command(s) and data to be invoked-
                   potentially only the data-and you then invoke the
                   created procedure or reference the specified data.

                   In this case, use of a file containing nolinemode
                   commands or other techniques might be useful-you will
                   want to ensure that the text editor you use does not
                   attempt to use screen mode or similar, as this is not
                   generally considered adventageous within a command
                   procedure.

                   Tools such as FTP have alternatives: COPY/FTP.

                   DCL symbol substitution occurs in two passes, using
                   the ampersand and the apostrophe. In most cases, only
                   the apostrophe is necessary. In a few cases-such as the
                   DCL PIPE command-you will may need to use the ampersand
                   to get the substitution to work. The following example
                   uses ampersand substitution to transfer the contents of
                   the header into a logical name:

                   by all processes in the current job) was used as DCL
                   symbols cannot be returned back out from a DCL PIPE or
                   other spawned subprocess.

                   of the functionality available under Unix, OpenVMS-
                   specific Perl modules provide interfaces to many native
                   features, as well as access to Oracle, Ingres, and
                   Sybase databases via the Perl DBI available on OpenVMS.

                   A website useful for getting started with Perl on
                   OpenVMS-where you will find such things as download

                   You will need GUNZIP and VMSTAR (both available from
                   the OpenVMS Freeware CD, or from other sites) to
                   unpack the archive; once you've done that, read the
                   instructions in the README.vms file.

          13.12  Where can I get Zip, Unzip, self-extracting zip, etc?

                   Many packages are provided in ZIP, GZIP, or BZIP2
                   format, which requires you to acquire the associated
                   unzip tool to unpack it. You can get ZIP and UNZIP and
                   related and similar tools from the following areas:

                   o  http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/

                   o  http://www.djesys.com/unzip.html

                   or you can request the FILESERV_TOOLS package from the
                   e-mail server.

                   Beware: The [000TOOLS...] pre-built
                   versions of ZIP on the OpenVMS Freeware V4
                   (http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/ Freeware V4.0)
                   CD-ROM will erroneously return BILF errors on OpenVMS
                   V7.2 and later. Use of the source on the Freeware V4
                   to rebuild the ZIP image(s), or acquiring a pre-built
                   ZIP image from one of the above areas can avoid this.
                   The pre-built version of ZIP on the Freeware V4 kit is
                   older than the included ZIP sources, and it contains a
                   latent bug.]

                   Directions for creating and using the sfx self-
                   extracting zip file compression mechanism are available
                   in the unzip kit that is available at:

                   o  http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/, look in a
                      recent unzip* directory. With the UNZIP542 directory
                      from Freeware V5.0, look for the file UNZIPSFX.TXT.

                                                                     13-25

                   If you want to build the zip images for yourself (eg:
                   for an older OpenVMS version), pull over the entire
                   contents of a recent unzip directory.

                   HP OpenVMS Engineering uses a tool known as FTSV
                   for creating self-extracting compressed files using
                   the OpenVMS DCX compression tools, as seen with
                   various OpenVMS ECO (patch) kits. sfx provides better
                   compression than does DCX. The FTSV and its related
                   FTSO package have only limited availability outside HP,
                   and are not standard products.

          14       Hardware Information



          __________________________________________________________
          14.1  What are the OpenVMS differences among VAX, Alpha, and
                IA-64?

                   In terms of software, very few. As of OpenVMS V6.1,
                   the VAX and Alpha platforms are very close to "feature
                   parity". OpenVMS on IA-64 is expected to have "feature
                   parity" with OpenVMS Alpha, and is based on the same
                   source pool. Most applications can just be recompiled
                   and run. Some differences to be aware of:

                   o  The default double-precision floating type on
                      OpenVMS Alpha is VAX G_float, whereas on VAX it
                      is usually D_float. D_float is available on Alpha,
                      but D_float values are converted to G_float for
                      computations and then converted back to D_float when
                      stored. Because the G_float type has three fewer
                      fraction bits than D_float, some applications may
                      get different results. IEEE float types are also
                      available on OpenVMS Alpha.

                   o  The preferred floating point format on Alpha and
                      IA-64 is IEEE.

                   o  Data alignment is extremely important for best
                      performance on Alpha. This means that data items
                      should be allocated at addresses which are exact
                      multiples of their sizes. Quadword alignment will
                      offer the best performance, especially for character
                      values and those smaller than 32 bits. Compilers
                      will naturally align variables where they can and
                      will issue warnings if they detect unaligned data
                      items.

                   o  HP C is the only C compiler HP offers on OpenVMS
                      Alpha, and is a direct descendant of Compaq C and
                      DEC C on OpenVMS Alpha. HP C is compatible with DEC
                      C on OpenVMS VAX, but is somewhat different from
                      the older VAX C compiler most people are familiar

                                                                      14-1

                      with. Read up on the /EXTERN_MODEL and /STANDARD
                      qualifiers to avoid the most common problems. In
                      additon to HP C, there are open-source ports such as
                      Gnu C available for OpenVMS.

                   o  The page size on Alpha and IA-64 systems is
                      variable, but is at least 8 kilobytes. This can
                      have some effect on applications which use the
                      $CRMPSC system service as well as on the display of
                      available memory pages. The page size is available
                      from $GETSYI(SYI$_PAGE_SIZE).

                   There are also a number of manuals which discuss
                   migration to OpenVMS Alpha available on the
                   documentation CD-ROM media, both in the main
                   documentation and in the archived documentation
                   section.

                   On more recent OpenVMS Alpha versions, OpenVMS Alpha
                   has begun to add features and support not available on
                   OpenVMS VAX. Salient new areas include the following:

                   o  64-bit addressing in OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 and later

                   o  Multi-host SCSI support (SCSI TCQ) in V6.2 and later

                   o  PCI support (platform-dependent)

                   o  OpenVMS Galaxy support in V7.2 and later

                   Please see Section 14.4.5 for Intel Itanium
                   terminology.

          14.3.1  What commands are available in the Alpha SRM console?

                   In addition to the normal BOOT commands and such (see
                   Section 14.3.5.1 for some details) and the normal
                   contents of the console HELP text, operations such
                   as I/O redirection and floppy disk access are possible
                   at the SRM console prompt:

                   1  Format a FAT floppy, and insert it into the
                      AlphaStation floppy drive.

                   2  Perform the following at AlphaStation SRM Console :

                         >>> show * > env.dat
                         >>> show conf > conf.dat
                         >>> cat env.dat > fat:env.dat/dva0
                         >>> cat conf.dat > fat:conf.dat/dva0

                   3  You may use the SRM "ls" command to display the
                      contents of the floppy.

                         >>> ls fat:env.dat/dva0
                         >>> ls fat:conf.dat/dva0

                   4  You can now transfer the FAT-format floppy to
                      another system.

                                                                      14-3

          14.3.2  What does SRM mean? What is PALcode?

                   The abbreviation SRM is derived from the Alpha System
                   Reference Manual, the specification of the Alpha
                   architecture and the associated firmware.

                   PALcode is a name assigned to a particular set of
                   functions provided by the SRM firmware. PALcode
                   is used to provide low-level functions required by

          14.3.3  Alpha COM ports and VAX console serial line information?

                   This section contains information on the Alpha COM
                   communication ports, and related settings, as well as
                   on the VAX console bulkhead and VAX console serial line
                   connection.

          14.3.3.1  Which terminal device name is assigned to the COM
                    ports?

                   COM2 is normally TTA0:. COM1 is normally TTB0: if
                   the Alpha workstation is booted with the SRM console
                   environment variable set to graphics, and is OPA0: if
                   the console is set to serial.

          _____________________________
          14.3.3.2  Which serial port is the console on the MicroVAX 3100?

                   Just to keep life interesting, the MicroVAX 3100 has
                   some "interesting" console ports behaviours based
                   on the setting of the BREAK enable switch. When the
                   console is not enabled to respond to BREAK, MMJ-1
                   is the console port. MMJ-3 will (confusingly) output

                   14-4

                   the results of the selftest in parallel with MMJ-1.
                   When the console is enabled to respond to BREAK, MMJ-3
                   becomes the console port, and MMJ-1 will (confusingly)
                   output the results of selftest in parallel with MMJ-3.

          14.3.3.3  How can I set up an alternate console on a VAXstation?

                   Most VAXstation systems have a switch-often labeled
                   S3-that enables one of the serial lines as the system
                   console.

                   Various members of the DEC 3000 series Alpha systems
                   also have a similarly-labled S3 switch for selection of
                   the alternate console.

                   Also see Section 14.3.6, Section 11.11, and
                   Section 14.19.

                   The MicroVAX-series console bulkhead was used with the
                   KA630, KA650, KA655 processors.

                   There are three controls on the console bulkhead of
                   these systems:

                     Triangle-in-circle-paddle: halt enable.
                       dot-in-circle: halt (<break>) is enabled,
                                      and auto-boot is disabled.
                       dot-not-in-circle: halt (<break>) is disabled,
                                      and auto-boot is enabled.

                     Three-position-rotary: power-up bootstrap behaviour
                       arrow: normal operation.
                       face: language inquiry mode.
                       t-in-circle: infinite self-test loop.

                     Eight-position-rotary: console baud rate selection
                       select the required baud rate; read at power-up.

                                                                      14-5

 





                   Hardware Information




                   There are several different bulkheads involved,
                   including one for the BA23 and BA123 enclosures,
                   and one for the S-box (BA2xx) series enclosure.
                   The console bulkheads typically used either the MMJ
                   serial line connection, or the MicroVAX DB9 (not
                   the PC DB9 pinout), please see the descriptions of
                   these in section WIRES1. For available adapters, see
                   Section 14.28.

                   Also present on the console bulkhead is a self-test
                   indicator: a single-digit LED display. This matches the
                   final part of the countdown displayed on the console or
                   workstation, and can be used by a service organization
                   to determine the nature of a processor problem. The
                   particular countdown sequence varies by processor
                   type, consult the hardware or owner's manual for
                   the processor, or contact the local hardware service
                   organization for information the self-test sequence
                   for a particular processor module. Note that self-tests
                   2, 1 and 0 are associated with the transfer of control
                   from the console program to the (booting) operating
                   system.

          _____________________________
          14.3.4  What are Alpha console environment variables?

                   Alpha systems have a variety of variables with values
                   set up within the SRM system console. These environment
                   variables control the particular behaviour of the
                   console program and the system hardware, the particular
                   console interface presented to the operating system,
                   various default values for the operating system
                   bootstrap, and related control mechanisms-in other
                   words, "the environment variables provide an easily
                   extensible mechanism for managing complex console
                   state."

                   The specific environment variables differ by platform
                   and by firmware version-the baseline set is established
                   by the Alpha Architecture:

                   AUTO_ACTION ("BOOT", "HALT", "RESTART", any other value
                   assumed to be HALT),  BOOT_DEV, BOOTDEF_DEV, BOOTED_DEV,
                   BOOT_FILE, BOOTED_FILE, BOOT_OSFLAGS, BOOTED_OSFLAGS,
                   BOOT_RESET ("ON", "OFF"), DUMP_DEV, ENABLE_AUDIT ("ON",
                   "OFF"), LICENSE, CHAR_SET, LANGUAGE, TTY_DEV.

                   OpenVMS Galaxy firmware can add console environment
                   variables beginning with such strings as LP_* and HP_*,
                   and each particular console implementation can (and
                   often does) have various sorts of platform-specific
                   extensions beyond these variables...

                   The contents of a core set of environment variables
                   are accessible from OpenVMS using the f$getenv lexical
                   and the sys$getenv system service. (These calls are
                   first documented in V7.2, but have been around for
                   quite a while.) Access to arbitary console environment
                   variables is rather more involved, and not directly
                   available.

          14.3.5  What are the boot control flag values?

                   Both VAX and Alpha primary bootstraps support flag
                   values; a mechanism which permits the system manager
                   to perform specific customizations or site-specific
                   debugging of the OpenVMS system bootstrap. While very
                   similar, there are differences between VAX and Alpha
                   systems in this area.

                   the OpenVMS Alpha primary bootstrap image APB.EXE.
                   These flags control the particular behaviour of the

                             system boot procedure, the bootstrap code
                             solicits parameter and other input from the
                             console terminal.  If the DIAG is also on then
                             the diagnostic supervisor should enter "MENU"

                             bootstrap is a single 512-byte block, whose LBN
                             is specified in R4.

          14.3.6  How do I boot an AlphaStation without monitor or
                  keyboard?

                   The AlphaStation series will boot without a keyboard
                   attached. To use a serial terminal as the console,
                   issue the SRM console command SET CONSOLE SERIAL
                   followed by the console INIT command. Once this SRM
                   command sequence has been invoked, the Alpha system
                   will use the serial terminal.

                   The DEC 3000 series has a jumper on the motherboard
                   for this purpose. Various older Alpha workstations
                   generally will not (automatically) bootstrap without a
                   keyboard connected, due to the self-test failure that
                   arises when the (missing) keyboard test fails.

                   The usual settings for the console serial terminal (or
                   PC terminal emulator acting as a serial console are:

                   9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit (9600 baud, 8N1).

                   AlphaServer 4100 and derivative series platforms,
                   and AlphaServer GS80, GS160, and GS320 series system
                   consoles are capable of 57600 baud. See the COM2_BAUD
                   console environment variable, and ensure that you have
                   current SRM firmware version loaded.

                   The AlphaStation and AlphaServer series use the PC
                   DIN serial connector for the "COM1" and "COM2" serial
                   lines, see Section 14.27 for details and pinout.

                    systems?

                   Firmware updates for HP Alpha systems are available
                   from:

                   o  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/index.html

                   o  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/readme.html

                   The latest and greatest firmware-if updated firmware
                   has been released after the most recent firmware CD was
                   distributed-is located at:

                   o  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/interim/

                   For information on creating bootable floppies
                   containing the firmware, and for related tools, please
                   see the following areas:

                   o  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/utilities/mkboot.txt

                   The SROM firmware loader expects an ODS-2 formatted
                   floppy, see mkboot. As for which image to use, the ROM
                   image uses a header and the file extension .ROM, and
                   the SROM bootable floppy cannot use the .ROM file.

                   To check the firmware loaded on recent OpenVMS Alpha
                   systems, use the command:

                   $ write sys$output f$getsyi("console_version")
                   $ write sys$output f$getsyi("palcode_version")

          14.3.7.2  How do I reload SRM firmware on a half-flash Alpha
                    system?

                   Some of the AlphaStation series systems are "half-
                   flash" boxes, meaning only one set of firmware (SRM or
                   AlphaBIOS) can be loaded in flash at a time. Getting
                   back to the SRM firmware when AlphaBIOS (or ARC) is
                   loaded can be a little interesting...

                   That said, this usually involves shuffling some files,
                   and then getting into the AlphaBIOS firmware update
                   sequence, and then entering "update srm" at the apu->
                   prompt.

                   To shuffle the files, copy the target SRM firmware file
                   (as200_v7_0.exe is current) to a blank, initialized,
                   FAT-format floppy under the filename A:\FWUPDATE.EXE

                   From the AlphaBIOS Setup screen, select the Upgrade
                   AlphaBIOS option. Once the firmware update utility gets
                   going, enter:

                        Apu-> update srm

                              Answer "y" to the "Are you ready...?"

                        Apu-> quit

                   You've reloaded the flash. Now power-cycle the box to
                   finish the process.

          14.3.7.3  How do I switch between AlphaBIOS/ARC and SRM
                    consoles?

                   The specific steps required vary by system. You must
                   first ensure that the particular Alpha system is
                   supported by OpenVMS (see the SPD), that all core I/O
                   components (graphics, disk controllers, etc) in the
                   system are supported by OpenVMS (see the SPD), and that
                   you have an OpenVMS distribution, that you have the
                   necessary license keys (PAKs), and that you have the
                   necessary SRM firmware loaded.

                                                                     14-13

 





                   Hardware Information




                   A typical sequence used for switching over from the
                   AlphaBIOS graphics console to the SRM console follows:

                   1  Press <F2> to get to the AlphaBIOS setup menu.

                   2  Pick the "CMOS Setup..." item.

                   3  Press <F6> to get to the "Advanced CMOS Setup" menu.

                   4  Change the "Console Selection" to "OpenVMS Console
                      (SRM)".

                   5  Press <F10>, <F10>, then <Enter> to save your
                      changes.

                   6  Power-cycle the system.

                   Most Alpha systems support loading both the
                   AlphaBIOS/ARC console and the SRM console at the same
                   time, but systems such as the AlphaStation 255 are
                   "half-flash" systems and do not support the presence
                   of both the AlphaBIOS/ARC and SRM console firmware at
                   the same time. If you have a "half-flash" system, you
                   must load the SRM firmware from floppy, from a network
                   download, or from a firmware CD-ROM. Following the
                   normal AlphaBIOS or ARC firmware update sequence to
                   the APU prompt, and then explictly select the target
                   console. In other words, power up the system to the
                   AlphaBIOS or ARC console, use the supplementary options
                   to select the installation of new firmware (typically
                   from CD-ROM), and then rather than using a sequence
                   which updates the current firmware:

                       Apu-> update
                         -or-
                       Apu-> update ARC
                       Apu-> verify
                       Apu-> quit
                       Power-cycle the system

                   Use the following sequence to specifically update (and
                   load) SRM from AlphaBIOS/ARC on a "half-flash" system:

                       Apu-> update SRM
                       Apu-> verify
                       Apu-> quit
                       Power-cycle the system

                   14-14

 





                   Hardware Information




                   Use the following sequence to specifically update (and
                   load) the AlphaBIOS/ARC console from SRM on a "half-
                   flash" system:

                       >>> b -fl 0,A0 ddcu
                       BOOTFILE: firmware_boot_file.exe

                       Apu-> update ARC
                       Apu-> verify
                       Apu-> quit
                       Power-cycle the system

                   Once you have the SRM loaded, you can directly install
                   OpenVMS or Tru64 UNIX on the system. Do not allow
                   Windows NT to write a "harmless" signature to any disk
                   used by OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, or Linux, as this will
                   clobber a key part of the disk. (On OpenVMS, you can
                   generally recover from this "harmless" action by using
                   the WRITEBOOT tool.)

                   If you have a "full-flash" system and want to select
                   the SRM console from the AlphaBIOS or ARC console
                   environment, select the "Switch to OpenVMS or Tru64
                   UNIX console" item from the "set up the system"
                   submenu. Then power-cycle the system. If you have a
                   "full-flash" system with the SRM console and want to
                   select AlphaBIOS/ARC, use the command:

                      >>> set os_type NT

                   and power-cycle the system.

                   OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD).

                   o  http://www.compaq.com/info/spd/
                      OpenVMS typically uses SPD 25.01.xx and/or SPD
                      41.87.xx.

                   Sometimes a particular and officially unsupported Alpha
                   box or Alpha motherboard will sufficiently resemble a
                   supported box that the platform can effectively mimic
                   and can bootstrap OpenVMS. Alternatively, somebody
                   (usually one or more engineers within the OpenVMS
                   Engineering group) will have put together a bootstrap
                   kit - such as the kit for the Alpha Multia-which
                   permits OpenVMS to bootstrap on the platform.

                   Contrary to the assumptions of some folks, there
                   are platform-level differences within the VAX and
                   within Alpha platforms-hardware-level differences that
                   can require moderate to extensive new coding within
                   OpenVMS. Within a platform series, and particularly
                   within Alpha platforms that support Dynamic System
                   Recognition (DSR), OpenVMS can usually bootstrap.

                   DSR is a mechanism by which OpenVMS Alpha can gather
                   platform-specific information, and DSR is the reason
                   why newer Alpha systems can be more easily and more
                   commonly supported on older OpenVMS Alpha releases.
                   DSR is implemented with OpenVMS Alpha code, with SRM
                   console code, and with platform non-volatile memory.

                   OpenVMS users with experience on older OpenVMS VAX
                   releases and VAX hardware will recall that then-new
                   VAX systems either required an OpenVMS VAX upgrade,
                   or that earlier releases would mis-identified then-
                   newer VAX systems-such as the case of the VAX 7000
                   model 800 being (mis)identified as a VAX 7000 model

                                                                     14-17

                   600 when bootstrapped on OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2. (This
                   (mis)identification was the outcome of a deliberate
                   engineering effort to permit the VAX 7000 model 800 to
                   bootstrap on V5.5-2; the system manager could configure
                   the VAX 7000 model 800 to (mis)identify itself as a
                   model 600, to permit the system to bootstrap on V5.5-
                   2.) OpenVMS VAX and VAX platforms lack DSR support.

                   OpenVMS I64 (please see Section 14.4.5 for Intel
                   Itanium terminology) supports a platform-level feature
                   similar to the OpenVMS Alpha DSR mechanism, based
                   on the ACPI interface and the byte-code interpreter
                   implemented within OpenVMS, within the EFI console,
                   and particularly within non-volatile memory located
                   on (byte-code interpreter compliant) PCI I/O hardware.
                   ACPI tables provide the information that was formerly
                   retrieved from DSR and from the SRM, and the byte-code
                   interpreter can (theoretically) permit at least limited
                   operations with (compliant) PCI hardware, whether or
                   not OpenVMS has a driver for the particular hardware.

                   The byte code interpreter may or may not permit
                   operations with any particular PCI hardware, and
                   may or may not have sufficient performance for local
                   requirements, and PCI hardware may or may not include
                   the necessary ROM-based drivers in the PCI hardware
                   non-volatile storage. (The intent of this Intel
                   platform-level effort is to move the host software
                   drivers out onto the specific PCI hardware, and to
                   permit the same byte code to operate regardless of
                   the particular host platform.) At least the initial
                   releases of OpenVMS I64 will not have support for the
                   byte code interpreter nor for arbitrary PCI or system
                   hardware, but will have support for ACPI-based system
                   identification and system configuration.

          _____________________________
          14.4.1  on the Alpha Multia?

                   Yes, there are a set of unsupported images that permit
                   specific OpenVMS Alpha versions to bootstrap on the
                   Multia UDB system. These images and the associated
                   instructions are available at the OpenVMS Freeware
                   website:

                   o  http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/

          Look in the Freeware V5.0 /multia/ directory.

                   Instructions are included IN the kits. READ THE
                   INSTRUCTIONS. PLEASE!

                   Some of the restrictions involved when running OpenVMS
                   on the Multia system include (but may well not be
                   limited to) the following:

                   o  The PCMCIA support was completely removed, because
                      the Intel chip on the Multia was not compatable with
                      the Cirrus chip on the Alphabook.

                      This means, of course, that you will not see and
                      cannot use any PCMCIA cards on a Multia.

                      The Multia uses shared interrupts, and as a result,
                      a special ZLXp-E series graphics device driver-one
                      that does not use interrupts-is needed. This driver
                      is provided in the kit.

                   o  The serial lines don't work.

                   o  If you have a Multia with a PCI slot, you can't use
                      any PCI card that requires interrupts.

                   o  The SRM console on this system is very old and
                      very fragile. (This SRM console was designed
                      only and strictly for diagnostic use, and was not
                      particularly tested or used with OpenVMS.)

                   o  If things don't work for you, don't expect to see
                      any OpenVMS updates, nor SRM console updates, nor
                      any support.

                   o  Do not expect to see any new versions of OpenVMS
                      on the Multia nor on any other unsupported systems.
                      If such new versions do appear and do work, please
                      consider it as a pleasant surprise.

                                                                     14-19

                   with OpenVMS V7.2. (These images became available after

          14.4.2  on AlphaPC 164LX? AlphaPC 164SX?

                   OpenVMS Alpha is not supported on the AlphaPC 164LX and
                   164SX series, though there are folks that have gotten
                   certain of the LX series to load SRM and bootstrap
                   OpenVMS. (The Aspen Durango II variant, specifically.)

                   One problem has been generally reported: ATA (IDE)
                   bootstraps will fail; SCSI storage and a SCSI CD-ROM
                   device is required.

          _____________________________
          14.4.2.1  on the NoName AXPpci33 system?

                   Information on bootstrapping OpenVMS (using the Multia
                   files described in Section 14.4.1) on the (unsupported)
                   NoName AXPpci33 module is available at:

                   o  http://www.jyu.fi/~kujala/vms-in-axppci33.txt

          Tips for using the Multia files with the AXPpci33:

                   o  You have to use the Multia kit and follow the
                      directions in ALPHA8, but do *not* load the Multia
                      SRM firmware into the AXPpci33. Rather, download and
                      use the latest firmware for the AXPpci33 from the HP
                      Alpha firmware website instead.

                   o  64 MB memory is generally necessary.

                   14-20

 





                   Hardware Information




                   o  you cannot use any PCI cards, and if you plan on
                      networking, you need to find an ISA Ethernet card
                      supported by OpenVMS.

                   o  When the AXPpci33 board bootstraps, it will dump
                      some stuff like a crash dump, but it will continue
                      and-so far-this hasn't caused any particular
                      hassles.

                   o  The system shutdown and reboot procedures do not
                      work properly.

                   o  The serial console is reported to not work, though
                      the serial ports apparently do work. The status of
                      the parallel port is unknown.

                   o  Rumour has it that you have one of the AXPpci33
                      motherboards with the PS/2 mouse and keyboard
                      connectors and a VGA card (one that will work
                      under DECwindows) and you can run DECwindows on
                      the system.

          _____________________________
          14.4.3  on the Alpha XL series?

                   No.

                   OpenVMS Engineering does not formally support the Alpha
                   XL series, nor will OpenVMS (informally) bootstrap on
                   the Alpha XL series.

                   OpenVMS can not, will not, and does not bootstrap on
                   the Alpha XL series. The Alpha XL series was targeted
                   for use (only) with the Microsoft Windows NT operating
                   system.

                   The Alpha XL platform does not resemble other supported
                   platforms.

          _____________________________
          14.4.4  OpenVMS on the Personal Workstation -a and -au series?

                   Though OpenVMS is not supported on the Personal
                   Workstation -a series platforms, OpenVMS might or might
                   not bootstrap on the platform.

                                                                     14-21

 





                   Hardware Information




                   If you wish to attempt this, you must ensure that all
                   graphics and all I/O controllers in the system are
                   supported by OpenVMS. You must also ensure that you
                   have the most current firmware loaded.

          _____________________________
          14.4.4.1  OpenVMS on the Whitebox Windows-Only series Alpha?

                   Though OpenVMS is not supported on the "Whitebox"
                   series of Alpha platforms, OpenVMS might or might
                   not bootstrap on the platform. These systems were
                   specifically configured, targeted and supported only
                   for use with the Microsoft Windows NT operating system.

                   On some of the "Whitebox" systems, the following
                   sequence of console commands can potentially be used
                   to convert the system over to unsupported use by and
                   for OpenVMS Hobbyist users. (But please note that if
                   you wish to attempt this, you must ensure that all
                   graphics and all I/O controllers in the system are
                   supported by OpenVMS, and you must ensure that you have
                   the most current SRM firmware loaded. (For information
                   on locating and downloading the most current Alpha SRM
                   firmware, please see Section 14.3.7.1.) And you must
                   realize that the resulting Whitebox configuration will
                   be entirely unsupported and may or may not be stable
                   and useful.)

                   set os_type vms
                   cat nvram  ! too see what is in this, if anything
                   edit nvram
                   10 set srm_boot on
                   20 e
                   init

                   If your nvram has other contents, you will need to
                   change the line numbers (10 and 20) to reflect the
                   contents of your configuration. To obtain documentation
                   on the commands of the console editor, enter the ?
                   command within the editor.

                   The above sequence was reportedly tested on the DIGITAL
                   Server 3300 series, a relative of the AlphaServer
                   800 series. The DIGITAL Server 3300 is not supported
                   by OpenVMS, though the AlphaServer 800 series is a
