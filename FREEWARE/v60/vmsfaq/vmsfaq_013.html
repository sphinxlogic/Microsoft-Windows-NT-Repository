<p>
The localtime() function and various other functions maintain the 
number of years since 1900 in the "struct tm" structure member tm_year. 
This field will contain a value of 100 in the year 2000, 101 for 2001, 
etc., and the yearly incrementation of this field is expected to 
continue.

<p>
The C epoch typically uses a longword (known as time_t) to contain the 
number of seconds since midnight on 1-Jan-1970. At the current rate of 
consumption of seconds, this longword is expected to overflow (when 
interpreted as a signed longword) circa 03:14:07 on 19-Jan-2038 (GMT), 
as this time is circa 0x7FFFFFFF seconds since the C base date. (The 
most common solution is to ensure that time_t is an unsigned.)

<p>
If C does not correctly handle the display of the local system time, 
then check the UTC configuration on OpenVMS---the most common symptom 
of this is a skew of one hour (or whatever the local daylight savings 
time change might be). This skew can be caused by incorrect handling of 
the "is_dst" setting in the application program, or by an incorrect 
OpenVMS UTC configuration on the local system. (See section 
<a href="vmsfaq_004.html#time4">Section 4.4</a>.)

<p>
Floating point is prohibited in OpenVMS Alpha inner-mode (privileged) 
code, and in any process or other execution context that does not have 
floating point enabled. C programmers developing and working with 
OpenVMS Alpha high-IPL kernel-mode code such as device drivers will 
want to become familiar with the floating point processing available in 
the environment, and with the C compiler qualifier 
/INSTRUCTION_SET=[NO]FLOATING_POINT. Device drivers and other similar 
kernel-mode C code must be compiled with 
/INSTRUCTION_SET=FLOATING_POINT and /EXTERN_MODEL=STRICT_REFDEF.

<a name="index_x_844"></a>
<a name="index_x_845"></a>

<p>
Additionally, the SYS$LIBRARY:SYS$LIB_C.TLB/LIBRARY parameter will be 
needed to be appended to the module specification or declared via the C 
compiler's include library logical name mechanism when the C compiler 
is resolving kernel-mode data structures and definitions. This library 
contains OpenVMS kernel-mode and other system declaractions, and 
particularly a mixture of undocumented definitions and declarations, 
and particularly definitions and declarations that are subject to 
change (and that can accordingly lead to requirements for the 
recompilation of application code).

<a name="commonc2"><h2>10.22.2 Other common C++ issues</h2></a>

<p>
HP C++ (a separate compiler from HP C) provides both symbol mangling 
and symbol decoration. Some of the details of working with longer 
symbol names and the resulting symbol name mangling in mixed language 
environments are listed in the shareable image cookbook, and in the C++ 
documentation. Symbol name decoration permits the overloading of 
functions (by adding characters to the external symbol for the function 
to indicate the function return type and the argument data types 
involved), and mixed-language external references can and often do need 
to disable this decoration via the extern "C" declaration mechanism:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
      extern "C" 
        { 
        extern int ExternSymbol(void *); 
        extern int OtherExternSymbol(void *); 
        } 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Also see <a href="vmsfaq_018.html#alpha16">Section 14.7</a> for information on /ARCHITECTURE and 
/OPTIMIZE=TUNE.

<p>
See <a href="vmsfaq_012.html#prog17">Section 10.15</a> for information on the C system and the lib$spawn 
call in CAPTIVE environments.

<p>
Constructs such as the order of incrementation or decrementation and 
the order of argument processing within an argument list are all 
implementation-defined. This means that C coding constructs such as:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
    i = i++; 
    a[i] = i++; 
    foo( i, i++, --i); 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
are undefined and can have (adverse) implications when porting the C 
code to another C compiler or to another platform. In general, any 
combination of ++, --, =, +=, -=, *=, etc operators that will cause the 
same value to be modified multiple times (between what the ANSI/ISO C 
standard calls "sequence points") produce undefined and 
implementation-specific results.

<p>
Within C, the following are the "sequence points": the ";" at the end 
of a C statment, the ||, &amp;&amp;, ?:, and comma operators, and a 
call to a function. Note specifically that = is NOT a sequence point, 
and that the individual arguments contained within a function argument 
list can be processed from right to left, from left to right, or at any 
random whim.

<p>
HP C for OpenVMS VAX (formerly DEC C) and VAX C do differ in the 
related processing.

<p>
So you are looking for OpenVMS-specific definitions (include files)?

<p>
UCBDEF.H, PCBDEF.H and other OpenVMS-specific definitions---these are 
considered part of OpenVMS and not part of the C compiler kit---are 
available on all recent OpenVMS Alpha releases.

<p>
To reference the version-dependent symbol library 
sys$share:sys$lib_c.tlb, use a command similar to the following for 
compilation:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ CC sourcea+SYS$LIBRARY:SYS$LIB_C/LIB 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You can also define DECC$TEXT_LIBRARY to reference the library.

<p>
You will want to review the Programming Concepts manual, and 
specifically take a quick look at Chapter 21.

<p>
And some general background: the STARLET definitions (and thus the 
sys$starlet_c.tlb library) contain the symbols and the definitions that 
are independent of the OpenVMS version. The LIB definitions (and thus 
sys$lib_c) contain symbols and definitions that can be dependent on the 
OpenVMS version. You won't need to rebuild your code after an OpenVMS 
upgrade if you have included definitions from STARLET. The same cannot 
be said for some of the definitions in LIB---you might need to rebuild 
your code. (The UCB structure can and has changed from release to 
release, for instance.)

<p>
Recent versions of C automatically search sys$starlet_c.tlb. Explicit 
specification of sys$lib_c.tlb is required.

See <a href="vmsfaq_010.html#file5">Section 9.5</a> for information on the C off_t limitations, resolved 
in OpenVMS V7.3-1 and later and in ECO kits available for specific 
OpenVMS releases. The use of a longword for off_t restricts 
applications using native C I/O to file sizes of two gigabytes or less, 
or these applications must use native RMS or XQP calls for specific 
operations.

<a name="decw1"><h1><font color=maroon>11.1 How do I let someone else display something on my workstation?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_857"></a>

<p>
On a workstation, you will want to use the &quot;Customize&quot; menu 
of the session manager utility and select &quot;Security&quot;. When 
the pop-up box appears, you can select the host node, username, and 
tranport that will allow you to launch an application that targets the 
workstation display.

<p>
If this does not provide you with access to the display, You need a 
checklist of sorts:

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you've specified the X-windows &quot;display&quot; 
  correctly on the remote host. For a DECnet transport, the specification 
  uses two colons, while the TCP/IP transport typically uses one. The X 
  Windows server and the X Windows screen follow the host specification, 
  delimited by a period. For example:

  <li>If you have verified the command is correct and things are still 
  not working, ensure the Security settings on the OpenVMS host side will 
  allow the incoming connection: Pull down the &quot;Options&quot; menu 
  in the Session Manager, and select &quot;Security...&quot;. If you do 
  not find your host and username and transport listed among the 
  authorized users, you will need to add an entry.

  <ul>
    <li>There are various transports available, including LOCAL, DECNET, 
    LAT, and TCPIP. You must Select the transport appropriate to the 
    incoming connection.
    <li>If the transport is &quot;DECnet&quot;, do <em>NOT</em> add the 
    double colon (::) to the node name.
    <li>If the transport is &quot;TCPIP&quot;, "Username" <em>must</em> be 
    an asterisk (*). Why? Because unlike DECnet, the TCP/IP protocol does 
    not provide the remote username information in the incoming connection.
    <li>If the connection is &quot;TCPIP&quot;, it is best to use a full 
    domain name (e.g. Node.Subd.Domain). However, you may have to use the 
    IP address itself, if your host does not have a way to resolve the 
    address via DNS. If you have the luxury of fixed addresses (eg: you are 
    <em>not</em> using DHCP), then it can be helpful to add two entries for 
    each TCP/IP host, one that specifies the host name and one that 
    specifies the host address.
    <li>There are various TCP/IP packages for OpenVMS, and you must use 
    syntax appropriate to the transport installed.
    <li>If a TCP/IP connection is still not working, ensure that the 
    transport you want has been activated for use with DECwindows. See 
    <a href="vmsfaq_014.html#decw17">Section 11.15</a> for details of configuring TCP/IP as a transport.
  </ul>
  <li>There is a log file created in SYS$MANAGER: which can tell you 
  which transports are loaded, and also tell you what connect attempts 
  were rejected, including showing what the presented credentials were. 
  This file is SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_ERROR.LOG, although the 0 could 
  be another number if you have multiple servers on the workstation. I 
  have found this file to be very useful for tracking down what needs to 
  be put in the Session Manager Security entries.

<a name="decw2"><h1><font color=maroon>11.2 How do I create a display on another workstation?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_860"></a>

<p>
To create a display from an OpenVMS host to a remote X Windows display, 
use one of the following DCL commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=net_transport /NODE=remote_node 
$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=LAT /NODE=remote_node 
$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=DECnet /NODE=remote_node 
$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=TCPIP /NODE=remote_node 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_861"></a>
<a name="index_x_862"></a>

<p>
Note that LAT is typically used only for the VXT series X Windows 
terminals, but it can also be used from OpenVMS to OpenVMS systems on 
various OpenVMS releases, such as on OpenVMS Alpha V6.1 and later. For 
details on configuring the TCP/IP transport, see <a href="vmsfaq_014.html#decw17">Section 11.15</a>.

This involves the Motif virtual key bindings. When a Motif application 
starts, it looks at the vendor string returned in the display 
connection information and attempts to match the string to a table of 
virtual bindings.

<p>
First check to see if there is a graphics device, usually a G* device. 
(eg: On a DEC 2000 model 300, use the command SHOW DEVICE GQ) If you do 
not find a graphics device:

<ul>
  <li>OpenVMS has failed to find the appropriate IRQ information for an 
  EISA graphics card (on the DEC 2000 series) such as the HP (Compaq) 
  QVision, and did not autoconfigure it. Run the correct ECU (for Tru64 
  UNIX and OpenVMS) and reboot. This is necessary only on EISA-based 
  systems.
  <li>You have an EISA-based system (such as the DEC 2000 model 300) and 
  do not have a HP (Compaq) QVision video card. This EISA graphics card 
  should have Compaq printed on it, and identifies itself as a CPQ3011 or 
  a CPQ3111. If it is not one of these two EISA devices, then OpenVMS 
  does not support it. (There are no other supported EISA graphics 
  controllers, and EISA graphics are normally used with DECwindows only 
  on the DEC 2000 series systems.)
  <li>You have a PCI-based system, and do not have a supported graphics 
  controller---examples of supported controllers include the following:

  <ul>
    <li>PowerStorm 3D30
    <li>PowerStorm 4D20
    <li>PowerStorm 300
    <li>PowerStorm 350
    <li>ELSA GLoria Synergy
    <li>3DLabs Oxygen VX1
  </ul>
    <br>See <a href="vmsfaq_007.html#mgmt24">Section 5.15</a> for further information on some of these graphics 
    controllers.
  <li>You have booted the system minimally, or have otherwise disabled 
  the device autoconfiguration process.
</ul>

<p>
If there is a G* graphics device present:

<ul>
  <li>There may have been a severe error in the DECwindows startup. Type 
  the contents of SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_ERROR.LOG for any information 
  on errors starting the server.
  <li>The system parameter WINDOW_SYSTEM is not set to 1. While this was 
  a common way for system managers to disable the DECwindows server 
  startup, it is not particularly reliable as DECwindows can now 
  &quot;correct&quot; this setting.

<a name="index_x_871"></a>
    <br>If you really do not want an OpenVMS system with workstation 
    hardware to bootstrap and configure itself as a workstation, add the 
    following definition to SYLOGICALS.COM:

  <li>You may not have a valid DECwindows Motif license loaded. To check 
  for the two most common types of Motif product authorization keys 
  (PAKs), use the following DCL commands:

<p>

  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>

<a name="index_x_875"></a>
<a name="index_x_876"></a>
<a name="index_x_877"></a>
<a name="index_x_878"></a>
    <br>and examine the information displayed. Make sure that one of these 
    licenses is present, valid and active. <br>For information on 
    registering software license product authorization keys (PAKs) when you 
    cannot log into the system directly, please see <a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5b">Section 5.5.2</a>.
  <li>Check that the DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM is correct for the 
  graphics controller in use. For instance: <br>The following is from the 
  9FX Vision 330 Owners Guide, EK-V330G-OG pg 2-9. Place the following in 
  DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM, creatibng .COM from .TEMPLATE if 
  necessary. Locate the DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM file in 
  SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSMGR] or in SYS$COMMON:[SYSMGR] as appropriate; the 
  former file is used for this system within a cluster configuration, and 
  the latter is used for all systems that do not also have a local copy 
  of this file in SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSMGR].

</font>
</table>

<p>
If you want to change the title of an existing window, use the 
following control sequences, where <kbd>[esc]</kbd> is the ANSI escape 
code, value decimal 27, and &quot;text label&quot; is what you want to 
display:

<p>
To set the DECterm title, send:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
<kbd>[esc]</kbd>]21;text label<kbd>[esc]</kbd>\

      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
<kbd>[esc]</kbd>]2L;text label<kbd>[esc]</kbd>\
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
To set both the DECterm title and icon to the full device name:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$  esc[0,7] = 27 
$  fulldevnam = F$Edit(F$GetDVI("TT","FULLDEVNAM"),"UPCASE,COLLAPSE")

$  write sys$output esc+ "]2L;" + fulldevnam + esc + "\" 
</pre>

<a name="decw10"><h1><font color=maroon>11.8 How do I customize DECwindows, including the login screen?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_880"></a>

<p>
To customize various DECwindows Motif characteristics including the 
defaults used by the SET DISPLAY command, the DECwindows login screen 
background logo used (the default is the DIGITAL, Compaq, or HP logo), 
various keymaps, the FileView defaults, session manager defaults, the 
DECwindows login processing, DECwindows log file processing, and 
various other DECwindows attributes, see the example file:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SYS$STARTUP:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.TEMPLATE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This example template file is typically copied over to the filename 
SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM and then modified 
to meet site-specific requirements.

<p>
Additionally, various X tools such as xsetroot, bitmap and xrdb---some 
these can be useful in customizing the appearance of an application or 
of the DECwindows Motif display---are provided in the DECW$UTILS: area.

<p>
When using DECwindows V1.2-4 and later on OpenVMS Alpha, the default 
desktop is the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). You can select your 
preferred desktop (CDE or DECwindows Motif) when logging in, or you can 
change the default to the DECwindows Motif desktop using the DCL symbol 
decw$start_new_desktop in the DECwindows private application setup 
command procedure. See SYS$STARTUP:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.TEMPLATE for 
further details, and how to create DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM.

<p>
Note that with DECwindows CDE, the root window is no longer visible by 
default. The root window is hidden behind the "backdrop" window of the 
current CDE workspace. To make the root window visible, use the CDE 
style manager selection "backdrop none", and use information such as 
that in the OpenVMS FAQ to set the root window.

<p>
To add a new backdrop to the DECwindows CDE environment, the backdrop 
must first be in or be converted into X11 pixmap format. (This 
conversion is often possible using tools such as xv.)
<a name="index_x_881"></a>
<a name="index_x_882"></a>
<a name="index_x_883"></a>
<a name="index_x_884"></a>
Then (if necessary) create the default backdrop directory 
SYS$COMMON:[CDE$DEFAULTS.USER.BACKDROPS]. Place the X11 pixmap file 
containing the desired image into the backdrops directory, ensure that 
it has a filename extension of .PM. (The xv default filename extension 
for the X11 pixmap file is .XPM, while CDE expects only to see files 
with .PM.) Now invoke the CDE style manager and select a new backdrop. 
You will find your image will be placed at the end of the list of 
backdrops available.
