<a name="alpha2"><h1><font color=maroon>14.1 What are the OpenVMS differences among VAX, Alpha, and IA-64?</font></h1></a>

<p>
In terms of software, very few. As of OpenVMS V6.1, the VAX and Alpha 
platforms are very close to &quot;feature parity&quot;. OpenVMS on 
IA-64 is expected to have &quot;feature parity&quot; with OpenVMS 
Alpha, and is based on the same source pool. Most applications can just 
be recompiled and run. Some differences to be aware of:

<ul>
  <li>The default double-precision floating type on OpenVMS Alpha is VAX 
  G_float, whereas on VAX it is usually D_float. D_float is available on 
  Alpha, but D_float values are converted to G_float for computations and 
  then converted back to D_float when stored. Because the G_float type 
  has three fewer fraction bits than D_float, some applications may get 
  different results. IEEE float types are also available on OpenVMS Alpha.
  <li>The preferred floating point format on Alpha and IA-64 is IEEE.
  <li>Data alignment is extremely important for best performance on 
  Alpha. This means that data items should be allocated at addresses 
  which are exact multiples of their sizes. Quadword alignment will offer 
  the best performance, especially for character values and those smaller 
  than 32 bits. Compilers will naturally align variables where they can 
  and will issue warnings if they detect unaligned data items.
  <li>HP C is the only C compiler HP offers on OpenVMS Alpha, and is a 
  direct descendant of Compaq C and DEC C on OpenVMS Alpha. HP C is 
  compatible with DEC C on OpenVMS VAX, but is somewhat different from 
  the older VAX C compiler most people are familiar with. Read up on the 
  /EXTERN_MODEL and /STANDARD qualifiers to avoid the most common 
  problems. In additon to HP C, there are open-source ports such as Gnu C 
  available for OpenVMS.
  <li>The page size on Alpha and IA-64 systems is variable, but is at 
  least 8 kilobytes. This can have some effect on applications which use 
  the $CRMPSC system service as well as on the display of available 
  memory pages. The page size is available from $GETSYI(SYI$_PAGE_SIZE).
</ul>

<p>
There are also a number of manuals which discuss migration to OpenVMS 
Alpha available on the documentation CD-ROM media, both in the main 
documentation and in the archived documentation section.

<p>
On more recent OpenVMS Alpha versions, OpenVMS Alpha has begun to add 
features and support not available on OpenVMS VAX. Salient new areas 
include the following:

<ul>
  <li>64-bit addressing in OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 and later
  <li>Multi-host SCSI support (SCSI TCQ) in V6.2 and later
<a name="index_x_1132"></a>
<a name="index_x_1133"></a>
<a name="index_x_1134"></a>
<a name="index_x_1135"></a>
  <li>PCI support (platform-dependent)
  <li>OpenVMS Galaxy support in V7.2 and later
</ul>

<a name="console"><h1><font color=maroon>14.3 Console Commands, Serial Lines, and Controls?</font></h1></a>

<p>
This section contains information on VAX and Alpha consoles, and 
details related to console commands, serial lines, and configuration 
settings.

<a name="alpha20"><h2>14.3.1 What commands are available in the Alpha SRM console?</h2></a>

<p>
In addition to the normal BOOT commands and such (see <a href="vmsfaq_017.html#alpha11">Section 14.3.5.1</a> for 
some details) and the normal contents of the console HELP text, 
operations such as I/O redirection and floppy disk access are possible 
at the SRM console prompt:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Format a FAT floppy, and insert it into the AlphaStation floppy 
  drive.
  <li>Perform the following at AlphaStation SRM Console :

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
   &gt;&gt;&gt; show * &gt; env.dat 
   &gt;&gt;&gt; show conf &gt; conf.dat 
   &gt;&gt;&gt; cat env.dat &gt; fat:env.dat/dva0 
   &gt;&gt;&gt; cat conf.dat &gt; fat:conf.dat/dva0 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

  <li>You may use the SRM &quot;ls&quot; command to display the contents 
  of the floppy.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
   &gt;&gt;&gt; ls fat:env.dat/dva0 
   &gt;&gt;&gt; ls fat:conf.dat/dva0 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

  <li>You can now transfer the FAT-format floppy to another system.
</ol>

<a name="srmpalcode"><h2>14.3.2 What does SRM mean?  What is PALcode?</h2></a>

<p>
The abbreviation SRM is derived from the Alpha System Reference Manual, 
the specification of the Alpha architecture and the associated firmware.
<a name="index_x_1136"></a>
<a name="index_x_1137"></a>

<p>
PALcode is a name assigned to a particular set of functions provided by 
the SRM firmware. PALcode is used to provide low-level functions 
required by higher-level operating system or application software, 
functions which may not be directly available in Alpha hardware. 
PALcode is implemented using available Alpha instructions and using the 
Alpha processor, though PALcode operates in a mode which simplifies 
programming. PALcode is also permitted access to processor-specific and 
otherwise internal features of a particular Alpha microprocessor 
implementation; microprocessor-specific features which are not easily 
accessable to operating system or application code.
<a name="index_x_1138"></a>

<a name="comports"><h2>14.3.3 Alpha COM ports and VAX console serial line information?</h2></a>

<p>
This section contains information on the Alpha COM communication ports, 
and related settings, as well as on the VAX console bulkhead and VAX 
console serial line connection.

<a name="alpha24"><h3>14.3.3.1 Which terminal device name is assigned to the COM ports?</h3></a>

<p>
COM2 is normally TTA0:. COM1 is normally TTB0: if the Alpha workstation 
is booted with the SRM console environment variable set to graphics, 
and is OPA0: if the console is set to serial.

<a name="vax9"><h3>14.3.3.2 Which serial port is the console on the MicroVAX 3100?</h3></a>

<p>
Just to keep life interesting, the MicroVAX 3100 has some "interesting" 
console ports behaviours based on the setting of the BREAK enable 
switch. When the console is not enabled to respond to BREAK, MMJ-1 is 
the console port. MMJ-3 will (confusingly) output the results of the 
selftest in parallel with MMJ-1. When the console is enabled to respond 
to BREAK, MMJ-3 becomes the console port, and MMJ-1 will (confusingly) 
output the results of selftest in parallel with MMJ-3.

<a name="vax10"><h3>14.3.3.3 How can I set up an alternate console on a VAXstation?</h3></a>

<p>
Most VAXstation systems have a switch---often labeled S3---that enables 
one of the serial lines as the system console.

<p>
Various members of the DEC 3000 series Alpha systems also have a 
similarly-labled S3 switch for selection of the alternate console.

<p>

keys (PAKs), please see <a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5b">Section 5.5.2</a>.

<a name="vax1"><h3>14.3.3.4 Please explain the back panel of the MicroVAX II</h3></a>

<p>
The MicroVAX-series console bulkhead was used with the KA630, KA650, 
KA655 processors.

<p>
There are three controls on the console bulkhead of these systems:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
  Triangle-in-circle-paddle: halt enable. 
    dot-in-circle: halt (<kbd>[break]</kbd>) is enabled, 
                   and auto-boot is disabled. 
    dot-not-in-circle: halt (<kbd>[break]</kbd>) is disabled, 
                   and auto-boot is enabled. 
 
  Three-position-rotary: power-up bootstrap behaviour 
    arrow: normal operation. 
    face: language inquiry mode. 
    t-in-circle: infinite self-test loop. 
 
  Eight-position-rotary: console baud rate selection 
    select the required baud rate; read at power-up. 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
There are several different bulkheads involved, including one for the 
BA23 and BA123 enclosures, and one for the S-box (BA2xx) series 
enclosure. The console bulkheads typically used either the MMJ serial 
line connection, or the MicroVAX DB9 (not the PC DB9 pinout), please 
see the descriptions of these in section WIRES1. For available 
adapters, see <a href="vmsfaq_020.html#wires2">Section 14.28</a>.

<p>
Also present on the console bulkhead is a self-test indicator: a 
single-digit LED display. This matches the final part of the countdown 
displayed on the console or workstation, and can be used by a service 
organization to determine the nature of a processor problem. The 
particular countdown sequence varies by processor type, consult the 
hardware or owner's manual for the processor, or contact the local 
hardware service organization for information the self-test sequence 
for a particular processor module. Note that self-tests 2, 1 and 0 are 
associated with the transfer of control from the console program to the 
(booting) operating system.

<a name="alpha12"><h2>14.3.4 What are Alpha console environment variables?</h2></a>

<p>
Alpha systems have a variety of variables with values set up within the 
SRM system console. These environment variables control the particular 
behaviour of the console program and the system hardware, the 
particular console interface presented to the operating system, various 
default values for the operating system bootstrap, and related control 
mechanisms---in other words, "the environment variables provide an 
easily extensible mechanism for managing complex console state."

<p>
The specific environment variables differ by platform and by firmware 
version---the baseline set is established by the Alpha Architecture:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
AUTO_ACTION ("BOOT", "HALT", "RESTART", any other value 
assumed to be HALT),  BOOT_DEV, BOOTDEF_DEV, BOOTED_DEV, 
BOOT_FILE, BOOTED_FILE, BOOT_OSFLAGS, BOOTED_OSFLAGS, 
BOOT_RESET ("ON", "OFF"), DUMP_DEV, ENABLE_AUDIT ("ON", 
"OFF"), LICENSE, CHAR_SET, LANGUAGE, TTY_DEV.  
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
OpenVMS Galaxy firmware can add console environment variables beginning 
with such strings as LP_* and HP_*, and each particular console 
implementation can (and often does) have various sorts of 
platform-specific extensions beyond these variables...

<p>
The contents of a core set of environment variables are accessible from 
OpenVMS using the f$getenv lexical and the sys$getenv system service. 
(These calls are first documented in V7.2, but have been around for 
quite a while.) Access to arbitary console environment variables is 
rather more involved, and not directly available.

<a name="vaxalphar5"><h2>14.3.5 What are the boot control flag values?</h2></a>

<p>
Both VAX and Alpha primary bootstraps support flag values; a mechanism 
which permits the system manager to perform specific customizations or 
site-specific debugging of the OpenVMS system bootstrap. While very 
similar, there are differences between VAX and Alpha systems in this 
area.

<a name="alpha11"><h3>14.3.5.1 What are the Alpha APB boot flag values?</h3></a>

<p>
The following flags are passed (via register R5) to the OpenVMS Alpha 
primary bootstrap image APB.EXE. These flags control the particular 
behaviour of the bootstrap:

          Conversational boot. At various points in the         
          system boot procedure, the bootstrap code             
          solicits parameter and other input from the           
          console terminal.  If the DIAG is also on then        
          the diagnostic supervisor should enter "MENU"

          executes a BPT instruction immediately after          
          enabling mapping.

          Secondary boot from the boot block.  Secondary        
          bootstrap is a single 512-byte block, whose LBN       
          is specified in R4.

          secondary bootstrap image from that file's            
          image header.  If RPB$V_HEADER is not set,

          Halt before transfer.  Executes a HALT                
          instruction before transferring control               
          to the secondary bootstrap.

<a name="alpha7"><h2>14.3.6 How do I boot an AlphaStation without monitor or keyboard?</h2></a>

<p>
The AlphaStation series will boot without a keyboard attached. To use a 
serial terminal as the console, issue the SRM console command SET 
CONSOLE SERIAL followed by the console INIT command. Once this SRM 
command sequence has been invoked, the Alpha system will use the serial 
terminal.
<a name="index_x_1139"></a>
<a name="index_x_1140"></a>
<a name="index_x_1141"></a>

<p>
The DEC 3000 series has a jumper on the motherboard for this purpose. 
Various older Alpha workstations generally will not (automatically) 
bootstrap without a keyboard connected, due to the self-test failure 
that arises when the (missing) keyboard test fails.

<p>
The usual settings for the console serial terminal (or PC terminal 
emulator acting as a serial console are:

9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit (9600 baud, 8N1). 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
AlphaServer 4100 and derivative series platforms, and AlphaServer GS80, 
GS160, and GS320 series system consoles are capable of 57600 baud. See 
the COM2_BAUD console environment variable, and ensure that you have 
current SRM firmware version loaded.

<p>
The AlphaStation and AlphaServer series use the PC DIN serial connector 
for the "COM1" and "COM2" serial lines, see <a href="vmsfaq_020.html#wires1">Section 14.27</a> for details 
and pinout.

The SROM firmware loader expects an ODS-2 formatted floppy, see mkboot. 
As for which image to use, the ROM image uses a header and the file 
extension .ROM, and the SROM bootable floppy cannot use the .ROM file.

<p>
To check the firmware loaded on recent OpenVMS Alpha systems, use the 
command:

<a name="alpha14"><h3>14.3.7.2 How do I reload SRM firmware on a half-flash Alpha system?</h3></a>

<p>
Some of the AlphaStation series systems are &quot;half-flash&quot; 
boxes, meaning only one set of firmware (SRM or AlphaBIOS) can be 
loaded in flash at a time. Getting back to the SRM firmware when 
AlphaBIOS (or ARC) is loaded can be a little interesting...

<p>
That said, this usually involves shuffling some files, and then getting 
into the AlphaBIOS firmware update sequence, and then entering "update 
srm" at the apu-&gt; prompt.

<p>
To shuffle the files, copy the target SRM firmware file (as200_v7_0.exe 
is current) to a blank, initialized, FAT-format floppy under the 
filename A:\FWUPDATE.EXE

<p>
From the AlphaBIOS Setup screen, select the Upgrade AlphaBIOS option. 
Once the firmware update utility gets going, enter:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
     Apu-&gt; update srm 
 
           Answer "y" to the "Are you ready...?" 
 
     Apu-&gt; quit 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You've reloaded the flash. Now power-cycle the box to finish the 
process.

<p>
Also see <a href="vmsfaq_017.html#alpha6">Section 14.3.7.1</a>.

<a name="alpha21"><h3>14.3.7.3 How do I switch between AlphaBIOS/ARC and SRM consoles?</h3></a>

<p>
The specific steps required vary by system. You must first ensure that 
the particular Alpha system is supported by OpenVMS (see the SPD), that 
all core I/O components (graphics, disk controllers, etc) in the system 
are supported by OpenVMS (see the SPD), and that you have an OpenVMS 
distribution, that you have the necessary license keys (PAKs), and that 
you have the necessary SRM firmware loaded.

<p>
A typical sequence used for switching over from the AlphaBIOS graphics 
console to the SRM console follows:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Press <kbd>[F2]</kbd> to get to the AlphaBIOS setup menu.
  <li>Pick the "CMOS Setup..." item.
  <li>Press <kbd>[F6]</kbd> to get to the "Advanced CMOS Setup" menu.
  <li>Change the "Console Selection" to "OpenVMS Console (SRM)".
  <li>Press <kbd>[F10]</kbd>, <kbd>[F10]</kbd>, then <kbd>[Enter]</kbd> 
  to save your changes.
  <li>Power-cycle the system.
</ol>

<p>
Most Alpha systems support loading both the AlphaBIOS/ARC console and 
the SRM console at the same time, but systems such as the AlphaStation 
255 are "half-flash" systems and do not support the presence of both 
the AlphaBIOS/ARC and SRM console firmware at the same time. If you 
have a "half-flash" system, you must load the SRM firmware from floppy, 
from a network download, or from a firmware CD-ROM. Following the 
normal AlphaBIOS or ARC firmware update sequence to the APU prompt, and 
then explictly select the target console. In other words, power up the 
system to the AlphaBIOS or ARC console, use the supplementary options 
to select the installation of new firmware (typically from CD-ROM), and 
then rather than using a sequence which updates the current firmware:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>

    Apu-&gt; verify 
    Apu-&gt; quit 
    Power-cycle the system 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Use the following sequence to specifically update (and load) SRM from 
AlphaBIOS/ARC on a "half-flash" system:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
    Apu-&gt; update SRM 
    Apu-&gt; verify 
    Apu-&gt; quit 
    Power-cycle the system 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Use the following sequence to specifically update (and load) the 
AlphaBIOS/ARC console from SRM on a "half-flash" system:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b -fl 0,A0 ddcu 
    BOOTFILE: firmware_boot_file.exe 
 
    Apu-&gt; update ARC 
    Apu-&gt; verify 
    Apu-&gt; quit 
    Power-cycle the system 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Once you have the SRM loaded, you can directly install OpenVMS or Tru64 
UNIX on the system. Do not allow Windows NT to write a 
&quot;harmless&quot; signature to any disk used by OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, 
or Linux, as this will clobber a key part of the disk. (On OpenVMS, you 
can generally recover from this &quot;harmless&quot; action by using 
the WRITEBOOT tool.)

<p>
If you have a &quot;full-flash&quot; system and want to select the SRM 
console from the AlphaBIOS or ARC console environment, select the 
&quot;Switch to OpenVMS or Tru64 UNIX console&quot; item from the 
&quot;set up the system&quot; submenu. Then power-cycle the system. If 
you have a &quot;full-flash&quot; system with the SRM console and want 
to select AlphaBIOS/ARC, use the command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
   &gt;&gt;&gt; set os_type NT 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
and power-cycle the system.
