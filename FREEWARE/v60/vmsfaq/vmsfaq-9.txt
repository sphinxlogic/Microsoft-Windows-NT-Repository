                   Many commercial paging services provide email contact
                   addresses for their paging customers-you can simply
                   send or forward email directly to the email address
                   assigned to the pager.

                   Some people implement the sending of pages to radio
                   pagers by sending commands to a modem to take the
                   "phone" off the "hook", and then the paging sequence,
                   followed by a delay, and then the same number that a
                   human would dial to send a numeric page. (This is not
                   entirely reliable, as the modem lacks "call progress
                   detection", and the program could simply send the
                   dial sequence when not really connected to the paging
                   company's telephone-based dial-up receiver.)

          15.6.1.1  OpenVMS Cluster (SCS) over DECnet? Over IP?

                   The OpenVMS Cluster environment operates over various
                   network protocols, but the core of clustering uses
                   the System Communications Services (SCS) protocols,
                   and SCS-specific network datagrams. Direct (full)
                   connectivity is assumed.

                   An OpenVMS Cluster does not operate over DECnet, nor
                   over IP.

                   No SCS protocol routers are available.

                                                                     15-11

                   Many folks have suggested operating SCS over DECnet
                   or IP over the years, but SCS is too far down in
                   the layers, and any such project would entail a
                   major or complete rewrite of SCS and of the DECnet
                   or IP drivers. Further, the current DECnet and IP
                   implementations have large tracts of code that operate
                   at the application level, while SCS must operate in
                   the rather more primitive contexts of the system and
                   particularly the bootstrap-to get SCS to operate over a
                   DECnet or IP connection would require relocating major
                   portions of the DECnet or IP stack into the kernel.
                   (And it is not clear that the result would even meet
                   the bandwidth and latency expectations.)

                   The usual approach for multi-site OpenVMS Cluster
                   configurations involves FDDI, Memory Channel (MC2), or
                   a point-to-point remote bridge, brouter, or switch. The
                   connection must be transparent, and it must operate at
                   10 megabits per second or better (Ethernet speed), with
                   latency characteristics similar to that of Ethernet or
                   better. Various sites use FDDI, MC2, ATM, or point-to-
                   point T3 link.

                   SCS: Systems Communication Services. The protocol used
                   to communicate between VMSCluster systems and between
                   OpenVMS systems and SCS-based storage controllers.
                   (SCSI-based storage controllers do not use SCS.)

                   PORT: A communications device, such as DSSI, CI,
                   Ethernet or FDDI. Each CI or DSSI bus is a different
                   local port, named PAA0, PAB0, PAC0 etc. All Ethernet
                   and FDDI busses make up a single PEA0 port.

                   VIRTUAL CIRCUIT: A reliable communications path
                   established between a pair of ports. Each port in a
                   VMScluster establishes a virtual circuit with every
                   other port in that cluster.

                   All systems and storage controllers establish "Virtual
                   Circuits" to enable communications between all
                   available pairs of ports.

                   SYSAP: A "system application" that communicates using
                   SCS. Each SYSAP communicates with a particular remote
                   SYSAP. Example SYSAPs include:

                   VMS$DISK_CL_DRIVER connects to MSCP$DISK
                   The disk class driver is on every VMSCluster system.
                   MSCP$DISK is on all disk controllers and all VMSCluster
                   systems that have SYSGEN parameter MSCP_LOAD set to 1

                   VMS$TAPE_CL_DRIVER connects to MSCP$TAPE
                   The tape class driver is on every VMSCluster system.
                   MSCP$TAPE is on all tape controllers and all VMSCluster
                   systems that have SYSGEN parameter TMSCP_LOAD set to 1

                   VMS$VAXCLUSTER connects to VMS$VAXCLUSTER
                   This SYSAP contains the connection manager, which
                   manages cluster connectivity, runs the cluster state
                   transition algorithm, and implements the cluster quorum
                   algorithm. This SYSAP also handles lock traffic, and
                   various other cluster communications functions.

                   SCS$DIR_LOOKUP connects to SCS$DIRECTORY
                   This SYSAP is used to find SYSAPs on remote systems

                   MSCP and TMSCP
                   The Mass Storage Control Protocol and the Tape MSCP
                   servers are SYSAPs that provide access to disk and
                   tape storage, typically operating over SCS protocols.
                   MSCP and TMSCP SYSAPs exist within OpenVMS (for OpenVMS
                   hosts serving disks and tapes), within CI- and DSSI-
                   based storage controllers, and within host-based MSCP-
                   or TMSCP storage controllers. MSCP and TMSCP can be
                   used to serve MSCP and TMSCP storage devices, and can
                   also be used to serve SCSI and other non-MSCP/non-TMSCP
                   storage devices.

                                                                     15-13

                   SCS CONNECTION: A SYSAP on one node establishes an SCS

                   connection will be on ONE AND ONLY ONE of the available
                   virtual circuits.

                   When there are multiple virtual circuits between two
                   OpenVMS systems it is possible for the VMS$VAXCLUSTER
                   to VMS$VAXCLUSTER connection to use any one of these
                   circuits. All lock traffic between the two systems will
                   then travel on the selected virtual circuit.

                   Each port has a "LOAD CLASS" associated with it. This
                   load class helps to determine which virtual circuit
                   a connection will use. If one port has a higher load
                   class than all others then this port will be used. If
                   two or more ports have equally high load classes then
                   the connection will use the first of these that it
                   finds. Normally all CI and DSSI ports have a load class
                   of 14(hex), while the Ethernet and FDDI ports will have
                   a load class of A(hex).

                   For instance, if you have multiple DSSI busses and
                   an FDDI, the VMS$VAXCLUSTER connection will chose the
                   DSSI bus as this path has the system disk, and thus
                   will always be the first DSSI bus discovered when the
                   OpenVMS system boots.

                   To force all lock traffic off the DSSI and on to
                   the FDDI, for instance, an adjustment to the load
                   class value is required, or the DSSI SCS port must
                   be disabled.

                   Note that with PE ports, you can typically immediately
                   re-enable the path, permitting failover to occur should
                   congestion or a problem arise-a running average of the
                   path latency is checked when the virtual circuit is
                   formed, and at periodic intervals (circa every three
                   seconds), and when a problem with a virtual circuit
                   arises.

                   In the case of PEDRIVER, the driver handles load
                   balancing among the available Ethernet and FDDI
                   connections based on the lowest latency path available
                   to it. Traffic will be routed through that path until
                   an event occurs that requires a fail-over.

          15.6.1.2.3  Cluster Communications Control Tools and Utilities?

                   In most OpenVMS versions, you can use the tools:

                   o  SYS$EXAMPLES:LAVC$STOP_BUS

                   o  SYS$EXAMPLES:LAVC$START_BUS

                   These tools permit you to disable or enable all SCS
                   traffic on the on the specified paths.

                   You can also use a preferred path mechanism that tells
                   the local MSCP disk class driver (DUDRIVER) which path
                   to a disk should be used. Generally, this is used with
                   dual-pathed disks, forcing I/O traffic through one of
                   the controllers instead of the other. This can be used
                   to implement a crude form of I/O load balancing at the
                   disk I/O level.

                   Prior to V7.2, the preferred path feature uses the
                   tool:

                   o  SYS$EXAMPLES:PREFER.MAR

                   In OpenVMS V7.2 and later, you can use the following
                   DCL command:

                   $ SET PREFERRED_PATH

                   The preferred path mechanism does not disable nor
                   affect SCS operations on the non-preferred path.

                   With OpenVMS V7.3 and later, please see the SCACP

          15.6.2.1  What is the correct value for EXPECTED_VOTES in a
                    VMScluster?

                   The VMScluster connection manager uses the concept
                   of votes and quorum to prevent disk and memory data
                   corruptions-when sufficient votes are present for
                   quorum, then access to resources is permitted. When
                   sufficient votes are not present, user activity will be
                   blocked. The act of blocking user activity is called
                   a "quorum hang", and is better thought of as a "user
                   data integrity interlock". This mechanism is designed
                   to prevent a partitioned VMScluster, and the resultant
                   massive disk data corruptions. The quorum mechanism is
                   expressly intended to prevent your data from becoming
                   severely corrupted.

                   On each OpenVMS node in a VMScluster, one sets two
                   values in SYSGEN: VOTES, and EXPECTED_VOTES. The
                   former is how many votes the node contributes to the
                   VMScluster. The latter is the total number of votes
                   expected when the full VMScluster is bootstrapped.

                   Some sites erroneously attempt to set EXPECTED_VOTES
                   too low, believing that this will allow when only a
                   subset of voting nodes are present in a VMScluster. It
                   does not. Further, an erroneous setting in EXPECTED_
                   VOTES is automatically corrected once VMScluster
                   connections to other nodes are established; user data
                   is at risk of severe corruptions during the earliest
                   and most vulnerable portion of the system bootstrap,
                   before the connections have been established.

                   One can operate a VMScluster with one, two, or many
                   voting nodes. With any but the two-node configuration,
                   keeping a subset of the nodes active when some nodes
                   fail can be easily configured. With the two-node
                   configuration, one must use a primary-secondary
                   configuration (where the primary has all the votes), a

                   peer configuration (where when either node is down, the
                   other hangs), or (preferable) a shared quorum disk.

                   Use of a quorum disk does slow down VMScluster
                   transitions somewhat - the addition of a third
                   voting node that contributes the vote(s) that would
                   be assigned to the quorum disk makes for faster
                   transitions-but the use of a quorum disk does mean
                   that either node in a two-node VMScluster configuration
                   can operate when the other node is down.

                   If you choose to use a quoum disk, a QUORUM.DAT file
                   will be automatically created when OpenVMS first
                   boots and when a quorum disk is specified - well, the
                   QUORUM.DAT file will be created when OpenVMS is booted
                   without also needing the votes from the quorum disk.

                   In a two-node VMScluster with a shared storage
                   interconnect, typically each node has one vote, and
                   the quorum disk also has one vote. EXPECTED_VOTES is
                   set to three.

                   Using a quorum disk on a non-shared interconnect is
                   unnecessary-the use of a quorum disk does not provide
                   any value, and the votes assigned to the quorum disk
                   should be assigned to the OpenVMS host serving access
                   to the disk.

                   For information on quorum hangs, see the OpenVMS
                   documentation. For information on changing the

                   Priority Level %x0C; IPL C) handler. AMDS, Availability
                   Manager, and the IPC handler can each be used to clear
                   a quorum hang. Use of AMDS and Availability Manager is
                   generally recommended over IPC, particularly because
                   IPC can cause CLUEXIT bugchecks if the system should
                   remain halted beyond the cluster sanity timer limits.

                   The quorum scheme is a set of "blade guards"
                   deliberately implemented by OpenVMS Engineering to
                   provide data integrity-remove these blade guards at
                   your peril. OpenVMS Engineering did not implement
                   the quorum mechanism to make a system manager's life
                   more difficult- the quorum mechanism was specifically
                   implemented to keep your data from getting scrambled.

          15.6.2.2  Explain disk (or tape) allocation class settings?

                   The allocation class mechanism provides the system
                   manager with a way to configure and resolve served and
                   direct paths to storage devices within a cluster. Any
                   served device that provides multiple paths should be
                   configured using a non-zero allocation class, either
                   at the MSCP (or TMSCP) storage controllers, at the
                   port (for port allocation classes), or at the OpenVMS
                   MSCP (or TMSCP) server. All controllers or servers
                   providing a path to the same device should have the
                   same allocation class (at the port, controller, or
                   server level).

                   Each disk (or tape) unit number used within a non-
                   zero disk (or tape) allocation class must be unique,
                   regardless of the particular device prefix. For the
                   purposes of multi-path device path determination, any
                   disk (or tape) device with the same unit number and the
                   same disk (or tape) allocation class configuration is
                   assumed to be the same device.

                   If you are reconfiguring disk device allocation
                   classes, you will want to avoid the use of allocation
                   class one ($1$) until/unless you have Fibre Channel
                   storage configured. (Fibre Channel storage specifically
                   requires the use of allocation class $1$. eg:
                   $1$DGA0:.)

          15.6.2.2.1  How to configure allocation classes and Multi-Path
                      SCSI?

                   The HSZ allocation class is applied to devices,
                   starting with OpenVMS V7.2. It is considered a port
                   allocation class (PAC), and all device names with a PAC
                   have their controller letter forced to "A". (You might
                   infer from the the text in the "Guidelines for OpenVMS
                   Cluster Configurations" that this is something you have
                   to do, though OpenVMS will thoughtfully handle this
                   renaming for you.)

                   You can force the device names back to DKB by setting
                   the HSZ allocation class to zero, and setting the PKB
                   PAC to -1. This will use the host allocation class, and
                   will leave the controller letter alone (that is, the
                   DK controller letter will be the same as the SCSI port
                   (PK) controller). Note that this won't work if the HSZ
                   is configured in multibus failover mode. In this case,
                   OpenVMS requires that you use an allocation class for
                   the HSZ.

                   When your configuration gets even moderately complex,
                   you must pay careful attention to how you assign
                   the three kinds of allocation class: node, port and
                   HSZ/HSJ, as otherwise you could wind up with device
                   naming conflicts that can be painful to resolve.

                   The display-able path information is for SCSI
                   multi-path, and permits the multi-path software to
                   distinguish between different paths to the same device.
                   If you have two paths to $1$DKA100, for example by
                   having two KZPBA controllers and two SCSI buses to the
                   HSZ, you would have two UCBs in a multi-path set. The
                   path information is used by the multi-path software to
                   distinguish between these two UCBs.

                   The displayable path information describes the path;
                   in this case, the SCSI port. If port is PKB, that's
                   the path name you get. The device name is no longer
                   completely tied to the port name; the device name now
                   depends on the various allocation class settings of the
                   controller, SCSI port or node.

                                                                     15-19

 





                   Information on Networks and Clusters




                   The reason the device name's controller letter is
                   forced to "A" when you use PACs is because a shared
                   SCSI bus may be configured via different ports on the
                   various nodes connected to the bus. The port may be PKB
                   on one node, and PKC on the other. Rather obviously,
                   you will want to have the shared devices use the same
                   device names on all nodes. To establish this, you
                   will assign the same PAC on each node, and OpenVMS
                   will force the controller letter to be the same on
                   each node. Simply choosing "A" was easier and more
                   deterministic than negotiating the controller letter
                   between the nodes, and also parallels the solution used
                   for this situation when DSSI or SDI/STI storage was
                   used.

                   To enable port allocation classes, see the SYSBOOT
                   command SET/BOOT, and see the DEVICE_NAMING system
                   parameter.

                   This information is also described in the Cluster
                   Systems and Guidelines for OpenVMS Cluster
                   Configurations manuals.

          15.6.3  Tell me about SET HOST/DUP and SET HOST/HSC

                   The OpenVMS DCL commands SET HOST/DUP and SET HOST/HSC
                   are used to connect to storage controllers via the
                   Diagnostics and Utility Protocol (DUP). These commands
                   require that the FYDRIVER device driver be connected.
                   This device driver connection is typically performed by
                   adding the following command(s) into the system startup
                   command procedure:

                   On OpenVMS Alpha:

                   $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN
                   SYSMAN> IO CONNECT FYA0/NOADAPTER/DRIVER=SYS$FYDRIVER

                   On OpenVMS VAX:

                   $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
                   SYSGEN> CONNECT FYA0/NOADAPTER

                   Alternatives to the DCL SET HOST/DUP command include
                   the console SET HOST command available on various mid-
                   to recent-vintage VAX consoles:

                   These console commands are available on most MicroVAX
                   and VAXstation 3xxx series systems, and most (all?) VAX
                   4xxx series systems. For further information, see the
                   system documentation and-on most VAX systems-see the
                   console HELP text.

                   EK-410AB-MG, _DSSI VAXcluster Installation and
                   Troubleshooting_, is a good resource for setting
                   up a DSSI VMScluster on OpenVMS VAX nodes. (This
                   manual predates coverage of OpenVMS Alpha systems,
                   but gives good coverage to all hardware and software
                   aspects of setting up a DSSI-based VMScluster-and most
                   of the concepts covered are directly applicable to
                   OpenVMS Alpha systems. This manual specifically covers
                   the hardware, which is something not covered by the
                   standard OpenVMS VMScluster documentation.)

                   system consoles... (Obviously, the system must be
                   halted for these commands...)

                   Integrated DSSI:

                   SET HOST/DUP/DSSI[/BUS:[0:1]] dssi_node_number PARAMS

                   KFQSA:

                   SET HOST/DUP/UQSSP port_controller_number PARAMS

                   For information on how to get out into the PARAMS
                   subsystem, also see the HELP at the console prompt
                   for the SET HOST syntax, or see the HELP on SET HOST
                   /DUP (once you've connected FYDRIVER under OpenVMS).

                   Once you are out into the PARAMS subsystem, you can
                   use the FORCEUNI option to force the use of the UNITNUM
                   value and then set a unique UNITNUM inside each DSSI
                   ISE-this causes each DSSI ISE to use the specfied unit
                   number and not use the DSSI node as the unit number.
                   Other parameters of interest are NODENAME and ALLCLASS,
                   the node name and the (disk or tape) cluster allocation
                   class.

                   Ensure that all disk unit numbers used within an
                   OpenVMS Cluster disk allocation class are unique, and
                   all tape unit numbers used within an OpenVMS Cluster
                   tape allocation class are also unique. For details on

          _____________________________
          15.6.6  How can I split up an OpenVMS Cluster?

                   Review the VMScluster documentation, and the System
                   Management documentation. The following are the key
                   points, but are likely not the only things you will
                   need to change.

                   OpenVMS Cluster support is directly integrated into the
                   operating system, and there is no way to remove it. You
                   can, however, remote site-specific tailoring that was
                   added for a particular cluster configuration.

                   First: Create restorable image BACKUPs of each of the
                   current system disks. If something gets messed up, you
                   want a way to recover, right?

                   Create standalone BACKUP kits for the OpenVMS VAX
                   systems, and create or acquire bootable BACKUP kits
                   for the OpenVMS Alpha systems.

                   Use CLUSTER_CONFIG or CLUSTER_CONFIG_LAN to remove the
                   various system roots and to shut off boot services and
                   VMScluster settings.

                   Create as many architecture-specific copies of the
                   system disks as required. Realize that the new systems
                   will all likely be booting through root SYS0-if you
                   have any system-specific files in any other roots, save
                   them.

                   Relocate the copies of the VMScluster common files onto
                   each of the new system disks.

                   Reset the console parameters and boot flags on each
                   system for use on a standalone node.

                   Reset the VAXCLUSTER and NISCS_LOAD_PEA0 parameters to
                   0 in SYSGEN and in MODPARAMS.DAT.

                   Clobber the VMScluster group ID and password using
                   SYSMAN.

                   Reboot the systems seperately, and run AUTOGEN on each.

                                                                     15-23

                   server nodes.

                   Permanent seperation also requires the duplication
                   of shared files. For a list of the files commonly
                   shared, please see the most current version of

                   are typically shared within a cluster:

          15.6.7  Details on Volume Shadowing?

                   This section contains information on host-based volume
                   shadowing; on the disk mirroring capabilities available
                   within OpenVMS.

          _____________________________
          15.6.7.1  Does volume shadowing require a non-zero allocation
                    classes?

                   Yes, use of host-based Volume Shadowing requires
                   that the disk(s) involved be configured in a non-zero
                   allocation class.

                   Edit SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT to include a declaration
                   of an non-zero allocation class, such as setting the
                   host allocation class to the value 7:

                   ALLOCLASS = 7

                   Then AUTOGEN the system, and reboot.

                   You should now be able to form the shadow set via a
                   command such as the following:

                   $ MOUNT dsa1007: /SHADOW=($7$dkb300:,$7$dkb500:) volumelabel

                   When operating in an OpenVMS Cluster, this sequence
                   will typically change the disk names from the SCSNODE
                   prefix (scsnode$dkann) to the allocation-class prefix
                   ($7$dkannn). This may provide you with the opportunity
                   to move to a device-independent scheme using logical
                   name constructs such as the DISK$volumelabel logical
                   names in your startup and application environments; an
                   opportunity to weed out physical device references.

                   Allocation class one is used by Fibre Channel devices;
                   it can be best to use another non-zero allocation class
                   even if Fibre Channel is not currently configured and
                   not currently planned.




                                                                     15-25
