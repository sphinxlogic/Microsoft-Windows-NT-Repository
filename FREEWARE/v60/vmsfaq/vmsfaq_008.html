<a name="mgmt40"><h1><font color=maroon>5.26 How can I prevent a serial terminal line from initiating a login?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_431"></a>

<p>
In SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM, issue the command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SET TERMINAL/NOTYPEAHEAD/PERMANENT ddcu: 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This will prevent any unsolicited terminal input on ddcu:, and this 
unsolicited input is what triggers JOB_CONTROL to start up LOGINOUT on 
the terminal. Once LOGINOUT starts up on the serial line, you can see 
interesting behaviour (eg: audits, process creations, etc) as LOGINOUT 
tries to "chat" with whatever device is hooked onto the remote end of 
the serial terminal line.

<a name="mgmt41"><h1><font color=maroon>5.27 How does PCSI use the image BUILD_IDENT field?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_432"></a>

<p>
The (undocumented) build ident field in an OpenVMS Alpha image header 
is 16 bytes long, and is used as a counted string of 0-15 characters 
(ie, as an .ASCIC string, a string with the character count in byte 0) 
and was originally introduced to provide information for use by 
VMSINSTAL patch kits to determine whether an image should be replaced 
or not.

<p>
Starting with OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2, OpenVMS Engineering uses the PCSI 
utility to package and install ECO kits for OpenVMS. PCSI uses the 
generation attribute (a 32-bit unsigned integer) specified for files in 
the product description file (PDF) of a PCSI kit as the basis for 
performing file conflict detection and resolution. When a product is 
installed, PCSI modifies the build ident field of Alpha image headers 
to store an encoded form of the generation number. It also looks at the 
build ident field of previously installed images to obtain the 
generation information for those files as input to the file conflict 
processing algorithm. (Only images have this field, obviously.)

<p>
PCSI interprets the build ident field of a previously installed image 
as follows:

<ul>
  <li>if the string length is 15, the 5th character is a hyphen, and the 
  last ten characters are a ten digit number with leading zeros, then the 
  last ten characters are treated as a valid generation number.
  <li>for V7.1-2 through V7.2-1, inclusive, if the above test fails, the 
  information is obtained from the PCSI product database.
  <li>in releases after V7.2-1 and with current PCSI ECO kits, if the 
  above test fails, an invalid generation number is treated as 0000000000 
  so that the ECO kit will simply replace the image rather than assuming 
  the PCSI database is in error.
</ul>

<p>
So, what will you see in the image identification displayed via the 
ANALYZE/IMAGE command?

<p>
For an image that has been built as part of an OpenVMS Engineering 
system build, you will generally see a build ID string in the format 
"X6TE-SSB-0000"---X6TE is the build number for the OpenVMS Alpha V7.2-1 
release. This id format is used within the OpenVMS system build, and 
can generally only be seen associated with images that have not yet 
been processed via PCSI.

<p>
During the installation of V7.2-1, PCSI will modify the image header to 
have a build ident string of "X6TE-0050120000". During installation of 
an ECO kit containing this image with a generation number of 50130052, 
for example, PCSI would determine that 50130052 is greater than 
50120000, and will replace the existing image on the target disk with 
the version of the image included in the ECO kit.

<a name="mgmt43"><h1><font color=maroon>5.28 How can I tell what software (and version) is installed?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_433"></a>

<p>
There is unfortunately no consistent nor single way to make this 
determination---this is one of the reasons that a move to PCSI 
installations is underway.
<a name="index_x_434"></a>

<p>
On OpenVMS Alpha, you can use VMSINSTAL.HISTORY and PRODUCT SHOW 
PRODUCT to determine what packages have been installed via the 
VMSINSTAL and PCSI tools, respectively.
<a name="index_x_435"></a>
<a name="index_x_436"></a>

<p>
To see which OpenVMS Alpha ECO kits have been applied, look in 
VMSINSTAL.HISTORY on OpenVMS Alpha prior to V7.1-2, and use PRODUCT 
SHOW PRODUCT/FULL on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1-2 and later.

<p>
On OpenVMS VAX, you can use PRODUCT SHOW PRODUCT and (for software that 
is installed via VMSINSTAL on V7.3 and later) in VMSINSTAL.HISTORY.

<p>
For products installed on OpenVMS VAX prior to V7.3 using VMSINSTAL, 
there is no reliable way to determine what products have been 
installed. If the product provides a RELEASE_NOTES file (as many do), 
you can look for the list of these files via DIRECTORY 
SYS$HELP:*.RELEASE_NOTES. Again, this approach is NOT reliable: some 
kits do not provide release notes, some system managers will install 
only the release notes, some system managers will delete release notes, 
and release notes for multiple versions can be present.

<p>
On most packages, you can generally use ANALYZE/IMAGE on one of the 
core images, looking at the image identification area. Some of the 
product-specific mechanisms available are:

<ul>
  <li>DQS DQS$VERSION logical name
  <li>C CC/VERSION
  <li>C++ CXX/VERSION
  <li>TCP/IP TCPIP SHOW VERSION command
</ul>

<a name="mgmt46"><h1><font color=maroon>5.29 What file checksum tools are available for OpenVMS?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_437"></a>

<p>
The undocumented DCL command CHECKSUM is the usual means, and provides 
a rather simple-minded checksum suitable to detect basic file 
corruptions. For information and an OpenVMS version of the MD5 checksum 
tool, see:

<ul>
  <li>http://www.support.compaq.com/svctools/md5-instructions.html
</ul>

<p>
The OpenVMS Alpha ECO (patch) kit checksums available at the ECO 
website are determined using the following DCL command sequence:

<p>
indicates that the particular OpenVMS Alpha release does not contain 
support for the target platform. In this case, OpenVMS does not 
recognize Alpha family 1C member 02 as a supported platform. A later 
version of OpenVMS might support the platform, or there might be no 
support on any release. Ensure that you have the most current firmware, 
and review the minimum version requirements for the platform.

<p>
The execlet load failure and other similar bootstrap status values can 
often be decoded using either of the following techniques:

<p>
To customize DCPS for an otherwise unsupported printer, you can try the 
following sequence:

<ul>
  <li>Extract the most closely-associated setup modules from the existing 
  device control library, DCPS$DEVCTL.TLB. (For instance, you can 
  probably extract and use the HP LaserJet 4000 series definitions for 
  the HP LaserJet 4050 series. Each printer will vary, please consult the 
  printer documentation for specifics and requirements.)
  <li>rename each extracted setup module to a corresponding:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>

</pre>
</font>
</table>

  <li>Insert all of the above-renamed setup modules into a newly-created 
  device control library specific to the new printer:

    <br>The above assumes the filename HP4050_DEVCTL.TLB, alter as required.
  <li>Set up your DCPS startup procedures to include a search-list 
  logical name such as:

  <li>Supply DCPS_HP4050_LIB as the library parameter in the queue 
  startup for this printer, this is the P3 parameter to the command 
  procedure SYS$STARTUP:DCPS$EXECUTION_QUEUE.COM.
  <li>The HP4050_DEVCTL library may/will need to be recreated and modules 
  re-edited and replaced with each DCPS upgrade, particularly if any 
  modules are updated in the original library. You will also want to 
  determine if the upgraded version of DCPS directly supports the 
  particular printer.

<a name="mgmt56"><h1><font color=maroon>5.36 How do I remove a PCSI-installed patch (ECO) kit?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_444"></a>

<p>
You cannot PRODUCT REMOVE a PCSI patch (ECO) kit.

<p>
In order to remove an ECO kit, PCSI would have to have copies of all 
the other version of the files from all other patches and products that 
previously were installed. This can clearly involve a large number of 
files and a large archive of old file versions and a substantial 
quantity of disk space. While removal is clearly theoretically 
possible, it is not currently implemented.

<p>
The following is the supported mechanism to remove a PCSI patch kit.

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Execute a PRODUCT SHOW PRODUCE &lt;product-name. /FULL command. The 
  &quot;maintenance&quot; column (132 column width) shows the patches 
  that have been installed. Keep a copy of this listing.
  <li>Acquire kits for all of the maintenance kits listed.
  <li>Re-install the prior FULL version of the product. This will remove 
  all patch kits, setting to product back to "original" condition.
  <li>Re-install all the patches in the list from step 1, except those 
  patches which you have determined you do not want.
</ol>

<p>
The above information also applies to PCSI PARTIAL kits.

<a name="mgmt59"><h1><font color=maroon>5.38 Resolving License PAK Problems?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_446"></a>

<p>
The PAK release date, the PAK termination date, and the PAK version are 
the usual culprits when a license product authorization key (PAK) check 
failure occurs.

<p>
The PAK termination date is the date when the license PAK will expire.

<p>
The PAK release date is the date of the most recent release date of the 
software package that will be permitted by the particular license PAK. 
(The release date check is analogous to a product version check.) The 
PAK version indicates the most recent product version that is permitted 
by the license.

<p>
Having multiple license PAKs registered (and active) can also cause 
problems if an expired PAK gets loaded. You will want to DISABLE 
license PAKs you do not wish to have loaded.

<p>
Other problems include a failure to register each PAK in all license 
databases throughout a multiple-system-disk cluster, with a consistent 
set of /INCLUDE lists specified across each of the duplicated PAKs.

<p>
Additionally, you could have an invalid LMF$LICENSE logical name 
defined. (If no LMF$LICENSE logical name is defined, the standard 
license database named SYS$SYSTEM:LMF$LICENSE.LDB will be used.)

<p>
You can display license failures by defining the following logical name:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ DEFINE/SYS/EXEC LMF$DISPLAY_OPCOM_MESSAGE TRUE 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Enable your terminal as a license operator (REPLY/ENABLE=LICENSE), 
define the LMF$DISPLAY_OPCOM_MESSAGE logical name, and then try the 
failing operation again. You should see one or more OPCOM messages 
displayed.

<p>
If you have the LMF$DISPLAY_OPCOM_MESSAGE logical name defined, you can 
(will?) see spurious license check failures---various products will 
check for multiple licenses, and a few products will check for PAKs 
that either have not yet been or will not be issued. Once you figure 
out which license has failed, you will want to deassign this logical 
name.

<p>
Note: that there is no license check failure does NOT indicate that the 
particular product or operation is permissible per the license.

<p>
To register a license PAK on a DECwindows system when DECwindows cannot 
start (because of an expired license or other licensing problem), 
follow the steps outlined in section <a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5">Section 5.5</a> up through the use of 
the AUTHORIZE command. In place of the AUTHORIZE command, use the 
console to register the license PAKs. Also see <a href="vmsfaq_014.html#misc20">Section 12.5</a> for 
licensing and troubleshooting information.

<a name="mgmt62"><h1><font color=maroon>5.40 How to prevent users from choosing obvious passwords?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_450"></a>

<p>
To prevent users from selecting obvious passwords on OpenVMS, you will 
want to use the reserved password (password screening) mechanism. 
Effectively, you merge your list of reserved passwords into the 
existing reserved words database maintained by OpenVMS. (You can also 
then require all users to reset their passwords---via the pre-expired 
password mechanism---thus forcing users to select new passwords.) For 
details on the password screening mechanism, of the reserved password 
database (VMS$PASSWORD_DICTIONARY.DATA), and details of how to merge 
your list of prohibited passwords into the database, please see the 
associated chapter in the OpenVMS security manual. For details of the 
password expiration mechanism, see the AUTHORIZE command qualifier 
/PWDEXPIRED.

<p>
You can also implement a site-specific password filter with the 
information provided in the back of the OpenVMS Programming Concepts 
manual. The password filter permits you to establish particular and 
site-specific password requirements. For details, please see the system 
parameter LOAD_PWD_POLICY
<a name="index_x_451"></a>
<a name="index_x_452"></a>
and the programming concepts manual, and see the examples in 
SYS$EXAMPLES:. (Examples and documentation on V7.3 and later reflect 
both platforms, the examples are found only on OpenVMS VAX kits on 
earlier releases. The capabilities have existed on both the VAX and 
Alpha platforms for some time now.)

<p>
To verify current passwords, you can also use a technique known to 
system crackers as the "dictionary attack"---the mechanism that makes 
this attack somewhat more difficult on OpenVMS is the hashing scheme 
used on OpenVMS, and the file protections used for the SYSUAF 
authorization database. Given a dictionary of words and the unprotected 
contents of the SYSUAF file, a search for obvious passwords can be 
performed. Interestingly, a "dictionary attack" also has the 
unfortunate side-effect of exposing the password to the user---while 
this is clearly the goal of a system cracker, authorized privileged and 
non-privileged system users should not know nor have access to the 
(cleartext) passwords of other users.

<p>
Accordingly, OpenVMS does not store the cleartest password. Further, 
OpenVMS uses a password hashing algorithm, not an encryption algorithm. 
This means that storage of a cleartext password is deliberated avoided, 
and the cleartext value is deliberately very difficult to obtain. The 
hash is based on a Purdy Polynomial, and the hash itself includes 
user-specific values in addition to the password, values that make the 
results of the password hash unique to each user.

<p>
Regardless of the use of a password hashing scheme, if a copy of your 
password file should become available to a system cracker, you will 
want to force all users to use new passwords immediately.

<p>
If you should require a user to verify a password, use the username, 
the user's salt value (this value is acquired via $getuai) and the 
user's specified cleartext password, and compare the resulting hashed 
value (using a call to $hash_password) against the saved hashed 
password value (this value also acquired via $getqui). For reasons of 
security, avoid saving a cleartext password value in any data files, 
and do not maintain the cleartext password in memory longer than 
required. (Use of $ACM on V7.3-1 and later is recommended.)

<p>
Kerberos authentication (client and server) is available on OpenVMS 
V7.3 and later. Integration of Kerberos support into various Compaq and 
into third-party products is expected.

<p>
External authentication is available in V7.3-1 and later, with support 
for user-written external authentication in V7.3-2 and later.

<p>
If you are simply looking for OpenVMS access and the SYSTEM and all 
other privileged passwords are forgotten or otherwise unavailable, 
please see section <a href="vmsfaq_005.html#mgmt5">Section 5.5</a> and/or the OpenVMS documentation set.

<p>
Also please see the C2 guidelines in the OpenVMS security manual.

directory file get renamed.

<a name="mgmt35_12"><h3>5.41.1.1 Why has OpenVMS gone through the agony of this change?</h3></a>

<p>
When a directory is renamed, the modified date is changed. When the 
restoration needs to restore the directory and its contents, and the 
restoration should not result in the restoration of the older directory 
name when a series of incremental BACKUPs are restored. Thus an 
incremental BACKUP operation needs to pick up all of the changes.

<p>
Consider performing an incremental restoration, to test the procedures. 
This testing was how OpenVMS Engineering found out about the problem 
that was latent with the old BACKUP selection scheme---the old 
incremental BACKUP scheme would have missed restoring any files under a 
renamed directory. Hence the change to the selection mechanisms 
mentioned in <a href="vmsfaq_008.html#mgmt35_10">Section 5.41.1</a>.

<a name="mgmt35_16"><h3>5.41.1.2 Can you get the old BACKUP behaviour back?</h3></a>

<p>
Yes, please see the /NOINCREMENTAL qualifier available on recent 
OpenVMS versions (and ECO kits). Use of this qualifier informs BACKUP 
that you are aware of the limitations of the old BACKUP behaviour 
around incremental disk restorations.

<a name="mgmt35_20"><h2>5.41.2 What can I do to improve BACKUP performance?</h2></a>

<p>
Use the documented commands in the manual for performing incremental 
BACKUPs. Use the documented incremental procedures. Don't try to use 
incremental commands in a non-incremental context.

<p>
Also consider understanding and then using /NOALIAS, which will likely 
be a bigger win than will anything to do with the incremental BACKUPs, 
particularly on system disks and any other disks with directory aliases.

<p>
See the OpenVMS V6.2 release notes for additional details.

<a name="mgmt64"><h2>5.41.3 Why is BACKUP not working as expected?</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_454"></a>

<p>
First, PLEASE READ THE BACKUP MANUAL.

<p>
Second, PLEASE GET THE CURRENT BACKUP ECO KIT.

<p>
Third, PLEASE SET THE PROCESS QUOTAS PER THE DOCUMENTATION.

<p>
BACKUP has a very complex interface, and there are numerous command 
examples and extensive user documentation available. For a simpler user 
interface for BACKUP, please see the documentation for the 
BACKUP$MANAGER tool.

<p>
As for recent BACKUP changes, oddities, bugs, etc:

<ul>
  <li>A change made in OpenVMS V6.2 WILL cause more files to be included 
  into a file-based BACKUP saveset using /SINCE=BACKUP as all files 
  underneath any directory with a sufficiently recent (selected) date 
  will be included in the saveset. This change was deliberate and 
  intentional, and was mandated by the need to provide a functional 
  incremental restoration. <br>Without the inclusion of these 
  apparently-extra files, an incremental saveset can NOT be reliably 
  restored.
  <li>As part of the OpenVMS V6.2 change, the /SINCE command---without 
  the specification of the =BACKUP keyword---selected more files than it 
  should have. This is a bug. This bug has been remedied in the OpenVMS 
  BACKUP source code and in some of (all of?) the BACKUP ECO kits.
</ul>

<p>
When working with BACKUP, you will want to:

<ul>
  <li>Ensure you have your process quotas set per the recommendations in 
  the OpenVMS System Management documentation. Deviation from these 
  values can and will lead to access violation (ACCVIO) and other 
  untoward behaviour.
  <li>Get the current BACKUP ECO kit and install it BEFORE you attempt to 
  troubleshoot any problems.
  <li>Learn about the /NOINCREMENTAL (new) and /NOALIAS (V6.2 and later) 
  command qualifiers. The former qualifier returns to the pre-V6.2 
  behaviour of the /SINCE file selection mechanism, while the latter 
  (specified with /IMAGE) reduces the replication of files on system 
  disks and other disks with file alias and directory alias entries. Both 
  of these can reduce the numbers of files that will be selected and thus 
  included into the saveset. <br>Learn what /IGNORE=INTERLOCK means. This 
  command probably does not
<a name="index_x_455"></a>
provide what you think it does---those file system interlocks that this 
command is ignoring were implemented for a reason, after all. Ignoring 
these interlocks can lead to missed data and potentially to corruptions 
to individual files stored within the output saveset, corruptions that 
may or may not be reported. For details on this BACKUP command 
qualifier, please see the Ask The Wizard topic (2467).
</ul>

<p>
When working with the BACKUP callable API:

<ul>
  <li>Build your applications with the most current BACKUP API available. 
  Changes made to the V7.1-2 and V7.2 API were incompatible with the V7.1 
  and V7.2-1 and later APIs, and this incompatibility was repaired via a 
  BACKUP ECO kit. Do NOT build your application with the versions of the 
  BACKUP API that shipped with V7.1-2 and V7.2, as these are incompatible 
  with the BACKUP API constants that were used on other versions.
