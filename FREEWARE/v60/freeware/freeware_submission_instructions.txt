
               Introduction to the OpenVMS Freeware Submissions
               ------------------------------------------------

OpenVMS Engineering is again sponsoring an OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM.  The
OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM contains "public domain" and "freeware" software 
which runs on OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS I64, and selected tools
specific to the interoperation of other systems with OpenVMS systems.  
The purpose of the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM is to provide OpenVMS customers
with easy access to public domain software and to "free" internal HP 
software and tools.

The guidelines for the software to be contained on the OpenVMS Freeware 
CD-ROM are the following:

o The software must be free and access unencumbered.  No license fees
  shall be requested of or required by the customer for its use.  GNU,
  OpenBSD or or similar open-source licenses may (or may not) apply.
o If a product authorization key (PAK) is required, an unrestricted PAK
  (with no termination!) must be provided with the submission.  If a PAK
  is not provided, HP may (at its sole discretion) elect to provide a
  PAK for the Freeware submission.
o The software must run on OpenVMS VAX and/or OpenVMS Alpha and/or OpenVMS
  I64, or be of direct relevance (or "Affinity") to OpenVMS systems.
o HP does not warranty this software in any way.  It is provided as
  "as is" software.
o HP will not provide service for this software, test the software,
  review the software or the source code, fix the software, or warranty
  that it works correctly or at all.  Individuals and vendors that have
  submitted packages to the Freeware may explicitly elect to provide 
  services, testing, enhancements, updates and/or specific warrantees
  for submissions -- but no such statements should be expected nor
  assumed.
o Customers are free to adapt and change the sources for their needs.
o HP products on the Freeware may or may not provide source code, but
  -- and at the discretion of HP -- all other submissions are expected
  to provide full source code.
o Submissions that are regulated under US export controls will not 
  be accepted.


                 Acquiring a Copy of the Freeware CD-ROM kit
                 -------------------------------------------

The OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM will be distributed in conjunction with the 
standard OpenVMS operating system software distribution kits.  It will 
also be made available for anonymous access from the OpenVMS Website:

  http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/

The Freeware CD-ROM kit may or may not be separately orderable.


                 Creating a Kit for Inclusion on the Freeware
                 --------------------------------------------

Please carefully follow the following simple steps to ease the job of 
packaging the wealth of software submissions onto the Freeware CD-ROM kit:

  1: Build the software into a saveset or ZIP kit.  Each product must be 
     in a DIFFERENT directory, or in a separate saveset or ZIP kit.  If 
     the sources are included, place them in a subdirectory called [.SRC].
     If executable or shareable images are included, place them one or more 
     architecture-specific subdirectories, and preferably named [.VAX_IMAGES],
     [.ALPHA_IMAGES], and/or [IA64_IMAGES].

     You must to supply one file (and optionally two others) in each 
     top-level directory:

       - FREEWARE_README.TXT  

         This file must have the following format for the FIRST line:

            PACKAGE_NAME, CATEGORY, ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION

          for example:

            INTOUCH 4GL, LANGUAGES, High-performance 4GL for VAX and Alpha...

         The one-line descriptions will be truncated to 60 characters.  This
         will allow them to display nicely on the selection menus later on.

         The list of categories to choose from are:

         AFFINITY             Interoperation with Microsoft Windows systems
         BUILD_TOOLS          Build tools
         WEB_TOOLS            CGI and HTML tools
         GAMES                Games (also see Motif Toys)
         GRAPHICS             Graphics tools
         LANGUAGES            Compilers, assemblers, and language-related
         MISCELLANEOUS        Or ask for a new category
         MOTIF_TOYS           X Windows, CDE, and Motif toys
         NETWORKING           Networking and network-related tools
         PROGRAMMING          Tools of interest to OpenVMS Programmers
         SYSTEM_MGMT          Tools related to system managment, security, etc
         UTILITIES            Random Utilities not related to other categories

         HP OpenVMS Engineering may choose to reset the category to match
         one of the above categories, or to a more appropriate category. 
         Petitions for the creation of new categories gladly accepted.

         Any additional lines of text in the FREEWARE_README.TXT file will 
         be displayed to the user from the MENU SYSTEM, if they choose this 
         package from the menu.

       - FREEWARE_DEMO.TXT file (optional)
  
         The FREEWARE_DEMO.TXT file is text that can explain how to try this
         software...or explains what the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM file will be
         showing the user.

         Depending on the volume of software submitted, these demonstrations
         may require the end-user unzip the distribution.

       - FREEWARE_DEMO.COM (optional)
  
         If the user selects this package from the menu system, 
         the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM file will be executed.

         Depending on the volume of software submitted, these demonstrations
         may require the end-user unzip the distribution.


  2: Each directory should contain VAX, Alpha and/or IA64 executables (if 
     possible), help text or help libraries, documentation, source file(s)
     (preferably in a [.SRC] subdirectory) and then  anything else you wish
     to include.  If the kit contains objects or executables or multiple
     platforms, consider using subdirectories [.VAX_IMAGES], [.ALPHA_IMAGES]
     and/or [.IA64_IMAGES].

     If the software is already kitted as a VMSINSTAL or PCSI kit, that 
     is quite acceptable.  Just put the kits in the directory along with 
     the instructions and a basic introduction.  

     Depending on the volume of software submitted, these installation kits
     may be left available directly, as well as residing within the zip 
     archive.

  3: PLEASE make sure that the .txt and .com files are easy to read and 
     understand.  The more friendly your instructions and directions, the 
     more likely that others will want to try it.

  4: In order for the software to be considered for inclusion on the 
     freeware CD-ROM, the attached release form MUST be submitted with 
     the software.  

     Electronic copies of the signed release form are acceptable.

     The release form will not be included in the distribution.


                             How to Submit a Kit
	                     -------------------
