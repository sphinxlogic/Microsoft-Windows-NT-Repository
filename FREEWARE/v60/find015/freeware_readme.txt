FIND, UTILITIES, SEARCH with Replacement Capabilities

FIND/REPLACE is a close relative of the UnI*x tool grep, with 
the option to replace the targets found, and with the command 
line syntax of the OpenVMS SEARCH tool. 

With the exception of the absence of /MATCH=AND and /MATCH=OR, 
the interface is compatible with SEARCH.

The tool supports both LSEDIT and POSIX regular expressions.
