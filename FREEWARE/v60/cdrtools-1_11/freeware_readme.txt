CDRTOOLS, UTILITIES, CD-R/RW Recording Tools for OpenVMS

This is an early port of CDRTOOLS-1_11.

The core CDRECORD engine is known to function with local CD-R drives,
and CD-R operations have been tried and do function with Plextor
PlexWriter SCSI drives and do with CD-R media loaded in HP DVD200 
series DVD drives.

This version of MKISOFS is known not to function.  (Problems within
the assumptions made around the readdir and related calls being one
reported area of incompatibility.)

Other components of CDRTOOLS here have not been tested.
