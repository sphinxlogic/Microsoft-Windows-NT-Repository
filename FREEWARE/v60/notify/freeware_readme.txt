NOTIFY, UTILITIES, Notifies you when an already-submitted batch job is done. 

NOTIFY.COM V2.1-1 

This utility notifies you when an already-submitted batch job
completes and gives the completion status of the job. This is useful
if you are waiting for a job that is running under another username or
for a job for which you did not specify the /NOTIFY qualifier.
NOTIFY.COM also tells you the completion status of the job. You can
also have NOTIFY.COM redirect the notification message to another
user or to a user on remote node.
