LD731, SYSTEM_MGMT, OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Virtual Disk Driver

This is a variation of the LDDRIVER kit found on previous Freeware 
releases (including the LD063 kit on Freeware V5.0) and allows more
direct access to the integrated LDDRIVER present within OpenVMS 
Alpha V7.3-1.  

This kit does not contain the driver, it allows more direct and
easier access to the LDDRIVER latent within OpenVMS Alpha V7.3-1.

This kit may or may not operate on releases newer than OpenVMS Alpha
V7.3-1, and will not operate on releases older than OpenVMS Alpha 
V7.3-1.

Releases LD063 and prior have a hard upper volume size limit of four 
gigabytes (4 GB), and larger volumes should not be configured.
