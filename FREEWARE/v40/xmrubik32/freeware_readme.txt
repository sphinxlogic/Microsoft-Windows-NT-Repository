XMRUBIK32, GAMES, MOTIF RUBIK'S CUBE Yet another motif widget

  DESCRIPTION

    One of the motivations is my love of puzzles.

    The top of the window shows what certain mouse inputs are. These are
    only activated inside the widget itself. (Clicking on the mouse icons
    is ignored).

    Use "mouse-left" to move ccw.

    Use "mouse-center", "P", or "p" to toggle the practice
    mode (in practice mode the record should be "VOID").

    "mouse-right", "R", or "r", to randomize (this must be
    done first to set a new record).

    "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys kill program.

    Use the key pad or "R" keys for other ways to move other than CCW. (NOTE:
    one must have the keyboardFocusPolicy set to pointer).

    Use the slider to change complexity.

    Use the toggle to toggle the orient lines.
