QI_UAFDUMP.DOC

QI_UAFDUMP is a program that reads SYSUAF.DAT and creates a fixed-length input
file for QI_MAKE.

The command RUN QI_UAFDUMP will create a file UAFDATA.TXT.  This file can be
used to create a minimal name/email listing of all the users in the SYSUAF.

The file UAFDATA.QI_MAKE is a definition of UAFDATA.TXT that can be used with
QI_MAKE (see QI_MAKE.DOC) to create the input for QI_BUILD.  Edit
UAFDATA.QI_MAKE to add your email domain.  You should probably also use
QI_ADD_ALIAS and QI_ADD_SOUNDEX.
