QI, NETWORKING, VMS CCSO Nameserver version 3.09

The CCSO Nameserver is a computer resident "phone book".  It can
keep a relatively small amount of information about a relatively
large number of people or things, and provide fast access to that
information over the Internet.

Unlike a printed directory, the information in the CCSO Nameserver
is dynamic.  It can be updated at any time, from any computer on the
Internet capable of running "client" programs such as ph, Gopher or
a number of web clients and gateways.  The Nameserver can also be
taught to keep new types of information, such as electronic mail
addresses or office hours, without recompilation or change to the
existing database.

VMS qi is a native RMS-based implementation of the protocol
described in the CCSO documents from UIUC.  Both the original
documents and the VMS differences are included in this kit.
