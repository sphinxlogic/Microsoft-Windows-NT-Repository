# Zip up a distribution of wxWindows.
# I use this to transfer _edited_files_only_ from Sun to PC by floppy.
# This saves huge amounts of time compared with transferring all files
# per session, especially when the few changed files are compressed.
#
# This uses UNIX zip, available from all good UNIX ftp sites.
# Note the sneaky use of the same response file as the DOS zipwx.bat,
# although UNIX zip doesn't have a response file feature.
#
# It also uses a tiny program called 'isnewer' I wrote to output the
# names of the files newer than the first argument.
