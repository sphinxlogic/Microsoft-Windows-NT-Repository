Hi there,

These are the changes I needed to make to compile wxWin162d
with Borland 4.5 as 32bit. I had some problems with inclusions of 
g++ header files when using garbage collection, but except this I've
selected everything in wx_Setup.h. I think, I've compiled/tested every lib, 
sample, utility and contribution delivered with wxWin for MSW except some
library test programs (e.g. test of wxstring), but if you are missing 
something, please let me know.


changes in makefiles:
=====================

src/make32.bat: 

  - added -DBCCDIR=
  - make32.bat now passes up to 3 parameters to make.exe
  - due to the changes to src/makefile.b32 you can now specify the lib or
    executable you want to be build (e.g. make32 fafa)

src/makefile.b32:
 
  - renamed target wxwin.cfg as wxwin32.cfg
  - wxwin32.cfg now contains the values of OPT and DEBUG_FLAGS, so there will
    be no need to pass them to the child makefiles (otherwise I had too long
    command lines)
  - there was a missing '-D' before DEBUG; I've added it, although Borland's
    make did not complain about it
  - renamed -DWXDIR= as -DWXWIN=
  - added some include pathes to wxwin32.cfg
  - now makefile.b32 is capable of building most of the wxWin libs and execs
    on demand (just added the right targets):
    
    target                 builds what ?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    all                    the name says it all
    all_execs              builds all executables (without winstall.exe, see
                           'unsolved problems')
    all_libs               builds all libs from utils/, contrib/ and
                           wx-lib, of course
    all_contrib            builds everything in contrib/
    all_utils              builds everything in utils/
    all_samples            builds everything in samples/
    (name_of_lib_or_exe)   builds the specified lib or exe (e.g. 'fafa' for
                           contrib/fafa)
                         
src/msw/makefile.b32:

  - moved wx_clipb.h from base headers to local headers
  - library page size increased to 256
  - ..\base\wx_lay.obj was a member of BASEOBJECTS2 and BASEOBJECTS4 -
    deleted the second one
  - some base object files were missing in the makefile (see below)
  - exchanged 
      tlib $(WXLIB)\wx.lib /P256 @&&!
    with
      tlib $(LIBTARGET) /P256 @&&!

src/base/makefile.b32

  - the following source- and object-files were missing in the makefile:
      wb_res
      wb_scrol
      wb_stat
      wb_vlbox
      wx_doc
      wx_enhdg

changes in source files:
========================

src/base/wb_print.cc and src/msw/wx_dc.cc:

  - removed comment marks in the lines
      // #ifndef __BORLANDC__
      #include <print.h>
      // #endif
    otherwise I got multiple declarations
    
src/msw/wx_win.cc:

  - lines 3172- : changed
      #if WIN32
        short minPos, maxPos;
      #else
        int minPos, maxPos;
      #endif

      to
      
      #ifdef WIN32
      #ifdef __BORLANDC__
        int minPos, maxPos;
      #else
         short minPos, maxPos;
      #endif  
      #else
        int minPos, maxPos;
      #endif

contrib/gauge/zyzgauge.c:

  - Win32s has no GetTextExtent function. I hope GetTextExtentPoint will do
    its job now (see lines 269-273 and 359-365).
    
contrib/wxstring/wxregex.h:

  - added '#ifndef __BORLANDC__' at line 138; bcc32 complains
    about '#define alloca _alloca'

contrib/wxstring/wxregex.cc:

  - added '#ifndef __BORLANDC__' at line 203; bcc32 complains
    about 'char *alloca ();'

utils/image/src/wx_image.h:

  - added '#ifdef wx_x' before line 36: #include "wx_imgx.h"

utils/mfutils/src/mfutils.h:

  - line 34: replaced #ifndef META_SETBKCOLOR with
  
    #if !defined(META_SETBKCOLOR) || (defined(__BORLANDC__) && defined(WIN32)),
    
    because Win32s seems to have less META_xxx constants; then I got
    redefinitions of the FF_xxx constants, so I ifdef'ed them out

samples/vlist/_srchdlg.cc:

  - line 12: deleted misplaced #endif
  
samples/buttnbar/test.rc:

  - there were no bitmap-files in samples/buttnbar/bitmap/, so I've copied
    as many files as I could get from samples/toolbar/bitmaps and 
    utils/wxbuild/src/bitmaps, but there are still some missing; used help.bmp
    instead
  

unsolved problems:
==================

utils/winstall:

  - I was unable to compile it. I got an error in line 35 of install.h:
    'Declaration terminated incorrectly', but could not figure out why.
    I got some 'xxx is not member of class xxx' messages, too.

samples/buttnbar:

  - the toolbox icons were not loaded properly; there are only black squares
  - the toolbar icons have a similar problem, they are grainy
  
utils/wxbuild:

  - toolbar icons are grainy
  - forms are completely black even if you put some panels or items on it

samples/form:

  - forms are painted completely black
  
src/include/base/wx_obj.h:

  - gc_c++.h will be included when garbage collection is set on; is there
    a work around for MSW ?
  



That's it.



BTW: If you have memory problems when compiling wxWin with Borland and do
     not want to mess up the DPMI, just compile it in a DOS box under Windows
     (with a right sized swap file, of course) - it's unbelievable, but
     MSW3.1 had no problems with that on my 8MB machine :).


Good luck
