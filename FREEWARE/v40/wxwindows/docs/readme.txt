   wxWindows is a C++ framework for developing multi-platform, graphical
   applications from the same body of C++ code. Currently supporting
   Motif, Open Look and MS Windows, a Mac port is under development.
   A third-party port supports development using Xt.

 Main features

   +   Simple-to-use, object-oriented API

   +   Support for menu bars and status lines
   +   Toolbar class
   +   Pens, brushes, fonts, icons, cursors, bitmaps
   +   Easy, object-oriented interprocess communication (DDE subset) under
       MS Windows and UNIX
   +   Encapsulated PostScript generation and MS Windows printing
   +   Print/preview framework

   +   Virtually automatic MDI support under MS Windows
   +   Support for MS Windows printer and file selector common dialogs, with
       equivalents for UNIX
   +   Under MS Windows, support for copying metafiles to the clipboard
   +   Programmatic form facility for building form-like screens fast,
       with constraints on values
   +   Applications can access MS Windows Help or wxHelp help system
   +   All source, examples

 Additional features

   +   Simple-to-use Windows program installation utility for delivering
       your applications

   +   Tex2RTF utility for maintaining online and printed manuals
   +   Tree layout, graph layout, charting and grid classes

       Borland 3.1/4.x/5.x, Symantec C++, Watcom C++ (WIN32 only),
       GNU-WIN32
   +   Most UNIX compilers, including GCC

 Platforms supported

   +   All MS Windows variants
   +   Most if not all UNIX variants, including Linux, Solaris 1.x,
       Solaris 2.x, HP/UX, SGI IRIX, OSF/1, IBM AIX
   +   VAX/VMS (partial support)
   +   Mac (68K and PPC) port in progress, with alphas available

 Weaknesses

   To avoid disappointment, it should be pointed out that wxWindows may
   not be suitable for everyone. It contains a few bugs and some ugly
   code, unlike any commercial equivalent :-); it does not have the
   slickness or coverage of a tool like Microsoft's MFC; and you may not
   agree with the compromises made for portability. On the other hand,
   it is in a state of continuous development and improvement. 

   Some changes may need to be made for specific platforms, although
   most compilers and UNIXes are now catered for. And wxWindows does
   produce large executables and increase compilation time, although
   there are strategies for minimizing these problems, depending on
   brand of compiler and operating system: see the FAQ. 

 Where to get it

   wxWindows is currently available from the Artificial Intelligence
   Applications Institute by anonymous FTP. 
 
   + FTP to one of:

       ftp.aiai.ed.ac.uk/pub/packages/wxwin    (UK)
       ftp.mapsy.nat.tu-bs.de/pub/mirror/wxwin (Germany)
       silr.ireste.fr/pub/mirror/wxwin         (France)
       senna.eng.monash.edu.au/pub/wxwin       (Australia)

   + log on as `anonymous', and give your user ID as password

   + Change directory into /pub/packages/wxwin/1.67, (unix or mswin
     subdirectories), change transmission method to binary, and
     get wx167*.tar.gz (UNIX) and/or setup.* (PC)

   + Get install.txt.

   + For automated installation under UNIX, get wxinstal.

   + Get the WinHelp, PostScript or HTML documentation required
     (the PC distribution contains the WinHelp files already).

   + Both archives contain the source code for both platforms.

 Installation

   See install.txt and the installation script wxinstal.
   Note that the local HTML documentation can be accessed from
   docs/html/index.htm.

 Bugs and an exhortation

   wxWindows, like most other software, has the occasional buglet
   (bugs.txt contains a list of some of them). I would be grateful for
   bug reports (even better, fixes) though I can't guarantee to integrate
   them.  Meanwhile, please do join the growing wxWindows community: it's
   fun, and it's going places. The more contributors, the stronger
   the chances that it will be the best toolkit of its type within
   the next year or so.

 wxWindows discussion forum

   There are discussion and announcements mailing lists for users or
   potential users of wxWindows.
   
   Mail one of the following addresses to subscribe to the relevant list.
   These lists are automated. Send a message with the message body:

   subscribe which-list [your-mail-address]

   or

   unsubscribe which-list [your-mail-address]

   where which-list is wxwin-users or wxwin-announce, and your-mail-address
   is your regular email address if you need to specify it explicitly. To
   get help on the syntax, send a message with 'help' in the message body.

   If there is a problem, please mail Timothy Peters (tim.peters@nene.ac.uk).

   wxwin-users-request@babbage.eng.nene.ac.uk
   - to subscribe to wxwin-users discussion list

   wxwin-announce-request@babbage.eng.nene.ac.uk
   - to subscribe to wxwin-announce mailing list
   
   General discussions take place on wxwin-users; wxwin-announce is for
   people preferring lower bandwidth, and I will always send announcements
   to wxwin-users as well as wxwin-announce.  So there's not usually a need
   to subscribe to both.
