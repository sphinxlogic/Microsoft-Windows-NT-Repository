wxWindows Bug and To Do List
----------------------------

######################### BUGS ##########################


19/4/93 Version 1.40 (First version for Motif)
----------------------------------------------

-- Haven't sorted out how to set default buttons without
   messing up tab traversal.

-- Probably need to set scrollbars to force an initial paint,
   or call wxCanvas::SetSize. If you set the scrollbars,
   it works fine.

-- No default colours. Works ok on monochrome though...

-- Too many repaint messages sent sometimes.

7/9/93 Version 1.50
-------------------

-- Programmatic setting of multiple selections listboxes doesn't work
   (Motif 1.1).

-- Canvas doesn't work under Motif 1.2.

-- Colourmap still only producing a small number of colours - FIXED (was
   using too small values for RGB values)

-- PostScript driver leaves something to be desired (espec. for
   Landscape mode).

-- Windows 3.1 canvas scrolling problem with large scale factor or some
   mapping modes: leaves streaks behind. Could be a rounding error with
   SetViewport...?

-- XView: closing of dialog boxes from the Window Manager not handled
   properly

16/11/93 Version 1.50 beta (h)
------------------------------

-- Motif 1.2.1 support added, but this bug (at least) remains: setting
   panel size doesn't seem to return correct size if there are panel
   items. So a Fit on a panel then a surrounding frame doesn't work
   properly. WORKAROUND: make frame and panel very big before placing
   items.

-- Status line in Motif doesn't show separate regions for > 1 region.

-- No PostScript DrawArc, or documentation for it.

16/11/93 Version 1.50 beta (i)
------------------------------

-- Motif: listbox gets smaller when you add 1 or more items to it.
   WORKAROUND: Set the listbox size after appending, e.g.
   SetSize(-1, -1, 100 100)

-- Motif: Technicolour appears after a while on a canvas (HP only?)

-- Motif: XORing doesn't seem to work in colour

-- Panel-in-panel doesn't work for wxABSOLUTE_POSITIONING panels
   (Motif) or XView (at all)

-- In Windows, CTL3D and Fafa library seem to conflict (some items don't
   appear on a panel if both are in operation). SOLUTION: I probably
   didn't include the fafa.rc file. This should make it work...


17/1/94 Version 1.50 beta (j)
-----------------------------

-- In beta (i), users found that buttons in Motif were random
   sizes. Something to do with using gadgets??

-- Cured bad MDI bug that crashed application (and Windows) on exit.

-- Cured XView wxPanel::Fit bug.

-- wxFrame::Fit() doesn't seems to work for an MDI frame that is
   iconized. It has to be displayed first, which leads to messy
   screen redraws. Ugh. Is this a Windows problem, or wxWindows?
   I suspect the former.

17/10/94 Version 1.60
---------------------

-- PopupMenu doesn't always work under Motif, for some reason.
   The workaround is to use FakePopupMenu.

-- Dialog box destruction isn't always vetoed when it should be
   under XView (Motif?)

-- Frames don't always position properly (some interaction with
   window managers?)

-- wxGetFirst/NextFile not implemented for Borland or NT

-- wxHelp and hyText refreshing is BAD, especially under Motif
   when sometimes the text doesn't appear at all.

-- Under Motif, listboxes sometimes change size mysteriously.
   Cured (I think) in 1.62.


June 1995 version 1.62
----------------------

-- OnSize events not sent in a consistent order across platforms.

-- When loading BMP or GIF into wxBitmap in X, depth not set.

-- wxbWindow::GetConstraints() (called by DeleteRelatedConstraints()
   and wxIndividualLayoutConstraint::ResetIfWin()) refer to windows
   that have been deleted.  Perhaps windows are not always
   removed from the constraintsInvolvedIn list when deleted?
   CURED IN 1.65.

-- There still seems to be an interaction between GCC, wxWindows
   and Motif under HPUX, where the file selector causes a core
   dump. SEE FAQ FOR FIX.

-- wxCheckBox (and probably wxRadioBox) behave wrong under Motif:
   setting the value programmatically causes the callback to
   be invoked. This should be suppressed.

-- Under Windows, wxWin crashes when GDI resources run out (insufficient
   checks for GDI function failures).

-- wxDebugMsg doesn't seem to work under WIN32s if the format string is
   complex (gives bizarre characters). Workaround: pass pure strings
   with no formatting (use e.g. sprintf instead).
 
December 1995 1.65
------------------

-- Cannot persuade XView to refresh dialog boxes properly: in the
   Dialog Editor, handles are not redrawn when the dialog is refreshed,
   although they *are* drawn when not within a window-manager-originated
   OnPaint call.

-- For the above reason and others, Dialog Editor does not work for
   XView.

-- OnSet/KillFocus may not work for wxText in Motif.

-- XView (and possibly Motif) version of the wxChart library crashes the
   X server. Probably some incorrect values are being passed to drawing
   primitives, which work OK under Windows but not under X.

-- Panel item text and background colouring is better under Windows than it was, but
   not recently tested under Motif. Colouring doesn't work for wxButton under
   Windows for some reason, and I don't know how to alter the foreground
   colour for panel items under Windows.
   There's confusion over what wxPanel::SetBackgroundColour and
   wxItem::SetBackgroundColour should do (should the former set the
   default for the latter? Not according to e.g. wxButton::ChangeColor).
   Similarly for SetButtonColour: button or font colour?

-- Programmatic scrollbars in Windows don't quite behave
   right: they don't always scroll to full extent.
   
-- Modal dialogs don't behave themselves well in XView, still
   (do XView bug fixes help?) E.g. samples/dialogs.cc shows
   choice items not working. So wxColourDialog and wxFontDialog
   don't work in XView.
   
-- wxItem::OnEvent returns slightly wrong mouse coordinates for
   Motif: must be normalized to take into account position of item
   widget on its form widget.
   
-- wxResourceTable, wxItemResource, wxStaticItem, wxSizer and
   derivatives not documented.
   
-- I recently realized that there was a bug in the way I calculate
   font point sizes under MS Windows. This results in fonts that
   are the wrong size, compared with point sizes in other applications
   and most annoyingly, the Windows font selector common dialog.
   Ironically, the bug allowed good font matching between X and
   Windows, but when the bug is corrected, fonts of a given size show
   up differently between X and Windows. So at present you can either
   have fonts that are consistent between platforms, or ones that
   are consistent with other Windows applications, but not both.
   Set FONT_SIZE_COMPATIBILITY to 1 for compatibility with previous
   version of wxWindows, to 0 for compatibility with other Windows apps
   (especially if you will be using the Windows font selector dialog).
   
-- wxTextWindow::GetLastPosition appears not to work in WIN32 (Watcom),
   although it does for WIN16.
   
January 1997 1.66F
------------------

-- Popup menu bug in Motif now fixed by Torsten Schmale.
