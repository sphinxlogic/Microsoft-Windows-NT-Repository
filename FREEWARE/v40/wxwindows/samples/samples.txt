-----------------

animate         A 3D rotating cube.

bombs           Minesweeper game, by Pasquale Foggia.

buttnbar        Button bar (Windows only). This is demonstrates the
                Windows-optimized version of wxToolBar.

docview         Demonstrates the document/view framework. Pass the flag
                -single for single window mode, -mdi for MDI mode, -sdi
                for multiple unconstrained windows.

dialogs         Checks out the wxFontDialog and wxColourDialogs.
                Hopefully more common dialogs and tests will be added
                over time.

form            A wxForm demo.

forty           A version of the card game 'Forty Thieves', by
                Chris Breeze

fractal         Fractal mountains.

hello           A fairly complex canvas, text window and panel
                demonstration. This is usually a good test of a
                wxWindows installation.

ipc             Interprocess communication demo. Start server and then
                client. Click on the server's listbox to notify the
                client; or pick items from the client's menubar.

layout          Shows off the constraint-based layout system. Subwindows
                and panel items are constrained in size and position
                relative to siblings or parent.

mfc             Shows how Microsoft Foundation Classes and wxWindows
                can coexist in the same application.

mdi             MDI demo (most appropriate to Windows). Start with
                -mdi or -sdi to show different modes of operation.

memcheck        Demonstrates memory checking and object dumping. You
                need to compile both wxWindows and this sample in DEBUG
                mode, i.e. passing DEBUG=1 to the makefiles.

minimal         A very small (minimal) wxWindows program.

odbc            ODBC sample (Windows only). You must edit
                wx/include/base/wx_setup.h
                and set USE_ODBC to 1 before recompiling. You also
                need to have odbc.dll, sql.h and sqlext.h. ODBC binaries
                come with products such as MS Office; but the headers
                must be purchased with the ODBC SDK.

panel           Shows drawing on a panel. A marbled background is drawn,
                with a gauge that is incremented by pressing either of
                two buttons.

printing        Demonstrates the print/preview framework.

pressup         Sample board game, demonstrating canvas input and output.

resource        Demonstrates use of resource files (.wxr).

splitter        Demonstrates use of the wxSplitterWindow class.

static          Demonstrates undocumented static panel items.
                Beware: not fully debugged.

toolbar         Shows the generic wxToolBar class in use. See also buttnbar.

types           Tests wxDate, wxTime and wxFraction classes.

vlist           Demonstrates an undocumented virtual listbox implementation.
                Beware: not fully debugged.
            
wxpoem          wxPoem: a poetry display program, with a selection of poems.
