Installing PROLOGIO
-------------------

PROLOGIO is used in wxWindows for reading .wxr resource files
(optional) and for compiling wxBuilder (also optional). The PROLOGIO
source is in utils/prologio/src.

UNIX compilation
----------------

Ensure that YACC and LEX or FLEX are on your system. Check that
the makefile uses the correct programs: a common error is to compile
y_tab.c with a C++ compiler. Edit the CCLEX variable in make.env
to specify a C compiler. Also, do not attempt to compile lex_yy.c
since it is included by y_tab.c.

DOS compilation
---------------

The simplest thing is to copy dosyacc.c to y_tab.c, and doslex.c to
lex_yy.c. It is y_tab.c that must be compiled (lex_yy.c is included by
y_tab.c) so if adding source files to a project file, ONLY add y_tab.c
plus the .cc files. If you wish to alter the parser, you will need YACC
and FLEX on DOS.

The DOS tools are available at the AIAI ftp site, in the tools directory. Note that
for FLEX installation, you need to copy flex.skl into the directory
c:/lib.

If you are using Borland C++ and wish to regenerate lex_yy.c and y_tab.c
(supplied for you as doslex.c and dosyacc.c), you need to generate
lex_yy.c with FLEX and then comment out the 'malloc' and 'free'
prototypes in lex_yy.c. It will compile with lots of warnings. If you
get an undefined _PROIO_YYWRAP symbol when you link, you need to remove
USE_DEFINE from the makefile and recompile. This is because the parser.y
file has a choice of defining this symbol as a function or as a #define,
depending on what the version of FLEX expects. See the bottom of
parser.y, and if necessary edit it to make it compile in the opposite
way to the current compilation.

Testing PROLOGIO
----------------

To test out PROLOGIO, compile the test program (test.exe), find
badcase.txt in the docs directory, and try loading it into the test
program. Then save it to another file. If the second is identical to the
first, PROLOGIO is in a working state.
