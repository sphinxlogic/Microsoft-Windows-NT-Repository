This manual describes a graph layout class library for wxWindows. It is
an encapsulation of the main code from Jos van Eijndhoven's graphplace
tool which he has distributed to the net.

\helponly{Below is the example graph generated by the program test.cc.

Sorry, the documentation for wxGraphLayout is sparse at present, but
see the class reference and the test program. Here is the message from Jos
introducing his original graphplace tool:

{\it
We are using in our group a locally developed graph placement and drawing
program, which was noticed as being very nice by several visitors.
The program was made as general applicable tool,
and indeed quickly gained use in several very different applications.
Therefore we decided to make it available to all of you...

In general it will try to find a placement with 'short' edges, and in a
'breath-first-search' (sorted on level) order. The program works for any
graph (also cyclic or not fully connected). The placement algorithm is a
very fast linear-time heuristic, which often gives surprisingly nice
results.

If you are interested, you can fetch the program from 'ftp.es.ele.tue.nl'
as 'pub/down/graphplace.tar.Z'.
