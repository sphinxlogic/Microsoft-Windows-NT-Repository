\winhelponly{\center{{\bf wxChartLayout, by Neil Dudman.\\Version 1.0}}\\}

This manual describes a chart drawing class library for wxWindows.  It
provides the start of a graphing tool; currently wxChartLayout supports
the layout of bar, line, area, curve floating bar, percent bar, pie,
xyplot. There are a number of user definable options to minor and major
tickmarks, 3D display (bars only) etc. Multiple datasets may be defined
per chart, each of which may have different display types. 

wxChartLayout is an abstract class that must be subclassed. The programmer
defines various member functions which will access whatever data structures
are appropriate for the application, and wxChartLayout uses these when laying
out the chart.

wxStoredBarLineChart is a class derived from wxChartLayout that may be
used directly to draw data in a chart on a canvas. It supplies storage
for the data in a two dimensional array and draws to a device context of
the Canvas passed to the constructor function. 

Below are  the example charts generated by the program test.cc.

\chapter{The Test Program}

The test program included with the chart library uses the shapes code
written by Julian Smart as part of wxBuilder and allows the chart to be
resized and moved by selecting the object and dragging the corners. The
right mouse button may also be used to bring up a simple frame where
various settings of the graph may be changed (not yet complete). 

All the types of charts that the libarary supports have been added to
the test program as seperate datasets. It is posible to turn off various
datasets by checking various menu options.

Include the file {\tt lbchart.h} in your source, and link with the
libary {\tt wxchart.lib} (Windows) or {\tt libwxchart.a} (UNIX).
