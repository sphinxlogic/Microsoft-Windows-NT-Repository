wxWindows installation utility
------------------------------

This is a simple installation utility written to help
authors of wxWindows programs to distribute their software.

The utility runs ONLY UNDER WINDOWS, because it is written
using the native Windows API. This is because wxWindows
programs tend to be quite large, and two wxWindows
programs are unlikely to fit on a standard
1.44MB floppy.

Over time, it is hoped that installation utilities will be
written for other platforms, again in their native
API for size reasons.

Please read the manual for further details.
