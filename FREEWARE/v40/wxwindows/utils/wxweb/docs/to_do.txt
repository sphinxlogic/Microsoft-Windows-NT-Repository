1) Transparent GIFs for X Windows.

2) PNG for X Windows.

3) JPEG for X (had a look at the new wximage_lug
library, but unfortunately it's GIF support is way
behind the old library, so it's either GIFs or JPEG
and GIFs win for now).

4) GIF animations all platforms.

7) Implement file upload protocol.

8) Move authentication stuff into the server (from
CGI example).

9) Get tables working properly.
