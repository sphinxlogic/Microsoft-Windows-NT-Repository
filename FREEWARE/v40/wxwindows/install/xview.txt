======== Use At Your Own Risk================================
For wxWindows to work correctly under SunOS 4.1.x (OpenWindows
3.0) you must either install Sun's jumbo XView patch or build
XView 3.2. All other systems (eg Linux) must have XView 3.2
installed.
In addition, for modal dialogs to work properly, you need to link
your applications with xvwinlp.o.
Since the effect of the modified xvwinlp.o on other XView
applications is unknown it has NOT been included in the XView
3.2 patch for SunOS.
  1) SunOS 4.1.x (OpenWindows 3.0)
	i) Sun Patch 100452-61 or newer is required (RECOMENDED)
     OR
	ii) Or XView 3.2. A modification of XView 3.2 IS REQUIRED
	   if one wishes to replace the XView 3.0 or 3.1
	   shared libraries with a XView 3.2 shared library.
	   The calling convention for application startup is
	   different and applications compiled with XView 3.0
	   will NOT work correctly with the standard XView 3.2
	   shared library.

           Building XView 3.2 under SunOS 4.1.x:
	  (a) Get XView 3.2 from your favorite depot
	  (b) Apply patch xviewez.p
	  (c) Make
	  (d) Move the old libview.so
	  (e) Install libxview.so
	  (f) Remember to run ldconfig to rebuild the link cache!

  2) On other platforms ensure you have XView 3.2.
  3) Edit wx/src/make.env so that BOTH xvwinlp.o and sb_scrol.o
     are (staticaly) linked in to your application.
