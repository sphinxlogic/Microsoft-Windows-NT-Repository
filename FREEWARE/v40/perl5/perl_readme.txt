This directory contains the current release of Larry Wall's Perl language.
At present, it contains these files:

  Perl5_nnn.Zip         - the official release of Perl, version 5,
                          patchlevel nnn

  Perl5_nnn_yymmddx.Zip - Perl5_nnn.Zip, with working changes by the VMS
                          perl porting group.  This ZIP file is intended
                          to help developers and testers keep in sync,
                          and may contain untested patches to perl.
                          Feel free to grab it and play with it, but know
                          that it's not as stable as the production
                          release.

  [.Perl5_000...]       - the expanded version of Perl5_nnn_yymmddx.Zip,
                          for use by those who want to pick up just one
                          or two changed files.

The ZIP files have been generated by a version Zip which embeds VMS file
attributes in the ZIP file.  In order to unpack them, you'll need to use
a version of UnZip which understands these attributes; any version >=5.0
should work.  Both UnZip.Exe and the full UnZip distribution (UnZip.Zip)
are available here for anonymous ftp in the [.Util.VMS.Archive] directory.
