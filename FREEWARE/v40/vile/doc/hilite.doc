Subject: syntax hiliting 
 
now that the latest patch is out, i can forward you guys this syntax 
hiliting perl library i have been using for some time.  
 
the library utilizes the concept of syntax definitions where in the user 
defines the syntax for each different language - like the keywords, 
identifiers, types, varibales, constructs, constants, comments, etc. 
the library then uses the majormode to decide which syntax definition to 
use and hilites the file accordingly using a common hiliting procedure. 
 
the library includes examples for perl, tcl and c languages. 
 
optionally, one can define the hiliting procedure rather than using the 
builtin one (example for "mailmode" included). 
 
the following two lines need to be added to .vilerc 
 
---------------------------------------- 
perl "Vile::register 'synon', 'synon', 'Syntax Hilighting, do', 'syntax.pl'" 
perl "Vile::register 'synoff', 'synoff', 'Syntax Hilighting, undo', 'syntax.pl'" 
---------------------------------------- 
 
this way :synon turns on hiliting and :synoff turns off hiliting. 
 
also put the attached files in your ~/.vile/perl directory. 
 
warning: be warned that the hiliting is a little slow, and not 100% 
robust. it is not as clean as vim's :-( due to the simplistic approach. 
but maybe with a concept of "contained" it can be improved.
