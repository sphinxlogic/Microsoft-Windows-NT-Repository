VILE, UTILITIES, VI-LIKE-EMACS text editor
vile is a text editor which is extremely compatible with vi in terms of
"finger feel".  In addition, it has extended capabilities in many areas,
notably multi-file editing and viewing, key rebinding, and real X window
system support.

Version 5.4 appeared on the second OpenVms Freeware CDROM.  Version 6.1,
which appeared on the third Freeware CDROM upgraded the source to ANSI C
(from extended C).

Version 8.2 (this version) adds support for user-definable modes and
makes procedures executable just like the builtin commands.  The
minibuffer (aka the ex command line) is editable with vi-style commands.
As usual, there are lots of bug fixes.

The authors of vile are Tom Dickey (current maintainer), Paul Fox, Kevin
Buettner and Rick Sladkey.
