
    This file describes how the various AppLst button callbacks are to handle
    user input. This is an alphabetical list of the buttons and what
    they are to perform, plus a semi-detailed description of
    calls and events for each AppLst operation.

  'Add' button

    The Add button is set sensitive AFTER characters have been entered into
    BOTH the 'Application Name' and 'Application Command' text boxes.
    The callback routines for the above text boxes are relatively stupid
    in that they look for a string length of greater than zero in each
    textbox. It is the job of later routines to verify validity of these 
    strings.
    The Add button will check for the existance of the Command File and,
    if, that file is valid, will add the 'Application Name' and 
    'Application Command' to the ApsLst, AppName, and AppCmd allocated
    command structures. The Minism Application List will not be changed.


  'Remove' button

    The Remove button is set sensitive AFTER MB1 selects a current item from
    the 'Application List' listbox.
    The Remove button will remove the 'Application Name' and 'Application
    Command' from the ApsLst, AppName, and AppCmd allocated command
    structures. The Minism Application List will not be changed.


  'Cancel' button

    The Cancel button is used to:
        1) Unrealize the Application Definitions popup when inadvertantly
           selected from the file menu.
        2) Unrealize the Application Definitions popup after an Add or
           Remove operation has been performed and the user does not wish
           to immediately have the main window application list reflect
           those changes. 
    Following and Add/Remove operation, the Cancel button will not undo
    the operations performed, however, if the user attempts to exit MiniSm
    without saving changes made by Add/Remove operations, a warning popup
    appears once to remind them changes have been made.


  'Apply' button

    The Apply button is not set to be sensitive UNLESS either the 'Add' 
    or the 'Remove' button has been selected. Assuming the above is true,
    the Apply button's function is to invoke the changes to the MiniSm 
    main window's 'Applications' list box. This is accomplished by redefining
    the address of the AscAppsList structure, which is performed only by 
    utilization of the 'Apply' or the 'OK' buttons.


  'OK' button

    The OK button is not set to be sensitive UNLESS either the 'Add' or the
    'Remove' button has been selected. Assuming the above is true, the 
    OK button's function is to invoke the changes to the MiniSm main window's 
    'Applications' list box. This is accomplished by redefining the address
    of the AscAppsList structure, which is performed only by utilization of
    the 'Apply' or the 'OK' buttons.
    The ONLY diference of the 'Apply' and the 'OK' buttons is that the
    Apply' invokes the above actions and leaves the AppLst Dialog box
    in the managed (visible) state, while the OK' button invokes the above 
    actions and unmanages the AppLst Dialog box (removing visibiility).
