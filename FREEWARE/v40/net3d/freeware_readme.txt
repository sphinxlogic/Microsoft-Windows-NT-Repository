NET3D, GAMES, A networked multiplayer 3d combat game.  Version 0.08

This is version 0.08 of net3d, a simple multiplayer game written for
Unix and X11. At the moment, I have only successfully tested net3d on
the following systems -

        Ultrix 4.4 / 4.3        (DECstation)
        OSF/1                   (DEC Alpha)
        HP-UX
        SunOS
        Solaris                 (Sun Sparc Classic)
        Irix 5.2                (SGI)

==> And now OpenVMS !!

If you are using either of the above, then it should work. As for
anything else... if you get it to compile and run then tell me about it,
and any changes / bug fixes needed to get it up and running.
