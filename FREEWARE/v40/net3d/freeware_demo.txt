Net3D V 0.08 port under OpenVMS    March 1995
===============================

You can run NET3D via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure

Controls for the vehicle you are piloting will be displayed before the 
game starts, and are by default something like :

rotate left              - left    rotate right             - right
accellerate              - up      decellerate              - down
climb                    - a       dive                     - z
halt                     - s
gun left                 - o       gun right                - p
gun up                   - j       gun down                 - i
fire                     - return  lock on                  - l
eject                    - j
quit                     - q
wireframe toggle         - w       build menu toggle        - b

long range view              - 1  view from stationary point   - 2
view from behind vehicle     - 3  inside view                  - 4
above view                   - 5  turret view                  - 6
short range view             - 7  missile view                 - 8
interesting thing view       - 9

Not all controls will be appropriate for all vehicles. For example, a
vehicle like a tank (in tank.v) cannot fly, so the climb and dive keys
have no effect. Similarly, in a vehicle with no separate gun turret,
the keys for contolling the turret won't do anything.

Using the controls, you can fly or drive a vehicle around the game
world. Most objects in the game, including the hills, will cause damage
if your vehicle hits them. Also, other computer controlled vehicles may
open fire on you or accidentally collide with you.



Sources are available under [.SRC] directory in NET3D-008.ZIP file



Under OpenVMS, vehicules and scenery files are not pre-processed at run time
but once with:

$ CC/DECC/PREPROC=FILE.I  FILE.V

command. The .I files generated are used by either
client or server at run time, without using pipe and fork mechanisms but by a
direct read.

Warning: you need to delete all comment lines generated by CC/DECC/PREPROC,
net3d's parser don't like them !!

NOTA: Preprocessed file are provided in this kit, with all the .V and .DEF_V 
files.

You need to define NET3D_DIR logical pointing on the location of .I files

The client runs well in single user mode (without server) or in client mode
with a pre-launched server. However, under VMS the server can only run with 
a fixed number of clients (you can define this number at compile time with 
VMS_PLAYERS define). 

You need DEC C to compile this program.

Example of single-user run:

$ net3d map.i tank.i
