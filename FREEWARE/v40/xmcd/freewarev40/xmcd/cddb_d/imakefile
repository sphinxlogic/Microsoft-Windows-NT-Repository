 * -DBSDCOMPAT
 *	Compiling under BSD-derived or BSD-like OS

 * -DNO_STDLIB_H
 *	The system does not support <stdlib.h>
 *
 * -DNOREMOTE
 *	Build libcddb without the remote (Internet) CD database support
 *
 * -DSOCKS
 *	Define this if your network requires that clients such as
 *	xmcd/cda to be SOCKSified in order to access a remote CD database.
 *	You will also have to change to link the application with the
 *	socks library instead of the standard socket library.
 *
 * -DSYNCHRONOUS
 *	Disable asynchrnous handling of X events while waiting for I/O.
 *	This should be used if the select() call on your system cannot
 *	be used to wait on non-socket file descriptors.
