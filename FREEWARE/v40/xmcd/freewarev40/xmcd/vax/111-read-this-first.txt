Welcome to xmcd v2.4 !

This is a pre-compiled binary kit of xmcd v2.4, compiled on a VAX system 
running VMS 7.1. This kit is expected to run on other VAX VMS 7.0 and 
later systems. It may also work on VMS 6.2.  
This kit will not work on AXP machines. If you want xmcd on an AXP, you 
need to compile the sources following the hints given there.

Please note that this binary was compiled without the socket support
code.  This means that it will not be able to connect to Internet
CDDB servers.  If your system has TCP/IP and Internet connectivity,
and you want xmcd to query CDDB servers for CD information, then you
need to recompile xmcd from the sources with socket support.  See the
INSTALL.VMS file in the source code distribution for details.


Here are instructions to install the pre-compiled binary kit on your VAX.

1 - Edit XMCD.DAT, and find the line:

      XMcd.libdir:                    KIDDY$DKA0:[XMCD

    Replace   KIDDY$DKA0:[XMCD   with your local disk and directory names
    where your copy of xmcd resides, e.g., MYVAX$DKB500:[FREE.XMCD
    The missing "]" is _NOT_ a typo.

    Now find the lines:

      XMcd.cddbMailSite:              SMTP%"""cddb-submit@submit.cddb.com"""
      XMcd.cddbMailCmd:               MAILL/SUBJECT="%S" %F %A

    and check whether your mailer will cope with this syntax.
    If it doesn't, change it the way you need it. The "magic tokens" 
    are explained in xmcd.dat.

    Save and exit xmcd.dat.

2 - $ COPY XMCD.DAT SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER]

3 - $ RENAME COMMON.CFG-KIDDY COMMON.CFG-your_node's_name

      Where your_node's_name is what you get with
      $ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$GETSYI("NODENAME")

    If your node does not have a name:

    $ RENAME COMMON.CFG-KIDDY COMMON.CFG

4 - Edit COMMON.CFG(-your_node's_name), and find the line:

        device:                 kiddy$dkb100:
     
     Change kiddy$dkb100: to the name of the CD drive you want use 
     with xmcd, e.g., DKA100: or MYVAX$DKA100: respectively.

    Save and exit file.

5 - $ RENAME DEVICE.CFG-KIDDY DEVICE.CFG-your_node's_name

    If your node does not have a name:

    $ RENAME DEVICE.CFG-KIDDY DEVICE.CFG

6 - Edit DEVICE.CFG(-your_node's_name), and find the line:

       deviceList:             kiddy$dkb100:
     
     Change kiddy$dkb100: to the name of the CD drive you want use 
     with xmcd, e.g., DKA100: or MYVAX$DKA100: respectively.

    Check the drive settings in this file to comply with your CD drive.
    If they don't, change them so that they will match your drive's
    capabilities.

    Save and exit file.

7 - If you want xmcd to drive a web browser refer to section 8 of
    INSTALL.VMS in the [.docs] directory or execute INSTWEB.COM

    I'd recommend to read section 8 first, this will explain what
    INSTWEB.COM does.

8 - You are done.  To start xmcd, just:

    $ RUN XMCD
