CHANGE HISTORY
--------------

Ver 2.4 patchlevel 0 released Tue Oct 27 22:30:43 PST 1998
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:
    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	NEC CDR-1910
	Nakamichi MJ-5.16s
	Regal CDC-4X
	Teac CD-532S

    - Added support for the following non-SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	Acer CD-632A, CD-636A, CD-640A
	Goldstar CRD-8240, CRD-8241, RCD-G540,
	Mitsumi FX-320S
	Nakamichi MJ-5.16
	NEC CDR-1800, CDR-1900
	Panasonic CR-572
	Samsung SCR-2430, SCR-3230
	Sony CDU-611, CDU-701, CDU-711
	Teac CD-532E
	Toshiba XM-6202, XM-6320

OS Support changes:
    - Added support for FreeBSD 3.x which now uses the CAM mechanism
      for SCSI pass-through rather than the SCIOCCOMMAND ioctl interface
      that was in FreeBSD 2.x.

    - For Linux, the SCSI medium changer support was making the wrong
      assumption that the /dev/sg* (SCSI Generic) device was a block
      device.  This is now fixed.

    - Fixes for Solaris 2.x systems running the Volume Manager (vold):
      *	Change to prevent xmcd and cda from exiting with a fatal error
	when a data CD is loaded into the drive.
      *	The xmcd and cda eject function will be inhibited when a data CD
	is mounted and busy.
      *	If a CD is removed via the eject(1) command, xmcd and cda will
	no longer hang until a CD is reinserted.

    - The wwwWarp feature is now functional on OpenVMS.  Added the
      instweb.com and vmswrap.com command procedures.  See the
      INSTALL.VMS file for details.

    - Xmcd/cda has been now been successfully tested on the Linux-alpha
      platform without need for modifications.

Misc changes:
    - A new cddbRemoteDisable parameter is added to the common.cfg file.
      When set to True, xmcd and cda will inhibit remote CDDB server
      queries, even if they are configured in the cddbPath list.

    - The xmcd "CDDB/Program" subwindow now has a "Disable remote" button
      that allows the user to disable/enable remote CDDB queries.  The
      start-up state is set by the cddbRemoteDisable parameter.

    - The xmcd "Track Extended Information" window now has an "Auto-track"
      toggle button.  When enabled, the information displayed in this
      window will follow the currently playing track.

    - Added a new XMcd.modeChangeGravity X resource.  When switching
      between the normal and basic modes, this resource lets the
      user choose which part of the xmcd window to remain fixed in its
      location (any of the edges, corners, or the center).  See the
      comments in the XMcd.ad file for details.

    - When using the xmcd Direct Access Keypad window to change disc or
      track, a dialog box will now pop-up to ask if the shuffle or program
      mode should be disabled when such modes would become invalid upon
      the change.  Also, using the keypad to change discs on a CD changer
      did not work if the current slot is empty.  This has been fixed.

    - During startup, when xmcd and cda loads the common configuration
      files in XMCDLIB and $HOME/.xmcdcfg, the file common.cfg-HOSTNAME
      (e.g., common.cfg-snoopy) will now be tried first, and if it doesn't
      exist, then try the standard common.cfg file.  The device-specific
      configuration file is now also handled similarly, where DEVICE-HOSTNAME
      (e.g., rcd0-snoopy) will be tried first, then rcd0.  This is useful
      if the XMCDLIB directory or the user's home directory is on an
      NFS-shared directory and must support xmcd/cda on multiple hosts.
      The config.sh script now sets up a symbolic link for each of these
      files.

    - Added tool-tip support to the xmcd main window status indicators.

    - Xmcd's help system was looking in the wrong directory for the
      documentation files, if XMCD_LIBDIR environment variable was used
      to override the XMcd.libdir resource.  This is now fixed.

    - Fixed a sporadic xmcd hang when the wwwWarp feature is invoked to
      search Internet web sites.

    - In xmcd, if a CD database "Save" operation fails, reset the music
      category, so that the user can try saving to a different category.

    - If the xmcd "Track Extended Information" window is open and the user
      clicks "Save" to save the CD database entry, the track arrow buttons
      in the Track Extended Information window stops working until the
      user re-selects a track from the main track list.  This is now fixed.

    - Changed the config.sh script to work around a shell bug under HP-UX.

    - If insertPollDisable is set to True, and a new CD is loaded in
      the drive, xmcd would incorrectly enter pause mode if the "play"
      button is clicked, or if the playOnLoad feature is enabled.  This
      is now fixed.

    - If cddbRemoteAutoSave is enabled, and no local CDDB directory exists
      that match the remote CDDB category, then just save the entry to the
      first local directory in the cddbPath.

    - In config.sh, when configuring a SCSI medium changer device, the
      medium changer device node is now checked to make sure it's a
      character device special file.

    - The xmcd wwwWarp search function has a change to the semantics of
      the %T ot %t token (for the action parameter in the name-to-action
      mappings).  See the comments in the common.cfg file for details.
      The xmcd online help information for the search engine selector has
      also been updated to take this into account.

    - The xmcd wwwWarp built-in URL-encoding scheme has been modified
      to be more conformant to standards.

    - Added HTTP/1.1 proxy-authorization support and SOCKS firewall
      support to the cddbcmd utility.

    - Changed the HTTP mode "User-agent" MIME line to be more compatible
      with certain proxy servers.

    - The cda visual mode now supports the PageUp, ctrl-U and ctrl-B keys 
      to scroll up one screen, as well as the PageDown, ctrl-D and ctrl-F
      keys to scroll down one screen.

    - Added a DiscPlay-to-Xmcd CD database file format convertor utility
      (dp2xmcd) to the distribution.  DiscPlay is a Win32-based CD player
      utility from Obvion Systems.

    - The install.sh script now accepts a -b command line option.  When
      the -b option is used, the installation script will run in batch
      mode that requires no user input.  Built-in default answers are
      used for all prompts.  The default answers can be overridden with
      environment variables.  See the comments in the install.sh file
      for details.  Note that when run in batch mode, install.sh will
      not run the config.sh script to set up the configuration.  Thus,
      the user must run XMCDLIB/config/config.sh after installation,
      before running xmcd/cda for the first time.

    - The install.sh script now will look for old installations of xmcd
      executable binaries in various directories.  If found, it will
      ask the user whether to remove them.  In batch mode, these files
      are silently cleaned.

    - Other fixes and clean-ups.


Ver 2.3 patchlevel 0 released Fri May 22 23:08:44 PDT 1998
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:
    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	NEC CDR-1810
	Plextor PX-32C
	Toshiba XM-6201

    - Added support for the following non-SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	Tatung CD-1216E

    - Disable volume/balance/channel routing settings for the Toshiba
      XM-3801, XM-5701 and XM-5901 drives.  These drives do not have the
      hardware internally to support these features.

    - Fixed a bug in the old SCSI-1 NEC drive support code that was
      preventing these drives from playing properly.

OS Support changes:
    - Added support for the UNIX System V Release 5 (SCO UnixWare 7)
      and HP-UX 11.x platforms.

    - ATAPI drives are now supported on the BSDI BSD/OS 3.x platform.
      This is done using the SCSI-emulation driver in BSD/OS (must
      use the /dev/rsr* device).

    - Xmcd/cda now runs on Digital UNIX 4.0B.  A workaround has been
      added to address a bug in DU 4.0B's SCSI driver which was
      causing xmcd/cda to fail to open the CD-ROM device.  This was
      also causing subsequent access to the drive to be blocked
      until reboot.  Also, the caddyLockSupport parameter is now
      True by default with ATAPI drives on Digital UNIX.

    - Apply some fixes for the Siemens Pyramid Reliant UNIX (SINIX)
      5.43 platforms.

    - Fixes to make xmcd and cda compile/run under the latest versions
      of glibc (GNU libc).  The built-in basename() function in xmcd
      was conflicting with a function of the same name in glibc.

    - Some portability fixes for the Digital OpenVMS platform.

Misc changes:
    - Xmcd is now web-savvy with "wwwWarp".  wwwWarp allows xmcd to access
      the world wide web by remote-controlling an external browser.  You
      may browse the official xmcd and CDDB web sites, browse music
      reviews, do keyword searches on the CDDB search engine, or search
      the web about the currently loaded CD title.  A number of pre-
      configured web search engines can be selected via a pop-up menu.
      wwwWarp is activated via the "Web..." button on the CDDB/Program
      subwindow.

      Currently, wwwWarp supports Netscape Navigator/Communicator v2.x and
      later for UNIX, as well as NCSA Mosaic v2.x.  It can remotely control
      a running Netscape or Mosaic session, or start a new browser session
      if an existing one is not found.

      Several new parameters are added for wwwWarp in the common.cfg file:
      "browserRemote", "browserDirect", "webSite1URL", "webSite2URL" and
      "webSite3URL".  In addition, there is a new search engine "name to
      action mapping" section in the common.cfg file.

      The config.sh script now supports configuring xmcd for the appropriate
      browser.  Wrapper scripts are also provided to support a web browser
      running on a different system than that of xmcd.

    - A new dual-mode main window feature has been added to xmcd.
      The user can now switch between the full-feature "normal" main
      window and a "basic" small-footprint window via a button click.
      The latter uses less than one quarter the screen space of the
      normal xmcd main window.  The start-up mode can be configured via
      the XMcd*mainWindowMode X resource.  In the "basic" mode, the
      controls can still be operated using the keyboard (using the
      apprpriate hotkey), even for those controls which are not shown.

    - A tool-tip pop-up feature is added to xmcd's main window, which
      replaces the previous design of a user-selected toggle between
      button face symbols and text labels.  The button faces are now
      always shown with symbols.  When the mouse cursor is left to rest
      on any main window control, a "tool-tip" is popped up containing a
      description of the control's function.  This feature works with the
      main window in either the "normal" or "basic" modes.

      The new "tooltipEnable" common parameter can be used to enable/disable
      the tool-tip feature.  Also, the "tooltipDelayInterval" parameter
      is used to configure the delay interval between the mouse cursor's
      movement over a control and the pop-up of the tool-tip.  The
      "tooltipActiveInterval" parameter sets the minimum amount of time
      that the tool-tip is displayed.  The actual display time is scaled
      according to the length of text.

    - A new time display mode "e-disc" (elapsed-disc) is added to display
      the total elapsed time on xmcd's main window time indicator.
      Also, a new common parameter "timeDisplayMode" is added to allow
      the default start-up time display mode to be pre-set.  The "Time
      display mode" button can now be used to toggle between the four
      available modes.

    - The "Disc" and "Track" labels above the "Ext Info..." buttons will
      also now also display an asterisk (*) if the associated extended
      information data section contains text (i.e., is non-empty).  This
      is a positive indication whether there is information therein
      without having to open the extended information windows.

    - The xmcd Extended Disc Information and Extended Track Information
      windows now display the disc and track numbers, respectively.

    - The xmcd Extended Track Information window now has arrow-buttons
      to facilitate changing to the previous or next track for display.
      the user no longer needs to go back to the track list on the
      CD Database/Program window to do this.

    - Xmcd now allows rewinding past the beginning of track 1 (for those
      CDs that have track 1 starting at beyond 2 seconds into the disc,
      and have "hidden" music information in the lead-in).  Also, the
      "previous track" button can now also be used to go to the beginning
      of this lead-in area before track 1.  Note: this feature may not
      work on all CD-ROM drives.

    - The repeat count indicator would indicate the wrong value when the
      repeat mode is disabled and re-enabled during shuffle play or program
      play.  This is now fixed.
      
    - Reorganizd all documentation files to under the docs_d subdirectory.
      These are also installed in the XMCDLIB/docs directory.  The xmcd
      online help system has been enhanced to allow browsing these files.
      The help window will automatically pop-up when xmcd is run for the
      first time by each user.  The feature-soecfic help is now supported
      on items within the help window itself.

    - The xmcd "About..." button (to pop up information about xmcd) is
      now in the help window.

    - The default CDDB submissions email address has been changed to
      <cddb-submit@submit.cddb.com>.

    - The dbconv_d source subdirectory has been renamed util_d.

    - Added a new utility to the distribution: cddbcmd(1).  This is
      a front-end program to the CDDB server, and allows one to send
      a command to the server and get its output.

    - The CD database server setup section of the config.sh script has
      been extensively improved.  It now has easier-to-navigate menus
      and the ability to query the latest CDDB categories and public
      server sites list from a central CD database on the Internet.

    - Made a minor fix to the parsing of the cddbMailCmd X resource.
      The original code was not working correctly on all platforms.

    - Fixed incorrect handling of broken up escape sequences (\n and \t)
      in multi-line CDDB file data.

    - Xmcd now requires that the app-defaults/XMcd file be installed in
      order to run.  Version checking is also now implemented on this file.

    - Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when the XMcd.libdir X resource
      or the XMCD_LIBDIR environment variable is incorrectly set.

    - The /tmp/.cdaudio/curr.XXXX file wasn't being updated if one uses
      the "next track" button to change the starting track before clicking
      "play" in xmcd.  This has been fixed.

    - Fixed a randomly occurring CDDB query failure when HTTP mode is used.

    - Cda now handles CDDB server inexact matches and HTTP/1.1 Proxy-
      authorizations, in both the command-line and visual modes.  For
      the command-line mode, the new -batch command line option can be
      used to disable any user interaction that would result from these
      features.

    - The ctrl-^ abd ctrl-v keys can now also be used in cda visual mode
      to scroll the information region up and down.

    - When starting up, both xmcd and cda now explicitly close file
      descriptors that are not stdin, stdout and stderr.  This is to
      eliminate inherited open file descriptors which are unused by xmcd
      or cda.  One of these file descriptors may be that of the CD-ROM
      device itself, and if so, may cause xmcd and/or cda to fail opening
      the device if the device driver enforces exclusive open semantics.

    - Other fixes and clean-ups.


Ver 2.2 patchlevel 1 released Sun Nov 30 14:57:54 PST 1997
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:
    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	Hewlett Packard CD-Writer 4020, CD-Writer 6020
	Pioneer DR-533
	Teac CD-50, CD-R50S

OS Support changes:
    - Non-SCSI CD-ROM drives are now also supported on OpenBSD and
      NetBSD platforms, using the existing FreeBSD ioctl method.
      Older NetBSD systems may need -DNETBSD_OLDIOC to compile.
      See the INSTALL file.

    - Enabled cda visual mode support for the OpenBSD platform by default.

    - The AIX IDE support was broken in 2,2 PL0 due to a typo.  This is
      now fixed.

    - The SCSI pass-through method under AIX no longer sets the SC_ASYNC
      flag.  Some CD-ROM drives do not handle this well and was causing
      SCSI bus hangs.

Misc changes:
    - The install.sh was misbehaving when a non-default answer is given
      on the XMCD library directory prompt.  This is now fixed.

    - If cddbRemoteAutoSave is enabled but there are no valid local CDDB
      directories to save to, a warning message is now displayed.

    - Fixed a problem that caused CDDB lookup to randomly fail if the
      entry is not in the first category specified in the cddbPath.

    - Eliminated an extraneous beep that occurs on some platforms, when
      exiting without a CD loaded in the drive.

    - Other fixes and clean-ups.


Ver 2.2 patchlevel 0 released Mon Aug 11 21:40:44 PDT 1997
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:
    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	Compro CDR-7501
	Digital RRD46
	NEC CDR-462, CDR-1610
	Nakamichi MBR-7.4, MJ-4.8s
	Panasonic LF-1004, LK-MC606BP
	Philips CDD2600
	Pioneer DR-466S
	Plextor PX-20X
	Sony CDU-415
	Stratus D756, D758, D855, D857, D859
	Teac CD-512S, CD-516S, CD-524S
	Toshiba XM-3801

    - Added support for the following non-SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	Acer CD-912E
	Goldstar CRD-8160
	Hitachi CDR-8130
	Mitsumi FX-140S2, FX-800S, FX-1200, FX-1600
	NEC CDR-251
	Panasonic CR-584, CR-585, LK-MC686BP
	Pioneer DR-444
	Sanyo CRD-820P, CDR-C3G
	Sony CDU-511, CDU-524E
	Teac CD-512E, CD-516E, CD-524E
	Toshiba XM-6002, XM-6102

    - Most drives automatically stop after being held in paused
      state for some time.  However, some drives also forget that
      it used to be paused and therefore rejects a "resume" SCSI
      command.  Xmcd/cda now attempts to restart the playback from
      where it left off in this scenario.

    - Some SCSI drives return a failure status to the Test Unit Ready
      command when the disc is not spun up.  Change the xmcd code to
      try spinning up the disc in these circumstances.

OS Support changes:
    - Added support for BSDI BSD/OS 3.x and OpenBSD 2.x platforms.

    - ATAPI/IDE CD-ROM drives are now supported on the Digital UNIX
      4.x platform.

    - On AIX 4.x platforms, ATAPI/IDE drive support is no longer
      auto-enabled when compiling with the IBM C compiler.  This is
      because there are AIX systems that lack the needed IDE header
      files.  To enable the IDE drive support, it is necessary to
      add -DAIX_IDE to the libdi_d/Makefile.

    - On Linux platforms, xmcd/cda now uses the CDROMCLOSETRAY ioctl
      command if this is available to close the CD tray.

    - On FreeBSD, xmcd/cda was not working well with non-SCSI drives.
      It either crashed or couldn't read the CD's TOC (table of contents).
      This is now fixed.

    - On HP-UX, changed to perform an SIOC_EXCLUSIVE ioctl only on
      the HP9000/7xx machines.  This ioctl service appears to be
      supported only on this platform.

    - Fixes were added to make the CD database "Send" functionality work
      on Digital OpenVMS 7.x.  Also, the local CD database categories was
      incorrect, due to mishandling of VMS-style path names.  This is
      now fixed.

Misc changes:
    - Added support of disc change operations on multi-CD changers.
      In xmcd, new buttons on the main menu allows changing to the
      previous or next disc, and the keypad window allows direct
      access to a desired disc via the keypad.  A new disc number
      indicator is also added to the main display area.

      The following parameters have been added to device.cfg:

	deviceList
	numDiscs
	mediumChangeMethod
	multiPlay
	reversePlay

      The drive configuration files and the config.sh script have
      been enhanced to set up xmcd/cda for proper operation with
      multi-CD drives.

    - The keypad window indicator now shows parentheses "( )" when
      the keypad or track warp slider is being used for input.

    - The following parameters have been moved from common.cfg to
      device.cfg, so that they may be independently configured on
      a per-drive basis:

	searchSkipBlocks
	searchPauseInterval
	searchSpeedUpCount
	searchVolumePercent
	searchMinVolume
	startupVolume

      Currently, multi-CD changer support in xmcd/cda is only
      applicable to SCSI-2 compliant CD changer drives, using either
      the LUN addressing method or the medium changer method for
      disc change operations.  This support is limited only to
      certain platforms.  Support for some IDE/ATAPI CD changers
      is also available under Linux.  See the README file for details.

    - In addition to the original CDDBP protocol for communications
      with remote CD database servers, support has now been added
      for using the HTTP protocol for CD database access.  The latter
      is primarily intended for xmcd/cda users who are behind a firewall
      (that allows HTTP traffic but not CDDBP).

      Moreover, xmcd/cda now supports the use of firewall proxy servers
      when communicating with a remote CD database server via HTTP.
      The following parameters have been added to common.cfg in
      support of accssing CD database servers in HTTP mode via a
      proxy server:

	cddbUseHttpProxy
	proxyServer

      The config.sh script has been enhanced to configure these new
      new capabilities and parameters.

      Proxy-authorization as defined in the HTTP/1.1 draft specifications
      is also implemented in this version of xmcd.  This allows xmcd to
      be used in an installation where a proxy user name and password
      is required to access hosts outside of the firewall.

      The syntax of the cddbPath parameter has been revised to
      specify remote CD database hosts using URL format.  See the
      comments in the common.cfg file for details.

      Note that not all official public xmcd CD database server sites
      support both CDDBP and HTTP protocols.

    - Added a curfileEnable parameter to control whether the
      /tmp/.cdaudio/curr.XXXX file should be written.  If enabled,
      this file now contains information about the device path, disc ID,
      category, playing mode, track number and disc/track titles.

    - The xmcd CDDB/Program subwindow now has a new "disc total" time
      indicator.

    - If a remote CD database query yields an inexact match, and the
      cddbRemoteAutoSave feature is enabled, xmcd was saving the entry
      into the database with the inexact disc ID instead of the actual
      disc ID.  This is now fixed.

    - Fixed an uninitialized variable which was causing xmcd to
      errorneously identify audio tracks as data, if the previously
      loaded CD contained data tracks.

    - Fixed a potential xmcd core dump that could occur when adding a
      track program or ejecting a disc.

    - Redesigned the SCSI pass-through method's pthru_send() interface
      to be more portable.

    - Some improvements to the install.sh and libdi_d/config.sh scripts.

    - New 14-color icon pixmap files are added, in addition to the
      original 5-color versions.

    - Added the clean, depend and tags target to all the Makefile.std
      files.

    - Other fixes and clean-ups.


Ver 2.1 patchlevel 2 released Sun Jan 19 17:11:46 PST 1997
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:
    none.

OS Support changes:
    - Revised README file notes relevant to the QNX platform:
      Due to a bug in QNX, the Iso9660fsys driver must not be running
      when using xmcd/cda.

    - Revised README file notes relevant to the SparcLinux platform:
      Xmcd/cda has been successfully tested on this platform without
      need for modifications.

Misc changes:
    none.


Ver 2.1 patchlevel 1 released Mon Jan 06 08:03:57 PST 1997
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	Plextor PX-12C, PX-12T
	Toshiba XM-5701

    - Added support for the following non-SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	NEC CDR-272
	Toshiba XM-5702

OS Support changes:

    - Add support for the QNX 4.22 and later platform.

    - On AIX 4.x platforms, ATAPI/IDE drive support is now automatically
      enabled if the xmcd/cda source code is compiled using the AIX
      C compiler on the appropriate platforms.  When using gcc, it is
      still necessary to add -DAIX_IDE to the libdi_d/Makefile.

Misc changes:

    - Added a new "insertPollDisable" parameter to common.cfg.  When
      set to True, this causes xmcd not to poll for the insertion of
      a new CD if xmcd is started without a CD in the drive, or after
      a CD is ejected.  In this mode, xmcd will only detect a new
      CD when the "Play/Pause" or "Stop" button is clicked.

      This feature is useful on platforms that log excessive messages
      (either on the console or in a system log file) when the CD-ROM
      drive is accessed without a CD loaded.

    - Fix an error that was causing new CDDB entries that are
      entered via xmcd to have a revision of 2 rather than 1.

    - Added code to sanity check a CDDB file's format and completeness
      when the user requests to "Send" it to a CDDB archive server.

    - The "Save" button in xmcd was being disabled after invoking the
      Extended Disc Information pop-up window and then "Cancel"ing it.
      This is now fixed.

    - The common and device-specific configuration files are no longer
      read with super-user privilege, even with the setuid root permission
      on the binary.  The original user's uid and gid are used instead.

    - Further hardening of the code to all subsystems.  This involved
      the use of tools such as Purify(tm), lint, gcc -Wall, and code
      inspection.  Several possible causes of segmentation fault crashes
      have been fixed.

    - Other fixes and clean-ups.


Ver 2.1 patchlevel 0 released Mon Nov 25 17:32:57 PST 1996
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	Apple CD-600e
	NEC CDR-1410, CDR-1450, CDR-1460, CDR-3460
	Panasonic CR-506B, CR-8005, CW-7501
	Philips PCA80SC
	Pioneer DR-433
	Plextor PX-83C, PX-85C
	Sanyo CRD-254S
	Sony CSD-76S
	Teac CD-56S
	Toshiba XM-5401, XM-5601
	Yamaha CDE-100, CDR-100, CDE-102, CDR-102

    - Added support for the following non-SCSI CD-ROM and CD-R drives:
	Acer CD-610A
	Hitachi CDR-7830, CDR-7930
	IBM CRMC-FX400C
	Mitsumi FT-810T, FX-600B, FX-120T
	NEC CDR-273
	Panasonic CR-583
	Pioneer DR-411
	Sony CDR-111, CDU-311, CSD-880E
	Teac CD-56E
	Toshiba XM-5602

    - Enable playTISupport for the Sony CDU-55S and CDU-76S
      drives.  Enable balanceControlSupport for CDU-76S.

    - WORM (CD-R) drives are now supported in addition to CD-ROM
      drives.

OS Support changes:

    - BSDI support is currently limited to BSD/OS version 2.x
      only.

    - ATAPI/IDE CD-ROM drives are now supported on the Solaris/x86 2.x
      and IBM AIX 4.x platforms.  The AIX IDE ioctl method is normally
      disabled, and can be enabled by defining -DAIX_IDE in the libdi_d
      directory when compiling.

    - Corrected a data alignment problem that caused remote
      CDDB server access to malfunction on some platforms.

    - Worked around a problem on some AIX 4.x platforms where
      bogus SCSI inquiry data is returned from the OS.  This was
      causing xmcd and cda to complain that the device is not a CD-ROM.

    - For Linux, changed the default mail program from "elm" to "mail",
      and the CD-ROM device from /dev/sr? to /dev/scd?.

    - /bin/sun is linked to /bin/false on Solaris/x86 2.x.  Fix the
      install.sh and config.sh scripts to deal with this.

    - Simplified the build procedure for systems without imake.

Misc changes:

    - Added a new "startupVolume" parameter to common.cfg.  This allows
      the volume control setting to be pre-set when xmcd/cda is
      first started.

    - Added the "cddbRemoteAutoSave" parameter to common.cfg.  If set to
      True, this would cause xmcd and cda to automatically save CD
      database entries (that are queried from a remote server) to the
      local database.

    - Changes to conform to the new xmcd-cddb DBFORMAT specification:
      - Add "Revision" support.
      - Add "Submitted via" support.
      - Added full support of DISCID fields with multiple IDs and
	multiple DISCID lines.
      - The new disc ID is now added to the CDDB file's DISCID= line
	during a "Link" operation.
      - '\' characters are now saved as '\\' in the CDDB file.

    - When performing a CD database "Link" operation, xmcd's windows
      and controls are no longer frozen while it searches the CD
      database.

    - Changes to make xmcd and cda compile and run correctly when
      using gcc with the -ansi option.  This previously generated
      incorrect data structure bitfields.  Note, however, that the
      use of -ansi on some platforms may exclude needed definitions
      in some system header files.  Thus, the use of -ansi is still
      not recommended.

    - Fixed to handle cut-and-paste operations to the CDDB/Program
      subwindow text input fields properly.  In particular, multi-line
      pastes are now disallowed into single-line text fields.  Also,
      there is better input checking on the Program Sequence text box.

    - Fixed some data alignment problems that was causing inexact
      CD database server lookup to misbehave.

    - When the CD database server query yields multiple inexact
      matches, xmcd will now elminate duplicates and only invoke a
      confirmation dialog box on unique entries.

    - The USE_SYMLINK flag is no longer supported for the "Link"
      feature.

    - Improved handling of the caddy lock and eject functionality
      on platforms that automatically lock the caddy/tray when
      the device is in use.

    - The xmcd track warp slider and the keypad time indicator
      would misbehave when playing the lead-in to a track (index 0).
      This is now fixed.

    - Fixed some problems that occurred when attempting to play CDs
      that contain data tracks.

    - Modifications to prevent internal string buffers from overflowing
      under unusual circumstances.  This removes the possibility of
      corrupting the program stack (and possibly causing a system
      security violation) via a very long XMCD_CDDBPATH environment
      variable.

    - Other fixes and clean-ups.


Ver 2.0 patchlevel 2 released Thu May 09 16:46:17 PDT 1996
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	Nakamichi MBR-7

OS Support changes:

    - On Linux platforms, the CD device is now opened with
      the O_NONBLOCK flag set.  This is in accordance with
      the new Linux CD audio control standard.

    - The "closeOnEject" parameter is no longer forced to be
      True when running in the SunOS/Linux or FreeBSD ioctl
      modes.

    - Added support for configuring ATAPI drives on the
      SCO Open Server 5.x platform in config.sh.

    - Changed to use #ifdef __bsdi__ instead of #ifdef bsdi
      for BSDI BSD/OS support code.

Misc changes:

    - Cda was not generating the correct command to the remote
      CD database server.  This is now fixed.

    - Another xmcd fix for internationalization and multi-byte
      character sets.

    - If the xmcd and cda was playing in program mode and the repeat
      mode is turned off in the middle of play, it would continue
      with one more repeat iteration before stopping.  This has been
      corrected.


Ver 2.0 patchlevel 1 released Mon Apr 08 10:00:48 PDT 1996
----------------------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Fixed the Pioneer DR-U124X configuration to include balance
      control support.

OS Support changes:

    - Fixed a install.sh script failure where the variable $AWK
      wasn't defined.  This problem was only occuring on some
      platforms.

    - On Solaris 2.x systems running vold, the xmcd display would
      erroneously indicate "cd busy" after a disc eject.  This is
      now fixed.

    - Corrected compilation problems on some OpenVMS platforms.

Misc changes:

    - Xmcd was malfunctioning on some systems with long device
      path names due to insufficient path name buffer space.
      This has been corrected.

    - On first startup, xmcd tries to write a file to the
      /tmp/.cdaudio directory before the directory is created.
      This is now fixed.

    - Fix handling of CD database files that contain extended ASCII
      characters.

    - Minor changes for internationalization and multi-byte character
      sets.


Ver 2.0 released Thu Mar 21 20:08:15 PST 1996
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the following SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	Apple CD-300e
	Chinon CDS-545, CDX-545
	IBM 7201-005, 7201-010
	Media Vision CDR-H93RMV, Reno
	MDI 600CD4X, SE6CDI
	NEC CDR-25, CDR-37, CDR-55, CDR-222S, CDR-502, CDR-511, CDR-512,
	    CDR-602
	Panasonic/Matsushita CR-501B, CR-502B, CR-503B, CR-504B

	Sony CDU-76S
	Toshiba XM-3601, XM-3701, XM-5201, XM-5301, XM-5901

    - Added support for the following non-SCSI CD-ROM drives:
	Aztech CDA268-01A
	IBM External-ISA
	Longshine LCS-7260
	Mitsumi FX-400B
	Panasonic CR-522, CR-523, CR-574, CR-581
	Philips CM206
	Okano/Wearnes CDD110
	Optics Storage 8000AT
	Orchid CD-3110
	Pioneer DR-UA124X
	Sanyo CRD-254P
	Sony CDU-76E, CDU-531, CDU-535, CDU-7205N
	Teac CD-55A
	Toshiba XM-5302, XM-5402

    - Corrected the NEC CDR-210P configuration defaults.

    - Added workaround for firmware bugs in some Sun CD-ROM drives
      (Sony OEM CDU-8012) that caused a SCSI bus hang after ejecting
      a CD.  See the README file for details.

    - Added workaround for firmware bugs in some Digital RRD42 drives
      that caused xmcd to play track "110" after the end of certain
      CDs.

    - Fixed a bug which caused the CD table-of-contents to be
      incorrectly read on Sony CDU-6111 CD-ROM drives.

    - Added workaround for a firmware bugs in some Chinon CD-ROM
      drives.  These drives report and accept track numbers in BCD
      (rather than binary as specified in the SCSI-2 specifications).

OS Support changes:

    - Added support for the following OS/system platforms:
	BSDI BSD/OS 2.x or later on x86
	Digital OpenVMS on alpha/VAX
	HP-UX 9.x on m68k
	HP-UX 10.x on PA-RISC
	NetBSD 1.0A or later on x86, sparc and others
	SCO Open Server Release 5.x on x86
	Siemens Nixdorf SINIX SVR4/mips
	Silicon Graphics Irix and Irix64 SVR4 6.x
	Sony NEWS-OS/m68k

    - Non-SCSI CD-ROM drives are now supported on the FreeBSD
      platform via the new FreeBSD ioctl method module.

    - Modified to support a change in the FreeBSD 2.0.5R SCSI
      device driver (it now requires the device to be opened O_RDWR
      rather than O_RDONLY for SCSI pass-through operations).

    - Changed handling of dynamic library search on some systems to
      be more intelligent, and moved the support of creating symlinks
      into install.sh (this was in configure.sh in previous releases).

    - SCSI command timeout values have been increased to 10 seconds
      on all platforms that support such a parameter.  This avoids
      problems with some slow-reacting CD-ROM drives.

    - Fixed cda_d/Imakefile to properly support Digital Ultrix.

    - Worked around a problem with SIGCHLD handling in the HP-UX VUE
      environment.  Previously, xmcd may hang when it spawned child
      processes to perform various tasks under VUE.

    - This distribution now comes with several 32x32 pixmap files
      suitable for use as an xmcd desktop icon.  See the README file
      for details.

Misc changes:

    - Changed all file names to be compatible with the ISO9660
      standard (without the Rockridge extension).  The exceptions
      are listed as follows (these cannot be changed due to existing
      convention):

	    Imakefile (all sub-directories)
	    common_d/patchlevel.h
	    xmcd_d/XKeysymDB
	    misc_d/xmcd.icon

      If you received the xmcd source distribution on a CD-ROM that
      does not implement the Rockridge extension then the above files
      will have their names truncated.  You must rename them back to
      their original names before attempting to compile/install.

      An important user-visible aspect of this change is that the
      former LIBDIR/xmcd/config/configure.sh shell script is now named
      LIBDIR/xmcd/config/config.sh.

    - Changed all *.d subdirectory names to *_d.  This is to make
      xmcd compatible with OpenVMS which does not allow dots in the
      directory name.  Also, the wm2xmcd.d directory is renamed
      dbconv_d.

    - Changes to xmcd widget creation code to fix compatibility
      problems with some ports of Motif 2.0.

    - Source code related to CD database management functions are
      now consolidated into the cddb_d subdirectory; which is built into
      a library and shared by xmcd and cda.  This library now has the
      capability of using a remote CDDB server on a TCP/IP network.
      As a result of the reorganization the following changes are made:

      1. The "dbdir:" common parameter is renamed "cddbPath:" and the
	 XMCD_DBPATH environment variable is changed to XMCD_CDDBPATH.
	 The separator character for each component in these parameters
	 is changed from a colon (:) to a semi-colon (;).  In addition
	 to the absolute and relative path names (for local directories),
	 remote servers can be specified with the @hostname[:port]
	 syntax.  The hostname can be the CD database server name
	 or its IP number.  The port number is optional, and need not be
	 specified if it's the same as the default (which is set in the
	 common.cfg file).  An example of the "cddbPath" parameter:

            cddbPath: rock;jazz;classical;~/mycddb;@cddbsrv.xyz.com

	 The config.sh script now prompts for remote CD database
	 server names and configures this parameter for you.

      2. The "maxDbdirs:" parameter has been obsoleted.

      3. The "dbFileMode:" parameter is renamed "cddbFileMode:".

      4. The former "cddb" indicator in the main window now has been
	 changed to display one of four possible messages:

	 query		Searching CD databases
	 loc-db		Current CD entry found in local CD database
	 rmt-db		Current CD entry found in remote CD database
	 (blank)	No CD database entry found for current CD,
			or no CD loaded

    - Xmcd now automatically scrolls the track list in the CDDB/Program
      subwindow during playback such that the current playing track
      would be visible in the list window.  The auto-scrolling behavior
      is suppressed when a track is selected in the track list, or when 
      editing track titles.

    - The scrolling position of the CDDB/Program subwindow track list
      is now preserved when the time display format is changed using
      the total/track toggle buttons.  Previously, this caused the
      track list to scroll to the top.

    - Double-clicking (or pressing carriage return) on a track in the
      CDDB/Program subwindow track list is equivalent to creating a
      program with the selected track and pressing play.  This is the
      same as in previous versions, but with this release, the main
      window display no longer shows the "prog" indicator while in this
      mode, nor is the track number shown in the CDDB/Program subwindow
      "Program Sequence" text field.  Also, the program is now
      automatically cleared after the selected track is finished playing.

    - Xmcd now displays an asterisk "*" character after the track title
      in the CDDB/Program subwindow track list, if there is extended
      track information associated with that track.  To view it,
      select the track by clicking on it, then click the Track "Ext Info"
      button to pop up the Track Extended Info window.  The "cda toc"
      output has also been modified to more closely resemble xmcd.

    - When ejecting the CD or exiting xmcd, if the on-screen CD database
      information has changed but not yet saved, xmcd now pops up a
      dialog box that asks whether the information should be saved
      to file.

    - The Options pop-up window now has a Save button that allows
      the user to save the settings.

    - Added two new device-specific parameters "repeatMode" and
      "shuffleMode" that allows the user to specify whether the repeat
      or shuffle modes should be enabled on program startup.

    - Xmcd now maintains the file /tmp/.cdaudio/curr.XXXX which contains
      information about the currently loaded CD.  Namely, the device
      path name, the CD database category and the disc ID is recorded
      in this file.  Other applications may read this file to identify
      the CD that is loaded in the drive.  This feature is disabled on
      the Digital OpenVMS platform.

    - Fixed an obscure xmcd crash that may occur when the time display
      is in r-disc mode; while a program is cleared but still playing,
      and an attempt is made to change tracks.

    - After a CDDB link operation, the xmcd main window now displays the
      track title correctly while the CD is playing.  Previously,
      "unknown track title" is shown until a track change occurred.

    - When running in shuffle mode or if a track program is in effect,
      moving the track warp slider all the way to the right produced
      incorrect behavior on some platforms.  Also, if the CD is not playing
      and the track warp slider is moved by clicking to the left or right
      of the thumb (not dragging), the keypad time display is not correctly
      updated.  These problems are now fixed.

    - The cda utility did not handle the "playOnLoad" and "ejectOnDone"
      parameters correctly.  Fixed.

    - Reorganized the code in cda to reduce the size of the cda_visual()
      routine.

    - Multiple cda "client" programs can now simultaneously run with
      a single cda daemon (the same CD-ROM drive).

    - The cda utility now correctly handles old FIFO files from a
      previously-killed cda daemon.  Also, implemented new locking
      scheme to ensure that no more than a single cda daemon process
      can be invoked per CD-ROM drive.

    - Added a "cda debug" command that allows the user to query, set
      or unset the debug mode on-the-fly.

    - The install.sh script displays the wrong default LIBDIR
      on XFree86-3.x systems.  Fixed.

    - Display formatting improvements to the config.sh script.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------
OS Support changes:

    - Corrected a minor problem with the FreeBSD platform support.


Ver 1.4 released Sun Feb 12 20:54:01 PST 1995
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the Chinon CDx-525, Digital RRD44, NEC CDR-210P,
      Plextor PX-43CS/PX-45CS, Sony CDU-55S and Toshiba XM-3501

      CR-521, CR-562, CR-563, and Sony CDU-31A, CDU-33A and CDU-55E
      CD-ROM drives.  These are non-SCSI drives using a proprietary
      interface card, sound card or an IDE/EIDE/ATAPI interface.
      Xmcd/cda must be configured to run using the SunOS/Linux ioctl
      method to use these (rather than SCSI pass-through).  Also,
      the appropriate driver support must be configured in the kernel.

    - On SCSI-2 drives, the IMMED bit in the Start Stop Unit
      SCSI command CDB is now set.  This causes the CD ejects
      command to complete immediately, avoiding command time-out
      situations on some platforms.

    - When ejectOnExit was set, the CD wasn't being ejected when the
      program quits (on certain SCSI-1 CD-ROM drives only).  This is
      now fixed.

    - The version number of the LIBDIR/xmcd/config/.cfgtbl/* files
      have been bumped to 2.  A new field is added to these files
      to configure the new "noTURWhenPlaying" parameter in device.cfg.

OS Support changes:

    - Add support for the FreeBSD (version 2.0.5 or later) platform.
      See the README file for special notes about the kernel and
      SCSI driver configuration.

    - The configure.sh script was not properly setting the MAILCMD
      variable on some OS platforms.  Fixed.

    - Added a SunOS/Linux ioctl method module to libdi.  This is
      primarily used to support non-SCSI CD-ROM drives using a
      proprietary interface card under Linux.  Although this method
      can be used with SCSI CD-ROM drives under Linux, SunOS 4.1.x,
      and Solaris 2.x platforms, it is recommended that the SCSI
      pass-through method be used instead.

    - Fixed a problem with the volume slider not being properly
      initialized on the Digital OSF/1 and Motorola SVR4/m88k platforms.

    - The configure.sh script no longer rejects a device node path
      that doesn't exist on the Solaris 2.x platform with the
      Solaris Volume Manager.

Misc changes:

    - Enhanced the libdi design such that multiple CD-ROM controlling
      methods can be implemented and coexist.  The original support for
      SCSI pass-through is now an instance of a method.  This change
      involves adding another jump table for all libdi functions
      to branch control to the appropriate method.  The device.cfg
      file now has a new "deviceInterfaceMethod" parameter that
      configures the actual method to use.  See the PORTING file
      for details.

    - The cda utility now supports a "visual" mode that turns cda
      into a screen-oriented (curses-based) CD player.

    - Implemented work-around to avoid hitting a bug in some versions
      of Motif-1.2.  The symptom was a xmcd crash when the
      CDDB/Program subwindow is closed.

    - The xmcd CDDB/Program window Track List now highlights
      the appropriate entry when a track title is being edited in
      the Track Title Editor box, even if a track is not explicitly
      selected.  Also, the Track List now automatically scrolls down
      as tracks titles are entered.

    - Xmcd now displays an error message if a CDDB Save operation
      fails due to a full filesystem.

    - The "dbdir" parameter in common.cfg and the XMCD_DBPATH environment
      variables now support tilde-expansion (e.g., ~/somepath or
      ~someuser/somepath are now handled correctly).

    - Xmcd and cda now creates a directory /tmp/.cdaudio.  All
      lock files, fifo nodes, and other temporary files are created
      and deleted under that directory (instead of directly in /tmp).
      This is because many platforms set the sticky bit in the
      /tmp directory permissions, making it cumbersome for xmcd/cda to
      maintain lock files (one user's xmcd process should be able to
      delete another's lock file if the other process has exited).

    - The misc.d/makesrc.sh and misc.d/makerel.sh scripts have been
      further enhanced to print informative messages, and these now
      work correctly on systems with a limited command line length.

    - Removed the BUGS file and added the FAQ file.

    - Added the "reggae" and "folk" categories to the standard CD
      database.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.3 released Fri Sep 30 12:32:10 PDT 1994
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Added support for the Digital RRD43 CD-ROM drive.

OS Support changes:

    - IBM AIX 4.x is now supported.

    - Fixed a misplaced line in libdi.d/configure.sh that caused
      the default device node path to be set wrong under the IBM AIX
      and Digital OSF/1 environments.

    - Added improved instructions for DG/UX, and corrected the default
      CD-ROM device node path in configure.sh.

    - The configure.sh script now will set up the "XMcd*cddbMailCmd"
      parameter as well, based on the OS variant.

    - The configure.sh now prompts the user before creating any
      X library symbolic links from non-standard locations to /usr/lib
      on SVR4 systems.

Misc changes:
    - Added an xmcd Options sub-window which allows run-time toggle
      of many of the feature options in the device.cfg file.  The
      Options window also includes a Channel Routing selector, a
      Volume Control Taper selector and a stereo Balance slider
      control (these can be used on CD-ROM drives that has the
      appropriate capabilities).

    - Added a Track Warp feature in the xmcd Keypad subwindow.  This
      allows fast searches to any part of a track using a slider.
      In conjunction with the keypad, this allows very easy access
      to any arbitrary CD location.  A similar feature is added to
      cda, where the "cda play" command now accepts an optional
      mm:ss offset argument if a track number is also specified.

    - Added a new Repeat Count Indicator in the xmcd main window
      display area.  This shows the number of iteration completed
      when playing audio with the Repeat mode enabled.  Likewise,
      a Repeat Count field is added to the "cda status" output.

    - Added support for the following cda commands: "balance"
      to set the stereo channel balance, and "route" to set the
      channel routing.

    - The Disc ID indicator in the xmcd CDDB/Program window now
      displays the CD category as well as the disc ID number.
      Likewise, the "cda toc" command now displays the category
      under the "Disc ID" heading as well.

    - The xmcd database Link feature CD list now displays the
      average track offset difference between the current CD and
      each potential database match.  Those entries that are
      within 10 seconds are now listed with bold font.  This
      enhancement is based on code contributed by Andreas Zins
      (zins@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de).

    - Fixed a bug which causes xmcd to generate an X protocol error
      if the XMcd*cddbMailCmd resource is improperly set and the
      Send button is used.

    - The XMcd*cddbMailCmd resource now uses %S, %A and %F to denote
      the mail subject, mail address and CD database file path,
      respectively.  This makes it easier to configure xmcd to work
      with different mailers.

    - Fixed a bug where the track list display in the CDDB subwindow
      was being duplicated when a disc which is not in the database
      is inserted and ejected.

    - Fixed a typo in the xmcd.d/cfgtbl/Pioneer file which caused
      Pioneer not to appear in the xmcd configure.sh menu.

    - Increased the string buffer used in common_parminit() in
      xmcd.d/cdfunc.c so that longer CD database directory paths
      can be accommodated.

    - The "caddyLock" parameter is now in device.cfg instead of
      common.cfg.  Thus, it is now configurable on a per-device
      basis.
    - Added the "balanceControlSupport", "channelRouteSupport" and
      "channelRoute" parameters to device.cfg.  Enhanced the configure.sh
      script to set up these parameters based on CD-ROM drive brand
      and model.

    - Fixed libdi.d/configure.sh to not put a backslash in the
      app-defaults/XMcd file (it was writing "XMcd\*libdir:", but
      it should be "XMcd*libdir:").

    - Added support for editres(1) in xmcd.  The code is enabled if
      compiled with -DEDITRES in the xmcd.d directory under X11R5 or
      later.  This feature is contributed by Andreas Zins
      (zins@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de).

    - The "cda status cont" command now supports a sub-argument
      "secs" to allow the user to specify the display update time
      interval in seconds.  The default is now 1 second.

    - The "cda extinfo" command now always displays the disc extended
      info, then followed by the track extended info of the currently
      playing track, if any.  If "cda extinfo track#" is specified,
      then the specified track extended info is displayed instead.

    - The xmcd/cda -debug option was ineffective if the user has a
      $HOME/.xmcdcfg/common.cfg file with the "debugMode" parameter
      set to False.  This is now fixed.

    - Added "blues" and "country" to the default CD categories list.

    - If using the GNU C compiler (gcc), it is no longer required
      to specify the -fwritable-strings option.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.2 released Wed Jul 27 12:34:29 PDT 1994
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Fixed to really work with the Chinon CD-43x drives.

    - Add support for the Plextor 4Plex and the NEC CDR-900 (4xPro).

OS Support changes:

    - Add support for Apple A/UX, Data General DG/UX and Stratus
      FTX SVR4/PA-RISC platforms.

    - Enhancements to the Digital OSF/1 and Ultrix error handling.

    - On Solaris 2.x platforms, added support for the -c, -X and
      -o options for full compatibility with the Solaris Volume
      Manager auto-start feature using the action_workman.so
      program.

Misc changes:

    - Major source code tree re-organization into subdirectories.

    - "Makefile.std" files are added to the source code distribution.
      These can be used to build the source code on systems that do
      not have imake.

    - Added a new utility "cda" to the distribution.  This is a
      command-line driven (non-X) audio CD player.  The command
      interface makes it ideal as a script-driven player.

    - A new "Send" button is added to the xmcd CDDB/Program window.
      This allows users to send the CD database entry of the currently
      loaded CD to the xmcd CD database archive site.

    - The "Play Program" button in the CDDB/Program window has been
      deleted.  The main window "Play/Pause" button is used to
      start program playback instead.  This change also involves a
      few other minor program-mode related behavioral changes.

    - Many common configuration parameters have been moved from
      XMcd.ad into the new common.cfg file.

    - The device-specific configuration file has been renamed from
      dev.config to device.cfg.

    - Added two new device-specific parameters that can be set to
      suit user preferences: "playOnLoad" determines whether xmcd
      will auto-play a CD after loading, and "ejectOnDone" determines
      whether xmcd will automatically eject the CD after it's done
      playing.

    - The CD now does not spin down between tracks when using the
      prev-track or next-track buttons in shuffle and program modes.

    - Xmcd (and cda) no longer silently ignore the error if the
      common or device-specific configuration file cannot be opened.

    - Fixed a few obscure problems involving the use of various
      xmcd controls when the player is in shuffle or program mode
      and the playback is paused.

    - If a CD has multiple links in the database, xmcd no longer
      displays duplicate lines in the Link Selector list menu.
      Also, the list menu sorting is now case-insensitive.

    - All window sizes have been reduced to conserve screen space.

    - The XMcd*mainShowTrackTitle, XMcd*mainShowDiscTitle and
      XMcd*cddbTimeShowLength X resources have been removed.  The
      built-in behavior is equivalent to setting these to True.

    - The install.sh and configure.sh scripts now have error message
      logging capability.

    - A new makeshar.sh script is added to the distribution that
      makes shar format xmcd source code releases.

    - Security improvements: the uid and gid settings are forced to
      their original settings regardless of whether SETUID_ROOT is
      defined.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.1 released Fri Feb 25 18:40:36 PST 1994
---------------------------------------------
CD-ROM drive support changes:

    - Add support for more SCSI-2 CD-ROM drives from Chinon, Hitachi,
      NEC, Pioneer, Procom, Sony and Toshiba.

    - Added support for Apple, Chinon and Sony SCSI-1 CD-ROM drives
      operating using vendor-unique commands.

    - Fixed problems in the Pioneer vendor-unique support code.

    - Drive-specific configuration data (previously hard coded in
      configure.sh) is now looked up in table files under the
      LIBDIR/xmcd/config/.tbl directory.

    - On SCSI-2 drives, the REW, FF and Sample operations will now use
      Play Audio MSF command by default, if the "playAudioMSFSupport"
      parameter is True.  In xmcd-1.0, these operations were supported
      only with the Play Audio(10) or Play Audio (12) commands.

    - A new "curposFormat" device-specific parameter is added to
      specify whether the CD-ROM drive supports Data Format 1 (CD-ROM
      Current Position) of the Read Subchannel SCSI-2 command.

    - The "volumeControlSetDBD" device-specific parameter is renamed to
      "modeSenseSetDBD".

OS Support changes:

    - Added support for Digital Ultrix and OSF/1 on DECstations and
      Digital Alpha AXP.

    - Added support for Linux on Intel x86 platforms.

    - Added support for IBM AIX on the RS/6000.

    - Added support for SGI IRIX on SGI workstations.

    - HP-UX specific code is now conditionally compiled via
      #ifdef __hpux instead of #ifdef hpux.  This is because the HP cc
      compiler pre-defines the former but not the latter in ANSI mode
      (-Ae).

    - Changed a "struct inquiry_data" to "struct inqry_data" in
      di_scsipt.h to avoid conflict with "union inquiry_data" in HP-UX's
      <sys/scsi.h>.

    - Support for Solaris 2.x platforms is improved.  Added code to
      coexist with the Solaris Volume Manager.

    - The configure.sh script has been improved such that on SVR4
      systems, it will attempt to create symlinks of shared library
      files to /usr/lib even if LIBDIR is set to a non-standard
      location.

    - Fixed to avoid a core dump in cd_untimeout() on some 64-bit
      systems.

Misc changes:
    - Source file names were changed to better illustrate their function.

    - Reordered a few stack structure declarations to fix alignment
      issues on some platforms.  This fixes a core dump and other
      failures when doing FF and REW operations on those systems.

    - Improved CD database files permissions handling.

    - Added a -debug command line option.  When used, xmcd will generate
      verbose diagnostics about the commands it sends and the data it
      receives from the CD-ROM drive.

    - Added XMcd.mainShowDiscTitle and XMcd.mainShowTrackTitle X
      application resources.  When set to True, these will cause xmcd
      to display the artist/disc title and currently playing track title
      in the main window display area, respectively.  The default
      settings for these are True.  For those who prefer the simpler
      appearance of xmcd-1.0, you can set either or both of these
      resources to False.

    - Added XMcd.cddbTimeShowLength X application resource.  When set
      to True, the default CDDB Track List time display mode will be
      "track lengths" instead of "track offsets".

    - A new "exitOnEject" device-specific parameter is added which, if
      set to True, causes xmcd to exit when a CD is ejected.  Likewise,
      the new "closeOnEject" parameter causes xmcd to close the device on
      eject, and re-open when the CD is re-loaded.

    - The CD database disc ID is now shown on the CDDB window.

    - A watch cursor is now displayed when xmcd is doing CD database
      file I/O.

    - A wm2xmcd utility is now included in the xmcd distribution that
      converts WorkMan CD database files to xmcd format.

    - Other enhancements and cleanups.


Ver 1.0 released Mon Nov 08 11:02:00 PST 1993
---------------------------------------------
    - Initial general availability.
