Xmcd is a full-featured CD Player utility package including xmcd, a
CD Player for the X window system using the Motif graphical user
interface; and cda, a command-line driven, text mode CD Player which
also features a curses-based, screen-oriented mode. Both utilities
transform your CD-ROM or CD-R drive into a stereo CD player, allowing
you to play audio CDs on your computer.

The following is a summary of xmcd/cda documentation files.  Please
read these before installing and using the software.

Many of these files refer to the XMCDLIB directory, which is the
directory under which all the xmcd/cda support files are installed.
This is configured when you install the xmcd package.

The documentation files are located in the docs_d subdirectory in the
xmcd source code distribution, and are copied to the XMCDLIB/docs
directory during installation.
