Next Disc Button

Select this button to change to the next disc.
This button is useful only on multi-disc changers.

If you are already on the last disc, selecting
this button will have no effect.

If audio playback is in progress when you select
this button, playback will automatically start
when the disc change is complete.  If the player
is currently paused, it will remain paused after
the disc change.

Any program sequence defined is canceled when
changing discs.
