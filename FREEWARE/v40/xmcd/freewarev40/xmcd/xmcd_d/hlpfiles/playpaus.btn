Play / Pause Button

Select this button to start audio playback.  When
audio playback is already in progress, selecting
this button causes the playback to pause.  If the
button is selected during paused state, audio playback
will resume.

If Repeat mode is enabled, the CD will be played
again after completion.

If Shuffle mode is enabled, the CD tracks will be
played in a non-repeating random order.  If both
Shuffle and Repeat modes are enabled, then the
shuffle sequence will be re-randomized before each
repeat playback.

If a Program sequence is defined, the CD tracks will
be played in the defined order.  A Program sequence
supercedes Shuffle mode.  If Repeat mode is enabled
during program play, the program will be repeated
after completion.

You can use this button only when a CD is loaded.
