! CD database search path.  Items are separated by a semi-colon ';'
! character.  Each item can be:
!	- An absolute directory path.  Tilde expansion '~' is supported.
!	  Examples:
!		/usr/local/lib/cddb/classical
!		~john/cddb/jazz
!		~/mycddb/rock
!	- A relative directory path (which is taken to be relative
!	  to the XMCDLIB/cddb directory)
!	  Examples:
!		blues
!		reggae
!		soundtrack
!	- A remote CD database server in URL format.  Two protocols
!	  are supported: cddbp or http.  Not all CD database server
!	  sites support both protocols.  Http URLs must contain the
!	  path to the CD database server CGI executable.
!	  Examples:
!		cddbp://cddbsrv.xyz.com
!		cddbp://cddbsrv.xyz.com:888
!		cddbp://127.0.0.1
!		http://cddbsrv.xyz.com/~cddb/cddb.cgi
!
! (The XMCD_CDDBPATH environment variable overrides this)
cddbPath:	rock;jazz;blues;newage;classical;reggae;folk;country;soundtrack;misc;data;cddbp://cddb.cddb.com:8880

! CD database file permissions
cddbFileMode:		0664

! Remote CD database default port number when connecting in CDDBP mode
! The default port number for the HTTP mode is 80.
cddbDefaultPort:	888

! Remote CD database timeout interval (seconds).  An attempt to connect
! to a remote CDDB server will be aborted if the server does not respond
! in this time interval.  You may need to increase this limit if the
! CDDB server is on a slow network link to your host (such as an on-demand
! dial-up PPP or SLIP connection).
cddbTimeOut:		60

! When cddbRemoteDisable is set to True, remote CDDB database queries will
! be inhibited, even if remote servers are specified in the cddbPath.
! In xmcd, this will be the startup state, and the "Disable remote" button
! will toggle the behavior at run-time.  This is useful for systems that
! are not connected to the Internet, or only connected on a part-time basis.
cddbRemoteDisable:	False

! CD database remote entry auto-save feature.  If this is set to True,
! Xmcd and cda will automatically save remotely-queried CD database
! entries into the local CD database.
cddbRemoteAutoSave:	False

! Whether to use a proxy server when connecting to a CD database server
! site via HTTP protocol.
cddbUseHttpProxy:	False

! The HTTP proxy server's host name and port number.  This is used
! only when cddbUseHttpProxy is set to True.
!
!	Syntax: proxyhost[:port]
!
! The host name can also be an IP number.  The port number is optional.
!
!	Examples:
!		proxy.xyz.com
!		proxy.xyz.com:80
!
proxyServer:		yourproxyhost:80

! Play status poll interval during audio playback. (msec)
! This should be less than 500 to get satisfactory display update
! response.
! (xmcd only)
statusPollInterval:	260

! If no disc, poll interval for disc insertion (msec).  This is
! used only if "insertPollDisable" is False.  The minimum is 500.
! (xmcd only)
insertPollInterval:	4000

! If set to True, this causes xmcd not to poll for disc insertion
! when xmcd is first started (and a CD is not loaded), or after a
! CD is ejected.  A CD is detected only when the "Play/Pause" or
! "Stop" button is clicked.
! (xmcd only)
insertPollDisable:	False

! When previous track/index button pressed, if this number of audio blocks
! has been played in the current track/index, then playback will start from
! the beginning of the current track/index instead of the previous one.
! (xmcd only)
previousThreshold:	100

! During Sample playback operations, the number of audio blocks to play
! in each track.
! (xmcd only)
sampleBlocks:		750

! Whether Solaris 2.x Volume Manager is running.  This is used only
! on the SunOS 5.x/Solaris 2.x platform with the Volume Manager.
solaris2VolumeManager:	False

! Whether error messages are output to stderr when xmcd encounters
! errors when delivering commands to the CD-ROM drive.  You should
! only set this to False if you have a non SCSI-2 compliant CD-ROM
! drive that causes xmcd to display lots of error messages.
showScsiErrMsg:		True

! Whether the current device, disc ID, category and other information
! should be recorded in the /tmp/.cdaudio/cur.XXX file
curfileEnable:		True

! The default main window time display mode.  The supported modes are:
! 0	Track elapsed time (elapse)
! 1	Disc elapsed time (e-disc)
! 2	Track remaining time (r-trac)
! 3	Disc remaining time (r-disc)
! (xmcd only)
timeDisplayMode:	0

! Whether to enable tool-tips.  When enabled, if the mouse cursor is
! positioned over a main window control, a small window is popped up
! after a delay, describing the function of the control.
! (xmcd only)
tooltipEnable:		True

! If tooltipEnable is set to True, this is the time delay (msec) after
! the mouse is positioned over a control before the tool-tip is popped up.
! (xmcd only)
tooltipDelayInterval:	1000

! After a tool-tip is popped up, the minimum amount of time (msec) that
! the tooltip will be displayed before automatically popping down.  The
! actual amount of time will be scaled up based on the length of text
! in the tool-tip.  Setting this to zero will make the tooltip stay active
! until the mouse cursor is moved away from the control.
! (xmcd only)
tooltipActiveInterval:	3000

! Whether verbose debug diagnostics should be generated on stderr.
debugMode:		False

!
! wwwWarp parameters
!
! browserRemote   The command line to remote-control a running web browser
!                 and make it open the destination URL.  This should not
!                 be run in the background (no '&' at the end).
!                 Examples:
!                 (Netscape) netscape -remote 'openURL(%U)' >/dev/null 2>&1
!                 (Mosaic)   /usr/lib/X11/xmcd/config/rmtmosaic.sh '%U'
! browserDirect   The command line to start a new web browser and make it
!                 open the destination URL.  This command should end with a
!                 '&' character to make it run in the background.
!                 Examples:
!                 (Netscape) netscape '%U' >/dev/null 2>&1 &
!                 (Mosaic)   Mosaic '%U' >/dev/null 2>&1 &
!
! The %U magic token will be substituted by xmcd with the destination URL
! on both of the above parameters.  If relative pathnames are specified
! to the browser, then it should be in your PATH environment variable.
!
! webSite1URL     The URL to the official xmcd web site.                 
! webSite2URL     The URL to the official CDDB web site.                 
! webSite3URL     The URL to the CDDB search engine site.                 
! excludeWords    Words to exclude from the disc artist and title
!                 when xmcd composes keywords for web searching
! 
browserRemote:	/usr/bin/X11/netscape -remote 'openURL(%U)' >/dev/null 2>&1
browserDirect:	/usr/bin/X11/netscape '%U' >/dev/null 2>&1 &
webSite1URL:	http://sunsite.unc.edu/tkan/xmcd/
webSite2URL:	http://www.cddb.com/

!
! Search Engine name to action mapping
!
!    The following section defines a list of search engines that will
!    appear in xmcd's wwwWarp "Search engines" option menu.
!
!    Notes:
!    1. These definitions may need to be changed if the particular site's
!       CGI interface changes.
!    2. This list is provided for the convenience of xmcd users.  Xmcd and
!       its author have no affiliation with, offer no endorsement, and
!       provide no guarantee for the contents and services of these sites.
!
!    The format each line is:
!
!    Name: action
!
!    Name is the name of the search engine site.  The action is the URL
!    plus the CGI arguments to invoke a search.
!
!    If the same Name appears in multiple lines, the last one will be used.
!    A Name of just a single hyphen '-' will cause xmcd to insert a separator 
!    line in the menu.
!
!    The following are magic tokens which xmcd will make a text substitution
!    as described.
!
!    %A    The artist of the current CD.
!    %D    The disc title of the current CD.
!    %T    The track title, determined using the following order of
!          precedence:
!		1. The selected track in the xmcd track list
!		2. The currently playing track
!          If no track is selected, and the CD is not currently playing,
!	   or if a track title is not defined for the appropriate track,
!          then the disc title will be used for %T instead.
!    %B    The artist and disc title information (similar to %A+%D)
!    %a    "Reduced" version of %A
!    %d    "Reduced" version of %D
!    %t    "Reduced" version of %T
!    %b    "Reduced" version of %B
!
!    "Reduced" means all punctuations deleted, and any words
!    in the excludeWords list above are also excluded.
