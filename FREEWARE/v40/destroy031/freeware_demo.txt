DESTROY, TOOLS, Delete files faster than Delete.
!
The DESTROY program allows to erase one or several files
which are included in a directory in the reverse of their
storage. (see Disk  ACP Operation of the OpenVMS I/O User's
Reference Manual)

It needs the "delete" (D) access to the file and the "write"
(W) access to the parent repertory. If the targeted file is
itself a repertory, the latter must be empty.
