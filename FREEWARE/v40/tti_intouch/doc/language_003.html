Another type of variable is a <b>structure reference</b>. 
INTOUCH includes a transparent interface to several record management 
systems, including the VMS file management system.  One of the major 
features of INTOUCH is its ability to perform database operations as a 
part of the language.  INTOUCH's data structure statements allow you to 
manipulate stored data from within your own programs. 
(See Chapter 14, Data Structure Statements for informaton on the 
INTOUCH data structure statements.) 

<p>
INTOUCH stores data in <b>structures</b>.  Structures look 
something like this: 

<p>

<a name="index_x_180"></a>
Each structure is made up of <b>records</b> and 
<b>fields</b>.  In the CLIENT structure above, we have a 
record for each customer. 

<p>
Each record consists of fields.  For example, our customer records 
might contain a field for the customer's ID number, last name, first 
name, address, phone number, company name, etc..  Each of these pieces 
of data is stored in its own field--the name field, address field, 
phone number field, etc..  These fields appear as columns in the 
example shown above. 

<p>
For information on creating structures and defining fields, see 
Chapter 16, Creating Structures, Field Definitions with SETUP. 

<p>
You can reference the field data in structures by using structure 
references.  To reference a field, indicate the structure name and 
the expression of the field whose contents you want to access. 

<p><pre>
        struc_name(field_expr) 
</pre>

<p>
<i>struc_name</i> is the name associated with the structure. 
<i>field_expr</i> is the name of a field in the structure.  When you 
reference a field, INTOUCH searches the current record for this field and 
reads its contents.  Some examples of structure references are: 

<p><pre>
        CLIENT(PHONE)          CATALOG(PART_NUM) 
</pre>

<p>
The <i>field_expr</i> can be either a string or numeric expression.  

<p>
<a name="index_x_181"></a>
You can use a string constant to specify the field name.  If you give the 
field name as a string constant, you need not enclose it in quotes.  
INTOUCH will use the string constant as the field name: 

<p><pre>
                      PRINT CL(LAST) 
                                / 
           the field is specified by its field name 
</pre>

<p>
If you specify the field as an expression, you will need to precede 
the expression with a pound sign (#).  The pound sign tells INTOUCH 
that the following characters are an expression, not the field name.  
If you do not include the pound sign, INTOUCH will interpret the 
characters as a field name.  Here are two examples: 

<p><pre>
                     PRINT CL(#FIELDNAME$) 
                                 / 
          the field is specified by the variable FIELDNAME$ 
 
 
                     PRINT CL(#FIELDNUM) 
                              / 
          the field is specified by the variable FIELDNUM 
</pre>

<p>
See Section 14.8.1.1, FIELD Expressions for an example of a 
program that uses field expressions. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.7"><h2>3.2.7 Multiple Occurrence Fields</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_182"></a>
<a name="index_x_183"></a>

<p>
Fields with multiple occurrences (single dimension array) are supported. 

<p>
When defining a field with multiple occurrences, the length of the field 
must be the length of a single occurrence.  Individual occurrences of a 
field are accessed by including the occurrence number in the field 
expression.

<a name="heading_3.2.8"><h2>3.2.8 Compound Expressions</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_184"></a>

<p>
You can use <b>compound expressions</b> in your programs.  
Compound expressions consist of operators and operands.  There are 
three types of compound expressions: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li>Numeric expressions
  <li>String expressions
  <li>Conditional expressions
</ul>

</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.8.1"><h3>3.2.8.1 Numeric Expressions</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_185"></a>
<a name="index_x_186"></a>
<a name="index_x_187"></a>

<p>
<b>Numeric expressions</b> consist of numeric (integer or real) 
variables, constants or expressions separated by arithmetic operators.  
The arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, and ^. 

<p><pre>
                        Constants    Variables 
 
                       
        +         Add 
 
                        4%+2%        Z + TWO16 
 
        -         Subtract 
 
                        4%-2%        Z - TWO16 
 
        /         Divide 
 
                        4%/2%        Z / TWO16 
 
        *         Multiply 
 
                        4%*2%        Z * TWO16 
 
        ^         Raise to a power 
 
                        4%^2%        Z ^ TWO16 
 
</pre>

<p>
You can combine any number of these operators in an expression. 

<p><pre>
        4 + Z ^ TWO16                Z * TWO16 / 2 
</pre>

<p>
You cannot generally use two arithmetic operators next to each other.  
However, you can use a + or - sign to indicate a positive or negative 
number.  For example: 

<p><pre>
                TOTAL * -2   =   TOTAL * (-2) 
                TOTAL / +2   =   TOTAL / (+2) 
</pre>

<p>
If all the values in an arithmetic expression are of the same data 
type, the result of the expression will be that data type.  For 
example, if an expression consists only of integer numbers, it will 
yield an integer result.  If an expression consists only of real 
numbers, the result will be a real number.  If an expression consists 
of integers and real numbers, the result will be a real number.  If 
the target of a real calculation is an integer (a% = 1.5 + 2.8) the 
result is rounded before it is assigned to the target. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.8.2"><h3>3.2.8.2 String Expressions</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_188"></a>
<a name="index_x_189"></a>
<a name="index_x_190"></a>

<p>
<b>String expressions</b> are strings concatenated (joined). 
String expressions can be joined by a plus sign (+) or by an ampersand (&amp;). 
INTOUCH evaluates this type of string expression by concatenating the 
strings.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  z$ = 'MO' + 'TH' &amp; 'ER' 
        20  PRINT z$ 
        30  END 
 
        RNH 
        MOTHER 
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, INTOUCH joins the strings separated by a plus sign 
and an ampersand, and assigns their value to Z$.  You can include string 
constants, variables, functions, etc. in your string expressions.  
For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  LET last$ = ' is it.' 
        20  PRINT 'This' + last$ 
        30  END 
 
        RNH 
        This is it. 
</pre>

<a name="heading_3.2.8.3"><h3>3.2.8.3 Conditional Expressions</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_191"></a>
<a name="index_x_192"></a>

<p>
<b>Conditional expressions</b> are expressions which yield a 
<b>TRUE</b> (1) or <b>FALSE</b> (0) value.  Conditional 
expressions are created by using either relational or logical operators.  
When INTOUCH evaluates a conditional expression, it returns a value of either 
TRUE or FALSE.  If the expression is TRUE, INTOUCH returns the integer 1.  
If the expression is FALSE, INTOUCH returns the integer 0. 

<p>
<h2>Conditional Numeric Expressions</h2>

<a name="index_x_193"></a>

<p>
<a name="index_x_194"></a>
Relational operators are similar to those used in algebra.  The relational 
operators are: 

<p><pre>
 
=      equals                           X=Y           X is equal to Y 
 
&lt;      less than                        X&lt;Y           X is less than Y 
 
&gt;      greater than                     X&gt;Y           X is greater than Y 
 
&lt;=     less than or equal to            X&lt;=Y          X is less than or equal 
                                                        to Y 
 
&gt;=     greater than or equal to         X&gt;=Y          X is greater than or 
                                                        equal to Y 
 
&lt;&gt;     not equal to                     X&lt;&gt;Y          X is not equal to Y 
 
</pre>

<p>
X and Y can be any unconditional or conditional expression. 

<p>
<h2>Performing Relational Operations on Strings</h2>

<p>
When you perform relational operations on strings, INTOUCH determines which 
string occurs first in the the ASCII collating sequence and returns 
<b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b>.  For instance, when you 
perform relational operations on two strings, INTOUCH checks the ASCII 
values for each character in each string.  INTOUCH compares the strings 
character by character--using these ASCII values--and determines where 
there is a difference in the values. 

<p>
When INTOUCH finds a character that differs, it compares the two and 
determines which one is less (which has a smaller ASCII code number). 
INTOUCH then returns a TRUE or FALSE value depending on the relational 
expression.   For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  a$ = 'TEXT' 
            b$ = 'TEST' 
            MESSAGE$ = 'Strings are equal' 
        20  IF  a$ &lt; b$  THEN  message$ = a$ + ' is less than ' + b$ 
            IF  b$ &lt; a$  THEN  message$ = b$ + ' is less than ' + a$ 
        30  PRINT message$ 
        40  END 
 
        RNH 
        TEST is less than TEXT 
</pre>

<p>
INTOUCH compares the two strings.  They are identical up to the third 
character.  The ASCII value of S is 53.  The ASCII value of X is 58.  
Therefore INTOUCH prints "TEST is less than TEXT". 

<p>
<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<a name="index_x_195"></a>

<p>
The logical operators are: 

<p><pre>
NOT     NOT X           <b>TRUE</b>  if X is false and 
                        <b>FALSE</b> if X is true. 
 
AND     X AND Y         <b>TRUE</b>  if X and Y are true. 
 
OR      X OR Y          <b>TRUE</b>  if X or Y is true. 
 
XOR     X XOR Y         <b>TRUE</b>  if X is true, or if Y is true but 
                          <b>FALSE</b> if both X and Y are true. 
 
EQV     X EQV Y         <b>TRUE</b>  if X and Y are true, or 
                        <b>TRUE</b>  if X and Y are false, 
                          but <b>FALSE</b> otherwise. 
 
IMP     X IMP Y         <b>TRUE</b> if X is true and Y is false. 
</pre>

<p>
X and Y can be any expressions.  Logical operators are usually used on 
integers or expressions which yield an integer result such as conditional 
expressions.  Logical operators will always yield an integer result.  If 
a logical operator is used on a real number, the real number is rounded 
and the resulting integer is used. 

<p>
Logical expressions always return an integer value.  If the integer value 
is a 1, the expression is TRUE.  If the integer value is a 0, the expression 
is FALSE.  (NOT 0 is equal to -1 and is TRUE.  NOT 1 is equal to -2 and is 
FALSE.) 

<p><pre>
                          VALUE     TRUE   FALSE 
                      +--------------------------+ 
                      |        0  |      |   X   | 
                      |-----------|------|-------| 
                      |        1  |   X  |       | 
                      |-----------|------|-------| 
                      | NOT 0 (-1)|   X  |       | 
                      |-----------|------|-------| 
                      | NOT 1 (-2)|      |   X   | 
                      +--------------------------+ 
</pre>

<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> If a logical operator is used on a real expression, the expression 
        is rounded and the resulting integer value is operated upon. 
  <li> Integers are represented as a signed 32-bit quantity. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
<h2>Bit Manipulation</h2>

<a name="index_x_196"></a>

<p>
Logical operators can be used to do <b>bit manipulation</b>. 
Computers represent values in a binary code, using ones and zeros.  
INTOUCH integer values are represented as a 32-bit binary longword.  A bit 
which is set to 1 is considered on.  A bit which is set to 0 is off.  
The value of the word is equal to the value of all the bits which are 
on, added together.  For example: 

<p><pre>
           0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1  =  16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23 
</pre>

<p>
The last bit has a value of 1.  The second to the last bit has a value of 2. 
The third bit has a value of 4, the fourth a value of 8, the fifth bit has 
a value of 16, and so on.  Each bit has a value double that of the previous 
one. 

<p><pre>
                0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 
         --------------------------------------------- 
               128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1 
</pre>

<p>
Bits can be manipulated and tested using logical operators.  The logical 
operators work on bits.  They compare each position in each word according 
to the particular rules of the logical operator.  For instance, here is 
the <b>AND</b> operator used on two values: 

<p><pre>
        10  LET a% = 23%       ! 00010111 
        20  LET b% = 37%       ! 00100101 
        30  LET c% = (a% AND b%) 
        40  PRINT c% 
        50  END 
 
        RNH 
         5 
</pre>

<p>
When INTOUCH executes this program, it compares the two values.  It sets a 
bit in the result to 1 (on), only if both the bits at a given position are 
on (1).  The value of the resultant word is 5.  

<p><pre>
                A%    0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 = 23 
                B%    0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 = 37 
                      --------------- 
                C%    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 =  5 
</pre>

<a name="heading_3.2.9"><h2>3.2.9 Order of Evaluation</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_197"></a>
<a name="index_x_198"></a>

<p>
When INTOUCH evaluates an expression, it evaluates it in a specific order. 
INTOUCH evaluates expressions from left to right. 

<p><pre>
        1+Z+4                 equals          (1+Z)+4 
        1+Z-4                 equals          (1+Z)-4 
 
        3*4/QUANTITY          equals          (3*4)/QUANTITY 
        12/QUANTITY*3         equals          (12/QUANTITY)*3 
</pre>

<p>
The following priorities take precedence over the left to right 
evaluation rule: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ol>
  <li> INTOUCH always evaluates expressions in parentheses first.  Parentheses, 
        ( ), can be used to change the order of any of the following 
        operations.  If parentheses are nested, INTOUCH evaluates them 
        from the inside out.  For example: 

<p><pre>
                Z%-(X% / (Y% + AMOUNT)) 
</pre>

    <br>        INTOUCH evaluates the expression Y% + AMOUNT first.  Next, it divides 
        the X% by AMOUNT to determine that result.  Finally, it subtracts 
        the entire sum from Z%. 
  <li> INTOUCH performs functions second. 
  <li> INTOUCH performs exponentiation. 
  <li> INTOUCH performs multiplication and division. 
  <li> INTOUCH performs addition and subtraction. 
  <li> INTOUCH performs relational operations from left to right.  (The 
        relational operators are: =, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= and &lt;&gt;.)  The only 
        exception is the assignment of the result.  The result is always 
        assigned last. 
  <li> INTOUCH performs logical operations in the following order: 

  <ul>
    <li> NOT
    <li> AND
    <li> OR
    <li> XOR
    <li> IMP
    <li> EQV
  </ul>
</ul>

<a name="chapter_4"><h1>Chapter 4<br>Writing and Debugging INTOUCH Programs</h1></a>

<p>
This chapter describes some statements that are used in basically all 
INTOUCH programs.  It also describes the INTOUCH debug facilities and 
how to use them. 

<p>

<a name="heading_4.1"><h1>4.1 Comments</h1></a>
<a name="index_x_199"></a>

<p>
You might want to include comments in programs.  Comments are not 
executable statements.  They are simply included in source code for 
informational purposes.  They are seen when a program is listed or 
printed out.  However, INTOUCH will ignore them when it executes a 
program. 

<p>
There are two types of comments allowed in INTOUCH: REM comments 
and exclamation points (!).  The following example shows each of

<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>

<dl>

<p>
Use <b>REM</b> to put remarks on program lines.  You can use 
these remarks to clarify your code. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
When a program is listed on the screen or printed out, the REM lines are 
displayed exactly as they were written in the source code. 

<p>
A REM statement must be placed at the beginning of a program line.  INTOUCH 
ignores the REM statement and everything after it up until the end of the 
line and it continues execution at the next executable line.  REM can be 
used anywhere in a multiple line statement.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$ 
            REM Print hello 
            PRINT 'Hello, '; name$ 
        20  END 
 
        RNH 
        Please enter your name? Lucy 
        Hello, Tom 
</pre>

<p>
When the above program is run, INTOUCH executes the INPUT statement, 
ignores the REM statement, and then executes the PRINT and END statements.

<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
Use the <b>!</b> to put comments in a program.  
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
You can use comments to clarify parts of your program as shown in the 
example above. 

<p>
When the program is listed or printed, the "!" line is displayed as it 
was written in the source code. 

<p>
When INTOUCH executes the above program, it executes the INPUT statement, 
ignores the "!" and the comment text following it and continues execution 
at the PRINT statement.  The "!" does not have to be placed at the beginning 
of a physical line.  It can be used anywhere on a program line.  

<p>
<i>The Exclamation Point with Line Continuation</i>

<p>
The exclamation point can be used after an ampersand to document 
continued lines.  When a line is continued with an ampersand, any 
comments must <b>follow</b> the ampersand.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  INPUT a$ 
            IF  a$ = ''  THEN  PRINT a$; &amp;     ! Here is the trailing 
                ' is OK.'                      ! comment text 
        20 END

<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>

Use the <b>TILDE</b> to highlight and/or border parts of your 
program source code. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
The tilde can be used to clarify or highlight code.  Tildes appear when 
the program is listed or printed but INTOUCH ignores them when it executes 
the program.  Tildes within quotes ('~~') are treated as string constants.

<p>
PROGRAM is used to name programs.  <i>prog_name</i> is the program 
name.  The program name must meet the specifications for variable names. 
It must: 

<ul>
  <li> start with a letter. 
  <li> can consist of letters, numbers, and/or underscore characters (_). 
  <li> can be up to, but not longer than 39 characters.

<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
Use the <b>END</b> statement to end program execution.  If you 
have <i>EXTERNAL</i> subprograms or functions, use END to mark the 
end of the main program unit. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
The END statement marks the end of a program.  When INTOUCH executes the 
END statement, it: 

<ul>
  <li> Writes all active output buffers and closes all files in the current 
        program. 
  <li> Exits the current program and returns to the INTOUCH prompt if in 
        the environment. 
</ul>

<p>
The END statement does not have to be the last physical line in a program. 
If you have subprograms, functions, etc., they can physically follow the 
END statement.  However, END marks the end of the source code for the main 
program unit.

<p>
Use <b>STOP</b> to terminate program execution where you do not 
want to mark the physical end of your program. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
STOP behaves exactly as the END statement does.  However, STOP does not 
mark the end of a program. 

<p>
STOP ends program execution and returns control to the INTOUCH environment. 
For instance, the example program would run as follows: 

<p><pre>
        RNH 
        Please enter your name? Ted 
        How old are you? .5 
        Not a valid age

            IF  age &lt; 1  THEN 
              PRINT 'Not a valid age' 
              HALT 
            END IF 
        20  PRINT name$; ' is'; age 
        30  END 
 
        RNH 
        Please enter your name? Tex 
        How old are you? 0 
        Not a valid age

        INTOUCH 
</pre>

<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
Use <b>HALT</b> if you want to interrupt program execution, 
check values, and then continue execution. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
HALT interrupts program execution, but it does not close any files, 
nor does it write the active output buffer.  HALT interrupts program 
execution and returns to the INTOUCH prompt.  Execution can be 
continued with the GO command.  

<p>
The EXAMPLE program would run as follows: 

<p><pre>
        RNH 
        Please enter your name? Tex 
        How old are you? 0 
        Not a valid age 
        Halt at 10.4 
 
        INTOUCH 
 
        let age = 34 
 
        INTOUCH 
 
        go 
        Tex is 34
