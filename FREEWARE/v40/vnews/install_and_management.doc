VNEWS - A NATIVE VMS NEWS READING PROGRAM         VERSION 1.40 June, 1991
                                                  updated to V1.41, Aug, 1991

1.0 INTRODUCTION

    VNews is a user agent program for reading news.  The news database is
    not kept on the VMS machine, instead the nntp protocol is used to
    access the data on a server machine.  VNEWS supports the following
    network software combinations:
	
	DECnet
	TGV's Multinet (V2 and V3)
	Wollongong WINS/TCP (V5.2 and prior)
	CMU-TEK TCP/IP
	Process Software's TCPware
	Digital's Ultrix Connection (UCX)

1.1 FAST START

    If you're the impatient type, do the following:

	1) $ delete vnews.opt;
	2) $ edit site_specific.def
	3) IF you have more than 1500 groups, $ edit news.def and 
		change MX_GROUP to be correct for your site
	4) $ mms  (or @compile_vnews; @link_vnews)
	5) $ assign "your.dns.name" nntp_host_name
	6) $ vnews :== $my_disk:[my_dir]vnews
	7) $ vnews

    Now, please read the rest of this file before unleashing VNEWS on
    everyone else.

2.0 BUILDING NEWS

    VNEWS comes with two sets of build procedures.  If you have MAKE, MMS
    or a similar program you can use the included MAKEFILE to rebuild the
    code.

    Almost all of VNEWS is written in FORTRAN.  BCOPY.MAR and HTONS.MAR, 
    which are needed by some TCP/IPs, are in Macro-32.  For CMU users, there 
    is a single source file in C, GETHOSTBYNAME.C

    BEFORE YOU TRY AND BUILD VNEWS, EDIT SITE_SPECIFIC.DEF!

MMS users:

    Delete VNEWS.OPT, and then:

	To compile VNEWS for Multinet: MMS
	To compile VNEWS for Wollongong (versions prior to 5.2):
					 MMS/macro="WIN=foo"
	To compile VNEWS for Wollongong (version 5.2 and above):
					 MMS/macro="WIN52=foo"
	To compile VNEWS for CMU: MMS/macro="CMU=bar"
	To compile VNEWS for UCX: MMS/macro="UCX=baz"
	To compile VNEWS for DECnet: MMS/macro="DECNET=zap"
	To compile VNEWS for TCPware: MMS/macro="PSC=boo"
	
    The MMS file has additional magic in it if you're into debugging;
    try typing out the file to see it.

Command procedure users:

    COMPILE_VNEWS.COM - compile the software.

    LINK_VNEWS.COM - Link the object modules into an executable.  You
    can let it guess which TCP you're running, or you can provide an
    argument as P1 to the procedure.

3.0 SITE SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION

    SITE_SPECIFIC.DEF contains all of the site specific information.  The code
    is initally configured for sites at the University of Arizona.

    VNEWS supports the following site specific customizations:

----------------------+-----------------------+---------------------
    Parameter		Logical Name?		Variable?
----------------------+-----------------------+---------------------
    Site name		NNTP_HOST_NAME		no, must use logical
			or ARPANET_HOST_NAME	
                        or INTERNET_HOST_NAME
                        or UCX$INET_HOST

    Editor		NNTP_EDITOR		yes
			or NNTP_VISUAL
			or MAIL$EDIT

    Personal Name	NNTP_NAME		yes
			or, in MAILUAF
			or, in SYSUAF
			or, USERNAME

    Organization	NNTP_ORGANIZATION	yes

    Mailer		NNTP_MAILPOSTER		yes

    News Server		NNTP_SERVER		yes

    DECnet task		NNTP_TASK		yes
    (only if using DECnet)

    Print command	NNTP_NEWS_PRINT		yes

    Valid destinations	no			yes

    Distribution  	no			yes

    Authinfo - username	no			yes
             - password	no			yes

    Timezone		NNTP_TIMEZONE		yes
			or, MULTINET_TIMEZONE
			or, JAN_TIME_ZONE

    XX.NewsRC location	NNTP_NEWSRC_LOCATION	yes

    Reply-to: header	NNTP_REPLY		no, must use logical
----------------------+-----------------------+---------------------


    If you have lots of groups, or groups which have very long names,
    look in NEWS.DEF for the appropriate constants. 

3.1 MANAGING VNEWS

    The hardest part about managing VNEWS is handling the time zone
    thing.  You'll have to remember to fix the appropriate logical
    name (NNTP_TIMEZONE) every time your system changes time zones.  
    Either that, or move to Arizona.

    Most anything you want to change will be in SITE_SPECIFIC.DEF.
    If that doesn't help, look in NEWS.DEF (this will be particularly
    appropriate if you have unusually long group names, or zillions
    of groups).  Finally, if you want to fool with the headers of
    messages before people get to post them, look in VALIDATE_HEADERS,
    which gives you that opportunity.

    If you have plenty of disk space and memory, you may want to explore
    replacing YOW.DEF with BIGYOW.DEF.

    Depending on your server, VNEWS can be very slow for certain
    operations.  In particular, ANU News users may find that VNEWS stalls
    for a very long time during start up.  If you'd like to speed up
    the start up of VNEWS, then simply comment out the line which
    calls NNTP_Get_New_Groups() from NEWS.FOR.  This is a part of VNEWS
    which is under construction right now, and you can safely discard
    this line (which will give users a little less information). 

    I'd also be interested in hearing from any VNEWS users who have
    servers that DON'T support the NEWGROUPS command.  This feedback will
    affect how VNEWS gets updated in the next release.

3.2 COMMON PROBLEMS

    A lot of people have logical names "NEWS" or "VNEWS" on their system.
    Such logicals will make the compile and build procedures blow up,
    or otherwise behave in an anti-social manner.  

    You may need privileges for any of the MAIL commands to work, or
    to install VNEWS with privileges.  VNEWS is not as dumb as it looks
    when it comes to privileges: it turns them off as soon as it
    starts, and only turns them on in the middle of MAIL transactions.
    Nevertheless, be careful.  It's a jungle out there.

    The way that VNEWS attempts to do editing is by looking for its
    own logical name (NNTP_EDITOR or NNTP_VISUAL), and then for anything
    you may have set up to work with VMS MAIL (MAIL$EDIT).  This could
    have some consequences for your users.  Beware of VNEWS blow-ups which
    happen when people try to edit files (replies and posts).  Some
    careful debugging of logical names may be appropriate here.  

    The most common problem of all seems to be not having an appropriate
    maximum group name.  If your server is hosting the wonderfully bogus
    group alt.desert.storm.its.not.scud.its.al-hussein.dammit, then
    you'll have to increase NwsGrpSz to 64 from 48.  Or, issue an 
    rmgroup for the stupid thing.

4.0 RUNNING VNEWS 

    You can run VNews with a foreign command, you can install it in the
    system DCL tables.  VNEWS requires no privileges.  However, some
    TCP/IP mailers require that you be installed with privileges to
    send mail.  The best thing to do is NOT install with privileges,
    and attempt to send mail (try using the S command).  If it fails,
    you'll need to add some appropriate privilege.

4.1 RUNNING VNEWS WITHOUT INSTALLING IT

    Define the foreign command VNEWS to point to the VNEWS image.  For
    example:

	$ VNEWS :== $disk$kludgey:[jms.wrk.vnews]vnews

    Now run VNews with the VNews command.  Define any logicals that are
    needed (see Site Specific information above) prior to issuing the
    command.  If VNEWS requires privileges to work with your mailer,
    then you'll have to construct a suitable install file.

4.2 INSTALLING VNEWS

    In order to install VNews on a system wide basis you need to do the
    following:

    1a) Edit VNEWS.CLD to point to the location of the VNEWS executable,
    by changing the IMAGE line (note: you will have to change it back
    to re-compile VNEWS) OR
    
    1b) Define a logical name VNEWS which points to the VNEWS executable,
    OR

    1c) Put VNEWS.EXE in SYS$SYSTEM

    2) Find out whether you need to install VNEWS with privileges
    to use your mailer.

    3) Add the VNews command to the system command tables:

	$ Set command/Table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
	             /Output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
		    VNews.CLD
	$ mcr install
	INSTALL> sys$common:[syslib]dcltables.exe/replace

    If installing in a cluster, you should remember
    to use INSTALL to REPLACE DCLTABLES on each node in the cluster.

8.0 VNEWS HELP LIST

    Jim Gerland has set up a VNEWS mailing list.  To subscribe, send a mail
    message to LISTSERV@UBVM.BITNET containing the line
    SUBSCRIBE VNEWS-L. You can post by sending to
    VNEWS-L@UBVM.BITNET.  It may be possible to gateway between 
    Internet and BITNET, if your system doesn't know how to, by
    sending via PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU (i.e., LISTSERV%UBVM@PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU).
    On the other hand, it may not---depends on how Princeton feels
    about being a gateway.

    If you want to read about vnews using vnews, subscribe to the
    group bit.listserv.vnews-l.

9.0 VNEWS CONFIGURATION DATABASE AND HELP TEAM

    I'd like to get a feel for who's running VNEWS and what TCP/IP they're
    using.  If you have a chance, drop me an email note with the
    following:
	Version of VMS (5 or 4),
	Type and version of TCP/IP (or DECnet, if you're using that)
	Type and version of NNTP server (like ANU news or whatever)
	Approximate number of systems running VNEWS
    Also, if you DON'T want me to give your name out to someone in your
    area who might be having problems with VNEWS, let me know. I can
    keep a secret.
