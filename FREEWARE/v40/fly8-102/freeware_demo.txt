OpenVMS port of Fly8 version 1.02:
==================================

You can run FLY8 in demo mode via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure (warning, a 
FLY.LOG file is created under SYS$LOGIN directory). To run FLY8 in  normal
mode (where you can define targets, drones, and pilot your plane), look at the
installation procedure, or run it via FLY symbol after executing the demo
(FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure defines all needded symbols and logicals).

Look at FLY8.DOC file to find the commands.

Exit:  ESC X yes   (ESC = CTRL 3 on VMS keyboards)

Sources are available under [.SRC] directory in FLY8_102.ZIP file

To rebuild and/or install:
=========================
You need DEC C to compile it (tested with DEC C 4.0 under VAX-VMS 6.0)

Build procedure on VAX/VMS with DEC C 4.0:

$ @COMPILE_PORTABLE_VMS_DECC.COM   ! compilation of portable procedure
$ set def [.VMS]
$ @COMPILE_VMS_DECC.COM   ! compilation of VMS-specific procedures
$ set def [-]
$ @LINK_VMS_DECC.COM      ! Link all this stuff


Build procedure on AXP/VMS 6.1 with DEC C 4.0 (not tested with DEC C 1.3
and AXP/VMS 1.5):

$ @COMPILE_PORTABLE_VMS_DECC.COM   ! compilation of portable procedure
$ set def [.VMS]
$ @COMPILE_VMS_AXP.COM    ! compilation of VMS-specific procedures  (with
                            /PREFIX=ALL)
$ set def [-]
$ @LINK_VMS_DECC.COM      ! Link all this stuff

Install procedure:

FLY8 directory is provided with all the necessary stuff to run FLY8. You just
need to install it somewhere on your system and copy the executable (VAX or
AXP or both ...) into. Now you can define a logical name FLY8_DIR pointing
on this directory and a DCL symbol with -F option to run FLY8 in a comfortable
way:

$ copy fly8.exe [-.FLY8]* /log     ! exe in the fly8 data directory
$ define FLY_DIR the_FLY8_data_directory  ! logical name needed
$ fly :== "$DISK:[XXXX.FLY8]fly8 """-F FLY_DIR:""""   ! DCL symbol

DO NOT DEFINE FLY8 SYMBOL TO RUN FLY8 ... FLY8 symbol is used to pass
arguments..... You run Fly8 invoking FLY symbol. Delete FLY8 symbol if you have
already created it.

$ fly                    ! Normal mode

$ fly -z5                ! demo mode

etc ...

A VMS Help file is provided (FLY.HLP), you can install it in one of yours
help libraries.


Enjoy.
