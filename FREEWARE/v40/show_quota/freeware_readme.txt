SHOW_QUOTA, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Show quota available/left for a process

This procedure shows the given quota and the remaining quota of a process. 
It uses the process id as first parameter. 

Take the results as an idea of how much quota is used. Do not take all 
the values for granted because they are updated in a certain interval.
Specialy the peak values may differ from what SHOW PROCESS/ACCOUNTING 
does give you.
