You'll need Motif or Lesstif if you don't have either you can get
lesstif from ftp://pain.csrv.uidaho.edu/pub/hungry/lesstif
vgp is know to work with lesstif-0.3.

	1) configure
	2) make
	3) demo

If you include files and/or libraries for X-windows and Motif are
not in the usually place, you may have to add -I options to the
compilation and the full path of the libraries to the link line.

This program has been successfully tested on:

Machine		OS			Motif	Lesstif

DEC Alpha	OSF/1 2.0,3.0,3.2	 X	 X

At this point the execuable should be built and you can copy it to any
directory in your path (e.g. /usr/local/bin).  Optionally, there is
also a 'Vgp' app-defaults file.  Change the colors as you like and
either copy this file to /usr/X11/lib/app-defaults or append the
contents to your ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources files. There is also a
man page 'vgp.1'.  If you would like these all put in the standard
/usr/X11 locations and you have the permissions needed to do so, use:

	4) make install

Octave is a great Matlab copy from the Free Software Foundation
written by John Eaton.  If you use Octave there are two m-files
included in this distribution which you can use to call 'vgp' from
Octave.  'stostr.m' is a little utility to get around the lack of
string referencing in pre-version 1.2 octave.  vgp.m is the actual
m-file to send a vector to vgp. Usage: vgp(set1, set2, set3,
...). Each setn should have be 3xN or Nx3. Octave can be obtained from
ftp://bevo.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave
