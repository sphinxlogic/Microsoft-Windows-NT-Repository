                                    PASLIB
                                    ------


PASLIB is my attempt to make available to Pascal programmers, System Service and
RTL routine declarations as well as some system constants which are not
currently in any Digital-supplied Pascal environment files.

This work was done circa VMS v3.7 and was kept up-to-date until circa VMS v5.4.
It has met my needs here without a massive update to include newly available
routines and constants since then, although redundant declarations from OpenVMS
v6.* have been removed from the Alpha variety.  I have only included constants
where my need required them - most of the unsupplied bits of LIB.MLB are not
there at all.

There are two versions - one for OpenVMS VAX v5.* and one for OpenVMS v6.*.

I have not attempted to remove any site-specific stuff, although there is
very little of that anyway.

This is provided on an "as is" basis - I'm happy to provide advice (and take
it!), but please understand that the package is not supported by me.

I hope you find it useful.
