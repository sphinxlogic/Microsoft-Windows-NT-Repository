PasLib, LANGUAGES, DEC Pascal declarations not in STARLET

PASLIB has been  developed  to  allow  Pascal  programmers  to take full
advantage of many Digital library and system routines which increase the
ease  of use, and scope of application of the language.  In  combination
with  the  Digital-supplied  programming  language  facilities  such  as
STARLET,  PASLIB  provides  the  Pascal  programmer with a comprehensive
environment for both application  and  systems programming.  It is usual
to  INHERIT environment files which contain the appropriate declarations
for the programming  environment  concerned.   The  files  available  in
STARLET are detailed in the HELP sub- topic entitled Source_Code.

Most  Run-Time  Library  and  Utility  routines  that  are  not  already
available  in  Digital-supplied software are declared in  PASLIB.   Some
routines have been omitted where the same functionality is available  in
intrinsic Pascal functions.  These intrinsic functions should be used in
preference to any equivalent RTL or Utility routines.
