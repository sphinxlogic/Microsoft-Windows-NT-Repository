
              OpenVMS Freeware for VAX and Alpha Systems

              The OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM set contains free software 
              tools and utilities to aid software developers in creating
              applications and managing and using OpenVMS systems.

              Many of these tools are popular packages already widely
              known and in use, while others are internally developed
              Compaq tools our engineers are making available to our
              OpenVMS customers.  For example, the OpenVMS Freeware 
              CD-ROM set includes the Bliss-32 language for OpenVMS 
              VAX, and the Bliss-32, Bliss-64, and Macro64 languages 
              for OpenVMS Alpha.

              Features of the Freeware CD-ROM set:

              The Freeware CD-ROM set includes the following features:

              o  Includes an easy-to-use 4GL-based menu system for
                 examining the contents of the CD-ROM set.

              o  Contains binaries, source code (except for specific
                 Compaq-provided packages), and documentation.

              o  Represents some of the most popular, most often
                 requested free packages, plus new items never before
                 made public.

                 using SEARCH or other tools directly on the CD-ROM set.

              Disclaimer on Testing, Quality, and Licensing

              The OpenVMS Freeware for VAX and Alpha Systems CD-ROM set
              is provided "AS IS" without warranty. Compaq imposes no
              restrictions on its distribution, nor on the redistribution
              of anything on it. Be aware, however, that some of the
              packages on the CD-ROM set may carry restrictions on their

              Compaq Equipment Corporation is providing this software
              free of charge and without warranty. Included in the
              [FREEWARE] directory on this CD are the GNU software
              licenses. Unless otherwise stated in sources or source
              packages, the GNU licenses cover all software supplied on
              this CD.

              It is provided to the customer as a free service.

	      Note: The menu system provides some insight into what is on
		this disk, but for best information read the files in
		this ([000000]) directory, AAAREADME.V3 and the abstract
		which contain much more information. The 60 character
		limitation in the menu system loses a vast amount of
		information. The abstract tries to do better and still
		be readable in a short time.

	      How to use the menu system included with the Freeware
              CD-ROM set:

	       1. Mount the volume(s) of the freeware CD-ROM in an
                  available CD-ROM drive:

                   $! packages A through P
		   $ MOUNT ddcu: FREEWAREV4_1

                   $! packages Q through Z
		   $ MOUNT ddcu: FREEWAREV4_2

	       2. Invoke the menu command file.

		   $ @DISK$FREEWAREV4_1:[FREEWARE]FREEWARE_MENU

		   $ @DISK$FREEWAREV4_2:[FREEWARE]FREEWARE_MENU

              on the OpenVMS Web site located at:

              Note too that the freeware CD-ROM set contains a directory 
              [000TOOLS] which contains many unpacking tools, and a file
              [000000]AAAREADME.V% which contains the text of all the
              FREEWARE_README.TXT files -- this file can be browsed from 
              any text viewer or text editor.
