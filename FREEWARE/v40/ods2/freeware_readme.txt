ODS2, affinity, Read OpenVMS disk volumes on PC

ODS2 is a program to read OpenVMS disk volumes. While it will
run on OpenVMS it is generally useful only when reading VMS floppy
disks or CDs on a PC running Windows 95, Windows NT or OS/2.

Program functions include being able to mount, perform a directory,
search files, or copy files from an OpenVMS volume. Search and copy
functions are restricted to sequential file formats.

Included are compiled versions of the program for Alpha/VMS,
VAX/VMS and Intel/Windows (95 & NT).

This program includes full C source so that it can be adapted
for use on other operating systems as required. The source
also contains various VMS date routines which may be useful
in other programs.

There is no support for this program, but suggestions can be sent
