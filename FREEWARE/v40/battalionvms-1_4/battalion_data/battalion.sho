(do not delete this file)

If you are running _battalion_ on a machine
other than a Silicon Graphics workstation
then you can rename this file as:
battalion.sho and save yourself a couple
megabytes of disc space.

_battalion_ needs a file named battalion.sho
to figure out its directory structure but only
Silicon Grpahics workstations have Showcase
which is the program that battalion.sho (the
graphical help) is viewable under.
