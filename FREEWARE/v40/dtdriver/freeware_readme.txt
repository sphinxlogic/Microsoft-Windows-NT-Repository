DTDRIVER, SOFTWARE, Device driver for TC-11/TU56 DECtape

The steam locomotive is an overweight, underpowered, fussy, expensive
to own and operate, totally obsolete source of motive power. And yet
is carries an undying charm that attracts many people. The same thing
can be said of DECtape.

DECtape was a random-access tape storage device that used a 3/4" tape
to emulate a disk. The 4" diameter DECtape reel fit comfortably in
your back pocket (unless you dressed like John Travolta) and had a
capacity of 296KB. The concept of DECtape originated at the M.I.T
Lincoln Laboratory and was originally called LincTape. Out of this
Digital developed the first personal storage media product in 1964.

It was always a bit dumpy in terms of speed and capacity, but its
reliability was legendary. There are tales of DECtapes continuing to
work after being dropped into a mud puddle, washed off in a sink, and
hung up to dry; of working until the oxide was so worn off you could
see through it; of a drive with a burned out motor successfully used
by hand-cranking the tape with a pencil.

Nowadays, like the steam locomotive, DECtape is hopelessly overpriced
and underpowered (I've seen Postcript preambles that would overflow
the tape), but it's still a blast to watch it run. Be the first
on your block to run a real museumpiece!
