XBAE-35, MOTIF_TOYS, Matrix and Caption Motif widgets 

bae Library Version 3.5 (see src/version.c)
Xbae 3.5 is the first public release.


The Xbae library is a set of two Motif widgets, XbaeMatrix and
XbaeCaption.  It was developed using X11R4/X11R5 and Motif 1.1.[0-4]
under SunOS 4.1.1.  It has also been built on an IBM RS/6000 running
AIX 3.2 and a Pyramid running OSx 5.1 (under the bsd universe).  It
should be pretty portable to other platforms.
