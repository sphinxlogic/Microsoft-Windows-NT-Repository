   NAME
     mxrn/dxrn - an X-based interface to the USENET news system that uses the
     NNTP remote news server

   SYNOPSIS
     mxrn is an X-based interface to the USENET news system that uses the
     NNTP remote news server for accessing newsgroups and articles.  By using
     the NNTP server, users can read news from personal workstations with the
     program accessing the news groups and articles from a central repository
     on the local area network.  This manual page applies to version 6.18.

   BASIC OPERATION

     Don't let the size of this manual page alarm you.  mxrn is easy to learn
     on-line without reading the documentation.  This manual page describes
     many features that may be obvious to the casual observer, along with a
     large section on customization (such as choosing colors and fonts).  It


   X                                                                        1






   MXRN(1)                                                         3 Mar 1993


     also describes how to use scroll bars, buttons, and select text; if you
     have used an X toolkit application before, the section titled "BUTTONS,
     SCROLL BARS, and SELECTION" can be skipped.

     mxrn uses the `.newsrc' file to determine what groups need to be read.
     If the `.newsrc' file does not exist, it is created, and the user is
     subscribed to the news group `news.announce.newusers'.

     mxrn has four modes of operation: Add, Newsgroup, All, and Article
     modes.  Add mode will be entered on startup if there are any groups that
     the news system knows about that are not in the `.newsrc' file (i.e.,
     new groups).  In Add mode, the user is given a list of new groups.
     Groups can then be subscribed to and placed in the `.newsrc' file at the
     first position, the last position, or after a group already in the
     `.newsrc' file.  When Add mode is exited, any remaining groups are added
     unsubscribed, so the user is not asked about them the next time mxrn is
     started.  On exit from Add mode, or on startup if there are no new
     groups, Newsgroup mode is entered.  Newsgroup mode displays the
     subscribed to groups that have unread articles and the range of
     available articles.  The basic functions available in this mode allow
     the user to read a group, mark all articles in a group as read,
     unsubscribe from a group, move the cursor around the newsgroup window,
     change the order of the list of newsgroups, re-visit the most recently
     visited group, and quit mxrn.  In addition, the user can subscribe to a
     group and specify its position in the `.newsrc' file, query the news
     server for new articles and groups, and go to groups that are either not
     subscribed to or currently have no unread articles (i.e., groups not
     displayed on the screen).
     From Newsgroup mode the user can go into All mode.  In All mode the user
     is presented with a sorted list of all known groups and their
     subscription status (subscribed or unsubscribed) and can change their
     status or location in the `.newsrc' file.  On exiting All mode the user
     is placed back in Newsgroup mode.
     In order to read the articles in a particular group, the user goes from
     Newsgroup mode to Article mode.  In Article mode the user can sequence
     through the articles in the group forward or backward, mark a group of
     articles as read or unread, mark all articles in the current group as
     read, unsubscribe to the current group, return to the last article
     visited, search forward or backward for an article subject (either for
     the exact subject or for a regular expression in the subject), locally
     kill all articles with a particular subject, and quit (saving all
     changes) or exit (leaving all articles marked unread).  In addition, the
     user can save the current article in a file, post an article to the
     group, post a followup to the current article, mail a reply to the
     author of an article, and return to Newsgroup mode.

   NEWS SYSTEM

     The news system is a set of bulletins, discussion groups, program
     sources, and other bits of information distributed around the world
     under the name `USENET'.  The information is generally called `news' and
     is broken up into `newsgroups'.  Each newsgroup deals with a subject or
     set of subjects.  The subjects for newsgroups are varied:  from
     discussions about particular versions of UNIX to movie reviews, from


   2                                                                        X

     information on the X window system to commentary on current social and
     political issues.

     For information on what newsgroups are available, answers to commonly
     asked questions, and newsgroup etiquette, read the articles in the
     newsgroup `news.announce.newsusers'.  Users who are new to the USENET
     are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the contents of the
     articles in `news.announce.newusers' before posting any messages.

   NEWS SERVER

     In order to run mxrn, you must have access to an NNTP news server.  If
     you do not have access to such a server and would like to set one up,
     see the "USENET Software: History and Sources" posting in
     news.announce.newusers for information about where to get the
     appropriate software.  Either the file `/usr/local/lib/rn/server' (this
     filename may be configured differently at some sites) must contain the
     name of the server machine, the environment variable NNTPSERVER must be
     set to the name of the server machine, the nntpServer Xdefault must be
     set to the name of the server machine, or the `-nntpServer' flag must be
     specified on the command line (with the order of precedence being
     command line, Xdefault, environment variable, file).  The name can be
     the actual host name of the NNTP server (i.e. shambhala.berkeley.edu) or
     the internet number (i.e. 128.32.132.54).  If someone else has installed
     mxrn at your site, then it is probably already configured to use the
     correct news server and you don't have to worry about it.

   SCREEN LAYOUT

     The screen displayed by mxrn consists of seven sections: a title bar,
     two scrollable text windows, two information bars, and two button boxes.
     The title bar displays the current version of the program.  The top text
     window displays information based on the mode.  In Add mode, the window
     displays all groups that are not currently in the `.newsrc' file, one
     per line.  In Newsgroup mode, the window displays the groups containing
     unread articles; each group represented by a line of the form:

        Unread news in <group name>           <num> article(s) + <old> old

     <group name> is the name of the group, <num> is the number of unread
     articles, and <old> is the number of read articles that are still
     available (i.e. have not been expired) on the news server.  If "List
     old" is toggled on, then the word "Unread" will not appear on the lines
     of newsgroups with no unread articles, and furthermore, the words "news
     in" will not appear on the lines of newsgroups with no available
     articles at all.

     In Article mode, the window displays a list of subjects for the articles
     in the current group, with each subject line being represented by a line
     of the form:

          [+u][SP] <num>    <subject of the article> [<lines>] <author>

     where <num> is the article number, <lines> is the number of lines in the


   X                                                                        3






   MXRN(1)                                                         3 Mar 1993


     article (when available), and <author> is the author of the article.  A
     `+' in the first position means that the article has been read, a `u' in
     the first position means that the article has been marked as unread, a
     'S' in the second position means that the article has been saved to a
     file, and a 'P' in the second position means that the article has been
     printed.

     in the top button box, and error messages.  The top button box has
     buttons that are specific to the mode and apply to the information in
     the top text window.  The bottom text window displays articles in
     Article mode and a list of all known groups and their subscription
     status in All mode.  The bottom information bar displays information
     about the mode, the buttons in the bottom button box, and error
     messages.  The bottom button box has buttons that are specific to the
     mode and apply to the information in the bottom text window.

   BUTTONS, SCROLL BARS, AND SELECTION

     All button and text selection commands are done with the left mouse
     button.  Single-line text selection is accomplished by clicking the left
     mouse button on the desired line.  Multiple-line selection is
     accomplished by clicking the left mouse button on the first line,
     holding the button down, dragging the mouse to the last line, and
     releasing the mouse button.  Extended selection can be done by clicking
     on an article or range of articles, then using shift-click to add or
     remove an article from the selection.  Selected lines appear in reverse
     video (the foreground and background colors are switched).  The text
     windows are scrolled with the scroll bar on the right side of the
     window.  Clicking the left mouse button in the scroll bar will scroll
     the text up or down some fraction of a page; the `slider' or `elevator'
     in the scrollbar can be dragged to perform more rapid scrolls.

   MODES

     The next few sections describe the individual modes in mxrn.  Each
     button in the various modes is described with the label for the button
     and the name of the button.  The name of the button can be used in X
     resources, in the button lists, and in the bindings tables.
     Note that not all buttons will appear in the button boxes; you can use
     the customization menus to determine which functions appear in the
     button boxes and popup menus. See the section of this manual titled
     `CUSTOMIZATIONS' for further information.

   ADD MODE

     Add mode is entered when new groups have been detected (groups that the
     news system knows about but are not in the `.newsrc' file).
     This allows you to determine what to do to these groups (subscribe or
     ignore them).

     Quit (addQuit)
          Add remaining groups in the list to `.newsrc' as unsubscribed; go
          to group mode.

     Add First (addFirst)
          Add the current group(s) to the beginning of the `.newsrc' file and
          mark as subscribed.  The current group is the selected group(s), or
          the group on the line containing the cursor.

     Add Last (addLast)
          Add the current group(s) to the end of the `.newsrc' file and mark
          as subscribed.

     Add After Group (addAfter)
          Add the current group(s) after a group already in the `.newsrc'.  A
          dialog box is used to allow the user to enter the name of the group
          to add the group after.  The mouse cursor must be in the dialog box
          for mxrn to accept text (however, it does not have to be in the
          type-in area).  The dialog box has two options: abort and add.  No
          other buttons on the screen will work until the user has selected
          an option in the dialog box.  Hitting carriage return is the same
          as clicking the add button (in all mxrn dialog boxes hitting
          carriage return is the same as clicking in the rightmost button of
          the dialog box).

     Add Unsubscribed (addUnsub)
          Add the current group(s) to the end of the `.newsrc' file and mark
          as unsubscribed.


   NEWSGROUP MODE

     Newsgroup mode is normally the mode that mxrn starts up in. The window
     at the top of the screen displays the list of subscribed groups that
     have new news articles (ones that you haven't read) and provides control
     over which groups are visited.
     Double clicking the left mouse button on a newsgroup entry will enter
     the newsgroup.

     exit (ngExit)
          Quit mxrn, leaving the `.newsrc' file unchanged since the last
          `rescan' operation or `checkpoint'.  If `updateNewsrc' is on, then
          the `.newsrc' file is kept up to date with the last time Article
          mode was exited.

     Quit (ngQuit)
          Quit mxrn. The `.newsrc' file is updated to account for the
          articles read and mxrn exits.

     Read Group (ngRead)
          Read the articles in the current group.  The current group is
          either the one selected (if one is selected) or the first group in
          the list. The first article in the group is read, if the `Auto
          Read' flag is turned on. The `Open Newsgroup' function can be used
          to avoid reading the first article.
          If all groups have been read, the user can still access groups by
          using the goto newsgroup command.



   X                                                                        5

     Open Group (ngOpen)
          Open a newsgroup without reading the first article. This command is
          useful for groups with large articles, such as source groups, where
          you may not want to read the initial article.
          The current group is either the one selected (if one is selected)
          or the first group in the list.

     Next (ngNext)
          Move the cursor to the next group, leaving the articles in the
          current group untouched.

     Prev (ngPrev)
          Move the cursor to the previous group, leaving the articles in the
          current group untouched.

     Catch Up (ngCatchUp)
          Mark all articles in the current group as read.

     Subscribe (ngSubscribe)
          Subscribe to a group.  A dialog box is used to allow the user to
          enter the name of the group.  The dialog box has the following
          options: abort, prev group (subscribe to the previous group
          visited), first (put group in the beginning of the `.newsrc' file),
          last (put group in the end of the `.newsrc' file), and current
          position (put group at the position of the cursor).  This command
          can also be used to change the position of a subscribed group.
          Hitting carriage return after typing in the name is the same as
          clicking the current position button.

     Unsubscribe (ngUnsub)
          Unsubscribe from the current group.

     Goto Newsgroup (ngGoto)
          Go to an arbitrary newsgroup. The first unread article is
          displayed.  If all articles in the group have been read, the last
          article in the group is displayed.  The name specified can be a
          substring of the group name or a regular expression.

     Toggle Groups (ngToggleGroups)
          Toggle group display mode from verbose mode (showing information on
          all subscribed groups) to normal mode (showing information only on
          subscribed groups with new news).

     All Groups (ngAllGroups)
          Display all of the groups that exist, their subscription status,
          and a set of buttons for changing the status.

     Rescan (ngRescan)
          Query the server for any new groups or articles.

     Prev Group (ngPrevGroup)
          Re-visit the previous group visited.

     Select Groups (ngSelect)


   6                                                                        X






   3 Mar 1993                                                         MXRN(1)


          Records the groups currently selected.  If no groups are selected,
          nothing is recorded.

     Move (ngMove)
          Moves the groups previously selected with the select groups command
          to the current cursor position.  If the cursor is currently inside
          the groups to be moved, no groups are moved.  If any other button
          is invoked after select groups and before move, the selection is
          lost, and no groups are moved.

     Checkpoint (ngCheckPoint)
          Update the `.newsrc' file. mxrn normally updates the `.newsrc' file
          on `rescan' and `quit' in Newsgroup mode. This allows you to update
          the `.newsrc' file without exiting mxrn or reconnecting to the
          server (see also 'artCheckPoint').

     Post (ngPost)
          Post an article to a newsgroup. See "post" under Article mode for
          more information.

     Gripe (ngGripe)
          Send a gripe (bug, bug fix, complaint, feature request, etc.) to
          the authors of the program.

   ALL MODE

     All mode allows the user to change both the subscription status and the
     `.newsrc' file position of any available group.  All operations can
     apply to multiple groups.  Thus, the user should never have to use a
     text editor on the `.newsrc' file.
     Double-clicking on a newsgroup name in the list will cause the group to
     be read. You can use the `open group' function to open a group without
     reading the first article.

     Quit (allQuit)
          Update the `.newsrc' file and return to group mode.

     Subscribe (allSub)
          Subscribe to the current group, leaving it at its current position
          in the `.newsrc' file.

     Subscribe First (allFirst)
          Subscribe to the current group and add it to the beginning of the
          `.newsrc' file.

     Subscribe Last (allLast)
          Subscribe to the current group and add it to the end of the
          `.newsrc' file.

     Subscribe After Group (allAfter)
          Subscribe to the current group and add it after a particular group
          in the `.newsrc' file (which is entered with the use of a dialog
          box).



   X                                                                        7

     Unsubscribe (allUnsub)
          Unsubscribe the current group.

     Goto Group (allGoto)
          Go to the current newsgroup.

     Open Group (allOpen)
          Open a newsgroup without automatically reading the first article.
          The currently selected group (or the first group in the selection)
          is opened.

     Select Groups (allSelect)

     Move (allMove)
          Same as the "select groups" and "move" buttons in Newsgroup mode.
          These functions are used to re-order groups.

     Toggle Order (allToggle)
          Toggle the order of the newsgroups in the window between `.newsrc'
          order and alphabetical order.

     Scroll Forward (allScroll)
          Scroll the all groups window forward a page.

     Scroll Backward (allScrollBack)
          Scroll the all groups window backwards a page.

     Search (allSearch)
          Search the all groups window for a group.

     Continue Search (allContinue)
          Continue the all groups search.

     Cancel Search (allCancelSearch)
          Cancel the all groups search.

   ARTICLE MODE

     Article mode is used for reading and manipulating articles in a single
     group.  When a group is entered, the list of article subjects displayed
     contains those from the first unread article to the last available
     article.  Previous articles can be obtained by using the prev or subject
     previous commands.  Double clicking the left mouse button on an article
     entry will display the article.

     Quit (artQuit)
          Update the `.newsrc' file and return to group mode.

     Next (artNext)
          Display the selected article, if any; otherwise, display the next
          article in the current group.  Return to Newsgroup mode after the
          last article has been reached.

          Display the selected article if it is unread; otherwise, display
          the first unread article AFTER the cursor position.  If no unread
          articles exist, mxrn returns to Newsgroup mode.

     Prev (artPrev)
          Display the selected article, if any; otherwise, display the
          previous article in the current group.

     Last (artLast)
          Display the last article accessed before the currently displayed
          one.  This command only keeps track of one previously accessed
          article, so invoking it repeatedly simply toggles the display
          between two articles.

     Next Newsgroup (artNextGroup)
          Go directly to the next newsgroup with unread news (bypass
          newsgroup mode).

     Goto Article (artGotoArticle)
          Go to the specified article number. Articles read in previous
          sessions can be accessed using this command.

     Catch Up (artCatchUp)
          Mark all articles in the current group as read; return to Newsgroup
          mode.  If a particular article is selected, catch up from the
          beginning of the group to the selected article.

     Fed Up (artFedUp)
          Mark all articles in the current group as read; go to the next
          newsgroup.

     Mark Read (artMarkRead)
          Mark an article (or group of articles) as read.  This command marks
          either the selected article(s) or the article the cursor is on, and
          leaves the cursor at its current position.

     Mark Unread (artMarkUnread)
          Mark an article (or group of articles) and unread.  This command
          marks either the selected article(s) or the article the cursor is
          on, and leaves the cursor at its current position.  When an article
          is marked as unread, a 'u' is placed in the far left column next to
          the article's subject.  The next, prev, subject next, and subject
          prev buttons will all display this article if they come across it,
          but the next unread button will not.  The only way to mark an
          article as read once it has been marked with a 'u' is to use the
          mark read function.

     Unsubscribe (artUnsub)
          Unsubscribe from the current group; return to Newsgroup mode.

     Scroll Forward (artScroll)

     Subject Next (artSubNext)
          Find and display the next article with the same subject as the
          current article (stripping the '[rR][eE]:' garbage).  If there are
          no more articles with the current subject and there are more unread
          articles, the first unread article is selected.  If there are no
          more articles with the current subject and there are no more unread
          articles, Article mode is exited.

     Subject Prev (artSubPrev)
          Find and display the previous article with the same subject as the
          current article. The search will proceed past the current list of
          articles to scan articles read in previous sessions.

     Session Kill (artKillSession)
          Mark all articles with the current subject as read, for this
          session only.

     Local Kill (artKillLocal)
          Mark all articles with the current subject as read for this group,
          and for this and all future sessions.

     Global Kill (artKillGlobal)

          and for this and all future sessions.

     Author Kill (artKillAuthor)
          Mark all articles by the current author as read for this session
          only.

     Subject Search (artSubSearch)
          Begin a regular expression subject search.  When this button is
          invoked, a window pops up querying the user for a regular
          expression (of the form used in ed), and a direction in which to
          search.  If a regular expression is not typed in, the last regular
          expression is used, and the search direction is the one specified
          in the dialog box (this can be used to switch the direction of the
          search without retyping the expression).

     Continue (artContinue)
          Continue the last regular expression search by searching for the

     Cancel Search (artCancelSearch)
          Cancel the regular expression search.

     Article Order (artNonSorted)
          Change the order of entries in the subject window to be sorted by
          article number.

     Subject Order (artSorted)
          Change the order of entries in the subject window to be sorted by
          article number, with groups of articles with the same subject
          grouped together.  or sorted by subject.

     Strict Order (artStrictSorted)
          Change the order of entries in the subject window to be sorted by
          the subject only. (This can be useful for sources groups).

     Post (artPost)
          Post an article to the current group.  A scrollable, editable text
          window will appear with a header and the user's appropriate
          signature file included.  The appropriate signature file is the
          usual signature file name `~/.signature' followed by either a `-'
          and a  newsgroup name substring, or followed by a `.' and
          `followup', `forward', `gripe', `reply' or `post' according to the
          posting mode.  For example if you want to post a followup article
          in comp.sources.x then xrn uses the first valid signature file in
          the following order:

               ~/.signature-comp.sources.x
               ~/.signature-comp.sources
               ~/.signature-comp
               ~/.signature.followup
               ~/.signature

          An appropriate header will be generated with a number of blank
          header fields that if left blank will be deleted from the posting.
          The editor defaults to the standard Xtoolkit editor, and the
          default can be overridden by using the command line option
          -editorCommand or by setting the same Xdefault (see the section on
          command line arguments).  The mouse buttons can be used to select
          text in this window (which can then be placed in a file, for
          example).

          There are four buttons at the bottom of the window: abort, send (to
          post the article), save (to save the article in a file), and
          include (include the text of the article in the reply or followup).
          The include article button is omitted if there is no current
          article (e.g. if the user is sending a "Gripe" or if "post" was
          selected from Newsgroup mode).  Only one article or message window
          can be active at a time.  Only one post (or followup or reply)
          window can be active at a time.

     Exit (artExit)

          Exit article mode, marking all articles listed in the top window as
          unread.

     Checkpoint (artCheckPoint)
          Update the `.newsrc' file. mxrn normally updates the `.newsrc' file
          on `rescan' and `quit' in Newsgroup mode. This allows you to update
          the `.newsrc' file without exiting mxrn or reconnecting to the
          server (see also 'ngCheckPoint').

     Gripe (artGripe)
          Send a gripe (bug, bug fix, complaint, feature request, etc.) to
          the authors of the program.

     List Old (artListOld)
          List all articles available in the group, even those that have been
          read.  Note that this button does not toggle (clicking this button
          twice will no put you back to where you were).

     Save (artSave)
          Save the current article in a file, or use the current article as
          standard input to a command.  The save command will pop up a dialog
          box for the filename.  The dialog box has two buttons: abort and
          save.  If the filename begins with a `|', the article will be sent
          to the command specified after the `|'.  Otherwise, the article
          will be appended to the file specified.  If the name is relative
          (does not begin with `/' or `~'), it will be prepended by
          `~/News/'.  If the name begins with a `+' the name is assumed to be
          a MH mail folder and a `refile' command will be done on the
          article.  If no name is specified, it will be saved in
          `~/News/<groupname>', where `<groupname>' is the name of the
          current group with the first letter capitalized (following the
          rn(1) article saving conventions).  If -saveMode is set to
          `subdirs', then `~/News/<groupname>/' will be used instead of
          `~/News/'. Multiple articles can be selected and saved with one
          command. If the filename contains the characters `%d', the article
          number will replace that string; otherwise, the group of articles
          will be appended into a single save file.  For VMS, piping of
          articles to commands (`|') is not supported.  File names are used
          as given. If no filename is given in a `save' command, the group
          name will be used for a filename (with second and subsequent
          periods converted to underscores; for example, `comp.os_vms'.
          Subdirs save mode on VMS uses the group name to create a
          subdirectory for saving the articles.

   CUSTOMIZING MXRN

     Colors, fonts, and other mxrn options can be specified on the command
     line or using X resources.  With the exception of the display name, all
     mxrn options can be specified using X resources.  Options specified on
     the command line take precedence over those specified using X resources.
     In addition, mxrn has a set of customization screens that can be used to
     tailor the environment without editing resource files.  For each
     customization entry below, the corresponding resource entry and
     customization menu entry are described.


   CUSTOMIZATIONS

     The majority of the customization functions are available in any mxrn
     mode by selecting the entries from the `Customize' menu. For each of the
     entries in this menu, the section below describes the function and the
     associated command-line argument. Note that the case of the entries
     given for the resource file and command line are case-sensitive - they
     must be entered exactly as given.
     The following sections describe the fields on each of the customization
     screens and their function.

     Customize/Controls
          This box provides a series of options for functions that the user
          wishes to confirm before actions are taken. These boxes pop up to
          ask the user to verify the invocation of "dangerous" actions (such
          as catch up and unsubscribe). It also provides control of `save'
          functions.

     Confirm Exit
               If active, provides a dialog box to allow you to confirm
               `quit' operations.

               If active, provides a dialog box to allow you to confirm
               `exit' operations.

     Confirm NG Catch Up
               If active, provides a dialog box to allow you to confirm
               `Catch Up' operations in Newsgroup mode.

     Confirm Article Catch Up
               If active, provides a dialog box to allow you to confirm
               `Catch Up' operations in Article mode.

     Confirm NG Unsubscribe
               If active, provides a dialog box to allow you to confirm
               `Unsubscribe' operations in Newsgroup mode.

     Confirm Article Unsubscribe
               If active, provides a dialog box to allow you to confirm
               `Unsubscribe' operations in Article mode.

     Action Prompt at Subject Change
               If active, provides a dialog box to allow you to decide what
               to do when the subject changes when reading articles.

     Confirm Save file Overwrite
               If active, allows you to specify what to do when a save
               operation finds the file you've specified already exists
               (replace, append, or quit).  The default is to append to the
               existing file.

     Customize/Controls Save fields
          These fields modify the behavior of save operations.

     Mailbox   If enabled, articles are saved in 'mailbox' format - with a
               date header line and other data to make the saved file appear
               to be in a format similar to mail storage.

     Headers   If enabled, all the header lines are saved with the article.
               If disabled, the article is saved as displayed (with any
               headers stripped as controled by the `leave headers' and
               `strip headers' customizations applied.)

     Subdirectory/One Directory
               These controls determine how articles are saved if no
               directory path is given; if `Subdirectory' is enabled, the
               article is saved in a subdirectory of your news directory -
               this subdirectory is determined from the newsgroup name. If
               `One Directory' is enabled, the file is saved in the news
               directory.  If neither is enabled, the file is saved in your
               current working directory.

     Customize/Posting
          This box provides a series of options for controlling the posting
          of articles and followups.

     Line Length/Wrap Length
               These fields determine the behavior of word wrapping of
               articles.  Any line that exceeds `Wrap Length' characters in
               width will be word-wrapped at the first space past the column
               determined by `Line Length'. If they are both zero, no word-
               wrapping takes place.

     Signature File
               This field provides the path to the file containing your
               `signature' - any postings or mailings have the contents of
               this file appended. Generally used to add mail address and
               witty sayings. The length of this file is limited to avoid
               `War and Peace' signatures.  Defaults to `~/.signature'.
               (SYS$LOGIN:NEWS.SIGNATURE on VMS).

     Save Postings
               This field gives the file name of the file to use to save
               postings (used when the `save' function in the composition
               window is invoked.  Defaults to `~/Articles'.
               (SYS$SCRATCH:SAVED.POSTING on VMS.) Note that this is the
               default name used when you do not specify a file name during a
               save operation.

     Dead Letters
               This field gives the file name of the file to use to save an
               article that could not be posted due to an error.  Defaults to
               `~/dead.letters'. (SYS$SCRATCH:DEAD.LETTER on VMS).

     Editor Command
               This entry allows use an alternate editor for creating
               postings, followups, forwards, gripes, and replies.  The entry
               must be a sprintf format string that contains a `%s' where the
               file name should be placed. Examples are:

                 xterm -e vi %s
                 xterm -e microEmacs %s
                 emacsclient %s
                 edit/tpu/display=decwindows %s [only VMS could be this verbose :-)]

              The resulting command should handle all editing and windowing.
              The article being followed up or replied to is automatically
              included.

     Organization
               This field provides a value for the `Organization' header
               field in postings and followups. Usually set to the name of
               your company or other organization.

     Reply To  This entry provides a specific address for the the Reply-To
               header field in postings and followups. Most news readers use
               this address for `reply' commands.

     Include Separator
               Include or do not include the prefix text ("|> ") in front of


   X                                                                       15

               included articles. The default is to include the prefix text
               ("|> ").

     Include Prefix
               Change the standard prefix for each line of included text from
               the default, "|> ", to the given text string.

     Customize/Reading
          This box provides a series of options for controlling the reading
          of articles.

     Subject Read
               Specifies the action to take when using the `doTheRightThing'
               function to read articles. If this button is enabled, at the
               end of the article a subject next function is performed. If
               disabled, a next unread function is performed.

     Retain Killed
               If enabled, articles that are killed are left in the subject
               listing.  If disabled, these articles are removed from the
               list.

     Full Name Display the full name of the author or the user/hostname of

     Customize/Mailing
          This box provides a series of options for controlling the mailing
          of articles.

     Reply Path
               The path to use for mailing replies. This should be a
               sprintf-able string.  This format string is used to build a
               mail address acceptable to mail for replies. For example,
               `IN%%"%s"'.
               The address in the articles `Reply-To' header replaces the
               `%s' in the string and the resulting line is used to provide a
               mail address. You must double any "%" characters that appear
               in this string other than the "%s".

     Personal Name
               (VMS Only) Sets your 'real' name for use in postings.

     Mailer    (UNIX Only) Specifies the command to use for mailing replies.
               This command must take all of it's input from standard input
               (mxrn will not build a command line).  The default is
               `/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t'.

     Host Name Sets the name of your internet host. Used for postings to
               specify a useful path name when the default isn't useful.

     Include CC
               If enabled, a `Cc:' line is provided in the header for
               forwards and replies.

     Customize/General
          This box provides a series of options for controlling the general
          behavior of mxrn.

     Top/Min/Max Lines
               These entries control the size and behavior of the window
               containing the list of newsgroups and articles. `Top Lines'
               specifies the number of entries in the list. As articles are
               read, the list scrolls to maintain the current article between
               `Min Lines' and `Max Lines'. For example, setting `Top Lines'
               to 10, `Min Lines' to 2, and `Max Lines' to 8 will cause the
               top window to scroll unless the current article is between
               lines 2 and 8. This type of setting minimizes the number of
               times the top window must be repainted.

     NNTP Server
               Supplies the name of the the NNTP server to use (name or
               internet number).  If the entry ends in two colons (`::'),
               DECnet is assumed as the transport.  Otherwise, TCP/IP is
               assumed.

     Newsrc File
               Name of the the `.newsrc' file to use. This file contains
               information on your subscribed groups and which articles have
               been read.  Defaults to `~/.newsrc'. (SYS$LOGIN:NEWS.RC on
               VMS).  If a file with a name of the form `<newsrcFile>-
               <nntpServer>' is found, it will be used. For example,
               .newsrc-fumble for news server node `fumble'.

     Saved Newsrc File
               Specifies the name of the backup `.newsrc' file.
               Before the `.newsrc' file is modified, it is saved in a backup
               file.  This entry allows you to control the name of this
               backup file.  Defaults to `~/.oldnewsrc'.
               (SYS$LOGIN:OLDNEWS.RC on VMS).

     Temp Directory
               Specifies the directory to use for the temporary storage of
               articles fetched from the server.  If this option and the
               corresponding Xdefault do not exist, mxrn will look for the
               environment variable TMPDIR.  The default is `/tmp'.
               (SYS$SCRATCH: on VMS.) Save Directory Specifies the article
               saving directory.  Defaults to `~/News' when -saveMode
               specifies `onedir', or `~/News/newsgroup' when -saveMode
               specifies `subdirs'.  For VMS, defaults to SYS$SCRATCH:.

     Print Command
               Set the command used for printing articles.  The article is
               sent to the command via standard input.  Defaults to `lpr'.
               (PRINT/DELETE on VMS).

     Rescan Time
               Amount of idle time (in seconds) before checking for new
               articles.  This rescan is only performed in Newsgroup mode.

     Popup Button
               Specifies which mouse button will pop up the popup menus.
               Defaults to the standard button for the widget set being used
               (MB2 for XUI, MB3 for Motif).

     Display Informational Messages
               If enabled, display all informative messages in the message
               pane. If disabled, information messages are displayed in the
               top information line only.  Defaults to display all
               information in the message pane.


   OTHER CUSTOMIZATIONS
     The following arguments can be provided on the command line to further
     customize mxrn. Entries in your application defaults file can be used to
     specify these as well.

     Watch Progress
               If enabled, when 'Catch Up' is used to catch up to a selected
               position in a group, the display is 'animated' so you can

               watch the progress of the operation.
               The associated customization file entry is `watchProgress'.
               The command line argument can be +watchProgress (enabled) or
               -watchProgress (disabled).

     -authorLength
               -subjectLength Specifies the width of the `subject' and
               `author' fields in the subject listing.

     -busyIcon When set to "on", the icon image will invert when mxrn is
               busy.

     -ccForward
               When set to "on", you will be included as a CC entry in
               forwarded articles.

     -compRows rows
               Specifies the number of rows in the message composition
               window.

     -distribution
               Specifies the default distribution for articles. The default
               is `world'.

     -display display
               specification of the X display. (Not for VMS).

     +/-dumpCore
               Dump core when a signal is detected.  The X resources class
               for the "dumpCore" X resource is "Debug". `+dumpCore' disables
               the default signal handler.

     -iconGeometry +X+Y
               specification of the initial mxrn icon location.  The window
               manager may choose to ignore this specification.

     -iconName name
               specification of the initial mxrn icon name.  The window
               manager may choose to ignore this specification.

     -iconic   start up mxrn with the window iconified.

     -layout =WxH+X+Y
               specification of the mxrn window size and location.  The
               window manager may choose to ignore this specification.  Using
               the Customize/Save menu item saves the current geometry
               automatically.

     -leaveHeaders list
               the header fields to leave in the article; a comma separated
               case-insensitive list of field names (i.e.,
               subject,from,organization).  This option takes precedence over
               `stripHeaders'.  If the word `all' is specified instead of a
               list of fields, then all headers will be retained (This can be

               used in user X resources to override a resource specified in
               the global mxrn application defaults, or on the command line
               to override a resource specified in either the application
               defaults or the user X resources.).  -lockFile name Specifies
               the name of the lock file to use. The lock file is used to
               avoid you running mxrn multiple times, thus losing updates to
               your newsrc file.

     -resetSave
               If set to "on", the string in the save dialog box will be
               reset when you exit article mode. Normally, the string is
               retained between entries.  [Except when the saveString is
               specified - see below].

     -retryPopupCount
               -retryPopupTimeout -retryPause -retryLimit Specifies the
               action to be taken when the connection to the NNTP server is
               lost. mxrn will pause for `retryPause' seconds between
               retries. A connection attempt is made `retryPopupCount' times
               before posting a popup window that allows the user the
               opportunity to give up. After `retryPopupTimout' seconds, this
               dialog box is automatically dismissed and another retry is
               attempted.  After trying this `retryLimit' times, mxrn exits.

     -saveString
               Provides a default value for the filename in the save dialog
               box.

     +sortedSubjects
               Specifies the subject sorting type to be used. Use
               "+sortedSubjects" to group articles with the same subject, and
               "-sortedSubjects" to display articles in article number order.
               The associated customization file entry is `sortedSubjects'.
               The command line argument can be +sortedSubjects (enabled) or
               -sortedSubjects (disabled).
               When used in the customization file, the following values can
               be used:
                      Value                                 Sort by
                   none (or off, unsorted, false)         article number
                   subject (or on, true, article, sorted) related subjects
                   strict                                 subject only

               You can specify specific sorting types by including the
               group name or hierarchy in the customization entry.
               For example:
               mxrn*sortedSubjects: subject
               mxrn.comp.sources.x.sortedSubjects: strict
               mxrn*binaries*sortedSubjects: strict
               mxrn.rec.humor.funny.sortedSubjects: none
               This would cause most groups to appear with subject sorting,
               `comp.sources.x' to appear in strict order, binaries groups
               (like `comp.binaries.ibm-pc') in strict order, and
               `rec.humor.funny' in article number order.

     -saveDir  Specifies the default directory for saving articles.
               You can specify save directories on a newsgroup basis by
               including the group name or hierarchy in the customization
               entry.  For example: mxrn*saveDir: ~/News
               mxrn.comp.sources.x.saveDir: ~/X-sources
               mxrn*binaries*saveDir: ~/binaries
               This would cause most groups to default to `~/News' for
               saving;

     -stripHeaders list
               the header fields to strip from the article; a comma separated
               case-insensitive list of field names (i.e., keywords,message-
               id).  If the word `none' is specified instead of a list of
               fields, then no headers will be stripped (This can be used in
               user X resources to override a resource specified in the
               global mxrn application defaults, or on the command line to
               override a resource specified in either the application
               defaults or the user X resources.).

     -unreadIconName name
               specification of the mxrn icon name when there are groups with
               unread articles.  The window manager may choose to ignore this
               specification.

     -useGadgets
               If set to "on", gadgets will be used to create the pulldown
               menus. Saves a bit of memory - the trade-off is that the
               gadgets are less customizable.

     -watchUnread
               Specifies a list of newsgroup names to monitor. If given, this
               list of groups will be scanned in newsgroup mode; if any
               contain new news, the icon title will change to the unread
               title. If not given, all groups are watched.

     -ngButtonList list

     -artButtonList list

     -artSpecButtonList list

     -addButtonList list

     -allButtonList list
               use the given list of buttons for the particular mode in the
               order given rather than all of the buttons for the mode in the
               default order.  The list is a comma separated list of button
               names.  The names of the buttons appear next after the button
               label in the button descriptions above.  For example, a list
               of buttons for Newsgroup mode might be:
               ngQuit,ngRead,ngCatchUp,ngRescan,ngSubscribe,ngPost
               Customization menus exist for buttons and menus for each mode.

               names.  The names of the buttons appear next after the button

               Customization menus exist for the menus for each mode.

   X RESOURCES

     mxrn takes a number of specifications for colors, fonts, border widths,
     and other program options.  The format for an mxrn X resource is:

                              dxrn.x.y....z.a: value
                                       or..
                              mxrn.x.y....z.a: value

     Where x.y....z specifies the path from the top level of mxrn to a
     particular item (think of mxrn as a hierarchical collection of windows,
     panes, and buttons, and x.y....z is a path from the top of the hierarchy
     to a node in the hierarchy), a is the type of default (i.e., font,
     border, foreground, background, borderWidth), and value is the value of
     the default (i.e,. a color name or hex representation, a font name, a
     numeric value).  Specifying a default for a item at some point in the
     hierarchy will set that default for all items from that point down in
     the hierarchy.  A higher level default can be overridden by specifying a
     default at a lower level directly.

   COMMENTS

     The name (mxrn) is a bit of a misnomer.  mxrn is not an X interface to
     `rn' (the terminal-based news reading program by Larry Wall), but is an
     X-based news reader that has had part of the functionality of `rn' added
     since a number of our users are (were?) `rn' users (all of the code is
     new).  Much of the `rn' functionality that mxrn currently has was not in
     the original plan (KILL files, for example).

     The user interface look and feel is modeled after that of `XMH' (by

     Terry Weissman).

     The `.newsrc' file is updated on executing the `quit' command in
     Newsgroup mode, during every `rescan', and by `checkpoint'.  If the
     `updateNewsrc' option is set, the `.newsrc' file will be updated every
     time Article mode is exited.

     mxrn catches signals and X errors and will clean up on error exit
     (remove temporary files, update the `.newsrc' file).  The cleanup will
     be done and then a death notifier box will be posted (if the signal is
     SIGHUP or SIGINT, the death notifier will be skipped and the program
     will exit).  The "click to exit" button must be pressed in the death
     notifier box for the program to exit.

     XREFS are handled by mxrn, however only articles that are actually read
     (not marked as read by 'catchup' or 'mark as read') have their XREFS
     chased and only groups that are currently subscribed to have XREFed
     articles marked as read.

     The default specifications for color and fonts can be confusing
     (thousands of different X resources can be specified for mxrn, no two
     users' mxrn displays need to be the same).

     mxrn uses the XHDR command of the Berkeley NNTP news server (XHDR is not
     part of the protocol defined by RFC 977).  mxrn will detect the presence
     of this command and complain if it does not exist.

     Since the NNTP protocol does not define a unique response code for
     server timeout, timeout recovery may not work if the format of the
     timeout error message changes.

     mxrn assumes a `smart' or `lucky' mailer.

     mxrn notices that the `.newsrc' file has been updated by another program
     while mxrn is running and informs the user (and gives the user the
     option to quit without updating the `.newsrc' or to continue on).

     Article temporary files can be removed and mxrn will recover.

     mxrn strips `<character>^H' from articles.

     The v{f,s}printf implementation included with mxrn is from Robert A.
     Larson <blarson@skat.usc.edu>.

     The strtok implementation included with mxrn is from Henry Spencer
     <henry@zoo.toronto.edu>.
