	GENERIC TERTRIS
	===============	Yet Another Tetris Game on X, V1.2.0


WHY ANOTHER?

    Because "different is good"...
 
    Because this one is simple, easy to build, portable, and triangular.
    It only uses Xlib -- no "toolkit" kind of thing.  The most updated
    source could be found on ftp.x.org under /contrib/games/altris .

    Polyiamonds instead of polyominoes of Q. Alex Zhao's tetris, which
    this program is patterned after.  That original tetris can be found
    on ftp.x.org under /contrib/games .

HOW TO BUILD?

    Edit the Imakefile (or Makefile.std, see below) for appropriate
    settings of variables SCOREFILE, UP, and DOWN, then do:
	xmkmf
	make
	tertris

    If that does not work then:
	mv Imakefile Imakefile.r5
	sed 's/^XCOMM/\/\*\*\/#/' > Imakefile < Imakefile.r5
	xmkmf
	make
	tertris

    Note: if you don't have 'xmkmf' or the "Makefile" it generates
    doesn't work well, try:
	make -f Makefile.std

    "Tertris" is the game.  It only lists the top 15 players at the
    end, each player may has at most three scores.  With the option
    "-s", "tertris" will list all the scores.


ANYTHING SPECIAL IN PLAYING?

    This is a triangular version of tetris ("tritris" did not sound
    right).  Pieces come down diagonally and slide off the walls and
    off each other and also change direction.  When an odd number of
    rows are filled (usually 1) the grid will change, "up" triangles
    will become "down" triangles and vice-versa.  This proves to be
    necessary because if this were not allowed then it would be
    impossible to fill a row if certain mistakes were made
    previously.  The default number of triangles is 5 where
    reflection is allowed.  This just "seemed right" (but if you do
    not think so try "tertris -n 4" where reflection is not allowed
    but the number of different pieces is severely limited).

    Use 'j' to move left; 'l' to move right; 'k' to rotate; 'i' to 
    reflect.  Left-handed people may want to use 's', 'f', 'd', 'e'
    respectively.  Use the space bar to drop a block quickly.  Do you
    want to try the arrow keys or keypad?

    Use CTRL-L key combination to redraw -- in case the program messes
    something up.

    As usual, '+' and '-' will speed up or lower down the speed.  Note
    that you don't need to press the SHIFT key -- '=' and '_' also
    work.  The 'b' key can be used to toggle "beep" and 'n' toggles
    "show next".  '>' and '<' will increase or decrease the number of
    triangles in a polyiamond.  'g' key toggles "diagonal", 'm' toggles
    "mixed", 'o' toggles "bonus", and 'r' toggles grid.

    If you press 'p', the game will be paused, and the window will be
    iconified -- just in case your boss suddenly appears at your door.
    ;o) When the tertris window loses its focus, it also goes to
    "paused" mode except it doesn't iconify itself.

    Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.


FOUND A BUG?

    Send bug reports (or fixes) to the author (well, a lot was taken
    from Q. Alex Zhao's tetris (azhao@cc.gatech.edu) but many of the
    algorithms were taken from xvtertris written by me):
