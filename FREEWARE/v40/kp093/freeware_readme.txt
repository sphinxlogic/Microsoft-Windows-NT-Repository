KP093, MOTIF_TOYS, Keyboard Practicer for the X Window System

Kp shows a keyboard and practice text.  If you hit the right keys, the
cursor advances.  The keys you hit appear to be pushed in for
amusement.  (This is the primary reason why I chose Motif.)

It also shows the next key you have to hit in reverse-video so that
you don't have to watch your fingers (I know from experience that it
is hard not to watch your fingers).  After you get rid of the habit of
watching your fingers, you can turn off the next-key showing to
perfect your typing.

Kp has a "filter" feature which will let you select the keys you want
to practice.  When this is enabled, only words entirely consisting of
those characters are displayed.  This will make the sentences
meaningless, but it's just practice and you don't have to comprehend
what the practice text is saying.
