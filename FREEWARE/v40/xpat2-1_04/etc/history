Changes xpat2 0.91 -> xpat2 0.92
================================

- fixed a bug in X-gfx2.c: tried to read Cards.conf if open failed.
  Thanks to Mitch DSouza <m.dsouza@mrc-apu.cam.ac.uk> for pointing this out.
- changed the default behaviour of the Seahaven rules to conform to the
  "official" Seahaven rules. The relaxed variant of the previous xpat versions
  may be played by 'xpat2 -rules Seahaven -p0 1'


Highlights of Xpat Version 2:
=============================

- more rule sets
- supports Athena Widgets (looks best with Xaw3d) and Motif
- native language support (not finished yet)
- bookmarks
- alternate graphics module for Colour displays:
  antialiased rank and suit symbols, card construction.
