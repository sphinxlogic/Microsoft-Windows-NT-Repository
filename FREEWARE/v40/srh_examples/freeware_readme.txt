SRH_EXAMPLES, UTILITIES, Source code example collection
 
    SRH_EXAMPLES contains a variety of OpenVMS programming examples
    accumulated (or written) over the years, as well as miscellaneous 
    source modules that did not fit elsewhere on the Freeware CD-ROM.

    Most are written in C, with some written in the older VAX C dialect 
    while the more recent examples are written in the ANSI C dialect 
    of DEC C.

    Some of the interfaces used here are documented, some are not.

    Some of the VAX C code has been adjusted to compile under DEC C, 
    some has not.

    Some of the examples are commented, some are not.
