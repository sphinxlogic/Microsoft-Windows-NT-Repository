XColorEdit 1.1

by Gerald Washington

This program allows you to view the standard X11 color entries, and to edit colors.
The color values can be pasted into another program, or where ever you need them.


Minimum Requirements:
---------------------

X11 Release 4
Motif 1.1
ANSI C compiler


Compilation:
------------

1> Edit the "Makefile" to specify your C compiler, the locations or your X11 and
   Motif include files and libraries, any compiler options, and the destination
   for installation.

2> Type "make".


Installation and Usage:
-----------------------

1> The program "coloredit" can be executed from any location.  You may instal the
   resource file "XColorEdit", or use the built-in resources.

2> Type "coloredit" to begin.  The following command line options are accepted:

	"-rgb <file>" :	Specify the full path and file name of the standard X11
			colors.  default = "/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt", resource =
			"rgbFile"


Notes:
------

Hopefully, the next release will provide a help button.
