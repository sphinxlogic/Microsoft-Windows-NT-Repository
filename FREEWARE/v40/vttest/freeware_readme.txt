VTTEST, UTILITIES, VT100/VT220 Terminal/emulator test program
VTTEST tests the compatibility (or demonstrates the non-compatibility)
of so-called "VT100-compatible" terminals.  This is a new version using
a configure script, in ANSI C, with tests for ISO 6429 color, VT220,
VT420, and xterm extensions.  VTTEST has been tested on several UNIX
platforms as well as VAX/VMS.
