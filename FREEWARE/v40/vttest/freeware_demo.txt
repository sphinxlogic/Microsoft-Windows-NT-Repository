For this cdrom, Terry Kennedy provided me with a temporary account to build
and test my development changes to VTTEST.  I built the set of executables
in vttest-axp.zip with DEC C 5.7 on an Alphastation running VMS 7.2 EFT2.

For other system configurations, to run vttest, you'll need a C compiler
(I've tested with VAX-C and DEC-C).  It's nice but not essential to have
MMS (or its clone, MMK).

Building without MMS:
--------------------

        If you simply want to build vttest, run the script:

                $ @VMSBUILD

        The build-scripts attempt to determine which of three
        configurations you may have:

                VMS with VAX-C
                VMS with DEC-C on a VAX
                VMS with DEC-C on an AXP (alpha)

        I've tested directly on the first configuration; my information
        for the second (DEC-C + VAX) comes from another port.

        The result of the build is an executable, VTTEST.EXE

Building with MMS:
-----------------

        The source distribution includes DESCRIP.MMS, which is the MMS
        script.  Run MMS in the source directory; it'll find this file
        and compile/link VTTEST.EXE, e.g.,

                $ MMS

        I've only used MMK installed as a foreign command; it doesn't
        work well with the recursive macros set in DESCRIP.MMS, in the
        "all" target.

        The standard targets in the MMS script are:  "all", "clean",
        clobber".

Running the program:
-------------------

        You don't have to install the program to run it.  Vttest can run
        from the build directory.  You must define a foreign command to
        run vttest (otherwise it won't get command-line arguments).

        The build scripts can generate a script VTTEST.COM which you can
        execute, defining a foreign command that lets you run vttest,
        e.g.,

                $ @VMSBUILD VTTEST_COM
                $ @VTTEST -P -L

        or

                $ MMS VTTEST.COM
                $ @VTTEST -P -L

        Vttest is a menu-driven program.  Version 1.7 has been used for
        several years in the UNIX environment for testing VT100 terminal
        implementations.  This new version (2.7 980719) runs on VAX/VMS as
        well.  It assumes (but does not require) that you know something
        about the VT100 terminology.

Installing:
----------
        You can install the executable for vttest in the directory where
        you normally install user programs or tools.  Define (e.g., in
        your LOGIN.COM) the foreign command to point to it, e.g.,

                $ VTTEST :== "$ SYS$LOGIN:VTTEST.EXE"

        if you put it in your home directory.
