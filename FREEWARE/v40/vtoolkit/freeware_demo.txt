Welcome to the cool VToolkit demo. I hope you will be
entertained by this collection of widgets and sample programs.

You will experience...

VCountdown - a simple work-in-progress window based on the
flexible VHist widget...

VColorizer - a drag-and-drop colorizer that lets you
(temporarily) colorize almost any object on your screen.
Just pick up a color from the palette and drop it onto a
visible widget in any application...

TestVHist - a demonstration of some of the dynamic
histogram capabilities of the VHist widget...

TestVList - an exerciser for the VList widget...

TestTList - a scrolling message window...

SimpleTestVList - a sample program that uses two VList
widgets and lets you drag-and-drop entries from one list
to the other...

and TestVDrag - a program that shows how to implement
draggable widgets (design your own UI interactively!)
