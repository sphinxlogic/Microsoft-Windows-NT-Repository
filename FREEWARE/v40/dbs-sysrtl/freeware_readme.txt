DBS-SYSRTL, UTILITIES, RTL used by DBS tools

    DBS-SYSRTL contains the source code and build procedures for the 
    run-time library used by the various DBS packages. The run-time 
    library source is in BASIC and Macro-32 and can be built on VAX
    or Alpha. Object libraries are also included. 


    Please note: These packages have been updated as of April 22, 1997.
    The update involved VESTing VAX images to produce Alpha executables.
    These VESTed images have NOT been fully tested - you have been advised.
