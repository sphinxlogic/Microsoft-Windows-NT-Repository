This directory contains the zip file of the CD 5.5B distribution. It is
included here in the event that CD 6.0 fails in your environment, and in
the hopes that whatever plagues 6.0 is not broken in 5.5B.

If 6.0 has failed for you, _please_ send a detailed bug report to me
by email to address cdutil.at.tditx.com (replace .at. with @).

If you are looking for the sources for CD 6.0.... please look in
directory [-.SRC] relative to here.
