
The demo procedure will set up a CD symbol and do a couple of sample
CD operations with logging enabled. The definition shown is a global
definition and represents what you would use to define a symbol for
your use. The demo procedure defines the symbol locally only though
in case you already have a CD symbol defined.

After the tests, the procedure will pause for 10 seconds to give you
a moment to hit holdscreen if you want to review the output for a
little while longer.

If you are under Alpha VMS 7.2 or later, a couple of the new ODS-5
features are demonstrated.
