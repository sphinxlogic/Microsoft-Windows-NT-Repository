There are precompiled versions of the NetPBM package (rel. 1jan96-VMS)
for an Alpha/OpenVMS v6.2, Motif v1.2-3 ECO 7 system in the [.*-ALP]
directory and for a VAX/OpenVMS v5.5-2, Motif v1.1 system in the [.*-VAX]
directory.

Full sources and documentation to build NetPBM for on VAX, Alpha or the
other supported systems are under the [.*-ALP.SRC] directory.

The DEMO setup will define all the NetPBM program symbols and associated
programs and on-line help library.  To use any NetPBM program to convert
one image to another type, use the program name as per the documentation.
