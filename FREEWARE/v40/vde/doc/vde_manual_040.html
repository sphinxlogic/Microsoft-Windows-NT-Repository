If this argument is specified, the first call must pass in the address 
of a longword zero. Once a VDE routine has been called, the 
contents of the address referenced by this longword must not be 
modified by the caller.

The callback routine is called to process individual entries in a 
display operation. It is passed an itemlist containing information on 
each individual entry---the itemlist passed to the callback routine is 
distinct and seperate from the itemlist passed into the original 
request, though it does contain a pointer to the caller's original 
itemlist.

<p>
An example of the declaration of the callback routine follows:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>

</font>
</table>

<p>
The first argument is not currently used. The second argument is the 
address of the itemlist. The third argument is the callback parameter.

<p>
The callback should return a successful status code.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
VDE$UnreserveModule cancels a previous reservation on the specified 
module. To perform the operation, the library, stream, facility and 
module must be specified.

<p>
As parameters specified to VDE callback routines are 
&quot;sticky&quot;, if a required parameter is not specified, it will 
be defaulted to the value used on a preceeding call.

The OpenVMS Development Environment (VDE) tool VDE$UPLOAD
<a name="index_x_968"></a>
<a name="index_x_969"></a>
<a name="index_x_970"></a>
assist OpenVMS engineers in uploading the contents of multiple 
CMS libraries into VDE.

<p>
VDE$UPLOAD requires information on environment to be created and the 
CMS information to be uploaded, and the location(s) where the 
VDE database is to be created. VDE$UPLOAD will then create a 
new VDE database based on the specified CMS libraries. As 
part of this, specified CMS classes from the specified CMS libraries 
will form the basis of new VDE streams, the users from the 
CMS libraries will be created in the VDE database, and the 
CMS command notification ACLs will be uploaded into VDE.

<p>
VDE$UPLOAD does not alter the CMS libraries in any way. As a 
consequence, the manual deletion of CMS command notification ACLs may 
be required.

<p>
To use VDE$UPLOAD, you must create a control file describing the 
requested operation. See <a href="vde_manual_040.html#vde_upload_syntax_tbl">Table D-1</a> for the syntax, and see the 
attached example file. <p>

      immediately previous library block. Multiple creation operations can be 
      accomplished in a single data file.

<p>
This appendix describes the error messages that can be reported by 
VDE.
<a name="index_x_971"></a>
<a name="index_x_972"></a>
<blockquote>
ABKEYW, ambiguous qualifier or keyword '<em>text</em>' - supply more 
characters
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> VDE cannot complete the command because 
'<em>text</em>' is ambiguous in the context of this command.
<blockquote>
ABTBADST, VDE may be in an inconsistent internal state
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The user has typed 3 or more CTRL/Cs. VDE 
normally responds to a CTRL/C by continuing execution until a 
consistent internal state is achieved and then aborts the current 
command. However, if VDE is in an infinite loop and does not detect 
this "consistent" state, it will abort anyway after the 3rd CTRL/C.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Leave and enter VDE again to make sure 
the internal state is consistent.
<blockquote>
ABTCNTLC, command aborted by Control-C
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The current VDE command has been aborted 
due to a control C issued by the user. VDE will attempt to gracefully 
recover.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Issue another command to VDE. It has 
gracefully to a consistent internal state.

<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> This message is used to format text 
strings within VDE, and should not be visible to users as an error 
message.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Contact VDE support for assistance, as 
the version of VDE in use should not be displaying this as an error 
message.
<blockquote>

BLDSTEPNEED, build step needed to make inputs up-to-date: <em>step</em> 
<em>step</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated build step needs to be 
performed to make all input modules up-to-date for the compile or link 
operation you have requested. This situation can occur if, for example, 
you have modified a source module without compiling it (so that the 
corresponding object module is no longer up-to-date) and you then 
request a link that includes the old, non-current object module. This 
is an informational message to alert you that your compile or link will 
not produce fully up-to-date outputs, but the requested compile or link 
will still be performed as you requested.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If the outputs of the compile or link do 
not need to be up-to-date, no action is necessary. Otherwise, you can 
use COMPILE, LINK, or BUILD commands to perform the build steps needed 
to make all inputs to the original compile or link operation up-to-date 
with respect to all source changes. You can then repeat that original 
operation.
<blockquote>
BLDSTEPNOTSHO, <em>steps</em> additional needed build steps not shown

messages are only printed for the first 30 such build steps. Then the 
BLDSTEPNOTSHO message is printed to indicate how many additional build 
steps are needed, but those build steps are not listed individually.
<br>

present in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that 
context. Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as the new 
name for an existing context on the MODIFY CONTEXT command, but another 
context already has the requested new name. Hence the name of the 
existing context could not be changed to the new name.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you entered the wrong context name, 
reenter the command with the correct name. If you entered the right 
context name, use the SHOW CONTEXT command to display the database 
information for that context. If you are not satisfied with that 
information, use the MODIFY CONTEXT command to change it.

EXPGENDIFF, expected generation expression <em>expression</em> differs 
from actual <em>expression</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> When you reserved the module you are 
replacing, the RESERVE command displayed the expected replace-time CMS 
generation expression of the new module generation. However, the actual 
CMS generation expression that VDE assigned during the current 
replacement differs from that expected generation expression. This 
situation is normal because VDE cannot predict the actual replace-time 
CMS generation expression when you reserve the module; it can only tell 
you the most likely generation expression. By the time you replace the 
module, various circumstances can change the appropriate generation 
expression to use.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> None. This message is informational only. 
However, if you used the expected CMS generation expression in code 
comments, you may have to change those comments.
<blockquote>

<strong>Explanation:</strong> When you replace the module you just 
reserved, the new generation of the module is expected to have the 
indicated CMS generation expression. You may use this generation 
expression as an &quot;audit trail identifier&quot; in the comments in 
your code if your project uses that convention. The indicated 
generation expression may differ from the one that VDE actually assigns 
when you replace the module, but only in certain unusual circumstances.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> None. This message is informational only.
<blockquote>
EXPGENLONG, expected CMS generation expression is too long
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The expected replace-time CMS generation 
expression for the module you are reserving will be longer than 16 
characters, which is longer than CMS allows. As a result, you cannot 
reserve the module.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This error indicates that you have 
reserved and replaced modules on too many nested non-main streams. You 
should create new streams off the main development stream and place the 
offending generations there so that they have CMS generation 
expressions of modest size. Even though you cannot reserve the 
generation in question, you can still fetch it out and replace it into 
the new streams.

<blockquote>
FIRGENNODEL, generation <em>generation</em> is first generation of 
module; cannot be deleted
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are trying to delete the first 
generation of a module with the DELETE GENERATION command, which VDE 
does not allow. If you want to delete all generations of a module, you 
must delete the entire module with the DELETE MODULE command.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you mistyped the generation number, 
reenter it correctly. If you want to delete all generations of the

<blockquote>
FOLDEXP, fold record for <em>fold</em> expected for stream 
<em>stream</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> This message informs you that VDE expects 
to generate a fold record for the indicated stream. The fold record 
will be generated when this module change is approved and performed by 
the project leader---when the queued replacement is performed. Because 
there may be a delay before the replacement is performed by the project 
leader and because the project leader may reject the replacement, the 
fold record will not immediately appear via commands such as SHOW 
REPLACEMENT. The fold will be generated when VDE sends you the 
notification that the replacement has been performed. This message is 
only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the REPLACE command, and 
only for a queued replacement from which VDE expects to generate a fold 
record.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> You may/will need to resolve the fold 
record that will (eventually) be generated by this replacement. Use the 
/NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to see the message.
<blockquote>
FOLDIDREQ, fold identifier required for module <em>module</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have multiple fold records for the 
indicated module. You must therefore specify a fold identifier with the 
/IDENTIFICATION or /FOLD qualifier (depending on the command) to 
uniquely indicate to which fold record you want the command to apply.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Reissue the command with the 
/IDENTIFICATION or /FOLD qualifier to indicate the specific fold record 
to which you want the command to apply.
<blockquote>
FOLDIDUSED, fold identifier <em>identifier</em> already used for module 
<em>module</em> attempt to create fold record has failed
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are trying to create a fold record 
for a module using the same fold identifier as you have used on a 
previous fold record for the same module in the same development 
stream. This is not allowed, since fold identifiers must be unique.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Reissue the CREATE FOLD command with a 
different fold identifier specified on the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier. 
Alternatively, you can omit the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, in which 
case VDE will assign a unique identifier for you.
<blockquote>
FOLDINSTRM, generation <em>generation</em> must be folded into stream 
<em>stream</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> This message informs you that you must 
manually fold the indicated module generation into the indicated 
development stream in order to propagate the changes in that generation 
into the stream. VDE cannot propagate the changes automatically because 
the module has already diverged between that stream and its 
predecessor. This message is only issued when you use the /LOG 
qualifier on the REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command 
if you do not wish to see the message.

<em>module</em> and stream <em>stream</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to reference a fold record 
for the indicated module in the indicated development stream, but there 
is no such fold record.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the 
message simply tells you that the indicated module has no fold records 
in the indicated stream.
<blockquote>
FROMDIREMPTY, the directory <em>directory</em> specified with 
/FROM_DIRECTORY is empty
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the directory specified with the 
/FROM_DIRECTORY qualifier is empty, no modules are created.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> None.

<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are trying to delete a generation of 
a module which is still reachable by at least one stream and/or is not 
a leaf generation (some other generation points to it as its previous 
generation). VDE does not allow a generation to be deleted in either of 
these cases.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Check that you have specified the correct 
generation for deletion.
<blockquote>
GENNOPRED, generation <em>generation</em> of <em>module</em> has no 
predecessor
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The generation of the indicated module 
with the shown CMS generation expression does not have a predecessor 
generation. As a result, the current operation cannot be performed. For 
example, the DIFFERENCES command cannot compare generation 1 with its 
predecessor because it has no predecessor.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Specify a generation that has a 
predecessor (normally any generation except generation 1) and rerun the 
command.
<blockquote>

<strong>Explanation:</strong> The VDE database does not have the proper 
format. The database header record could be read successfully, but that 
record does not contain the proper sentinel value or its database 
version value indicates an out-of-date or invalid database format. This 
error could indicate that the database has been corrupted in some way 
or that VDE has generated it incorrectly.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Try to connect to the database again 
using the SET LIBRARY command. If that does not work, you may have to 
recreate the library (and thus the database) from scratch with the 
CREATE LIBRARY command. If that still does not work, please contact VDE 
support for assistance.

<blockquote>
MODALRQUEREP, module <em>module</em> already queued for replacement 
<em>replacement</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to replace or unreserve a 
module that already belongs to the indicated queued replacement. A 
reservation that already belongs to a queued replacement cannot be 
unreserved or queued for another replacement; the reservation remains 
until the original replacement is performed or cancelled. As a result, 
your attempt to replace or unreserve the module has failed.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you want to remove the module 
reservation from its current queued replacement, you must cancel that 
replacement with the CANCEL REPLACEMENT command. You can then unreserve 
the module or replace it as part of another replacement.
<blockquote>
MODALRRES, module <em>module</em> already reserved; reservation has 
failed
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to reserve a module that 
is already reserved by another user (possibly yourself). That 
reservation does not allow concurrent reservations, or you have not 
requested a concurrent reservation. The reservation may be in the 
current default stream, or in an ancestor stream. As a result of this 
prior reservation, your attempt to reserve the module has failed.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Wait until the user who has reserved the 
module replaces it in the library. Then reserve it yourself. You can 
use the SHOW RESERVATION/FULL command to see who currently has the 
module reserved, and in what stream the module was originally reserved. 
Alternatively, you can use the /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT qualifier to 
concurrently reserve the module, or the /QUEUE qualifier to queue a 
request for notification when the module becomes available.
<blockquote>
MODDEL, module <em>module</em> deleted from the database
</blockquote>

<br>

database. This message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
on the DELETE MODULE command.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command 
if you do not wish to see the message.
<blockquote>
MODEXISTS, module <em>module</em> already exists in database; module 
not changed
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated module name was specified 
on a CREATE MODULE command, but an entry for that module is already 
present in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that 
module. Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as the new name 
for an existing module on the MODIFY MODULE command, but another module 
in the same facility already has the requested new name. Hence the name 
of the existing module could not be changed to the new name.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you entered the wrong module name, 
reenter the command with the correct name. If you entered the right 
module name, use the SHOW MODULE command to display the database 
information for that module. If you are not satisfied with that 
information, use the MODIFY MODULE command to change it.
<blockquote>

indicated module is recorded as an input to the build step being 
defined. This message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on 
the CREATE STEP or MODIFY STEP command.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command 
if you do not wish to see the message.
<blockquote>
MODLOCKED, module <em>module</em> locked for replacement by another user
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The module you are trying to replace is 
currently being replaced by another user who is updating the same 
generation as you want to update. As a result, your replacement attempt 
failed.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Wait a minute or two and then try the 
operation again. If the other user deleted your concurrent reservation 
through his or her replacement, your second attempt will fail with a 
message to that effect. If the other user's replacement failed or did 
not conflict with yours, your new replacement attempt can succeed.
<blockquote>

<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> No build job is present in the database 
that belongs to the indicated stream and matches the selection criteria 
you specified on the SHOW BUILD_JOB or other BUILD_JOB command. The 
selection criteria you have specified may include the build-job 
identification number, the build-job status, or bounds on the build-job 
creation date and time.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the 
message simply tells you that the no build job exists for the stream 
and selection criteria you specified.
<blockquote>
NOBLDSTEPS, build job contains no build steps; build job is not created
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You tried to create a build job with the 
BUILD command, but the build job turns out to contain no build steps. 
As a result, the build job is not created in the database. The usual 
cause of this error is that you specified a minimal build of modules 
that are already up-to-date with respect to their source modules.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you intended to perform a minimal 
build, the build job is unnecessary. If you intended to perform a full 
build, specify the /FULL qualifier on the BUILD command.

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> VDE tried to access the delta-file 
directory for the indicated facility, but no such directory is recorded 
in the database. This normally means that you have not yet created the 
disk directories for the facility.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> To create the facility's delta-file

<strong>Explanation:</strong> VDE tried to access the marker-file 
directory for the indicated facility, but no such directory is recorded 
in the database. This normally means that you have failed to create a 
delta-file subdirectory with directory symbol VDE$MARKER for the 
indicated facility. Such a directory must exist for you to create 
modules that use marker files.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> To create the needed subdirectory, use 
the SET DIRECTORY command with the /DELTA_FILES and /SYMBOL=VDE$MARKER 
qualifiers. Then create the facility's delta-file directory tree with 
the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command, using the /DELTA_FILES and possibly 
/FACILITY qualifiers. Use the SHOW LOCATION command to see what disk 
directories are recorded in the VDE database.

</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to create queued 
replacement for some module, but no staging area root directory exists 
for the library. Hence VDE cannot create a disk directory for saving 
(or &quot;staging&quot;) the files to be replaced.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE/STAGING 
command to create the root directory for the library's staging areas. 
Then reenter the REPLACE command. Alternatively, replace the module 
with an immediate (as opposed to queued) replacement. An immediate 
replacement does not use a staging area.
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to create a directory tree 
for a specific facility within the current stream, but no root 
directory exists for the stream. Hence VDE cannot create any disk 
directories for the indicated facility.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to 
create a directory tree for the current stream. That will automatically 
create both the stream root directory and the subdirectories for all 
facilities.
<blockquote>
NOSTRMSPEC, no stream specified for operation
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The command you have entered requires 
that you specify the name of a development stream, either with the

name as required.
<blockquote>
NOSUCHARCH, architecture <em>architecture</em> not found in database
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated architecture name was 
entered on a command, but no such architecture was found in the VDE 
database.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the 
message simply tells you that the indicated architecture does not exist 
in the database. However, if you had expected such an architecture to 
exist, you may use the SHOW ARCHITECTURE command to see what 
architectures are found in the database. If the desired architecture is 
not there, ask your project administator to add it to the database. 
Then reenter your command with a valid architecture name.
<blockquote>
NOSUCHCTX, context <em>context</em> not found in database
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated context name was entered on 
a command, but no such context was found in the VDE database.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the 
message simply tells you that the indicated context does not exist in 
the database. However, if you had expected such a context to exist, you 
may use the SHOW CONTEXT command to see what contexts are found in the 
database.
<blockquote>
NOSUCHDIRSYM, directory symbol <em>symbol</em> not found in database
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated directory symbol was 
referenced by a script but no such directory symbol was found in the 
VDE database. VDE tried to use the directory symbol either to look up 
the directory location for the script's DCL command file or to evaluate 
a script function such as $DIR or $STRMDIR. The most likely reason for 
the error is that you used a script function that takes a directory 
symbol as a parameter, and you misspelled the symbol name or specified 
a symbol you have not yet defined. Directory symbols are defined with 
the /SYMBOL qualifier of the SET DIRECTORY command.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Correct the script function call to have 
a correct directory symbol that is already defined. Then reenter the 
script in the database with the CREATE SCRIPT command and reenter the 
command that got the error message.
<blockquote>
NOSUCHFAC, facility <em>facility</em> not found in database
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated facility name was entered 
on a command, but no such facility was found in the VDE database.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the 
message simply tells you that the indicated facility does not exist in 
the database. However, if you had expected such a facility to exist, 
you may use the SHOW FACILITY command to see what facilities are found 
in the database. If the desired facility is not there, ask your project 
administator to add it to the database. Then reenter your command with 
a valid facility name.
<blockquote>
NOSUCHFOLD, fold record <em>record</em> not found for module 
<em>module</em> and stream <em>stream</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to reference a fold record 
with the indicated fold identifier for the indicated module and stream, 
but there is no such fold record in the VDE database. As a result, VDE 
has aborted the current command and rolled back the current transaction.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Specify a valid fold record and reenter 
the command.
<blockquote>
NOSUCHFUNC, no such script function exists: <em>function</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated script function was 
specified in a VDE script, but no such function exists. The most likely 
cause for this error is that you misspelled the function name. VDE 
recognizes a script function by the fact that all script function names 
begin with a dollar sign. Directory symbol names, which can appear in 
the same places as functions in scripts, should not begin with dollar 
signs.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Correct the spelling of the function name 
or select a directory symbol name that does not begin with a dollar 
sign.
<blockquote>
NOSUCHGEN, generation <em>generation</em> not found in database

database.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the 
message simply tells you that the indicated generation does not exist 
in the database. However, if you had expected such a generation of a 
module to exist, you may use the SHOW GENERATION command to see what 
module generations are found in the database.
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated group name was entered on a 
command, but no such group was found in the VDE database.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the

<blockquote>
OUTMODSRC, output module <em>module</em> of build step is a source 
module; ignored
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The automatically collected dependency 
information for the current build step specifies that the indicated 
module is an output from the step. However, the module is marked as a 
source module in the VDE database, and a source module cannot be an 
output of a build step. Hence this dependency information is ignored 
and is not recorded in the database.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If the module is erroneously marked as a 
source module in the VDE database, you should delete the module and 
rerun the build step. If the module actually is a source module, you 
should investigate why the compiler or other processor specifies it as 
an output from the build step.

<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you want more than 1024 characters for 
input, divide each line into records that are less than 1024 characters 
and use the continuation character "-" at the point of each break. If 
the sum of these records are greater than 32,768 characters, then the 
complete command line cannot be processed.
<blockquote>
PREFIXNOTALL, prefix VDE$ not allowed in facility or stream names
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to create or rename a 
facility or stream with a name that begins with the prefix 
&quot;VDE$&quot; but VDE does not allow facilities or streams to have 
such names. VDE uses facility and stream names as disk directory names, 
but VDE also creates directories reserved for its own use whose names 
always begin with the VDE$ prefix. To prevent name conflicts between 
facility or stream directories and these reserved directories, VDE does 
not allow facility or stream names to begin with the VDE$ prefix.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Reenter the command with a facility or 
stream name that does not begin with VDE$.

</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are attempting to modify or cancel a 
queued replacement that belongs to another user, and you do not have 
the PERFREP privilege that would allow you to cancel or modify another 
user's replacements. As a result, the replacement is not cancelled or 
modified.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Reenter the command specifying your own

</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated replacement name was 
specified on a REPLACE command, but an entry for that replacement is 
already present in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for 
that replacement. Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as 
the new name for an existing replacement on the MODIFY REPLACEMENT 
command, but another replacement already has the requested new name. 
Hence the name of the existing replacement could not be changed to the 
new name.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you entered the wrong replacement 
name, reenter the command with the correct name. If you entered the 
right replacement name, use the SHOW REPLACEMENT command to display the 
database information for that replacement. If you are not satisfied 
with that information, use the MODIFY REPLACEMENT command to change it.

must use either /KEY or /COMMAND.
<blockquote>
RESDEL, reservation <em>reservation</em> of <em>module</em> for user 
<em>user</em> has been deleted
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> This message informs you that the 
indicated reservation has been deleted from the VDE database because 
you performed an operation that changed what generation is the latest 
generation of the module for some stream. Such operations include the 
DELETE, INSERT, and REMOVE GENERATION commands. After such an 
operation, the reservation is based on the wrong generation and can no 
longer be replaced into the stream.
<br>

RESIDREQ, reservation identifier required for module <em>module</em>
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have multiple reservations for the 
indicated module. You must therefore specify a reservation identifier 
with the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier to uniquely indicate to which 
reservation you want the command to apply.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Reissue the command with the 
/IDENTIFICATION qualifier to indicate the specific reservation to which 
you want the command to apply.
<blockquote>
RESIDUSED, reservation Id <em>ID</em> already used for module 
<em>module</em> attempt to reserve module has failed
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are trying to reserve a module 
concurrently using the same reservation identification as you have used 
on a previous reservation of the same module in the same stream 
development stream. This is not allowed, since reservation 
identifications must be unique.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Reissue the RESERVE command with a 
different reservation identification specified on the /IDENTIFICATION 
qualifier. Alternatively, you can omit the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, 
in which case VDE will assign a unique identification for you.

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated session name was specified 
on a REPLACE command, but an entry for that session is already present 
in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that session. 
Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as the new name for an 
existing session on the MODIFY SESSION command, but another session 
already has the requested new name. Hence the name of the existing 
session could not be changed to the new name.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you entered the wrong session name, 
reenter the command with the correct name. If you entered the right 
session name, use the SHOW SESSION command to display the database

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have tried to change the state of a 
stream development stream with the /OPEN or /FROZEN qualifier on the 
MODIFY STREAM command when the stream is already in the permanently 
closed state. The rest of the command still takes effect, but the 
stream state is not changed; the stream remains closed.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> No user action is necessary; the state 
cannot be changed and the command did not change it.

database. This message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
on the DELETE STREAM command.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command 
if you do not wish to see the message.
<blockquote>
STRMEXISTS, stream <em>stream</em> already exists in database
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated stream name was specified 
on a CREATE STREAM command, but an entry for that stream is already 
present in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that 
stream. Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as the new name 
for an existing stream on the MODIFY STREAM command, but another stream 
already has the requested new name. Hence the name of the existing 
stream could not be changed to the new name.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you entered the wrong stream name, 
reenter the command with the correct name. If you entered the right 
stream name, use the SHOW STREAM command to display the database 
information for that stream. If you are not satisfied with that 
information, use the MODIFY STREAM command to change it.
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
STRMNOTCLOSED, stream <em>stream</em> can not be deleted because it is 
not closed
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are trying to delete a stream which 
is in an open or frozen state. Only streams in a closed state may be 
deleted.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If appropriate, change the state of the 
stream to closed and repeat the delete stream command.
<blockquote>
STRMNOTDEL, stream <em>stream</em> not deleted
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are attempting to delete a stream 
that cannot be deleted. Additional messages are normally included with 
this message, and these messages indicate why the strean cannot be 
deleted.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Resolve the problem(s) flagged by the 
other error messages, and reenter the DELETE STREAM command.
<blockquote>
STRMNOTFOUND, stream <em>stream</em> not found in database; parameter 
ignored
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The indicated stream name was entered on 
a SHOW STREAM command, but no such stream was found in the VDE database.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> This is not necessarily an error; the 
message simply tells you that the indicated stream does not exist in 
the database.
<blockquote>
STRMNOTOPEN, stream <em>stream</em> is not open; operation not allowed
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are trying to reserve or replace a 
module, but the currently active stream (whose name is given in the 
message) is either frozen or closed. It is thus not open for the 
reservation or replacement of modules.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> You can use the SHOW STREAM/FULL command 
to see the status of the current stream. If the stream is closed, it is 
permanently protected against being changed, and you should not be 
trying to reserve or replace modules in it. If the stream is frozen, it 
is currently protected against being changed, but changes may be 
allowed later when the library administrator sets the state back to 
open. You must then wait until the stream becomes open. (You may 
reserve modules from a frozen stream, but not replace them.) Finally, 
if you meant to reserve or replace modules in another stream, you 
should use the SET STREAM command to switch your context to that stream 
and then reserve or replace the desired modules.
<blockquote>
STRMNOTPOP, stream <em>stream</em> is not allowed to be populated
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are attempting to populate the 
indicated stream with the POPULATE STREAM command but a stream 
attribute disallows use of this command for the stream. Hence the 
stream has not been populated.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> Either you should not be trying to 
populate the stream or else you must set the stream attribute that 
allows you to populate the stream before retrying the operation. To set 
that attribute, use the /POPULATE qualifier to the MODIFY STREAM 
command.
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
SUCGENEXIST, successor generation for <em>module</em> already exists in 
library
</blockquote>

<br>
<strong>Facility:</strong> VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The new generation of the indicated 
module created by the current REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command 
should get a whole-number CMS generation expression but the reserved 
generation already has a successor generation in the VDE library with 
that whole-number CMS generation expression. This situation can arise 
if you have placed the reserved generation into a stream using the 
INSERT GENERATION command or if you have changed the stream that 
&quot;owns&quot; the whole-number successor generation with the 
/MAIN_STREAM qualifier to the MODIFY GENERATION command.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If the existing whole-number successor 
generation should not be in the VDE library, delete it and its 
successors with the DELETE GENERATION command. Then repeat the failed 
replacement. Otherwise, use the /MAIN_STREAM qualifier to the MODIFY 
GENERATION command to allocate ownership of the whole-number successor 
generation to the stream that already owns that generation, but not to 
any stream into which you are trying to replace the module. This will 
force the replacement to use a CMS variant letter. Then repeat the 
replacement.

the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that user. 
Alternatively, the indicated username was specified as the new username 
for an existing user on the MODIFY USER command, but another user 
already has the requested new username. Hence the username of the 
existing user could not be changed to the new username.
<br>
<strong>User Action:</strong> If you entered the wrong username, 
reenter the command with the correct username. If you entered the right 
username, use the SHOW USER command to display the database information
