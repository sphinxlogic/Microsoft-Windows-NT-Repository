<p>
The REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem accepts the following commands at the 
VDEREVREP&gt; prompt:

<ul>
  <li>DIRECTORY <em>[mod-name [, mod-name...]]</em>
<a name="index_x_590"></a>
<a name="index_x_591"></a>
    <br>Displays a list of all information files, comment files, 
    replacement log files, and modules on the replacement review list. For 
    each file, this command displays the type (information, comment, log, 
    module, or binary module) and the name of user who created the file 
    (for information and comment files) or the name of the module. If you 
    specify one or more <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters, the command 
    displays only those modules whose names match the parameters. You can 
    use wildcards in the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. An 
    information or comment file has the author's OpenVMS username as 
    its file name, so these files can also be selected with 
    <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters. The replacement log file (if 
    present) has the file name LOG.VDE$LOG.
<a name="index_x_592"></a>
  <li> SELECT <em>[mod-name]</em>
<a name="index_x_593"></a>
<a name="index_x_594"></a>
    <br>Selects the first review list element whose module or file name 
    matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter and makes that the 
    current review list element. This command prints one line identifying 
    the selected module or file. You can select an information or comment 
    file by specifying the author's OpenVMS username in the 
    <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. You can select the log file (if 
    present) by specifying LOG in the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. 
    <br>If you omit the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter, the command 
    displays the next element on the review list that matches the most 
    recently specified module name from a previous SELECT command. Using 
    this feature, you can enter a SELECT command with a 
    <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter containing wildcards to select the 
    first module (or other file) that matches the parameter. You can then 
    enter SELECT commands without parameters to successively select all 
    other modules and files that match the original parameter, one module 
    or file per SELECT command.
  <li> SHOW <em>[keyword]</em>
<a name="index_x_595"></a>
<a name="index_x_596"></a>
    <br>Prints the text of the current review-list element on your 
    terminal. If the current element is an information or comment file, 
    VDE reads that file and prints it on your terminal. If the 
    current element is a module, VDE prints the new version of 
    the module (the version about to be replaced into the library), the old 
    version of the module (the generation that was fetched when the module 
    was reserved), or the differences between the two. The 
    <strong>keyword</strong> parameter determines what is displayed for a 
    module; this parameter may be the keyword NEW, OLD, or DIFFERENCES. 
    This parameter is ignored for information, comment, and log files. 
    <br>If you specify the OLD keyword, VDE fetches out the old 
    module generation unless a previous reviewer has already fetched it 
    into the replacement's staging area. VDE then displays that 
    file. If you specify the DIFFERENCES
<a name="index_x_597"></a>
keyword, VDE fetches out the old module generation if 
necessary. VDE then runs the OpenVMS DIFFERENCES 
command to create a differences file unless a previous reviewer has 
already created it. VDE then displays that file. <br>This 
command will not display any files for binary source modules.
  <li> EDIT <em>[keyword]</em>
<a name="index_x_598"></a>
<a name="index_x_599"></a>
    <br>Invokes your preferred editor in read-only mode to display the text 
    of the current review-list element. If the current element is an 
    information or comment file, VDE spawns the editor to 
    display that file. If the current element is a module, VDE 
    spawns the editor to display the new version of the module (the version 
    about to be replaced into the library), the old version of the module 
    (the generation that was fetched when the module was reserved), or the 
    differences between the two. The <strong>keyword</strong> parameter 
    determines what is displayed for a module; this parameter may be the 
    keyword NEW, OLD, or DIFFERENCES. This parameter is ignored for 
    information, comment, and log files. <br>If you specify the OLD 
    keyword, VDE fetches out the old module generation unless a 
    previous reviewer has already fetched it into the replacement's staging 
    area. VDE then displays that file. If you specify the 
    DIFFERENCES keyword, VDE fetches out the old module 
    generation if necessary. VDE then runs the OpenVMS 
    DIFFERENCES command to create a differences file unless a previous 
    reviewer has already created it. VDE then displays that 
    file. <br>This command will not display any files for binary source 
    modules. <br>Use the SET EDITOR command at the VDE„ prompt to 
    specify your preferred editor. If you do not declare an editor, 
    VDE invokes the system default editor.
<a name="index_x_600"></a>
  <li> NEXT
<a name="index_x_601"></a>
<a name="index_x_602"></a>
    <br>Makes the next element on the review list the current element and 
    displays the name of that element. <br>Pressing the KP0 key (the 0 key 
    on the numeric keypad) is the same as entering the NEXT command. As a 
    result, you can step from element to element by repeatedly pressing the 
    KP0 key. Similarly, the COMMA (,) key on the numeric keypad enters the 
    NEXT and SHOW commands with a single keystroke and the MINUS (--) key 
    on the numeric keypad enters the NEXT and EDIT commands.
  <li> BACK
<a name="index_x_603"></a>
<a name="index_x_604"></a>
    <br>Makes the previous element on the review list the current element 
    and displays the name of that element.
  <li> CURRENT
<a name="index_x_605"></a>
<a name="index_x_606"></a>
    <br>Displays the name of the current element of the replacement review 
    list.
  <li> FIRST
<a name="index_x_607"></a>
<a name="index_x_608"></a>
    <br>Makes the first element on the review list the current element and 
    displays the name of that element.
  <li> LAST
<a name="index_x_609"></a>
<a name="index_x_610"></a>
    <br>Makes the last element on the review list the current element and 
    displays the name of that element.
  <li> ACCEPT <em>["remark-string"]</em>
<a name="index_x_611"></a>
<a name="index_x_612"></a>
    <br>Records in the VDE database that you accept the 
    replacement currently being reviewed. You must be a reviewer for the 
    replacement to use this command. You can specify the optional remark 
    string to give a reason for accepting the replacement. This command 
    accepts the same qualifiers as the VDE-level ACCEPT 
    REPLACEMENT command.
  <li> REJECT <em>"remark-string"</em>
<a name="index_x_613"></a>
<a name="index_x_614"></a>
    <br>Records in the VDE database that you reject the 
    replacement currently being reviewed. You must be a reviewer for the 
    replacement to use this command. The remark string should specify a 
    reason for rejecting the replacement. If you omit the remark parameter, 
    VDE prompts you for a remark. This command accepts the same 
    qualifiers as the VDE-level REJECT REPLACEMENT command. Like 
    REJECT REPLACEMENT, the REJECT command lets you specify a comment file 
    to more fully explain your reasons for rejecting the replacement.
<a name="index_x_615"></a>
  <li> SPAWN
<a name="index_x_616"></a>
<a name="index_x_617"></a>
    <br>Spawns a subprocess and attaches the terminal to that subprocess. 
    See the description of the VDE SPAWN command for details.
  <li> ATTACH
<a name="index_x_618"></a>
<a name="index_x_619"></a>
    <br>Attaches the terminal to a specified process. See the description 
    of the VDE ATTACH command for details.
  <li> EXIT
<a name="index_x_620"></a>
<a name="index_x_621"></a>
    <br>Exits from the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem and returns you to the 
    VDE„ prompt.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
Scripts are used to add various user-defined extensions to various 
VDE functions and commands. VDE invokes various 
scripts at various times during VDE processing---see 
<a href="vde_manual_026.html#vde_script_types">Script Types</a> for further information on this.

<p>
Scripts of various types are recorded in the VDE database. A 
<strong>script</strong> is a sequence of keywords in the VDE 
script language that VDE can execute to create a DCL command 
file. VDE can then invoke that DCL command file in a 
subprocess to perform the action of the script. VDE uses 
scripts to perform many different kinds of actions. For example, 
VDE uses &quot;compile scripts&quot; to compile modules in a 
build job. Similarly, it uses &quot;new-stream scripts&quot; to 
populate the directories of a new stream with files when it performs 
the CREATE STREAM command. There are many other kinds of scripts, all 
distinguished by the keywords or circumstances that cause them to be 
invoked.

<p>
The primary purpose of VDE scripts is to insert names and 
directory specifications from the VDE database into text you 
specify to generate DCL command files that perform various actions. A 
VDE script is thus a mixture of plain text and invocations 
of functions that retrieve names (such as module names, type names, and 
facility names) and directory strings (such as the names of facility 
subdirectories) from the VDE database.

<p>
Since you define scripts, you define how VDE should perform 
the corresponding actions. For example, you decide how a Pascal module 
is compiled because you define the Pascal compilation script. 
Similarly, you can define a script that defines auxiliary actions of 
the REPLACE command. Scripts thus let you make policy decisions for 
your own project, while VDE provides the mechanisms that 
implement your policies.

<p>
When a new development stream is created, all script definitions from 
the parent stream are copied to the child stream. If modified, the 
script definitions then evolve independently in the two development 
streams.

<p>
A VDE script is a sequence of text lines that contain 
VDE script keywords. There are only three VDE 
script commands: EMIT, FETCH, and EXIT.

<p>
In addition, a script may contain blank lines and comment lines. The 
exclamation point (!) is the comment character.
<a name="index_x_624"></a>
<a name="index_x_625"></a>
VDE ignores any text on a script line after an exclamation 
point, provided the exclamation point is not within quotes. A script 
keyword command may be continued from one line to the
<a name="index_x_626"></a>
<a name="index_x_627"></a>
next by ending the first line with the sequence space-minus ( --).

<p>
VDE accepts the following keyword commands in a script:

<ul>
  <li>EMIT <em>string [, string...]</em>
<a name="index_x_628"></a>
<a name="index_x_629"></a>
    <br>Emits one line into the DCL command file. This keyword command 
    evaluates each <strong>string</strong> parameter, concatenates the 
    resulting character strings into a single line of text, and writes this 
    line of text to the DCL command file being generated. Each 
    <strong>string</strong> parameter may be a quoted character string, an 
    invocation of a script function, or
<a name="index_x_630"></a>
 a directory symbol name. <br>If the EMIT command parameter contains 
 spaces or other characters, the string must be enclosed in a pair of 
 quoting characters. (eg: If the command is a typical DCL command and 
 contains blanks and various other characters, it must be quoted.) Valid 
 quoting character pairs include the double-quote pair: (&quot;) and 
 (&quot;), and the double-caret pair: (&laquo;) and (&raquo;).
<a name="index_x_631"></a>
<a name="index_x_632"></a>
Use of the end-quoting character within the string is permissible, but 
requires that the character be doubled. (eg: a double-quote character 
within the string is specified by double double-quotes; by two 
consecutive double-quotes: (&quot;&quot;).) <br>If the parameter is an 
invocation of a script function, you must specify the function name or 
the function name followed by a parenthesized list of function 
parameters. VDE evaluates the function to produce a 
character string that is concatenated to the current DCL command line. 
(Next section lists the available script functions.) <br>If the 
parameter is a directory symbol name, VDE looks up the 
OpenVMS directory specification associated with the directory 
symbol from the VDE database and concatenates that string to 
the current DCL command line. OpenVMS directory symbols are
<a name="index_x_633"></a>
 defined using the SET DIRECTORY command. <br>To exit from the generated 
 DCL in the script, issue one of the following script commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
 
<em>EMIT &laquo;$ GOTO VDE$ERROR&raquo;</em>
<em>EMIT &laquo;$ GOTO VDE$SUCCESS&raquo;</em>
<em>EMIT "$ EXIT"</em>
 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

  <li>EXIT
<a name="index_x_634"></a>
<a name="index_x_635"></a>
    <br>Exits from the script during script execution. Subsequent script 
    commands are thus not executed to produce DCL commands. (Note that the 
    EXIT keyword does not create an EXIT command in the DCL command file; 
    it only stops script execution. See the documentation on the EMIT 
    script command for information on generating the proper DCL exit 
    sequence from within a script.)
  <li>FETCH <em>string [, string...]</em>
<a name="index_x_636"></a>
<a name="index_x_637"></a>
    <br>Fetches a module generation from the VDE library. This 
    keyword evaluates each <strong>string</strong> parameter, concatenates 
    the resulting character strings into a single line of text, and 
    interprets the line as the qualifiers and parameters to a 
    VDE FETCH command. Each <strong>string</strong> parameter 
    may be a quoted character string, an invocation of a script function, 
    or a directory symbol name. <br>Your <strong>string</strong> parameters 
    should generate the full VDE FETCH command you want 
    performed except for the FETCH keyword. The <strong>string</strong> 
    parameters can generate all qualifiers and parameters that the 
    VDE FETCH keyword accepts, and can use script functions to 
    include strings such as module names, stream names, and directory 
    specifications. The resulting command string is parsed and executed as 
    if it belonged to a normal FETCH keyword entered from the terminal. Use 
    the FETCH keyword when you want VDE to fetch a generation 
    directly, without using a DCL command file, and you want it performed 
    in the same database transaction as the operation performing the 
    script. <br>By default, VDE fetches the latest generation of 
    the specified module in the stream for which the script is invoked. You 
    can override this default by generating a /STREAM qualifier, 
    /GENERATION qualifier, or a generation number for the FETCH keyword. 
    The script FETCH keyword suppresses log messages by default, but you 
    can override this default by generating a /LOG qualifier. Otherwise, 
    all parameters, qualifiers, and defaults are the same as for the 
    regular VDE FETCH keyword described elsewhere. <br>If a 
    <strong>string</strong> parameter is a quoted character string, the 
    string must be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;). A double-quote 
    character within the string is specified by two consecutive double 
    quotes (&quot;&quot;). VDE concatenates the quoted string to 
    the current FETCH keyword line. <br>If the parameter is an invocation 
    of a script function, you must specify the function name or the 
    function name followed by a parenthesized list of function parameters. 
    VDE evaluates the function to produce a character string 
    that is concatenated to the current FETCH keyword line. (Next section 
    lists the available script functions.) <br>If the parameter is a 
    directory symbol name,
<a name="index_x_638"></a>
VDE looks up the OpenVMS directory specification 
associated with the directory symbol from the VDE database 
and concatenates that string to the current FETCH keyword line. 
OpenVMS directory symbols are defined using the SET DIRECTORY 
command.
</ul>

<p>
When executing a script, VDE executes successive script 
keywords from the script until it encounters an EXIT keyword or the end 
of the script. VDE executes FETCH keywords immediately as 
they are encountered. VDE writes all lines generated by EMIT 
keywords to the output DCL command file. At the end of the script, 
VDE executes that command file in a subprocess to perform 
the action of the script.
<p>
<a name="vde_cmd_crescrp_select"><strong>Selection of Scripts</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
Many types of scripts are invoked when a certain operation must be 
applied to a specific module, such as compiling or reserving the 
module. For such operations, VDE must select the script that 
is appropriate to the module. The type of the script is of course the 
primary selection criterion, but even for a given type, different 
scripts are needed for different modules. The script that compiles a 
Fortran module is not appropriate for a C module, for example, and the 
script that links one image cannot link another. (<a href="vde_manual_026.html#vde_script_functions">Script Functions</a> 
contains the types of scripts supported by VDE.)

<p>
To accommodate such situations, VDE lets you specify how 
scripts are selected based on the module name. You can specify that a 
script should be used only for a specific module, for all modules of a 
certain type in a given facility, for all modules of a given type 
regardless of facility, or for all modules regardless of type or 
facility. When you create such a script, you specify the script type 
with a qualifier, such as /COMPILE or /RESERVE. You also specify the 
modules to which the script applies through a module-name parameter to 
the qualifier. A restricted form of wildcarding determines what modules 
the script can be used for. The following module-name specifications 
are allowed:

<ul>
  <li>[FACIL]MOD.TYP <br>If you fully specify the module name, the script 
  applies only to that specific module. For example, the qualifier 
  /LINK=[CODE]X.EXE says that the script can only be used to link image 
  X.EXE in facility CODE. If you omit the facility name, the current 
  default facility is assumed.
  <li>[FACIL]*.TYP <br>If you specify the facility name and type name but 
  specify an asterisk (*) in place of the module name, the script applies 
  to all modules of that type in that facility. For example, the 
  qualifier /COMPILE=[FACIL]*.C says that the script can be used to 
  compile all C modules in facility FACIL. If you omit the facility name, 
  the current default facility is assumed.
  <li>[*]*.TYP <br>If you specify the type name but specify an asterisk 
  (*) in place of both the facility name and the module name, the script 
  applies to all modules of that type in all facilities. For example, the 
  qualifier /COMPILE=[*]*.FOR says that the script can be used to compile 
  all Fortran modules in all facilities.
  <li>[*]*.* <br>If you specify an asterisk (*) for each of the three 
  components of the module name, the script applies to all modules 
  regardless of type and facility. For example, the qualifier 
  /RESERVE=[*]*.* says that the script can be used to reserve all modules 
  in all facilities.
</ul>

No other forms of wildcarding are allowed in the module-name parameters 
to script-type qualifiers.

<p>
When VDE looks for a script to perform some action for a 
module, it always selects the script that is most specific to that 
module. If it can find a script with a fully specified module name 
([FACIL]MOD.TYP) for the module in question, it uses that script. 
Otherwise, it looks for a script with a matching module-name 
specification of the form [FACIL]*.TYP or [*]*.TYP or [*]*.*, in that 
order. This rule allows you to specify generic scripts that apply to 
all modules or to all modules of a certain type, but to override those 
scripts for specific modules or for modules in specific facilities when 
appropriate.

<p>
Similar rules apply to scripts that are selected by facility. A 
NEW_STREAM script, for example, is invoked for each facility in your 
system when you create a new stream. In this case, VDE 
accepts two forms of facility-name specification on the script-type 
qualifiers:

<ul>
  <li>FACIL <br>If you fully specify the facility name, the script 
  applies only to that specific facility. For example, the qualifier 
  /NEW_STREAM=RMS says that the script can only be used for facility RMS 
  when VDE creates new streams.
  <li>* <br>If you specify an asterisk (*) for the facility name, the 
  script applies to all facilities. For example, the qualifier 
  /NEW_STREAM=* says that the script can be invoked for every facility in 
  your system when VDE creates new streams.
</ul>

No other forms of wildcarding are allowed in the facility-name 
parameters to script-type qualifiers.

<p>
When VDE looks for a script to perform an action for a 
facility, it first looks for a script with a fully specified facility 
name. If no such script exists in the database, VDE selects 
the script with the wildcard in the facility name, provided it exists. 
You can thus specify a generic script that applies to all facilities, 
and then override that script for specific facilities when appropriate.
<p>
<a name="vde_cmd_crescrp_segs"><strong>Generating Command Files in Segments</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
Normally, VDE generates the DCL command file to perform some 
action from a single VDE script. In some situations, 
however, it is necessary to generate different &quot;segments&quot; of 
the DCL command file from different scripts. The DCL command file that 
compiles a MACRO module, for example, may need to consist of three 
segments:

<ul>
  <li>The first segment sets up logical names for the MACRO assembler and
<a name="index_x_639"></a>
includes the MACRO command and its qualifiers. The MACRO command is 
ended with the continuation character. This segment is the same for all 
MACRO modules, and the VDE script that generates it has the 
selection template [*]*.MAR.
  <li>The second segment contains the name of the module to assemble and 
  a plus-list of macro libraries to use with that module. This segment of 
  the command file is different for each MACRO module, and the 
  VDE script that generates it has a selection template of the 
  form [FAC]MOD.TYP.
  <li>The third segment inserts the assembled object module into an 
  object library and runs VDE/DEPEND to collect dependency data. This 
  segment of the DCL command file is the same for all MACRO modules, and 
  the VDE script that generates it has the selection template 
  [*]*.MAR.
</ul>

<p>
One VDE script could generate all three segments of the DCL 
command file, but then a separate script is needed for each MACRO 
module in the library. This solution is undesirable because the script 
keywords that generate the first and third segments of the DCL command 
file are the same for all MACRO modules, thus wasting space in the 
VDE database and making it difficult to modify the common 
parts of the scripts. A better solution is to have two generic scripts 
with selection templates [*]*.MAR that generate the first and third 
segments of each MACRO module's DCL command file, and to have a small 
script specific to each module to generate the second segment. This 
solution makes it easy to modify the module-independent segments of the 
keyword files because they are derived from just two VDE 
scripts.

<p>
To allow you to generate different segments of a DCL command file from 
separate scripts, VDE allows you to assign a <em>segment 
number</em> to each script. A segment number is an integer value in the 
range from 1 to 20 that is specified with the /SEGMENT qualifier to the 
CREATE SCRIPT command. When VDE generates a DCL command file 
from scripts, it looks for an appropriate script for each possible 
segment number. VDE selects the script for each segment 
number using the normal script selection rules so that more 
module-specific or facility-specific scripts are favored over more 
generic scripts. After selecting the scripts, VDE interprets 
them in order by segment number to generate the DCL command file. If 
there are no scripts for a given segment, that segment is simply 
omitted from the command file. As a result, you can have up to twenty 
segments in a DCL command file, each generated by a separately selected 
script.

<p>
If you do not specify a segment number for a script, VDE 
assigns segment number 10 to the script. If your DCL command files do 
not need multiple segments, you can thus ignore segment numbers and let 
VDE generate segment 10 (and only that segment) for each 
command file. If you later decide that you need additional segments 
before or after the original segment, you have ample segment numbers to 
choose from in both directions.

The INVOKE SCRIPT command is a useful tool
<a name="index_x_640"></a>
<a name="index_x_641"></a>
<a name="index_x_642"></a>
for debugging scripts. INVOKE SCRIPT allows you to fetch and invoke a 
specified script, and then to examine the DCL command(s) generated by 
the script.

<p>
For further information on this command, see <a href="vde_manual_015.html#vde_cmd_inv_scrp">INVOKE SCRIPT</a>.

<p>
In this example, the user first types the script file 
[MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT on the terminal. The script contains five 
EMIT keywords followed by an EXIT keyword. The user then enters 
VDE and uses the CREATE SCRIPT keyword to enter that script 
file into the VDE database as the compile script for all C 
modules in facility RMS. The log messages confirm that the script was 
successfully entered into the database.
