<a name="conv_features"><h1><font color=maroon>1.9 Convenience Features</font></h1></a>

<p>
VDE supports a number of convenience features.

<a name="kept_subprocess"><h2>1.9.1 Kept Subprocess</h2></a>

<p>
VDE can utilitize a kept subprocess. The kept subprocess is 
created when the command interface is first activated, and it greatly 
improves overall performance. With the kept subprocess, all of the 
processing required to initially connect to the database is performed 
only once, not each time the utility is activated.
<a name="index_x_38"></a>

<p>
<center>
<table bgcolor=lightskyblue border=0 width=75%>
<tr>
  <td><center><font size=+2 
  color=black><strong>Note</strong></font></center><hr size=1 noshade>
<font color=black>
All security and quota related values associated with the kept
<a name="index_x_39"></a>
<a name="index_x_40"></a>
<a name="index_x_41"></a>
<a name="index_x_42"></a>
<a name="index_x_43"></a>
<a name="index_x_44"></a>
subprocess are inherited from the parent process when the kept 
subprocess is spawned. This may seem like a minor detail, but it will 
cause all changes in the parent process's privilege mask and rightslist 
identifiers to be <em>ignored</em> by the kept subprocess. </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
 To force an update of the security and quota
<a name="index_x_45"></a>
attributes in the kept subprocess, issue the following commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ EXIT/KEPT_PROCESS
$  VDE/KEPT_PROCESS
VDE„
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The above commands cause the kept subprocess to exit and, as any 
subsequent invocation of VDE (with /KEPT_PROCESS) determines 
that there is no kept subprocess present, it will then spawn one.

<a name="init_files"><h2>1.9.2 Initialization Files</h2></a>

<p>
One can use an initialization file to set up VDE command 
abbreviations (with DEFINE/COMMAND), keypad definitions (with 
DEFINE/KEY), and session environment defaults (with SET FACILITY and 
SET STREAM). An initialization file can contain zero or or more 
VDE commands.

<p>
VDE supports a user-specified initialization file. Each 
utility processes an initialization file in a similar fashion, though 
each uses a unique name for the file. The initialization file is 
automatically invoked at the start of each VDE session.

<p>
To establish an initialization file for the VDE utility, 
define the logical name VDE$INIT<sup>3</sup>
<a name="index_x_46"></a>
<a name="index_x_47"></a>
before starting the VDE session. This logical name must 
reference the file name of the VDE initialization file. If 
the file name and/or the file extension is omitted from the logical 
name translation, the VDE utility uses the default value 
VDE$INIT.VDE for the initialization file.
<a name="index_x_48"></a>
<a name="index_x_49"></a>
<a name="index_x_50"></a>
<a name="index_x_51"></a>
<a name="index_x_52"></a>
<a name="index_x_53"></a>

<p>
An initialization file is usually resident in the user's SYS$LOGIN: 
directory.

<p>
If desired, the exclamation point (!) can be used as a comment 
character in an VDE or an VDE initialization file. 
All text located after a exclamation point is ignored up to and 
including the end of the line, if the exclamation point is not located 
within a quoted string.
<a name="index_x_54"></a>
The space-hyphen ( --) can be used as a line continuation. The 
space-hyphen character must be the last character of a line; it causes 
the subsequent command line to be considered part of the current line.
<a name="index_x_55"></a>
<a name="index_x_56"></a>
<a name="index_x_57"></a>
<a name="index_x_58"></a>

<a name="editor"><h2>1.9.3 Selecting a Text Editor</h2></a>

<p>
VDE lets one establish a text editor for the VDE 
session. VDE invokes the specified editor when certain 
commands are entered. For example, VDE lets one use an editor 
to review code changes on behalf of another user. The editor is invoked 
in a spawned subprocess, and can be invoked in read-write or read-only 
mode, depending on the context. To specify the editor for the current 
VDE session, use the SET EDITOR command. For example:
<a name="index_x_59"></a>
<a name="index_x_60"></a>
<a name="index_x_61"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET EDITOR "LSEDIT"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command tells VDE to spawn the LSEDIT command, which 
invokes the VAX Language-Sensitive Editor, whenever a VDE 
command requires an editor to be invoked. If you prefer some other 
editor, you should specify the DCL command for that editor instead. You 
can also include any qualifiers you want in the quoted string. 
VDE simply starts with the string you specify, appends a 
space and the name of the file to edit, and spawns the resulting DCL 
command string. If the editor is invoked in read-only mode, 
VDE appends the /READ_ONLY qualifier (which most 
OpenVMS editors accept), a space, and a file name to the string 
you specify, and then spawns that. (If your editor does not accept the 
/READ_ONLY qualifier, see the HELP text to see how you can specify a 
separate read-only editor string.)

<p>
The /DEFAULT qualifier on the SET EDITOR command allows one to 
establish the default editor strings for future VDE sessions. 
These editor strings are stored in the source control database. The 
SHOW EDITOR command displays the current editor strings.
<a name="index_x_62"></a>
<a name="index_x_63"></a>

<p>
VDEalso supports a number of standard utility commands. These 
commands include @<em>file-spec</em> (which executes a file containing 
VDE commands), SPAWN, ATTACH, EXIT, HELP, DEFINE/KEY and SET 
KEY, DEFINE/COMMAND, SET LOG and CANCEL LOG, SET VERIFY and CANCEL 
VERIFY, SET TERMINAL, and all associated SHOW commands. See the HELP 
text for descriptions of these commands.

<a name="sessions"><h2>1.9.4 Grouping Reservations into Sessions</h2></a>

<p>
VDE and VDE module reservations can be grouped 
together using <strong>sessions</strong>. One can create a session that 
contains a group of modules involved in a particular modification or 
fix---all modules contained in a session can be referenced in a single 
command.
<a name="index_x_77"></a>

      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ REPLACE/SESSION=WIN32_VMS
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The above command replaces all modules included in the WIN32_VMS 
session.

<p>
Information on how to <strong>reserve</strong> and 
<strong>replace</strong> modules is included in <a href="vde_guide_001.html#res_mod_repl_mod">Chapter 2</a>.

<a name="contexts"><h2>1.9.5 Defining Defaults Using Contexts</h2></a>

<p>
A <strong>context</strong> allows you to easily switch an entire group 
of related VDE default settings among a set of possible 
values. You can keep multiple sets of VDE defaults around.

<p>
Each context is comprised of a set of defaults: a default facility, a 
default stream, and a default architecture. (For information on 
architectures, see <a href="vde_guide_015.html#architectures">Chapter 9</a>.) You can specify one context for use 
when you are making bugfixes to a particular stream and facility, and 
another context for when you are adding new features to a different 
facility in a newer stream. And using key definitions (DEFINE/KEY), you 
can switch among your various contexts using a single keystroke.

<p>
Contexts can be private and user-defined, or they can be publically 
established and available for whole groups of users. Project leaders 
can establish a set of contexts for use by a particular group of users.
<a name="index_x_78"></a>
<a name="index_x_79"></a>
<a name="index_x_80"></a>

<a name="library_defaults"><h2>1.9.6 Default Libraries, Mnemonics</h2></a>

<p>
VDE utilitizes a set of logical names to determine the names, 
contents and locations of commonly-accessed libraries. To see which 
libraries have been established by default (if any), issue the command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET LIBRARY
</pre>
</font>
</table>

In addition to telling you that the command needs another parameter, 
this command will display any default libraries.

<p>

<em>VDE Reference Manual</em>, or see <a href="vde_guide_016.html#gui_xm_deflibrary">Section 10.1.3</a>.

<a name="res_mod_repl_mod"><h1>Chapter 2<br>Reserving and Replacing Modules</h1></a>
</font>

<p>
This chapter describes how to use the VSC utility to identify 
specific modules in a VDE library. It also shows you how to 
create, reserve and replace modules, how to fetch module generations 
without reserving them, how to create new modules, how to cancel 
reservations, and how to display reservation information from the 
source control database.

<p>
This section also describes some convenience features present in 
VSC and VDE. Examples of these features include the 
ability to reserve groups of modules, called <strong>sessions</strong>, 
and treat these modules as a unit. Also covered is the ability to queue 
a reservation request when a module is reserved by another user, and 
how to receive notification when the queued reservation request is 
eventually granted.

<a name="resrep_genid"><h1><font color=maroon>2.1 Identifying Module Generations</font></h1></a>

<p>
Each generation of a given module can be referenced using either of two 
names. One generation name is the <strong>generation number</strong>. 
This
<a name="index_x_81"></a>
<a name="index_x_82"></a>
<a name="index_x_83"></a>
number is assigned and maintained by VSC. The other 
generation name is the <strong>generation expression</strong>. The 
generation expression is assigned by CMS. One can use either generation 
name to specify a specific generation in VSC commands.

<p>
VSC assigns generation numbers in sequential order to the 
generations for each development stream. Generation 1 is thus the first 
generation for the stream, generation 2 is its successor, and so on. 
Generation 2 of stream A can be the same as generation 2 of stream B 
(if the streams have not yet diverged) or they may be two different 
generations (assuming the streams have diverged).

<p>
When one refers to a generation by its generation number on a 
VSC command, one specifies a semicolon and the generation 
number after the module name. The generation number is relative to some 
stream that one specifies explicitly (usually with the /STREAM 
qualifier) or by default. For example, MOD.TYP;5 refers to generation 5 
for the specified stream. One can also specify a zero or negative 
generation number; such a generation number is relative to the latest 
generation for the stream. MOD.TYP;0 thus refers to the latest 
generation and MOD.TYP;--1 refers to the next most recent generation, 
and MOD.TYP;--0 refers to the oldest.

<p>
CMS generation expressions are assigned by different means. The first 
generation for a module has generation expression 1. It can have 
multiple successors (for different streams) with generation expressions 
2, 1A1, 1B1, 1C1, and so on. Generation 1B1 can in turn have successors 
1B2, 1B1A1, 1B1B1, and so on. Each generation thus has a unique 
generation expression that encodes its genealogy. This expression is 
independent of stream. To specify a generation by its generation 
expression, one must use the /GENERATION qualifier for those commands 
that accept it. For example, MOD.TYP/GENERATION=1B1 refers to the 
generation of module MOD.TYP that has generation expression 1B1.
<a name="index_x_84"></a>

<p>
If one omits both the generation number and the /GENERATION qualifier, 
most VSC commands reference the latest generation of the 
module for the specified stream. This causes the command to operate on 
the most recent generation by default---this is normally the desired 
effect.

<p>
Because generation numbers are always relative to some stream, they are 
used to show lines of descent for a given stream and to reference 
generations relative to a specific stream. CMS generation expressions 
are independent of stream and thus give absolute names to the 
generations of a module. These two kinds of generation names are 
primarily used with the SHOW GENERATION and FETCH commands. For 
example, to fetch the next most recent generation of module FOO.BAR for 
stream FRED, one would request generation number --1, as shown in this 
example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ FETCH /STREAM=FRED FOO.BAR;-1
</pre>
</font>
</table>

However, one can also request the generation with generation expression 
10A3 (which is an absolute name; entirely independent of stream), as in 
this example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ FETCH FOO.BAR /GENERATION=10A3
</pre>
</font>
</table>

For most commands, including FETCH, one should not specify a 
generation. The default references the latest generation for a 
specified (or defaulted) stream, and this is nearly always the 
generation one typically wishes to reference. When reserving a module, 
one never specifies a generation to reserve; VSC always 
retrieves the latest generation for the specified stream.
<p>
<a name="audit_trail_id"><strong>Audit Trail Identifiers</strong></a>
<br>
<a name="index_x_85"></a>
<a name="index_x_86"></a>

<p>
When modifying a source module, one typically adds code comments that 
explain the nature of the changes. These comments should be labelled by 
an <strong>audit trail identifier</strong>. The audit trail identifier 
is simply the expected CMS generation expression of the new generation 
one creates when replacing the changed module into the VDE 
library. VDE displays the expected CMS generation expression 
when the module is initially reserved. In rare circumstances, the 
actual generation expression used when the module is replaced may 
differ from the expected generation expression displayed when the 
module is reserved. If this happens, VSC displays an 
informational message. One must then update the source module to 
correct the audit trail identifier in the code comments.

<a name="reserve_mods"><h1><font color=maroon>2.2 Reserving Modules</font></h1></a>

<p>
To reserve a module from a VDE library, use the RESERVE 
command. This command reserves a specified module for a given 
development stream and fetches that module into your default directory. 
This example illustrates the syntax of the RESERVE command:
<a name="index_x_87"></a>
<a name="index_x_88"></a>
<a name="index_x_89"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; RESERVE/STREAM=FOO [FACIL]MOD.TYP "Remark string"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command reserves module MOD.TYP in facility FACIL from a 
VDE library. The latest generation of the module for stream 
FOO is copied into your default directory.

<p>
With the RESERVE command, you can specify a list of module names 
separated by commas. This syntax---or the session support---allows you 
to manipulate a number of modules with only a few commands. For example:
<a name="index_x_90"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; SET FACILITY SYS
VSC&gt; RESERVE/STREAM=FOO A.MAR,B.MAR,C.MAR "Reduce memory-scrambling"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example reserves modules A, B, and C in facility SYS from stream 
FOO. Note that you do not have to include the facility names with the 
RESERVE command if the modules belong to the default facility 
established with a previous SET FACILITY command.

<p>
You can use wildcard characters in the module names. The percent sign 
(%) in a name matches any single character in the position it occupies 
and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. All modules that match the wildcard pattern are reserved.
<a name="index_x_91"></a>

<p>
VDE also allows you to associate a number of modules from 
various RESERVE and CREATE MODULE commands together, by using the 
/SESSION qualifier. The /SESSION qualifier allows you to pick a name 
for a group of modules, and to avoid having to specify each module on 
the REPLACE command. The use of /SESSION also provides the reviewers 
and the project leader with a clear indication that a group of 
replacement modules are related.

<p>
The reservation remark string can be specified as a parameter at the 
end of the command, as shown in the previous example. The remark 
parameter has the same effect as the /REMARK qualifier described in 
<a href="vde_guide_001.html#qualtbl_reserve">Table 2-1</a> and applies to all reserved modules unless overridden by 
/REMARK qualifiers on the individual module-name parameters.

<p>
The RESERVE command displays the expected CMS generation expression for 
the new generation that will be created when the module is later 
replaced. You should use this generation expression as the &quot;audit 
trail identifier&quot; for the comments in your code that explain your 
new changes. This example illustrates the RESERVE command's output:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt;RESERVE/STREAM=BIRCH [FACIL]MOD.TYP "Add gasket modulator"
%VDE-I-FETCHED, generation [FACIL]MOD.TYP;3(3) fetched from library
%VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MOD.TYP;
%VDE-I-RESERVED, generation [FACIL]MOD.TYP;3(3) reserved from stream BIRCH
%VDE-I-EXPGENEXPR, expected generation expression at replacement is 3A1
%VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
VSC&gt;
</pre>
</font>
</table>

In this case, you should use 3A1 as your audit trail identifier. This 
expected CMS generation expression might differ from the one actually 
assigned when you later replace the module, but only in certain unusual 
circumstances. VSC prints a message when the replacement is 
performed if the expected and actual generation expressions differ. If 
so, you need to rereserve the module to correct the audit trail 
identifier.

<p>
The source control system keeps track of successor relationships 
between streams. If source changes replaced into a stream A should 
normally also be propagated to another stream B, then stream B is a 
<strong>successor</strong> of stream A. Successor relationships between 
streams are defined by the maintainers of the VDE libraries, 
and reside in the source control database. These relationships ensure 
that bug fixes and other changes made to one version of OpenVMS 
are propagated to all later versions of OpenVMS.

<p>
Successor relationships determine what streams are affected by a module 
reservation. Normally, a reservation <strong>covers</strong> the 
development stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier and all 
successors of that stream, including the successors of the successors, 
and so on recursively. If you omit the /STREAM qualifier, the 
reservation covers your default stream and its successors. This means 
that you expect your changes to be propagated to those streams when you 
later replace the module. However, the reservation does not cover any 
stream in which the module has already diverged from the original 
stream because VSC cannot automatically propagate source 
changes to such a stream.

<p>
The RESERVE command determines what streams your reservation will cover 
and checks if any existing reservation for the module already covers 
one of those streams. If so, the RESERVE command rejects your 
reservation attempt unless you explicitly request a concurrent 
reservation. You can limit change propagation, and therefore restrict 
the streams covered by your reservation, by using the /PROPAGATE and 
/NOPROPAGATE qualifiers. By covering fewer streams (when appropriate), 
you make reservation conflicts less likely.

<p>
The RESERVE command accepts a number of qualifiers. The help text and 
the reference manual have the details on all of the qualifiers accepted 
by the command. <a href="vde_guide_001.html#qualtbl_reserve">Table 2-1</a> lists some of the more commonly-used 
qualifiers. <p>

       Specifies that the RESERVE command should reserve each specified module 
       even if the module is already reserved by another user. This qualifier 
       is required to create concurrent reservations. However, VSC 
       creates a concurrent reservation for a module only if all previous, 
       conflicting reservations of that module allow concurrent reservations. 
       If this qualifier is omitted, the RESERVE command reserves the module 
       only if it is not already reserved. When this qualifier creates a 
       concurrent reservation, the VSC utility automatically sends a 
       mail message to each developer who already holds a reservation for the 
       module in order to notify him or her of the new concurrent reservation.

       Determine what streams are covered by the current reservation and how 
       module changes are propagated to successor streams when the module is 
       later replaced into the library. /PROPAGATE specifies that the 
       reservation should be propagated to all successors of the initial 
       development stream up to and including the stream specified by the
      <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. /NOPROPAGATE specifies that the 
      reservation not be propagated past the initial stream. If neither 
      /PROPAGATE nor /NOPROPAGATE is specified, the reservation is propagated 
      to all successors (recursively) of the initial stream. These qualifiers 
      are used when a change is appropriate for only a subset of the streams 
      in the successor chain. For example, a bug fix might apply only to the 
      initial stream because it is replaced by a new algorithm in later 
      streams.
      <p>For OpenVMS VAX, most reservations should use the default 
      propagation behavior and you should seldom need these qualifiers.

       this qualifier has no effect. If the module is not available, 
       VSC queues a reservation request for it. When the module

       then reserve the module.

       When you queue a reservation request, the source control system records 
       the queued reservation in its database. The SHOW RESERVATION command 
       displays queued reservations. When the developer who owns the current 
       reservation later replaces the module into the library or cancels the 
       reservation, VSC sends a mail message to each user who has 
       queued a reservation request for the module. The mail message says that 
       the module is available and lists all users who have requested it in 
       the order that they requested it. Those users must then decide among 
       themselves who should reserve the module first. To actually reserve the 
       module, you must enter another RESERVE command.

       /SESSION allows you to associated various reserved and created modules 
       together into a session; sessions allow you to later replace a whole 
       series of reserved and created modules via a single REPLACE command. 
       When used with the queued-replacement environment, the use of sessions 
       also provides a clear indication to the reviewers and to the project 
       leader that the modules being replaced are associated. The particular 
       session name used is typically a mnemonic name chosen by the user, and 
       usually reflects the particular set of changes being made.
