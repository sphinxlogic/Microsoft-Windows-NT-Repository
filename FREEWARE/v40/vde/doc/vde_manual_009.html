<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
When a user has reserved and modified one or more modules and then uses 
the REPLACE command to replace the modules into the VDE 
libary, VDE either replaces the modules immediately or 
creates a queued replacement for them. A queued replacement is a record 
in the VDE database that records that the modules should be 
replaced into the library at a future time, after the modules have been 
reviewed and when an authorized user enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT 
command for the replacement. Whether the REPLACE command replaces the 
modules immediately or creates a queued replacement is determined by a 
qualifier to that command or by an attribute on the streams affected by 
the replacement.

<p>
Although queued replacements are normally created by the REPLACE 
command when you replace modules, you can create a queued replacement 
directly with the CREATE REPLACEMENT command. After you have created a 
queued replacement with this command, you can add module reservations 
to the replacement with the REPLACE command by using the /REPLACEMENT 
qualifier to specify the replacement name.

successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new replacement. The 
quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may 
contain any explanatory remark about the new replacement that you want 
stored in the VDE database.

<p>
Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The CREATE SCRIPT command reads a VDE script from a file and 
records the script and its type in the VDE database. A 
<strong>script</strong> is a sequence of commands in the VDE 
script language that VDE can execute to create a DCL command 
file. VDE can then invoke that DCL command file in a 
subprocess to perform the action of the script. VDE uses 
scripts to perform many different kinds of actions. For example, 
VDE uses &quot;compile scripts&quot; to compile modules in a 
build job. Similarly, it uses &quot;new-stream scripts&quot; to 
populate the directories of a new stream with files when it performs 
the CREATE STREAM command. There are many other kinds of scripts, all 
distinguished by the commands or circumstances that cause them to be 
invoked.

<p>
The primary purpose of VDE scripts is to insert names and 
directory specifications from the VDE database into text you 
specify to generate DCL command files that perform various actions. A 
VDE script is thus a mixture of plain text and invocations of 
functions that retrieve names (such as module names, type names, and 
facility names) and directory strings (such as the names of facility 
subdirectories) from the VDE database.

<p>
Since you define scripts, you define how VDE should perform 
the corresponding actions. For example, you decide how a Pascal module 
is compiled because you define the Pascal compile script. Similarly, 
you can define a script that defines auxiliary actions of the REPLACE 
command. Scripts thus let you make policy decisions for your own 
project, while VDE provides the mechanisms that implement 
your policies.

<p>
The CREATE SCRIPT command only defines the new script for the current 
default development stream. You can reference the new script only from 
within the stream to which it belongs. When you want to create the same 
script for more than one stream, you must use the CREATE SCRIPT command 
for each stream. For each stream, first enter the SET STREAM command to 
set the development stream, then enter the CREATE SCRIPT command to 
create the desired script within the stream.

<p>
When a new development stream is created, all script definitions from 
the parent stream are copied to the child stream. If modified, the 
script definitions then evolve independently in the two development 
streams.

<p>
Keywords used within scripts are documented in <a href="vde_manual_025.html#vde_script_keywords">Script Keywords</a>, while 
script functions are in <a href="vde_manual_026.html#vde_script_functions">Script Functions</a>, and script types are in 
<a href="vde_manual_026.html#vde_script_types">Script Types</a>. For other script-related commands, also see

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/BUILD</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE starts each 
process that executes a build job. The VDE$BUILD utility, which 
executes build
<a name="index_x_255"></a>
jobs, invokes the script once for each process that executes a given 
build job. This script runs before the process executes any build 
steps. The script can be used to generate DCL that defines commands or 
logical names that are needed by subsequent build steps. BUILD scripts 
are optional and are not needed for build jobs to work.
<h3>/COMPILE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE compiles a 
module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. 
VDE invokes the script when you enter a COMPILE command for a 
matching module or run a build job that contains compile steps for 
matching modules. The script must generate the DCL commands that 
actually perform the compile step.
<h3>/COPY=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE copies a module 
that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. VDE 
invokes the script when you enter a COPY command for a matching module 
or run a build job that contains copy steps for matching modules. The 
script must generate the DCL commands that actually perform the copy 
step.
<h3>/CREATE_FACILITY</h3>
Specifies the script that VDE should invoke when a new 
facility is created. This script is optional.
<h3>/DELETE_GENERATION=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE deletes a 
stream's latest generation of a module that matches the 
<strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. VDE invokes the script 
when you enter a DELETE GENERATION command for a matching module. The 
script should perform auxiliary processing that you want for the DELETE 
GENERATION command, such as updating source files in a clear-copy 
directory. This type of script is optional and is not needed for the 
DELETE GENERATION command to work.
<h3>/FETCH=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE fetches a 
module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. 
VDE invokes the script when you enter a FETCH command for a 
matching module. The script should generate DCL commands that perform 
auxiliary processing that you want for the FETCH command, such as 
sending notification to interested individuals. FETCH scripts are 
optional and are not needed for the FETCH command to work.
<h3>/INSERT_GENERATION=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE inserts a 
generation of a module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> 
parameter into a development stream. VDE invokes the script 
when you enter an INSERT GENERATION command for a matching module. The 
script should perform auxiliary processing that you want for the INSERT 
GENERATION command, such as updating source files in a clear-copy 
directory. This type of script is optional and is not needed for the 
INSERT GENERATION command to work.
<h3>/LINK=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE links a module 
that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. VDE 
invokes the script when you enter a LINK
<a name="index_x_256"></a>
 command for a matching module or run a build job that contains link 
 steps for matching modules. The script must generate the DCL commands 
 that actually perform the link step.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the script is created. 
The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the /NOLOG 
qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the script has 
been created and that the database transaction has committed 
successfully.
<h3>/NEW_STREAM=fac-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked for each facility that matches the 
<strong>fac-name</strong> parameter when VDE creates a new 
development stream. VDE invokes the script for each matching 
facility when you enter a CREATE STREAM command. The script must 
generate DCL commands that copy all stream-specific files for a given 
facility from the parent stream's directories to the new stream's 
directories. The role of NEW_STREAM scripts is to populate the new 
stream's directory tree with all relevant files from the parent stream.

<p>
NEW_STREAM scripts are optional and are not needed for the CREATE 
STREAM command to work, but they are strongly recommended because 
minimal system builds for the new stream cannot work unless all result 
files (such as object libraries and executable images) are copied from 
the parent stream to the new child stream.
<h3>/NOKEEP=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE replaces a 
module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. 
VDE invokes the script when you enter a REPLACE command with 
the /NOKEEP qualifier for a matching module. The script should generate 
DCL commands that perform the action of the /NOKEEP qualifier, such as 
deleting the replaced source module and perhaps also the associated 
object and listing files from the user's default directory. The script 
is run after the REPLACE command's database transaction has committed; 
it thus performs &quot;clean-up&quot; operations for the command. 
NOKEEP scripts are optional and are not needed for the REPLACE command 
to work. (If a NOKEEP script is not defined when a module is replaced 
with the /NOKEEP qualifier, VDE does not delete any files.)
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the new 
script. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters 
long, may contain any explanatory remark about the script that you want 
to store in the database.
<h3>/REPLACE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE replaces a 
module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. 
VDE invokes the script when you enter a REPLACE command for a 
matching module. The script should generate DCL commands that perform 
auxiliary processing that you want for the REPLACE or (on a 
queued-replacement stream) PERFORM REPLACEMENT command, such as sending 
notification to interested individuals or copying object modules to 
object libraries. REPLACE scripts are optional and are not needed for 
the REPLACE command to work.
<h3>/RESERVE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE reserves a 
module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. 
VDE invokes the script when you enter a RESERVE command for a 
matching module. The script should generate DCL commands that perform 
auxiliary processing that you want for the RESERVE command, such as 
sending notification to interested individuals. RESERVE scripts are 
optional and are not needed for the RESERVE command to work.
<h3>/SEGMENT=seg-num</h3>
Specifies the segment number of the new script. The 
<strong>seg-num</strong> parameter, which specifies the script's 
segment number, must be an integer value in the range from 1 to 20. If 
you omit this qualifier, VDE uses segment number 10 by 
default. When VDE later invokes scripts to perform some 
action, it generates the segments of the DCL command file from scripts 
ordered by their segment numbers.
<h3>/SET_FACILITY=fac-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE sets a new 
default facility that matches the <strong>fac-name</strong> parameter. 
VDE invokes the script when you enter a SET FACILITY or SET 
CONTEXT command for a matching facility. The script should generate DCL 
commands that perform auxiliary processing that you want for the SET 
FACILITY or SET CONTEXT command, such as defining logical names. 
SET_FACILITY scripts are optional and are not needed for the SET 
FACILITY or SET CONTEXT command to work.

<p>
<em>This qualifier is not yet implemented.</em>
<h3>/SET_STREAM</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE sets a new 
default stream. VDE invokes the script when you enter a SET 
STREAM or SET CONTEXT command. The script should generate DCL commands 
that perform auxiliary processing that you want for the SET STREAM or 
SET CONTEXT command, such as defining logical names. SET_STREAM scripts 
are optional and are not needed for the SET STREAM or SET CONTEXT 
command to work.

<p>
<em>This qualifier is not yet implemented.</em>
<h3>/STAGING=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE copies a source 
module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter into a 
&quot;staging&quot; area. VDE invokes the script when you 
enter a REPLACE command for a matching module and the replacement is 
queued. For a
<a name="index_x_257"></a>
<a name="index_x_258"></a>
queued replacement, VDE copies each replaced file to a 
staging area, from where it is actually replaced into the VDE 
library when another user later enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT command. 
The script must generate DCL commands that copy the module into the 
staging area.
<h3>/UNRESERVE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE unreserves a 
module that matches the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter. 
VDE invokes the script when you enter an UNRESERVE command 
for a matching module. The script should generate DCL commands that 
perform auxiliary processing that you want for the UNRESERVE command, 
such as sending notification to interested individuals. UNRESERVE 
scripts are optional and are not needed for the UNRESERVE command to 
work.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
When a user reserves one or more modules with the /SESSION qualifier to 
the RESERVE command, VDE creates a reservation session and 
makes the module reservations members of that session. A reservation 
session is thus a set of module reservations that belong together. 
Additional module reservations can be added to the session with 
additional RESERVE commands. When the modules are later replaced into 
the VDE library, the user can specify the session to be 
replaced (using the /SESSION qualifier to the REPLACE command) instead 
of listing all the modules individually. A session thus makes it easy 
to replace a set of related module reservations as a single unit.

<p>
Although reservation sessions are normally created by the RESERVE 
command, you can create a session directly with the CREATE SESSION 
command. This session initially contains no module reservations. You 
can later add module reservations to the session with the RESERVE 
command, using the /SESSION qualifier to specify the session name. To 
remove an existing non-empty session, use the UNRESERVE/SESSION 
command. To remove an existing empty session, use the CANCEL SESSION 
command.

<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new reservation session. 
The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may 
contain any explanatory remark about the new session that you want 
stored in the VDE database.

<p>
Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.
