<a name="estab_lib_opt_add_user"><h2>6.2.3 Automatic Addition of Users to Database</h2></a>

<p>
Before a user can use the new VDE library you are creating, 
that user must be added to the library's VDE database. This 
means that VDE must create an entry for the user in the 
database User Table. This entry records the user's OpenVMS 
username, full name (first and last names), default and authorized 
privileges, and other information. A user who has not been added to the 
database cannot use VDE to access information in that 
database or to perform VDE operations on the VDE 
library.
<a name="index_x_324"></a>
<a name="index_x_325"></a>
<a name="index_x_326"></a>

<p>
The CREATE LIBRARY command automatically adds the creator of a new 
VDE library to the library's database. Additional users must 
be added in one or two ways. First, they can be added manually using 
the CREATE USER command. This command allows you to specify the 
attributes of each new user explicitly. This way of adding users is 
most practical for VDE libraries with a small number of 
users, especially if you want careful control over who accesses the 
library.

<p>
Second, you can set a library attribute that allows new users to be 
added automatically the first time they access the VDE 
library. This way of adding users is more practical for VDE 
libraries with a large number of potential users. To enable automatic 
addition of new users, you must use the /AUTO_ADD_USER qualifier to the 
CREATE LIBRARY or MODIFY LIBRARY command. If this qualifier is used 
without a parameter, any user who attempts to access the VDE 
library through VDE is automatically added to the 
VDE database with the standard default and authorized 
VDE privileges for that library.

<p>
The qualifier can also be specified with a rights identifier parameter, 
as in /AUTO_ADD_USER=<em>rights-id</em>. In this case, VDE 
will only add those users to the database who hold the OpenVMS 
rights identifier given by the parameter. This way of adding users is 
useful when you already use a OpenVMS rights identifier to 
protect the files and directories of your VDE library. In 
this case, the OpenVMS security mechanism for the library also 
serves as the mechanism that restricts access to the VDE 
library through the VDE utility.

<p>
<a href="vde_guide_011.html#estab_lib_add_user">Section 6.4</a> gives a more complete description of how you can add 
users to your VDE library.

<p>
If you do not specify the /AUTO_ADD_USER qualifier, you must add users 
with explicit CREATE USER commands. However, you can change the library 
attribute that controls automatic addition of users at any time by 
using the /AUTO_ADD_USER or /NOAUTO_ADD_USER qualifier with the MODIFY 
LIBRARY command.

<p>
The owner information specified in the OpenVMS SYSUAF
<a name="index_x_327"></a>
 database will be used as the owner of any new VDE username 
 created. VDE will ignore any leading numerics, leading 
 hyphens, leading space characters, and leading tilde characters, listed 
 in the SYSUAF owner field.

<a name="estab_lib_opt_convdb"><h2>6.2.4 Conversion of Library Format</h2></a>

<p>
VDE maintains data about your VDE library in a 
relational database. As new capabilities are added to VDE, 
the format of this database may change from one version of 
VDE to the next. A new feature may, for example, require the 
addition of new database tables or of new columns to existing tables in 
order to store the data required to implement the feature. New features 
may also require other changes to your VDE library, such as 
the addition of a subdirectory or a new file. To accommodate such 
changes to the library format, each new version of VDE that 
requires a format change contains code that converts your existing 
VDE library to the new format. VDE also maintains a 
database format version number in your database so that it always knows 
the current format of your library and its database.
<a name="index_x_328"></a>
<a name="index_x_329"></a>
<a name="index_x_330"></a>

<p>
When a new version of VDE is installed on your system, that 
version may require that your existing VDE library be 
convered to a new format. If so, there are two ways to effect this 
conversion. One is to allow VDE to automatically convert the 
library format the first time any user accesses the library through 
VDE. The second way is to explicitly convert the library 
using the CONVERT LIBRARY command.

<p>
By default, VDE will <em>not</em> convert your VDE 
library automatically the first time any user starts a new 
VDE session that attaches to that library
<sup>1</sup> Automatic conversion is useful for small libraries, for 
libraries that are accessed only by the local copy of VDE, and for 
libraries that are easily restored from backup. In order to avoid 
unexpected conversions and the resulting potential for library access 
outages, automatic conversion is, by default, disabled when the library 
is created.

<p>
If you specify the /AUTO_CONVERT qualifier with the CREATE LIBRARY or 
MODIFY LIBRARY command, VDE will automatically convert your 
library when new versions of VDE are installed on your system.
<a name="index_x_332"></a>
<a name="index_x_333"></a>
If automatic conversion is disabled, a user must enter an explicit 
CONVERT LIBRARY command to convert the library. To use this command, 
you must have the VDE privilege MODLIB. This approach gives 
you more control over when conversions occur so that your VDE 
library cannot be accidentally converted to the format for a new 
version of VDE that you do not yet want to use.
<a name="index_x_334"></a>
<a name="index_x_335"></a>
<a name="index_x_336"></a>

<p>
Furthermore, when the library format changes, you should in general 
delete all processes connected to the VDE library before 
converting the library so that all user processes use the new version 
of VDE after the conversion. This is especially important if 
most users use kept VDE subprocesses to access the library. 
To delete such processes, use the
<a name="index_x_337"></a>
<a name="index_x_338"></a>
RMU/CLOSE command with the /ABORT=DELPRC qualifier. For example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RMU/CLOSE/CLUSTER/ABORT=DELPRC DEV$:[ROOTDIR]VDE$DATABASE
</pre>
</font>
</table>

After entering this command, use the VDE CONVERT LIBRARY 
command. This procedure ensures that all users of your library will 
access it with the new version of VDE and that your library 
has the format that this version requires.

<p>
To use the RMU/CLOSE command, you must have the OpenVMS privilege 
SYSPRV.
<a name="index_x_339"></a>

<p>
You can modify the library attribute that controls automatic library 
conversion using the /AUTO_CONVERT or /NOAUTO_CONVERT qualifier with 
the MODIFY LIBRARY command.

<a name="estab_lib_opt_sendmail"><h2>6.2.5 Sending Mail Notifications</h2></a>

<p>
The /AUTO_MAIL qualifier specifies that VDE should send a 
mail notification message to the user who has queued a replacement when 
that replacement is later performed (see <a href="vde_guide_003.html#queued_repl">Queued Replacements</a>). The 
/NOAUTO_MAIL qualifier suppresses such notification messages. These 
qualifiers thus control the volume of mail messages VDE 
sends. If you specify neither qualifier, /AUTO_MAIL is assumed by 
default.
<a name="index_x_340"></a>
<a name="index_x_341"></a>

<p>
The /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier suppresses all VDE mail 
notification messages for the library. This qualifier is useful if you 
are setting up a VDE library for testing purposes or simply 
to play with. For a production VDE library you should always 
enable mail notifications, which can you do by specifying the 
/SEND_MAIL qualifier or by simply omitting the /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier.

<a name="estab_lib_opt_delent"><h2>6.2.6 Allowing Deletion of Library Entities</h2></a>

<p>
VDE allows you to delete library entities such as modules, 
facilities, and streams with various DELETE commands. To use such 
commands, you must in general have the corresponding delete privileges. 
These delete privileges protect against deletion of library entities by 
unauthorized users. They also require authorized users to set those 
privileges before deleting entities, thus providing some protection 
against accidental deletion.
<a name="index_x_342"></a>
<a name="index_x_343"></a>
<a name="index_x_344"></a>

<p>
As an additional protection against accidental deletion of library 
entities, VDE allows you to specify that certain entities, 
such as specific modules, facilities, and streams, are not allowed to 
be deleted even when the user has the corresponding delete privilege. A 
given stream, for example, can have its delete attribute set to 
no-delete using the /NODELETE qualifier to the MODIFY STREAM command. 
VDE will then not allow the DELETE STREAM command to delete 
that stream. The stream can still be deleted, but only if the attribute 
is first changed with another MODIFY STREAM command to allow the stream 
to be deleted. The no-delete attribute thus prevents accidental 
deletion of the stream by requiring an extra command to explicitly 
allow deletion before the DELETE STREAM command can be used. The 
delete-stream privilege is required as well.

<p>
When you create your VDE library, you can specify the default 
setting of the deletion attribute for new database entities. The 
/ALLOW_DELETE qualifier to CREATE LIBRARY specifies that new database 
entities should be allowed to be deleted by default. The 
/NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier specifies that database entities should not 
be allowed to be deleted by default. If you specify neither qualifier, 
VDE by default marks new database entities as being allowed 
to be deleted. You can of course always override this default by 
explicity specifying the delete attribute when creating new entities. 
In general, allowing deletion is more convenient for the library 
maintainer. Not allowing deletion is more appropriate when numerous 
individuals have access to the library and some of them may be 
accident-prone when entering commands.

<a name="estab_lib_opt_cms"><h2>6.2.7 CMS History and Notes Defaults</h2></a>

<p>
Two sets of qualifiers to the CREATE LIBRARY command controls 
VDE's treatment of CMS history and notes information in the 
VDE library. The /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST qualifier causes 
VDE to create CMS elements (that is, delta files) with no 
default history and notes strings. This prevents CMS from producing 
files with history or notes information when modules are fetched with 
the CMS FETCH command. This library attribute has no effect on modules 
fetched with the VDE FETCH command, so it is only relevant if 
DCL command procedures access the CMS elements in the VDE 
library using CMS directly.
<a name="index_x_345"></a>
<a name="index_x_346"></a>
<a name="index_x_347"></a>

<p>
The /NOHISTORY_NOTES qualifier causes the VDE RESERVE command 
to never produce CMS history or notes information in its output files 
and to not accept the /HISTORY, /NOTES, and /POSITION qualifiers. 
Disabling history and notes information in reserved files makes certain 
mistakes less likely where such information gets replaced into the 
VDE library as part of the module text.

<p>
Both of these qualifiers prevent certain problems where history or 
notes information gets included in output files where this information 
must not be present. Such problems only occur in special circumstances 
and do not affect most VDE libraries. As a result, these 
qualifiers are optional and the default settings are given by the 
positive forms of those qualifiers, /CMS_ELEM_HIST and /HISTORY_NOTES.

<a name="estab_lib_arch"><h2>6.2.8 Configuring Architectures</h2></a>

<p>
<em>This section is under construction...</em>

<p>
After the creation of the various architectures using one or more 
CREATE ARCHITECTURE commands, one
<a name="index_x_348"></a>
normally enables the display of differnt architectures with the MODIFY 
LIBRARY/SHOW_ARCHITECTURE command.
<a name="index_x_349"></a>

<p>
See <a href="vde_guide_015.html#architectures">Chapter 9</a> for further information.

<a name="estab_lib_opt_misc"><h2>6.2.9 Miscellaneous Attributes</h2></a>

<p>
Other qualifiers to the CREATE LIBRARY command allow you to set various 
miscellaneous library attributes. The /ASK_INFO_FILE qualifier 
determines whether the REPLACE command will by default ask the user 
whether to edit a replacement information file (see <a href="vde_guide_003.html#repl_mods">Section 2.7</a>). The 
/SHOW_GEN_EXPR qualifier determines whether the RESERVE command 
displays the expected generation expression of the new module 
generation to be created when the module is later replaced. These and 
other qualifiers are described in more detail in the description of the 
CREATE LIBRARY command. Whether they are applicable to you depends on 
the development process you think is appropriate for your project.
<a name="index_x_350"></a>

<p>
If you have no strong feelings on these options, use the defaults. If 
you later change your mind, you can always change these setting with 
the MODIFY LIBRARY command.

<a name="estab_lib_dir"><h1><font color=maroon>6.3 Library Directory Structure</font></h1></a>

<p>
In addition to its root directory and database, your VDE 
library contains a number of additional disk directories and 
subdirectories. These additional directories contain the source modules 
for your software system, all associated derived modules (such as 
object modules and executable images), and various command files and 
log files that VDE uses to perform its functions. This 
section describes the structure and functions of these disk directories.
<a name="index_x_351"></a>
<a name="index_x_352"></a>
<a name="index_x_353"></a>
<a name="index_x_354"></a>

<a name="estab_lib_dir_delta"><h2>6.3.1 Delta File Directories</h2></a>

<p>
VDE always stores all source modules that are part of your 
software system in &quot;delta files.&quot; A <strong>delta 
file</strong> stores all generations of a source module in a condensed 
form. The delta file stores every line that has ever been part of the 
source module, along with information specifying which lines belong to 
which generations of the module. Because a line that is the same from 
one generation to the next is only stored once in the delta file, the 
file saves space by essentially only storing differences between 
generations. (Such files are called &quot;delta files&quot; because the 
Greek letter delta is often used to denote differences between 
quantities in mathematical notation.)
<a name="index_x_355"></a>
<a name="index_x_356"></a>

<p>
VDE uses callable CMS (VAX/VMS Code Management System) to 
manage its delta files. VDE sets up one CMS library for each 
facility in your software system. VDE also creates one CMS 
element (which is a delta file) for each source module in your software 
system.

<p>
By default, VDE creates a <strong>delta-file root 
directory</strong> called VDE$CMS.DIR within the library root directory 
when you create the library. Each time you create a new facility, 
VDE creates a subdirectory for that facility within the 
delta-file root directory. The CMS library for the facility is created 
in the facility's subdirectory. CMS uses additional subdirectories 
within the CMS library to store the actual delta files (CMS elements), 
but VDE does not keep track of the internal organization of 
the CMS library. <a href="vde_guide_010.html#libtbl_delta_dir">Table 6-1</a> illustrates the disk directories that 
VDE establishes for delta files. <p>

<table border=3>
  <caption><a name="libtbl_delta_dir"><strong>Table 6-1 Delta File Disk Directories</strong></a></caption>
  <tr bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
    <td>
      Library root directory:
    </td>
    <td>
      DEV$:[ROOTDIR]
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
    <td>
      Delta-file root directory:
    </td>
    <td>
      DEV$:[ROOTDIR.VDE$CMS]
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
    <td>
      Directory for facility FOO:
    </td>
    <td>
      DEV$:[ROOTDIR.VDE$CMS.FOO]
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
    <td>
      Directory for facility BAR:
    </td>
    <td>
      DEV$:[ROOTDIR.VDE$CMS.BAR]
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
VDE records the directory specification for the delta-file 
root directory and each facility's delta-file directory in its 
database. The SHOW LOCATION /DELTA_FILE command displays this 
information on your terminal.

<p>
Although VDE uses the default locations just described, you 
can specify different locations for the delta-file directories. To 
specify a different delta-file root directory (VDE$CMS by default), you 
must take the following actions:

<ul>
  <li>Specify the /DEFER qualifier with the CREATE LIBRARY command. This 
  qualifier prevents VDE from initializing the delta-file 
  directory tree using its default rules.
  <li>Enter the SET DIRECTORY command with the /DELTA_FILE qualifier to 
  specify the desired delta-file root directory. For example, to specify 
  that the delta-file root directory should be DEV$:[DELTAROOT], use the 
  following command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /DELTA_FILES DEV$:[DELTAROOT]
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command causes VDE to use directory DEV$:[DELTAROOT] as 
the delta-file root directory instead of DEV$:[ROOTDIR.VDE$CMS].
  <li>Enter the SET DIRECTORY command with the /DELTA_FILE and /FACILITY 
  qualifiers to specify the desired delta-file directory for a specific 
  facility. For example, to specify that the delta-file directory for 
  facility FOO should be DSK2:[PQR.STU], use the following command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /DELTA_FILES /FACILITY=FOO DSK2:[PQR.STU]
</pre>
</font>
</table>

Note that you can use this command to place the delta-file directory 
for a given facility on a different disk than the rest of the 
VDE library.
  <li>After having entered all desired SET DIRECTORY commands, enter the 
  following command to actually create the specified delta-file root 
  directory and the rest of the delta-file directory tree:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE /DELTA_FILES
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command creates the CMS library for each facility in addition to 
creating the actual directories. <br>To create the delta-file directory 
and CMS library for a specific facility FOO, use the following command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE /DELTA_FILES /FACILITY=FOO
</pre>
</font>
</table>

</ul>

<p>
Note that the SET DIRECTORY command specifies where a directory should 
be located, but does not actually create the directory. In effect, it 
creates a template for some part of the VDE directory tree. 
To actually create directories from that template, you must enter the 
CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command. This arrangement allows you to specify 
templates for many parts of the directory tree before you actually use 
the templates to create directories.

<a name="estab_lib_dir_stage"><h2>6.3.2 Staging Area Directories</h2></a>

<p>
When you use VDE for source control, you can replace modules 
in two ways. One is to replace modules immediately, in which case the 
modules being replaced are inserted into the VDE library 
right away. The other way is to queue modules for replacement, in which 
case the modules are not inserted into the library until an authorized 
user &quot;performs&quot; the queued replacement. Queued replacements 
are useful because they give project managers more control over the 
timing of replacements and they allow the replaced modules to be 
reviewed before being inserted into the library.
<a name="index_x_357"></a>
<a name="index_x_358"></a>

<p>
When a user queues modules for replacement, VDE copies the 
files being replaced into the library's staging area. The 
<strong>staging area</strong> is a disk directory tree that temporarily 
holds files being replaced until the corresponding replacements are 
performed by an authorized user. The staging area starts with the 
staging area root directory. By default, this root directory is 
subdirectory VDE$STAGE within the library root directory.

<p>
Within the staging area root directory, VDE creates two more 
levels of subdirectories. The staging area root directory contains 
subdirectories with names of the form VDE$STG_<em>n</em>. Each such 
directory holds a group of 100 replacements. Directory VDE$STG_12, for 
example, contains replacements with Replacement Id values in the range 
1200 to 1299. Within each such directory, VDE creates 
second-level directories that each hold the files for a single 
replacement. Within VDE$STG_12, for example, there are subdirectories 
with names such as VDE$REP_1261, representing replacement 1261. 
<a href="vde_guide_010.html#libtbl_stage_dir">Table 6-2</a> illustrates this structure.

<p>
Within the replacement subdirectory, VDE creates one 
subdirectory for each facility involved in the replacement. 
VDE stores the individual files being replaced in those 
facility subdirectories. Comment and information files for the 
replacement are stored in the replacement subdirectory. This is also 
shown in <a href="vde_guide_010.html#libtbl_stage_dir">Table 6-2</a>. <p>

<p>
As mentioned above, VDE's default location for the staging 
area root directory is subdirectory VDE$STAGE within the library root 
directory. To change this default, you must take the following actions:

<ul>
  <li>Specify the /DEFER qualifier with the CREATE LIBRARY command. This 
  qualifier prevents VDE from initializing the staging area 
  root directory using its default rules.
  <li>Enter the SET DIRECTORY command with the /STAGING qualifier to 
  specify the desired staging area directory. For example, to specify 
  that the staging area directory should be DEV2$:[PROJ.STAGE], use the 
  following command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /STAGING DEV2$:[PROJ.STAGE]
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command causes VDE to use directory DEV2$:[PROJ.STAGE] 
as the staging area root directory instead of DEV$:[ROOTDIR.VDE$STAGE]. 
It is preferable that the staging area be on a different disk than the 
rest of the library.
  <li>Enter the following command to actually create the specified 
  staging area root directory:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE /STAGING
</pre>
</font>
</table>

</ul>

<p>
The SET DIRECTORY and CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE commands can be used at any 
time after library creation to redirect the staging area to a different 
disk location.

<p>
After a given replacement has been performed, VDE no longer 
needs the corresponding staging area. VDE does not itself 
delete those files, but you should do so periodically to reclaim the 
disk space. Staging area files can be useful for some time, however, 
because they contain copies of the files inserted into the 
VDE library. They can thus be used to recover lost 
information if your delta files (CMS libraries) are lost or damaged. In 
case of such loss, you have to restore the CMS libraries from backups. 
That should make them close to being consistent with the information in 
the VDE database. After that, you can use the VDE 
VERIFY GENERATION command with the /RECOVER qualifier to restore the 
CMS libraries to the state given by the VDE database. This 
recovery operation requires access to the old staging area 
directories---to retrieve copies of any lost module generations for 
insertion into the CMS libraries. For this reason, you should always 
have the staging areas on a different disk than the delta files or the 
VDE database and you should keep the staging areas for old 
replacements around for some time after the replacements are performed.
