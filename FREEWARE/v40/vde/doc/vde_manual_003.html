</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>process-name</h3>
Specifies the parent process or a spawned subprocess to which control 
is to be passed. The process must already exist, be part of your 
current job, and share the same input stream as your current process. 
However, the process cannot be the current process or a subprocess 
created with the /NOWAIT qualifier.

<p>
Do not specify the <strong>process-name</strong> parameter if you use 
the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The ATTACH command allows you to quickly transfer control between 
processes. (For information about creating a subprocess, see the SPAWN 
command.) For example, you can transfer control from a parent process 
to a subprocess using the ATTACH command. Then, in the subprocess, you 
can start a build job using VDE and, after you finish, you 
can enter the ATTACH command to move back to the parent process. If you 
later want to display the status of your build job, you can enter 
another ATTACH command at DCL level (or from many utilities) to move 
back to the VDE subprocess you created.

<p>
Do not attempt to use the DCL ATTACH command to attach to a VDE kept 
subprocess.

<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>BUILD mod-name [, mod-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
Specifies a module or build group to be produced by the build job.

<p>
If the parameter is a module name, it is typically the name of an 
executable image or another type of derived module that is the end
<a name="index_x_105"></a>
result of a build operation. Each such module is a <em>target</em> of 
the build.

<p>
The module name must consist of a module name and a module type 
separated by a period (as in MODNAM.EXE) and may optionally be preceded 
by a facility name enclosed in square brackets (for example, 
[FACIL]MODNAM.EXE). If no facility name is specified, the module is 
assumed to belong to the default facility.

<p>
You can build more than one target module by using wildcard characters 
in any of the three components of the module name. The percent sign (%) 
in a name matches any single character in the position it occupies and 
the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. VDE builds those modules whose names match the 
wildcard pattern.

<p>
If the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter specifies a build group, the 
BUILD command builds all modules that are members of the build group. A 
build-group name is a simple name that has been declared with a CREATE 
GROUP/BUILD command. A build-group name may not contain wildcard 
characters.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The BUILD command performs two distinct operations: it creates a build 
job for the default development stream in the VDE database 
and it optionally starts that build job on a set of OpenVMS batch 
queues.
<p>
<a name="vde_cmd_build_createbld"><strong>Creating a Build Job</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
To create a build job in the database, the BUILD command does the 
following three things:

<ul>
  <li> First, the BUILD command determines the target modules to be 
  built. The target modules are specified by the 
  <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters of the command.
  <li> Next, the command determines the build steps that must be 
  performed to build those target modules. The needed build steps are 
  determined by the build dependencies stored in the VDE 
  database, by the modules that have changed since the last time the 
  targets were built, and by whether the user requests a full or minimal 
  build.
  <li> Finally, the BUILD command records information about the new build 
  job in the database. The information specifies the build steps to be 
  performed, any constraints on the order in which the steps are 
  performed, and other attributes. (An example of an order constraint is 
  the requirement that a compile step must complete before a dependent 
  link step starts.)
</ul>

<p>
The build job is always created for the default development stream. It 
uses the build dependencies of the default stream to determine the 
build steps to perform and it uses module replacement data for the 
default stream to determine the modules that have changed since the 
last build. The build job is then identified by the stream name and a 
build-job identification number. For example, the second build job for 
stream V1.0 is labeled &quot;build job 2 for stream V1.0&quot; in 
VDE messages.

<p>
You cannot create a new build job for a given stream if a build job 
already exists for that stream and that existing build job has not yet 
completed execution. This restriction ensures that two build jobs for 
the same stream do not execute at the same time. If you do not want the 
existing build job to run, stop it with the STOP BUILD_JOB command 
before creating the new build job.
<p>
<a name="vde_cmd_build_startbld"><strong>Starting a Build Job</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
To start a build job, the BUILD command submits one or more batch jobs 
to the OpenVMS batch queues that the user specified either with 
the /QUEUE qualifier or by default. Then each batch job runs the 
VDE$BUILD utility that executes the build steps belonging
<a name="index_x_106"></a>
to the build job. The steps are executed in a loop until all the steps 
are done. The VDE$BUILD utility does the following for each build step:

<ul>
  <li> The program looks in the database for the next available build 
  step. (A build step, normally a compile, copy, or link step, is 
  available if it is not waiting for another step to complete.) If no 
  step is available, the program waits a few seconds before looking for 
  another available build step.
  <li> When the program finds a build step to run, it looks up the 
  VDE script for that step and, from the script, generates the 
  DCL commands needed to run the step. The program then sends the DCL 
  commands to a subprocess that executes the build step, and waits for 
  the step to complete.
  <li> After the step completes, the program records the completion 
  status of the step in the database. A step completes either 
  successfully or with errors. If the step completes successfully, the 
  program updates the step's build dependency information in the database 
  and then looks for another step to perform.
</ul>

<p>
The BUILD command always creates a new build job in the VDE 
database. It also starts the build job unless you use the /NOSTART 
qualifier or you answer NO to a query asking whether to start the 
build. If the BUILD command does not start the build job, you can start 
it later with the START BUILD_JOB command. After the build job is 
created (whether or not you start it), you can use the SHOW BUILD_JOB 
command to display the attributes of the build, including the size of 
the build job and the exact build steps and build-step dependencies 
that make up the build job.

<p>
You can distribute the build job across several processors (whether in 
a single machine or in multiple machines in a cluster) by specifying 
the /QUEUE and /PROCESS_COUNT qualifiers. The /QUEUE qualifier 
specifies the batch queues to run the build job. The /PROCESS_COUNT 
qualifier specifies the total number of processes VDE submits 
to the batch queues performing the build job. By specifying the batch 
queues and the number of processes VDE submits to each queue, 
you can decide how to distribute the build job over a cluster with 
processors of different speeds and configurations.

<p>
If you do not specify the /QUEUE or /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier, 
VDE uses the default batch queues and process counts of the 
default development stream. You can establish these defaults using the 
/QUEUE and /PROCESS_COUNT qualifiers with the CREATE STREAM and MODIFY 
STREAM commands. If you have not specified such defaults, VDE 
submits one process to queue SYS$BATCH.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/AFTER=date-time</h3>
Indicates the date and time at which the build job begins execution. 
Specify the date and time using OpenVMS date-time syntax. Use 
this qualifier only if the BUILD command starts the build job: the 
qualifier specifies the start time for each batch job that is submitted 
to execute the build job.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the 
build job started. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print 
a message asking whether you want to start the build job. This message 
is displayed after VDE creates the build job and displays a 
message stating the size of the job. If you answer YES (or Y), the 
build job is started. If you answer NO (or N), the build job is not 
started. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to start the 
build job without asking for confirmation. Neither qualifier has any 
effect if you use the /NOSTART qualifier: /NOSTART unconditionally 
prevents VDE from starting the build job.
<h3>/FULL</h3>
Directs the BUILD command to perform a full build of your software 
system. In a full build, all source modules that contribute to the 
target modules you specified are compiled or otherwise processed. If 
you do not specify the /FULL qualifier, the BUILD command performs a 
minimal system build, which means that only the source modules that 
have changed since the last build of the specified target modules are 
compiled or processed. A minimal build is normally much quicker than a 
full build because it performs only the minimal work needed to 
propagate your source changes to the target modules.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the build job is 
created and submitted to batch queues for execution. The /LOG qualifier 
causes such messages to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses 
them. These messages indicate that the build job has been created, that 
the database transaction has successfully committed, and that batch 
jobs have been submitted to various batch queues to execute the build 
job.
<h3>/PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count</h3>
Specifies the number of processes to execute the build job. 
VDE creates the processes by submitting batch jobs to the 
queues specified by the /QUEUE qualifier or to the default queues for 
the default stream. The number of processes that VDE creates 
(that is, the number of OpenVMS batch jobs it submits) is 
specified by the <strong>proc-count</strong> parameter. As a result, 
this parameter determines the degree of parallelism for the build job.
<h3>/QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])</h3>
Specifies the OpenVMS batch queues to which the build job is 
submitted. Each <strong>queue-name</strong> parameter specifies the 
name of one batch queue. The <strong>queue-name</strong> parameter may 
optionally be followed by a process count in parentheses. This count 
specifies the number of processes that are started on the queue to run 
the build job. For example, SYS$BATCH(3) causes three build-job 
processes to be submitted to queue SYS$BATCH. If the process count is 
omitted, one process is submitted to the queue.
<a name="index_x_107"></a>
<a name="index_x_108"></a>

<p>
If you only specify one <strong>queue-name</strong> parameter, the 
parentheses may be omitted.

<p>
If you also use the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier, the /PROCESS_COUNT 
qualifier states the total number of build-job processes to create. In 
that case, the process counts attached to the 
<strong>queue-name</strong> parameters on the /QUEUE qualifier are used 
as scaling factors to distribute build-job processes among the queues 
proportionally. For example, if you specify queues HI_BATCH, 
HO_BATCH(3) and a total process count of eight, then two processes are 
submitted to queue HI_BATCH and six processes to queue HO_BATCH. If the 
total process count does not divide evenly into the sum of the scaling 
factors, the remaining processes are allocated to the queues in the 
order the queues are listed. If the total process count is nine, for 
example, the one extra process is allocated to queue HI_BATCH because 
HI_BATCH is listed first.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the new 
build job. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters 
long, may contain any explanatory remark about the build job that you 
want to store in the database.
<h3>/START (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOSTART</h3>
Controls whether the build job is started or not. The /START qualifier 
starts the build job, which means that VDE submits batch jobs 
to the appropriate OpenVMS batch queues. These batch jobs run 
programs that execute all the build steps that make up the build job. 
The /NOSTART qualifier prevents VDE from submitting the batch 
jobs. If you use the /NOSTART qualifier, you can start the build job 
later with the START BUILD_JOB command.
<h3>/STEP_DELAY=time-interval</h3>
Specifies the step-delay time interval used by VDE$BUILD.
<a name="index_x_109"></a>
VDE$BUILD is the program that executes the build steps belonging to a 
build job. If VDE$BUILD cannot find an available build step in the 
database, the program waits the amount of time specified by the 
/STEP_DELAY qualifier before it looks in the database again.

<p>
When multiple processes run a build job, one process may be idle until 
a second process completes its current build step. In that situation, 
the first process periodically looks in the database to see if the 
second process has finished its step. The step-delay interval 
determines how often the first process looks in the database for an 
available step.

<p>
Use the following syntax to denote the number of hours, minutes, and 
seconds in the interval:
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
/STEP_DELAY=hh:mm:ss.ss 
</pre>
</font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>

For example, an interval of three and one half seconds is specified as 
follows:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
 
<em></em><em>/STEP_DELAY=00:00:03.50</em>
 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

Usually the interval is set at a few seconds. If this qualifier is not 
specified, VDE uses the default step-delay interval of the 
stream. If no default has been specified, the delay interval is five 
seconds.
<h3>/TIMEOUT=time-interval</h3>
Specifies the timeout interval for the build job. If no build steps 
complete during this interval, the VDE$BUILD utility stops
<a name="index_x_110"></a>
the build job and assigns it TIMEOUT status. Therefore, the timeout 
interval must be longer than the time required to complete the longest 
build step.

<p>
Normally, a build job only times out if a node that is running one of 
the build-job processes fails. When a node fails, other build-job 
processes may be unable to proceed because they are waiting for a build 
step that ran on the failed node to complete, which will not happen. In 
that case, after the timeout interval expires, one of the waiting 
processes marks the build job as timed out, after which the remaining 
processes terminate themselves. You can later restart the build job 
using the START BUILD_JOB command.

<p>
Use the following syntax to denote the number of hours, minutes, and 
seconds in the interval:
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
/TIMEOUT=hh:mm:ss.ss 
</pre>
</font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>

For example, an interval of two and one half hours is specified as 
follows:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
 
<em></em><em>/TIMEOUT=02:30:00.00</em>
 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The length of the timeout interval should be set based on the length of 
the longest build step in the build job. If this qualifier is not 
specified, VDE uses the default timeout interval of the 
stream. If no default has been specified, the timeout interval is one 
hour.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The CANCEL DIRECTORY command deletes a &quot;directory template&quot; 
from the VDE database. Directory templates are defined with 
the SET DIRECTORY command and specify the names that VDE 
should assign to disk directories when creating directories for new 
development streams or facilities or for the library's 
queued-replacement staging area. The CANCEL DIRECTORY command can 
delete all templates that the SET DIRECTORY command can create. The 
CANCEL DIRECTORY command does not delete or otherwise affect existing 
disk directories, however.

<p>
Unless the cancelled template is for the library's delta files or its 
staging area, it is only cancelled for the default development stream. 
Because directory templates are inherited by a stream's descendants, 
the CANCEL DIRECTORY command will affect the disk directories created 
for all future descendants of the default stream. It may also affect 
the directories created for new facilities in the default stream.

<p>
When you have cancelled a directory template, VDE uses its 
default rules to create directory trees for subsequent streams and 
facilities. VDE always creates stream, facility, and 
delta-file root directories, whether there are templates for such 
directories or not. VDE does not create facility 
subdirectories unless there are templates for them, however, so if you 
cancel a subdirectory template, you prevent that subdirectory from 
being created for new streams or facilities.

<p>

symbols (<em>dir-symbol</em>) and directory symbol processing, see

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/DELTA_FILES</h3>
<h3>/STAGING</h3>
<h3>/STREAM (default)</h3>
Specifies whether a directory template for delta files, the staging 
area, or the default stream is deleted. The /DELTA_FILES qualifier 
specifies that a directory template for the VDE library's 
delta files (CMS libraries)
<a name="index_x_113"></a>
be deleted. The /STAGING qualifier specifies that the directory 
template for the library's staging-area root directory be deleted. 
(Staging areas
<a name="index_x_114"></a>
<a name="index_x_115"></a>
hold files for queued replacements.) The /STREAM qualifier specifies 
that a directory template for the default stream be deleted.

<p>
Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
<h3>/FACILITY=fac-name</h3>
Specifies that a directory template for the facility specified by the 
<strong>fac-name</strong> parameter be deleted. If both this qualifier 
and the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier are specified, VDE deletes 
the directory template for the specified facility subdirectory. If the 
/FACILITY qualifier is specified and the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier is 
omitted, VDE deletes the directory template for the specified 
facility's root directory.

<p>
If the /FACILITY qualifier is omitted and the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier 
is specified, VDE deletes the directory template for the 
given facility subdirectory for all facilities that are not explicitly 
specified in other templates. If both the /FACILITY qualifier and the 
/SUBDIRECTORY qualifier are omitted, VDE deletes the template 
for the stream or delta-file root directory.

<p>
You can delete more than one directory template at a time by using 
wildcard characters in the <strong>fac-name</strong> parameter. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. Directory templates for those facilities whose 
names match the wildcard pattern are deleted.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the directory template 
is deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the 
directory template has been deleted from the database and that the 
database transaction has completed successfully.
<h3>/SUBDIRECTORY=dir-symbol</h3>
Specifies that a directory template for a facility subdirectory be 
deleted. The <strong>dir-symbol</strong> parameter specifies the 
directory symbol that identifies the subdirectory. Among other uses, 
the directory symbol
<a name="index_x_116"></a>
 is used within VDE scripts; see <a href="vde_manual_025.html#vde_script_keywords">Script Keywords</a> for further 
 details. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE deletes the 
 directory template for a facility, stream, or delta-file root 
 directory. (The description of the /FACILITY qualifier explains how the 
 qualifiers interact to select the template to delete.)
