<blockquote>
<a name="index_x_369"></a>
Retrieves a generation of one or more source modules from the current 
VDE library.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>FETCH gen-spec [, gen-spec...] ["remark"] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>gen-spec</h3>
Specifies a generation of a source module in the default stream to be 
retrieved from the library. A generation specification consists of the 
following in order:

<ul>
  <li> an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets
  <li> a module name
  <li> an optional type name preceded by a period
  <li> an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon
</ul>

An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

<p>
If you omit the facility name, modules from the default facility are 
fetched. If you omit the type name, all source modules with the 
specified module name in the specified facility are fetched. If you 
omit the generation number, the most recent generation of the module in 
the requested development stream is fetched. This is either the stream 
specified with the /STREAM qualifier or the default development stream.

<p>
If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number is 
relative to the most recent generation of the module in the requested 
development stream. For example, if the most recent generation is 
generation 5, then generation 0 is the same as generation 5 and 
generation --1 is the same as generation 4.

<p>
If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE fetches the 
generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores the 
generation number on the <strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter.

<p>
You can fetch more than one module by using wildcard characters in the 
facility name, module name, or type name. (Wildcard characters are not 
allowed in the generation number.) The percent sign (%) in a name 
matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. Those source modules whose names match the wildcard pattern 
are fetched.

<p>
You can also fetch multiple modules by specifying the name of a source 
group instead of a generation expression. Source groups are created 
with the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group name, the latest 
generation of each module that is a member of the group is copied to 
your directory.
<h3>"remark"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be logged in the history file with this 
command, usually to explain why the command was entered. Specifying the 
<strong>remark</strong> parameter is equivalent to specifying the 
/REMARK qualifier after the FETCH keyword.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The FETCH command copies the specified generation of a module from the 
VDE library to a file in your default directory or the 
directory specified with the /OUTPUT qualifier. The module is not 
reserved from the library nor can it be replaced into the 
VDE library. You can fetch a module whether or not it is 
reserved.

<p>
The presence or absence of a remark determines whether the FETCH 
transaction is recorded in the CMS history file for the facility.
<a name="index_x_370"></a>
If you enter a remark, VDE records the transaction in the 
history file. If you enter a null remark, VDE does not 
record the transaction in the history file.

<p>
When you fetch a generation of a module from a VDE library, 
VDE restores the file's creation time, revision time, record 
format, and record attributes. The file that is placed in your 
directory has the same creation and revision times as the file that 
created the generation that you are fetching.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
module fetched. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a 
message for each module generation that you have specified asking 
whether you want to fetch that generation. If you answer YES (or Y), 
the module is fetched. If you answer NO (or N), the module is not 
fetched. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to fetch each 
specified module generation without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/GENERATION=gen-expr</h3>
Specifies that the module generation with the CMS generation expression 
given by the <strong>gen-expr</strong> parameter be fetched from the 
VDE library. When this qualifier is specified, the 
generation number specified on the <strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter 
is ignored.
<h3>/HISTORY[="string"]</h3>
Specifies that history information is to be included in the file placed 
in your directory. The history of the module lists the generations that 
preceded the current generation of the module. Each generation produces 
one line of history information in the output file. This line gives the 
CMS generation number, user name, date, time, and remark associated 
with the generation.

<p>
The quoted string specifies the format of the history line. The quoted 
string must contain the characters #H or #B (lower case is allowed) and 
can contain other printing characters (such as comment delimiters). 
Each history line is formed by inserting the history information where 
you specify #H or #B in the history string. If you specify #H, the 
history information is inserted at the end of the file and if you 
specify #B it is inserted at the beginning of the file. To include a 
quotation mark in the output history string, type it twice 
(&quot;&quot;). To include a number sign (#) in the output history 
string, type it twice (##). If the <strong>string</strong> parameter is 
omitted, VDE uses the module's default history string.

<p>
If the /HISTORY and /NOHISTORY qualifiers are both omitted, the FETCH 
command generates history information only if the history attribute is 
enabled for the module. This attribute is set with the CREATE MODULE or 
MODIFY MODULE command.
<h3>/NOHISTORY</h3>
Specifies that history information is not to be appended to the output 
file placed in your directory.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each module generation 
is fetched. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the modules have 
been fetched and that the database transaction has successfully 
committed.
<h3>/MERGE=stream-name</h3>
<h3>/MERGE=(gen-expr)</h3>
Controls whether another generation of the module (called the merge 
generation) is to be merged with the generation that is being fetched 
(called the retrieved generation). If you specify the /MERGE qualifier 
with the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter, the merge generation 
is the latest generation of the module in the specified stream. If you 
specify the /MERGE qualifier with the <strong>gen-expr</strong> 
parameter enclosed in parentheses, the merge generation is the 
generation with the specified generation expression (for example, 
&quot;2A3&quot;).

<p>
When you specify the /MERGE qualifier, VDE merges the lines 
of the retrieved generation with the lines of the merge generation and 
delivers the merged text as a single file to your output directory. The 
file that is placed in your directory has the current creation and 
revision times. The merge generation cannot be on the same line of 
descent as the retrieved generation. When there is a conflict between 
blocks of one or more lines, VDE includes the conflicting 
lines and flags the conflict.

<p>
VDE uses the callable interface to CMS to provide the merge 
capability.
<a name="index_x_371"></a>
For a detailed explanation of how two generations are merged and how 
CMS (and therefore VDE) treats conflicts between the 
generations, see the CMS documentation.
<h3>/NOTES[="string"]</h3>
Specifies that CMS notes are to be appended to the lines of the output 
file. CMS notes indicate in what module generation each source line was 
created.

<p>
The quoted string specifies the format of the note. The quoted string 
can contain text (including the appropriate comment delimiter) and the 
characters #G or #g. The CMS generation expression of the generation in 
which the line first appeared in inserted where you specify #G or #g. 
The resulting string is appended to the end of the output line. To 
include a quotation mark in the output notes string, type it twice 
(&quot;&quot;). To include a number sign (#) in the output notes 
string, type it twice (##). If the <strong>string</strong> parameter is 
omitted, VDE uses the module's default notes string. (You 
set the default notes string with the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE 
command.)

<p>
If the /NOTES and /NONOTES qualifiers are both omitted, the FETCH 
command generates CMS notes only if the notes attribute is enabled for 
the module. This attribute is set with the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY 
MODULE command.
<h3>/NONOTES</h3>
Specifies that CMS notes are not to be appended to the lines of the 
file placed in your directory.
<h3>/NOOUTPUT</h3>
Specifies that the fetch operation is to be performed along with any 
history processing and error checking but that no output file is to be 
created.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file-specification</h3>
Directs VDE to write the fetched module to the specified 
file. If you omit the directory from the file specification, 
VDE writes the file to your default directory. If you omit 
the file name or file type, VDE uses the module name and 
type by default. If you omit the /OUTPUT and /NOOUTPUT qualifiers 
entirely, VDE creates a file in your current default 
directory with the same name as the module.

<p>
If you fetch more than one module with the same /OUTPUT qualifier (by 
using either wildcards or a group name in the module-name parameter) 
and you do not specify wildcards in the output file specification, 
VDE creates successive versions of the file indicated by the 
/OUTPUT qualifier.
<h3>/POSITION=column-number</h3>
Specifies the column in which CMS notes are to be placed. The column 
number must be an integer in the range 1 to 511. If the length of an 
output line is less than the specified column number, the note appears 
at the specified column number. If the length of the line is greater 
than or equal to the column number, the note is placed at the next tab 
stop after the end of the line. (Tab stops are at position 9 and every 
8 characters thereafter.)

<p>
If the /POSITION qualifier is omitted, the default notes position for 
the module is used. The default notes position is set with the CREATE 
MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command. The /POSITION qualifier has no effect 
unless the /NOTES qualifier is specified or the notes attribute is set 
for the module.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be logged in the CMS history file by
<a name="index_x_372"></a>
this command, usually to explain why the command was entered. The 
remark is enclosed in quotation marks. If no remark is entered, the 
fetch operation is not logged.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that the modules be fetched from the development stream given 
by the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. If this qualifier is 
omitted, the modules are fetched from the default development stream. 
If this qualifier is omitted and no default stream is defined, 
VDE prompts you for the stream name.
<a name="index_x_373"></a>

<h3>INSERT GENERATION gen-spec [, gen-spec...] targ-stream-name 
["remark"] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>gen-spec</h3>
Specifies a module generation in a specified development stream that 
should be inserted into the stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. A generation specification 
consists of the following in order:

<ul>
  <li> an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets
  <li> a module name
  <li> an optional type name preceded by a period
  <li> an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon
</ul>

 An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

<p>
If you omit the facility name, the default facility is assumed. If you 
omit the type name, generations for all source modules with the 
specified module name in the specified facility are inserted into the 
given stream. If you omit the generation number, the most recent 
generation of the module in the stream specified with the /STREAM 
qualifier is inserted into the given stream.

<p>
If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number is 
relative to the most recent generation of the module in the stream 
given by the /STREAM qualifier. For example, if the most recent 
generation is generation 5, then generation 0 is the same as generation 
5 and generation --1 is the same as generation 4.

<p>
If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE inserts the 
generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores the 
generation number on the <strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter.

<p>
You can insert more than one generation by using wildcard characters in 
the facility name, module name, or type name. The percent sign (%) in a 
name matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. Wildcard characters are not allowed in the generation number. 
Those module generations whose names match the wildcard pattern are 
inserted into the <strong>stream-name</strong> stream.

<p>
Unless the WILD_INS_GEN library attribute is enabled, VDE 
does not allow wildcard characters in the generation specification when 
you use the /GENERATION qualifier. It seldom makes sense to select 
generations with the same CMS generation expression from different 
modules. For the same reason, VDE does not allow you to use 
wildcard characters and a non-zero generation number in the same 
generation specification (as in *.*;--2), again unless the WILD_INS_GEN 
library attribute is set.
<h3>targ-stream-name</h3>
Specifies the development stream into which the generations given by 
the <strong>gen-spec</strong> parameters should be inserted.

<p>
One can specify the source generation for the operation in several 
ways, one of which is based on the generation in a specified source 
stream---see the /STREAM qualifier.
<h3>"remark"</h3>
Specifies a remark string that explains why you inserted the generation 
into the specified stream. The quoted remark string can be up to 132 
characters long. Specifying the <strong>remark</strong> parameter is 
equivalent to specifying the /REMARK qualifier after the INSERT 
GENERATION keywords.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The INSERT GENERATION command inserts the module generations you 
specify with the <strong>gen-spec</strong> parameters into the 
development stream you specify with the <strong>stream-name</strong> 
parameter. Each such generation becomes the latest generation of the 
corresponding module in the <strong>stream-name</strong> stream. The 
command thus lets you move module generations from one stream to 
another stream.

<p>
If the specified module is currently reserved in the specified stream, 
VDE terminates that reservation since it is based on a 
module generation that no longer is the latest generation for the 
stream. VDE sends a mail message to notify the owner of the 
reservation that the reservation is lost.
<a name="index_x_377"></a>

<p>
Note that there are two stream specifications possible on this command. 
The destination stream---specified by the target stream name 
parameter---and the optional source stream qualifier.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
generation inserted into the specified stream. The /CONFIRM qualifier 
causes VDE to print a message for each generation giving the 
name of the generation and asking whether you want to insert the 
generation into the stream. If you answer YES (or Y), the generation is 
inserted into the stream. If you answer NO (or N), the generation is 
not inserted into the stream. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to insert each generation into the specified stream 
without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/NOCMS_CLASS</h3>
Prevents the inserted generations from being inserted into the CMS 
class for the specified stream, even if a CMS class is normally 
maintained for the stream. The INSERT GENERATION command executes 
faster than otherwise if CMS class memberships are not updated.
<h3>/GENERATION=gen-expr</h3>
Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression given 
by the <strong>gen-expr</strong> parameter be inserted into the 
specified stream. When this qualifier is specified, the generation 
number specified on the <strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter is ignored.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the generations are 
inserted into the stream. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be 
printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the 
generations have been inserted into the specified stream and that the 
database transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string that explains why you inserted the generation 
into the specified stream. The quoted remark string can be up to 132 
characters long.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies the stream in which the generation should be looked up if you 
omit the /GENERATION qualifier. This qualifier thus affects the 
interpretation of the generation number in the command-level 
<strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter when the /GENERATION qualifier is 
omitted. If you omit both the /STREAM qualifier and the /GENERATION 
qualifier, VDE prompts you for the name of the stream in 
which to look up the generation number.
