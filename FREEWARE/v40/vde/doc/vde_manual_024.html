<p>
The /NONOTES qualifier specifies that CMS notes are not to be appended 
to the lines of the file placed in your directory.

<p>
If the /NOTES and /NONOTES qualifiers are both omitted, the RESERVE 
command generates CMS notes only if the notes attribute is enabled for 
the module. This attribute is set with the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY 
MODULE command.

<p>
If the history-notes attribute for the VDE library is 
disabled, the RESERVE command will not generate CMS notes information 
into the output file and will not accept the /NOTES qualifier. See the 
description of the /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier to CREATE LIBRARY for more 
information.
<h3>/NOOUTPUT</h3>
Specifies that the reserve operation is to be performed along with any 
history processing and error checking but that no output file is to be 
created.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file-specification</h3>
Directs VDE to write the reserved module to the specified 
file. If you omit the directory from the file specification, 
VDE writes the file to your default directory. If you omit 
the file name or file type, VDE uses the module name and 
type by default. If you omit the /OUTPUT and /NOOUTPUT qualifiers 
entirely, VDE creates a file in your current default 
directory with the same name as the module.

<p>
If you reserve more than one module with the same /OUTPUT qualifier and 
you specify the file name and type on that qualifier, VDE 
creates successive versions of the file indicated by the /OUTPUT 
qualifier.
<h3>/OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT</h3>
Specifies that VDE should create a concurrent reservation if 
a module being reserved is already reserved for the same stream. If 
this qualifier is omitted and a module you are trying to reserve is 
already reserved, VDE displays an error message and does not 
reserve the module for you. To create a second, concurrent reservation, 
you must use this qualifier. Even when you use this qualifier, 
VDE does not allow you to create a concurrent reservation if 
a previous reservation for the module does not allow concurrent 
reservations.
<h3>/POSITION=column-number</h3>
Specifies the column in which CMS notes are to be placed. The column 
number must be an integer in the range 1 to 511. If the length of an 
output line is less than the specified column number, the note appears 
at the specified column number. If the length of the line is greater 
than or equal to the column number, the note is placed at the next tab 
stop after the end of the line. (Tab stops are at position 9 and every 
8 characters thereafter.)

<p>
If the /POSITION qualifier is omitted, the default notes position for 
the module is used. The default notes position is set with the CREATE 
MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command. The /POSITION qualifier has no effect 
unless the /NOTES qualifier is specified or the notes attribute is set 
for the module.

<p>
If the history-notes attribute for the VDE library is 
disabled, the RESERVE command will not generate CMS notes information 
into the output file and will not accept the /POSITION qualifier. See 
the description of the /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier to CREATE LIBRARY for 
more information.
<h3>/PROPAGATE=stream-name</h3>
<h3>/NOPROPAGATE</h3>
This qualifier controls the default module propogation behaviour of the 
subsequent and associated REPLACE command, and it controls the 
reservation &quot;shadow&quot; for this particular reservation.

<p>
When specified, the /PROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to 
propagate the changed module(s) only as far as the stream specified by 
the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter, but <em>not</em> to any 
successors of that stream---change propagation thus stops at the 
specified stream.

<p>
The /NOPROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to disable all 
propagate of the change beyond the current stream (the default stream 
or the stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier).

<p>
If you omit both qualifiers, the REPLACE command will propagate the 
changed modules to all successors of the current stream.

<p>
Because these qualifiers determine what streams a subsequent REPLACE 
command will affect, they also determine what streams---the 
&quot;shadow&quot;---the new module reservations cover. A reservation 
that covers fewer streams allows other users to reserve the same module 
in other streams with less likelihood of conflict.

<p>
For information on propogation, see <a href="vde_manual_022.html#vde_cmd_replace">REPLACE</a>.
<h3>/QUEUE</h3>
<a name="index_x_555"></a>
Specifies that VDE should queue a reservation request for 
you if you cannot reserve a module because it is already reserved by 
another user. If the requested module can be reserved now, the module 
is reserved and this qualifier has no effect. However, if the module is 
not available, VDE queues a reservation request for it in 
its database. When the user who owns the current reservation later 
replaces or unreserves it, VDE sends you a mail message 
saying that the module is now available. To actually reserve the 
module, you must then enter another RESERVE command. If multiple users 
have queued reservation requests for the same module, all of them are 
notified when the module becomes available. They must then decide among 
themselves who should reserve the module first.

<p>
To display queued reservation requests, use the SHOW RESERVATION 
command.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a character string to be stored in the database for this 
reservation, usually explaining why the reservation is made. The remark 
is enclosed in quotation marks. If no remark is entered, a null remark 
is stored.
<h3>/SESSION[=session-name]</h3>
Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations 
together, typically to group all modules related to a particular source 
code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all component 
modules reserved to be treated as a single entity for subsequent 
replacement operations. A session also allows additional modules to be 
reserved and incorporated into an existing session at a later time.

<p>
If no session with the specified <strong>session-name</strong> session 
name currently exists, VDE will create a new reservation 
session under the specified session name and will incorporate the 
module reservation(s) into it.

<p>
If the <strong>session-name</strong> parameter is omitted, 
VDE generates a unique session name, creates a new session 
by that name, and adds the module reservation to it.

<p>
If the /SESSION qualifier is omitted on the RESERVE command, 
VDE will reserve the module (as expected), and will not add 
the new module reservation to any session.

<p>
Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE, MODIFY 
SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL SESSION 
commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on a queued-replacement 
stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be combined into the same session.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that modules be reserved in the development stream given by 
the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. The RESERVE command fetches 
the latest generation of each specified module in that stream and 
records that each reservation belongs to that stream. If this qualifier 
is omitted, modules are reserved in the default development stream. If 
this qualifier is omitted and no default stream is defined, 
VDE prompts you for the stream name.
<a name="index_x_556"></a>
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Reserves modules in another user's name. The <strong>username</strong> 
parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of the other user. You 
must have the USERNAME privilege to use this qualifier.
<a name="index_x_557"></a>

<p>
The REVIEW BUILD_JOB command creates a <strong>build-step review

default, the list includes only those steps that completed with errors. 
Commands in the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem list the steps in the review

provided, the comment files that other reviewers may have written, and

The REVIEW REPLACEMENT command creates a list of files to be reviewed 
called the <strong>replacement review list</strong>. This list includes 
the replacement's information file (if any), the comment file for each 
reviewer that has provided one, the log file for the last attempt to 
perform replacement (if any), and the modules that are queued for 
replacement. Subsystem commands list, display, and navigate among the 
elements in the review list. One element is always designated as the

In this example, the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command displays some 
information identifying the requested queued replacement and enters the 
REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem. The DIRECTORY subcommand displays the 
elements on the review list and the CURRENT subcommand prints a line 
identifying the current element of the review list (namely the first 
element).

<p>
Yet another NEXT command makes module [FACIL]A.REQ the current element 
of the review list. The SHOW command displays the differences file for 
that module. To do so, it first fetches out the old generation of the 
module, differences it with the new generation queued for replacement, 
and displays the differences file. The EDIT command could have been 
used just as well, and is more suitable for long differences files. 
Another NEXT command make module [FACIL]C.B32 the current element and 
displays its name. A final NEXT command shows that there are no more 
elements in the review list. The user then enters the EXIT command to 
return to the VDE„ prompt.
