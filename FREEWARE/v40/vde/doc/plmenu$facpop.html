The Facility Populate utility (FACPOP) is used to populate one CMS 
class from another CMS class. The advantage of this utility is that if 
the class to be populated already contains some elements, then these 
elements will be skipped since no real work needs to be performed for 
them.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The FACPOP utility is used to create (if necessary) and populate a CMS 
class from an existing CMS class. This utility has some built in checks 
that must be met in order to minimize the possibility for error. The 
actual task of populating the CMS class is performed in three steps.

<p>
The first step is to verify that both class names specified are present 
in the CMS library. If the 'TARGET' class is not present, the utility 
will optionally create this class for the user. If the user did not 
specify that the class should be created, then the utility will display 
an error message and discontinue processing on the library that does 
not contain the 'TARGET' class.

<p>
The second step is to build a list of all elements contained in the 
'BASE' class, and a list of all elements contained in the 'TARGET' 
class. Using these lists, the utility then puts the new/updated 
generations found in the BASE list into the TARGET list.

<p>
The third and final step is to remove all element generations that were 
found in the TARGET list, but were not present in the BASE list. The 
step is optional, and by default is turned off (see the /REMOVE 
qualifier).

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>library-spec</h3>
  Specifies the CMS library that is to be acted on. This specification 
  can contain wildcards, but it must be a valid CMS library directory 
  specification (i.e. VMS$:[YELLOW_TEST.CMS]). An example of a wildcarded 
  specification would be: VMS$:[Y*.CMS]. This specification would process 
  all libraries that start with the letter "Y".
<h3>base-class</h3>
  Specifies the CMS class name that will be used to populate the target 
  class.
<h3>target-class</h3>
  Specifies the CMS class name that will be populated.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Command Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/[NO]CREATE</h3>
  Indicates that the utility should create the target class if it is not 
  already present in the library. The target class will only be created 
  if the library contains the base class, and the library is one that is 
  supposed to be processed. The default is not to create the target class 
  and to display an error message indicating that the target class was 
  not found in the library.
<h3>/LOG=(log-type[,log-type,...])</h3>
  Specifies what type of logging the user wants. The default is that the 
  user will only see messages from the utility pertaining to the 
  libraries being processed or skipped. The list of acceptable log types 
  is:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]ALL - Log all messages
  <li>[NO]LIBRARY - Log only message pertaining to libraries
  <li>[NO]CMS - Log error messages received from CMS
</ul>

<h3>/PROCESS=(attribute[,attribute,...])</h3>
  The PROCESS qualifier is used to identify what libraries are to be 
  processed. Some libraries have special attributes associated with them, 
  VMSCMS$NO_PROPAGATE.FLAG is an example of an attribute. This attribute 
  indicates that this library is not to have any code propagation 
  performed within it. The process qualifier is used to selectively 
  process or skip libraries marked with certain attributes. The list of 
  acceptable attributes is:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]ALL - process all libraries no matter what attribute it may have
  <li>[NO]ARCHIVEDFACILITY - process all archived libraries
  <li>[NO]FLAGFREE - process libraries with no attributes
  <li>[NO]NOPROPAGATE - process libraries marked no propagate
</ul>

<h3>/[NO]REMOVE</h3>
  Indicates that the utility should remove generations found in the 
  target class that are not in the base class. The default is that these 
  generations will not be removed from the target class.
