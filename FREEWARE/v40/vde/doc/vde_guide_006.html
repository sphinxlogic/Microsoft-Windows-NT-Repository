The SHOW USER command lists information about the users of the 
OpenVMS source control system. These users are the OpenVMS 
developers and others who are allowed to access the OpenVMS 
current library. The following example shows how to use the SHOW USER 
command:

</table>

This example displays information about the user with OpenVMS 
user name SMITH. If the user name is omitted, the command shows 
information about all users recorded in the database. With this 
command, you can specify a list of user names separated by commas, and 
you can use the asterisk (*) and percent sign (%) wildcard characters 
in the user names. All users whose OpenVMS user names match the 
wildcard patterns are displayed.

<a name="rev_repl"><h1>Chapter 4<br>Reviewing Queued Replacements</h1></a>
</font>

<p>
This chapter tells you how to review modules on behalf of another 
developer who has queued those modules for replacement. When you are a 
reviewer for a replacement, it is your responsibility to review the 
code being replaced for errors, quality, and appropriateness for the 
development stream. Based on these factors, you must then record in the 
source control database that you either accept or reject the proposed 
replacement. This chapter tells you how to perform these operations.

<a name="rev_repl_mods"><h1><font color=maroon>4.1 Reviewing Modules Queued for Replacement</font></h1></a>

<p>
When you queue a replacement with the REPLACE command, you can use the 
/REVIEWER qualifier to that command to specify who should review your 
replacement. The source control system might assign additional 
reviewers to your replacement because some developers automatically 
review every change to certain modules or development streams. 
VSC records the reviewer list in the database and sends mail 
to all the reviewers to request that they review your replacement. The 
SHOW REPLACEMENT/FULL command will display the reviewer list for you.
<a name="index_x_193"></a>
<a name="index_x_194"></a>
<a name="index_x_195"></a>

<p>
Once a replacement has been queued, the reviewers for that replacement 
are allowed to review it and to vote to accept or reject it. Reviewing 
the replacement means examining the source changes about to be replaced 
into the source code library to determine if they appear correct in 
style, substance, and appropriateness. The REVIEW REPLACEMENT command 
helps you review the source changes that comprise a replacement. For 
example, if you are a reviewer for the replacement SMITH--1, you should 
enter the following command to review it:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; REVIEW REPLACEMENT SMITH-1
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command places you in a VSC subsystem that presents the 
<em>VSC_REVIEW&gt;</em> prompt. This subsystem accepts a limited set of 
commands that allow you to examine the source code being replaced, 
differences between the new source code and the previous code in the 
source code library, and text files written by the replacement's 
submittor or by other reviewers. When you are done reviewing the 
replacement, you enter the EXIT command or press Ctrl/Z to return to 
the normal <em>VSC&gt;</em> prompt.

<p>
To perform its function, the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command first creates a 
<strong>review list</strong> for the specified replacement. The 
elements of the review list consist of the <strong>information 
file</strong> created by the user queing the replacement (if such a 
file was specified), the <strong>comment files</strong> created by 
previous reviewers (if such files were specified), and the modules 
queued for replacement. The review list will also contain a log file 
from the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command if that command was used but 
encountered errors when it tried to perform the replacement. One 
element of the review list is always designated as the <strong>current 
element</strong>; that is the element whose contents you can display. 
Initially, the first element on the list is the current element, but 
various commands allow you to change the current element.

<p>
The commands in the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem let you display the 
review list, navigate back and forth among the elements of the list to 
select the current element, and display the contents of the current 
element. To display an information or comment file, VSC 
simply types the file on your terminal. To diplay a module being 
reviewed, VSC can show the source being replaced, the 
original source currently in the library, and the differences between 
these two. VSC also lets you use an editor to examine files 
if you prefer.

<p>
The REVIEW REPLACEMENT command accepts several qualifiers that let you 
control the composition of the review list. <a href="vde_guide_006.html#qualtbl_revrep">Table 4-1</a> lists these 
qualifiers and describes their functions. <p>

    <td colspan=2 align=left>
       You can use these qualifiers in combination to include the elements you 
       want in the review list. If you omit all three qualifiers, the command 
       automatically includes all three kinds of elements in the review list.

<p>
The normal way to use the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem is to step from 
one review-list element to the next with the NEXT command (or the KP0 
key on the numeric keypad) and to then examine each element with the 
SHOW or EDIT command. To examine an information, comment, or log file, 
just use the SHOW command. To examine a module, you should generally 
start by examining the differences between the new and old versions of 
the module. The SHOW or EDIT command without a keyword parameter will 
create and display the differences file. If that does not give you 
enough information, use the EDIT NEW command to see the full text of 
the source module to be replaced. Use the EDIT OLD command if you want 
to see the old source code for comparison. When you are done reviewing 
the replacement, enter the EXIT command to return to the 
<em>VSC&gt;</em> prompt.

<p>
To traverse and display the review-list elements slightly faster, you 
can press the COMMA (,) key on the numeric keypad to perform the NEXT 
and SHOW commands with a single keystroke. Similarly, you can press the 
MINUS (--) key on the numeric keypad to perform the NEXT and EDIT 
commands with a single keystroke.

<p>
The new version, old version, and differences file for a module are all 
stored in the queued replacement's staging area. VSC fetches 
the old version and generates the differences file the first time a 
reviewer displays differences. For subsequent reviewers, VSC 
uses the files that already exist in the staging area.

In the following example, Jane Smith has queued a replacement 
consisting of two modules, [FACIL]FOO.MAR and [RMS]FUMBLE.B32. She has 
also supplied an information file for the replacement. If you were a 
reviewer for this replacement, you might first enter the following 
command to display information about it:

Modules and files being reviewed for replacement SMITH-1:
   Information file by user SMITH (Jane Smith)

   Module [FACIL]FOO.MAR
   Module [RMS]FUMBLE.B32

The review list includes SMITH's information file, a comment file from 
another reviewer JONES, and the two source modules. The information 
file is initially the current element since it is the first element on 
the list. To display that file, enter the SHOW command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC_REVIEW&gt; SHOW
 
Please perform this replacement after replacement SNURD-2 has run.
This replacement depends on a data cell defined by that code.
 
VSC_REVIEW&gt;
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The next element on the list is a comment file that user JONES created 
when he voted to reject the replacement. Such a comment file normally 
gives the reason for rejecting the replacement. To select and display 
that comment file, enter the NEXT command followed by the SHOW command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC_REVIEW&gt; NEXT
 
Comment file by reviewer JONES (Jim Jones) rejecting replacement
 
VSC_REVIEW&gt; SHOW
 
The code looks correct, but the name of variable USER_IS_A_JERK should
be changed to something more appropriate, such as USER_ERROR_FLAG.

To see the differences for the first module on the review list (module 
FOO.MAR), enter another NEXT command followed again by a SHOW command:

If the difference file had been large, it might have been easier to 
display it with the EDIT command. Also, to see the actual code to be 
replaced, you could use the EDIT NEW command at this point.

<p>
To examine module FUMBLE.B32, you repeat the NEXT and SHOW commands, as 
shown in the previous example. If you enter yet another NEXT command, 
VSC tells you that there are no more modules on the review 
list. You can then enter the EXIT command to return to the 
<em>VSC&gt;</em> prompt:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC_REVIEW&gt; EXIT
VSC&gt;
</pre>
</font>

At this point, you can enter normal VSC commands again.

<a name="acc_rej_repl"><h1><font color=maroon>4.2 Accepting or Rejecting a Queued Replacement</font></h1></a>

<p>
Once you have reviewed the changes that make up a queued replacement, 
you should record whether the replacement is acceptable or not. If you 
find the replacement acceptable, you enter the following command:
<a name="index_x_214"></a>
<a name="index_x_215"></a>
<a name="index_x_216"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; ACCEPT REPLACEMENT SMITH-1 "Remark string"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command records, in the source-control database, that you have 
reviewed the source changes in the specified queued replacement 
(SMITH--1) and have found them to be acceptable. Optionally, you can 
specify a remark string (using the /REMARK qualifier or a remark 
parameter as shown) or a comment file (using the /INPUT qualifier) to 
explain or comment on your decision to accept the replacement.

<p>
If you decide that the source changes in the queued replacement are not 
acceptable, you reject the replacement with the following command:
<a name="index_x_217"></a>
<a name="index_x_218"></a>
<a name="index_x_219"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; REJECT REPLACEMENT SMITH-1 "Remark string"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command records, in the source-control database, that you have 
reviewed the source changes in the specified queued replacement 
(SMITH--1) and have rejected them for some reason. This command 
requires you to specify a one-line remark string that summarizes why 
you reject the replacement. You can specify the remark string with the 
/REMARK qualifier or with a remark parameter as shown. If you do not 
specify a remark, VSC prompts you for the remark string. You 
must always give a reason for rejecting a replacement so the owner of 
the replacement learns how to make it acceptable.

<p>
If your reasons for rejecting the replacement are too long to fit in 
the remark string, you should explain your reasons in a comment file. 
You can edit this file ahead of time and specify its file name with the 
/INPUT qualifier. Alternatively, you can specify the /EDIT qualifier, 
which causes VSC to invoke an editor to create the comment 
file. The owner of the replacement can read your comment file through 
the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem. If you specify neither the /INPUT nor 
the /EDIT qualifier for the REJECT REPLACEMENT command, VSC 
asks you whether you want to edit a comment file. For the ACCEPT 
REPLACEMENT command, the default is to not provide a comment file.

<p>
If you have accepted or rejected a replacement and change your mind, 
you can enter another ACCEPT or REJECT REPLACEMENT command to reverse 
the earlier judgement. You can also enter another such command to 
modify your remark string or comment file.

<p>
You can accept or reject a replacement only if you are a reviewer for 
that replacement. Anyone can review a queued replacement using the 
REVIEW REPLACEMENT command, but only designated reviewers can vote for 
or against a replacement. Also, the votes of the reviewers only 
constitute advice to the release project leader to help him or her 
decide whether to perform the replacement or not. The project leader 
can decide for or against a given replacement regardless of what the 
reviewers say. Normally, however, the project leader relies on the 
reviewers to certify the quality and correctness of the replacement and 
takes their advice accordingly.

       Specifies that VSC should start an editing session for you to 
       create a text file with comments about the replacement. These comments 
       can give reasons for rejecting the replacement or descriptions of 
       possible improvements. The editor creates the file in the replacement's 
       staging area. If you specify neither the /INPUT nor the /EDIT qualifier 
       for the REJECT REPLACEMENT command, VSC asks you whether you 
       want to edit a comment file.

       Specifies a one-line remark string to be associated with your 
       acceptance or rejection of the replacement. If you omit this qualifier 
       from the REJECT REPLACEMENT command, the command prompts you for a 
       remark string. (A replacement can thus be accepted without giving a 
       reason but cannot be rejected without a stated cause.)

      is intended to be used only in special or unusual situations.
