If this qualifier is specified, the modules referenced by the 
<strong>session-name</strong> session are the target; do not specify 
the <strong>mod-name</strong> module name parameters.

<p>
Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE, MODIFY 
SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL SESSION 
commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on a queued-replacement 
stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be combined into the same session.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that reservations for the development stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter be modified. If this qualifier 
is omitted, reservations for the default development stream are 
modified.
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Specifies that reservations made by another user are to be modified. 
The <strong>username</strong> parameter is the OpenVMS username 
of the other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege to use this

The MODIFY SCRIPT command modifies the remark string for a specified 
VDE script in the VDE database. VDE 
only modifies the script of the specified type that belongs to the 
default development stream.

<p>
You must specify a script-type qualifier to select the script you want 
modified. See the description of the CREATE SCRIPT command for an 
explanation of the different types of scripts and how scripts are 
selected using script-type qualifiers. You must also specify the script 
segment number unless the default value applies.

<p>
Keywords used within scripts are documented in <a href="vde_manual_025.html#vde_script_keywords">Script Keywords</a>, while 
script functions are in <a href="vde_manual_026.html#vde_script_functions">Script Functions</a>, and script types are in

<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>MODIFY STEP step-mod-name = mod-name [, mod-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>step-mod-name</h3>
The name of the module that is compiled or linked by the build step. 
This name consists of a module name and a type name separated by a 
period (such as MOD1.PAS) and optionally may include a facility name 
enclosed in square brackets (such as [FACNAM]MOD1.PAS). The module name 
may not contain wildcard characters. If no facility name is specified, 
the default facility is assumed. This module must already exist in the 
database and it must already have build-dependency information.
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of a module that you want to add or remove as an input or 
output for the build step. This name consists of a module name and a 
type name (for example, MOD1.OBJ) and may include a facility name 
enclosed in square brackets (for example, [FACNAM]MOD1.OBJ). If no 
facility name is specified, the default facility is assumed.

<p>
You can add or remove many input or output modules by specifying 
wildcard characters in any component of the module name. The percent 
sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position it 
occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. Those modules whose names match the wildcard 
pattern are added to or removed from the build step.

<p>
If the output module you specify does not already exist in the 
database, the MODIFY STEP command adds it to the database. Input 
modules, however, must already be defined in the database. Also, you 
cannot specify a source module as an output from a build step.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
To be able to perform minimal system builds, VDE records all 
inputs and outputs for each build step. This information is known as 
&quot;build dependency information.&quot; Normally, VDE 
collects build dependency information automatically when you perform 
system builds. For some build steps, however, this is not possible and 
you must use the CREATE STEP command to enter the build dependency 
information into the VDE database.

<p>
The MODIFY STEP command is normally used to edit build step definitions 
created with the CREATE STEP command. The MODIFY STEP command allows 
you to change build dependency information in the VDE 
database by adding or removing individual input and output modules.

<p>
Build dependency information is always created in the default 
development stream. To modify a build step definition for use in more 
than one development stream, you must use the MODIFY STEP command for 
each stream. For each stream, first enter the SET STREAM command to set 
the development stream, then enter the MODIFY STEP command to modify 
the build dependency information in the VDE database.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ADD (default)</h3>
<h3>/REMOVE</h3>
Controls whether the modules specified in the parameter list are added 
to or removed from the build-step definition. The /ADD qualifier adds 
the specified modules to the build step. The /REMOVE qualifier removes 
the specified modules from the build step. To set the default for the 
command as a whole, specify the qualifier after the MODIFY STEP 
keywords. To override that default for a single module, specify the 
qualifier after the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter you choose to 
add to or remove from the build step. If you do not specify one of 
these qualifiers, modules are added to the build step.

<p>
Of /ADD and /REMOVE, /ADD is the default.
<h3>/COMPILE (default)</h3>
<h3>/COPY</h3>
<h3>/LINK</h3>
Specifies whether the build step to be modified is a compile step, copy 
step, or link step. /COMPILE modifies a compile step, /COPY modifies a 
copy step, and /LINK modifies a link step for the specified module.

<p>
Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
<h3>/CONFIRM (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the 
build-step definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to print a message asking whether you want the build 
step modified. If you answer YES (or Y), the build-step definition is 
modified. If you answer NO (or N), the build-step definition is not 
modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier also causes VDE to ask you 
to confirm the addition or removal of each individual input or output 
module for the build step. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to modify the build-step definition without asking for 
confirmation.
<h3>/INPUT (default)</h3>
<h3>/OUTPUT</h3>
Specifies whether the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters are inputs 
to or outputs from the build step. The /INPUT qualifier designates the 
specified modules as inputs in the build-step definition. The /OUTPUT 
qualifier designates the specified modules as outputs in the build-step 
definition. To set the default for the command as a whole, specify the 
qualifier after the MODIFY STEP keywords. To override that default for 
a single module, specify the qualifier after the 
<strong>mod-name</strong> parameter you choose to mark as an input or 
output.

<p>
Of /INPUT and /OUTPUT, /INPUT is the default.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the build step 
definition is modified in the database. The /LOG qualifier causes the 
messages to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The 
messages indicate that the build step has been modified, that the 
specified modules have been added to or removed from the step, and that 
the database transaction has committed successfully.

The /CMS_CLASS qualifier interacts with the /INIT_CMS_CLASS and 
/NOINIT_CMS_CLASS qualifiers; see the descriptions of these qualifiers 
for details.

<p>
You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use these qualifiers.

<h3>/CONFERENCE=file-spec</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFERENCE</h3>
Specifies whether a Notes conference for replacement information
<a name="index_x_472"></a>
should be associated with the new stream. The /CONFERENCE qualifier 
specifies that the notes conference given by the 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter should be used to record all 
replacements into the stream. VDE then enters a new note 
into the conference for each queued or immediate replacement and a 
reply to
<a name="index_x_473"></a>
that note when a queued replacement is actually performed. The 
/NOCONFERENCE qualifier specifies that no such notes conference should 
be used.

<p>
Under normal circumstances, just the file name should be specified in 
the <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter. VDE applies 
defaults to the notes conference file specification based on the 
translation of the logical name VDE$NOTES_LIBRARY.
<a name="index_x_474"></a>
<a name="index_x_475"></a>
If this logical name is not defined, the default file specification 
&quot;NOTES$LIBRARY:.NOTE&quot; is applied to the 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
stream definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to print a message for the specified stream giving the 
name of the stream and asking whether you want to modify that stream. 
If you answer YES (or Y), its attributes are modified. If you answer NO 
(or N), its attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier 
causes VDE to modify the attributes of the stream without 
asking for confirmation.
<h3>/DELETE</h3>
<h3>/NODELETE (default)</h3>
Sets or clears the <strong>delete</strong> attribute for the stream. 
This attribute allows the stream to be deleted with the DELETE STREAM 
command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete attribute so that the 
stream can be deleted. The /NODELETE qualifier clears the delete 
attribute so that the stream cannot be deleted without first resetting 
the attribute. You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use these 
qualifiers.
<a name="index_x_476"></a>
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the stream definitions 
are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the stream 
definitions have been modified and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/INIT_CMS_CLASS</h3>
<h3>/NOINIT_CMS_CLASS</h3>
Specifies whether VDE initializes the CMS class for the 
stream in each facility's CMS library when the /CMS_CLASS qualifier 
specifies that such
<a name="index_x_477"></a>
a class should be maintained. /INIT_CMS_CLASS sets an attribute that 
causes the MODIFY STREAM command with the /CMS_CLASS qualifier to 
create and populate a CMS class with the same name as the stream in 
each facility. /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS clears this attribute so that MODIFY 
STREAM does not create or populate such CMS classes. /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS 
is useful for very large VDE libraries where the 
initialization of CMS classes take an excessively long time. For such 
libraries, it is better to use a separate command procedure to 
initialize the desired CMS classes; such a procedure can process the 
facilities of your library in parallel for faster completion.

<p>
You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use these qualifiers.

<h3>/NAME=stream-name</h3>
Specifies a new name for the stream. The stream name can be up to 39 
characters long and must follow normal VDE name syntax, 
except that a stream name can contain periods (.) . After the stream 
name has been changed, you must refer to the stream by its new name in 
all subsequent VDE commands. The old name is lost from the 
database.
<h3>/NOSUCCESSOR[=(succ-name [, succ-name...])]</h3>
Specifies streams that should no longer be successors to the stream 
being modified. A successor to a stream is another stream to which 
source changes are propagated by the REPLACE command. Each 
<strong>succ-name</strong> parameter specifies the name of a stream 
that is currently a successor to the stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter, but that no longer should be a 
successor. The specified streams are thus removed from the list of 
successors stored in the database.

<p>
If the list of <strong>succ-name</strong> parameters is omitted, all 
current successors of the stream being modified are removed from that 
stream's successor list.
