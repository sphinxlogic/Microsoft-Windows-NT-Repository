If you also use the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier, the /PROCESS_COUNT 
qualifier states the total number of build-job processes to create. In 
that case, the process-counts attached to the 
<strong>queue-name</strong> parameters on the /QUEUE qualifier are used 
as scaling factors to distribute the build-job processes among the 
queues proportionally. For example, if you specify queues HI_BATCH, 
HO_BATCH(3) and a total process count of eight, then two processes are 
submitted to queue HI_BATCH and six processes to queue HO_BATCH. If the 
total process count does not divide evenly into the sum of the scaling 
factors, the remaining processes are allocated to the queues in the 
order the queues are listed. If the total process count is nine, for 
example, the one extra process is allocated to queue HI_BATCH because 
HI_BATCH is listed first.

<blockquote>
The STOP BUILD_JOB command stops the most recently created build job 
for each stream that matches a specified stream name. When a build job 
is stopped, it is marked as stopped in the database. Any processes 
executing the build job stop executing as soon as they read the new job 
status from the database. This command stops a build job permanently: 
it can never be restarted. Use the STOP BUILD_JOB command to stop a 
running build job or to mark an existing build job as stopped (even if 
it has never been started). After the most recent build job for a 
stream is stopped, you are free to create a new build job for that 
stream because the stopped job cannot execute and interfere with the 
new job.

<p>
You cannot stop a build job that has already been stopped or that has 
already completed execution. Because such jobs cannot execute again, 
there is no need to stop them.

the new job status from the database. A suspended build job is not 
permanently stopped, however: it can be restarted with a START 
BUILD_JOB command. Use the SUSPEND BUILD_JOB command to temporarily 
stop a running build job; you can restart the suspended job later or 
restart it on different batch queues. You should also suspend a build 
job if one of the nodes it is running on fails; suspending a build job 
and then restarting it allows the build steps that were running on the 
failed node to reexecute.

<p>
You can also unreserve multiple modules by specifying the name of a

the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group name, each module that 
is a member of the group is unreserved.

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
module unreserved. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for each module that you specify asking whether you 
want to unreserve that module. If you answer YES (or Y), the 
reservation is canceled. If you answer NO (or N), the reservation is 
not canceled. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
unreserve each specified module without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=res-ident</h3>
Specifies the reservation that is canceled. This qualifier is required 
when you have multiple reservations of the same module in the default 
stream. The <strong>res-ident</strong> parameter is the reservation 
identifier of the reservation to be replaced. The reservation 
identifier is a small integer value or the identifier you specified 
when reserving the module. Use the SHOW RESERVATION command to 
determine the reservation identifier of each reservation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each module is 
unreserved. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed and 
the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that each 
module has been unreserved and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/SESSION=session-name</h3>
Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations 
together, typically to group all modules related to a particular source 
code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all component 
modules reserved to be treated as a single entity for subsequent 
replacement operations. A session also allows additional modules to be 
reserved and incorporated into an existing session at a later time.

<p>
The /SESSION qualifier causes all module reservations comprising the 
<strong>session-name</strong> reservation session are canceled, and 
that the session be deleted from the VDE database. If you 
specify this qualifier, you cannot specify <strong>mod-name</strong> 
parameters on the UNRESERVE command.

<p>
Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE, MODIFY 
SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL SESSION 
commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on a queued-replacement 
stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be combined into the same session.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that the modules be unreserved from the development stream 
given by the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. If this qualifier 
is omitted, the modules are unreserved from the default development 
stream. If this qualifier is omitted and no default stream is defined, 
VDE prompts you for the stream name.
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Specifies that another user's reservation is to be canceled. The 
<strong>username</strong> parameter is the OpenVMS username of 
the other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege to use this 
qualifier.

the wildcard pattern are verified.

<p>
If you omit the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter, VDE 
verifies generations for all modules in the default facility.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The VERIFY GENERATION command verifies that the generations you specify 
actually exist in the CMS libraries belonging to your VDE 
library. This
<a name="index_x_836"></a>
command should be used if there is reason to think that one or more CMS 
libraries in the VDE library may not be consistent with the 
VDE database. Such a situation can arise any time you have 
had to restore the VDE library's database from back-up files 
or its CMS libraries from back-up
<a name="index_x_837"></a>
tapes. Provided you have enabled journalling, the VDE 
database can be fully recovered after a failure up to and including the 
last completed database transaction before the failure. However, the 
contents of the associated CMS libraries cannot be recovered past the 
last available back-up. If you back up your disks daily, the CMS 
libraries may thus be as much as a day out of date. As a result, the 
CMS libraries may be missing generations created by REPLACE or PERFORM 
REPLACEMENT commands that were entered after that last back-up, while 
the VDE database contains up-to-date information about those 
generations.

<p>
The VERIFY GENERATION command therefore assumes that the VDE 
database contains correct information about what generations should be 
found in the CMS libraries for your VDE library. If it finds 
any differences between the generations that the database says ought to 
exist and the generations that actually exist in the CMS libraries, 
VDE prints a message for each such generation. Optionally, 
VDE can also print a message for each generation that was 
correctly found.

<p>
If you specify the /RECOVER qualifier, the VERIFY GENERATION command 
will attempt to recover any missing generations. If the missing 
generations were created by REPLACE commands and if the replacements 
were queued, VDE retrieves the text of each missing 
generation from the staging area for the queued replacement that 
created the generation.
<a name="index_x_838"></a>
<a name="index_x_839"></a>
The retrieved text is then inserted into the CMS library. For immediate 
replacements, VDE does not maintain staging areas, but if 
you have a file that contains the text of a missing generation, you can 
specify that the missing generation be recovered from that file. Using 
either the VDE staging areas or files you explicitly 
specify, the /RECOVER qualifier thus allows you to repair any 
inconsistencies between the VDE database and its CMS 
libraries.
<a name="index_x_840"></a>

<p>
The VERIFY GENERATION command is usually used with wildcard characters 
in the module name parameters because you normally want to verify all 
generations in a specific facility (if the CMS library for that 
facility was restored from a back-up tape) or all generations for all 
facilities (if your whole disk was restored). To speed up the 
verification, you can use the /SINCE qualifier to verify and recover 
only those generations created since the back-up date for the CMS 
libraries.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/GENERATION=gen-expr</h3>
Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression given 
by the <strong>gen-expr</strong> parameter be verified. When you use 
this qualifier, you would normally not use wildcard characters in the 
module name parameter. If you specify an asterisk (*) for the 
<strong>gen-expr</strong> parameter or if you omit the entire 
qualifier, VDE verifies all generations for each specified 
module.
<h3>/LOG</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG (default)</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed for successfully verified 
generations. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The log messages for generations that are not 
successfully verified are always printed and are not affected by these 
qualifiers.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file-spec</h3>
Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file. The 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter specifies the name of the file. 
VDE creates a new file with that name, directs the command's 
print output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this 
qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
<h3>/RECOVER[=file-spec]</h3>
Specifies that each generation that is found in the VDE 
database but is missing in the corresponding CMS library should be 
recovered into
<a name="index_x_841"></a>
the CMS library. If you omit the <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter, 
VDE recovers each missing generation by taking its text from 
the staging area for the queued replacement that created the 
generation, provided such a staging area exists. You should omit the 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter when you want to recover all 
missing generations for a given set of facilities and those generations 
are available from staging areas.

<p>
If you specify the <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter, VDE 
recovers each missing generation by taking its text from the file 
specified by that parameter. If the parameter specifies a directory 
name without a file name, VDE assumes that the file has the 
same name as the module being recovered. When you use the 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter, you would normally also use the 
/GENERATION qualifier to identify the specific generation to recover 
and you would omit wildcard characters in the module name parameter. 
You should use the <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter when you want 
to recover an individual module generation that cannot be found in 
VDE's staging areas.

<p>
<strong>This qualifier requires the PERFREP privilege.</strong>
<a name="index_x_842"></a>
<h3>/SINCE=date-time</h3>
Verifies (and if requested, recovers) only those generations created on 
or after the specified date and time. The date and time can be stated 
in the standard OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the 
following keywords: YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space 
to separate the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire 
date-time string in double quotes. For further information about 
specifying OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.

<p>
This example verifies all generations in facility FACIL to make sure 
that each such generation is found in the CMS library for that 
facility. The
<a name="index_x_843"></a>
/LOG qualifier causes VDE to print log messages for the 
generations that are successfully verified as well as those that are 
missing. In this case, generation 2 of B.REQ is not found in the CMS 
library and the whole CMS element for module C.B32 is missing. The 
summary statistics indicate that seven generations were successfully 
verified and two were not.
