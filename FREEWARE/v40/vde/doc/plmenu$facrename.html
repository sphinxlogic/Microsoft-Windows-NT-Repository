<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The FACRENAME command is used to change the name of an existing CMS 
class name within a CMS library. This utility performs some 
verification before attempting to rename the specified CMS class to 
minimize the possibility for errors.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>library-spec</h3>
  Specifies the CMS library that is to be acted on. This specification 
  can contain wildcards, but it must be a valid CMS library directory 
  specification (i.e. VMS$:[YELLOW_TEST.CMS]). An example of a wildcarded 
  specification would be: VMS$:[Y*.CMS]. This specification would process 
  all libraries that start with the letter "Y".
<h3>old-name</h3>
  Specifies the CMS class name that is to be renamed.
<h3>new-name</h3>
  Specifies the CMS class name that "old-name" is to be renamed to.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Command Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/LOG=(log-type[,log-type,...])</h3>
  Specifies what type of logging the user wants. The default is that the 
  user will only see messages from the utility pertaining to the 
  libraries being processed or skipped. The list of acceptable log types 
  is:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]ALL - Log all messages
  <li>[NO]LIBRARY - Log only message pertaining to libraries
  <li>[NO]CMS - Log error messages recieved from CMS
</ul>

<h3>/PROCESS=(attribute[,attribute,...])</h3>
  The PROCESS qualifier is used to identify what libraries are to be 
  processed. Some libraries have special attributes associated with them, 
  VMSCMS$NO_PROPAGATE.FLAG is an example of an attribute. This attribute 
  indicates that this library is not to have any code propagation 
  performed within it. The process qualifier is used to selectively 
  process or skip libraries marked with certain attributes. The list of 
  acceptable attributes is:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]ALL - process all libraries no matter what attribute it may have
  <li>[NO]ARCHIVEDFACILITY - process all archived libraries
  <li>[NO]FLAGFREE - process libraries with not attributes
  <li>[NO]NOPROPAGATE - process libraries marked no propagate
</ul>

<h3>/REMARK="remark string"</h3>
  Indicates that the utility should also change the remark associated 
  with the new class name. Specifying a remark string will result in the 
  new class name having a new remark. The default action is for the new 
  class name to retain the original remark entered for the old class name.
