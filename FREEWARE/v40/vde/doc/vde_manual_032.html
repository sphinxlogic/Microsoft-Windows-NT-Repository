<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>

<h3>SHOW REPLACEMENT [rep-name [, rep-name...]] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>rep-name</h3>
The name of a queued replacement whose attributes are to be displayed. 
You can display more than one replacement using wildcard characters in 
the replacement name. The percent sign (%) in a replacement name 
matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. Those replacements whose names match the wildcard pattern are 
displayed.

<p>
Do not specify the <strong>rep-name</strong> parameter if you use the 
/IDENTIFICATION qualifier.

<p>
If you specify neither a replacement name nor the /IDENTIFICATION 
qualifier, VDE displays all replacements in the 
VDE database.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW REPLACEMENT command 
displays either a one-line summary for each specified queued replacement
<a name="index_x_799"></a>
or all database information for each replacement. The command can also 
show the total number of replacements that match a specified 
replacement name.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ACCEPTED</h3>
<h3>/REJECTED</h3>
<h3>/IN_REVIEW</h3>
<h3>/NOT_REVIEWED</h3>
Specify that only those queued replacements with certain review 
statuses be displayed. The /ACCEPTED qualifier displays those 
replacements accepted by all reviewers. The /REJECTED qualifier 
displays those replacements rejected by at least one reviewer. The 
/IN_REVIEW qualifier displays those replacements that are accepted by 
at least one reviewer but are not yet accepted or rejected by all 
reviewers. The /NOT_REVIEWED qualifier displays those replacements not 
accepted or rejected by any reviewers.

<p>
If one or more of these qualifiers are specified, those replacements 
that have one of the specified status values are displayed. These 
qualifiers can thus be used in combination to show replacements of 
several different status values. If all of these qualifiers are 
omitted, VDE displays all replacements regardless of status.
<h3>/BEFORE=date-time</h3>
Displays only those replacements queued before the specified date and 
time. The date and time can be stated in the standard OpenVMS 
date-time format or can be one of the following keywords: YESTERDAY, 
TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate the date from the 
time, remember to enclose the entire date-time string in double quotes. 
For further information about specifying OpenVMS date-time 
format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
<h3>/BRIEF (default)</h3>
<h3>/FULL</h3>
<h3>/MODULE</h3>
Determines the information that is displayed about each replacement. 
The /BRIEF qualifier displays a one-line summary for each replacement. 
The /FULL qualifier displays all available database information for 
each replacement. The /MODULE qualifier displays the replacement name, 
the staging directory, the module list, and the remark string for each 
replacement.

<p>
Of /BRIEF, /FULL and /MODULE, /BRIEF is the default.
<h3>/HISTORY</h3>
Specifies that replacement history be displayed. Replacement history 
consists of all past replacements, both immediate and queued, that have 
already been performed; it does not include currently queued 
replacements. Replacement history allows you to see a historical record 
of all past modifications to your software system. This information 
complements the historical information available from the SHOW 
GENERATION command. When used with the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, the 
/HISTORY qualifier displays a list of all past replacements in 
chronological order.

<p>
If you omit the /HISTORY qualifier, VDE displays currently 
queued replacements only.
<h3>/MODULE</h3>
Displays all modules comprising the replacement.
<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=id-range</h3>
Specifies that the replacements with the unique Replacement Ids given 
by the <strong>id-range</strong> parameter be displayed. Do not specify 
the <strong>rep-name</strong> parameter when you use this qualifier.

<p>
VDE assigns a unique Replacement Id to each immediate or 
queued replacement into the VDE library. VDE 
assigns Replacement Ids in chronological order so that the first 
replacement into the library has Id value 1, the next has Id value 2, 
and so on. When you use this qualifier, all replacements that fit your 
other selection criteria and that have Id values in the range given by 
the <strong>id-range</strong> parameter are displayed in ascending 
order by Replacement Id. This is the same as chronological order.

<p>
The <strong>id-range</strong> parameter can be a single integer value, 
a range of integers, or a wildcard character. If the parameter is a 
single integer (for example, /IDENT=5), VDE displays the 
replacement with that Replacement Id. If the parameter is a range of 
integers (specified as two integers separated by a colon as in 
/IDENT=3:5), VDE displays the replacements with Ids in that 
range. Finally, if the <strong>id-range</strong> parameter is the 
asterisk wildcard character (as in /IDENT=*), VDE displays 
all replacements. To be displayed, each replacement must also fit all 
selection criteria that you specify with other qualifiers.

<p>
If you specify a zero or negative number in the 
<strong>id-range</strong> parameter, that number is relative to the 
largest Replacement Id value for the VDE library (the latest 
replacement). For example, if the latest replacement has Replacement Id 
250, then /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=250 and /IDENT=--1 is 
equivalent to /IDENT=249.

<p>
The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier is especially useful when used with the 
/HISTORY qualifier because then it displays all past replacements in 
chronological order.
<h3>/IN_REVIEW</h3>
Displays all replacement component modules presently undergoing review.
<h3>/NOT_REVIEWED</h3>
Displays all replacement component modules presently unreviewed.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file-spec</h3>
Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file. The 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter specifies the name of the file. 
VDE creates a new file with that name, directs the command's 
print output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this 
qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
<h3>/REJECTED</h3>
Displays all modules comprising the replacement that have been rejected.
<h3>/REVIEWER[=username]</h3>
Specifies that only those replacements for which a given user is a 
reviewer be displayed. The <strong>username</strong> parameter gives 
the OpenVMS username of that reviewer. If you omit the 
<strong>username</strong> parameter, only those replacements for which 
you are a reviewer are displayed. If you omit the whole qualifier, 
replacements for all reviewers are displayed.
<h3>/SINCE=date-time</h3>
Displays only those replacements queued at or after the specified date 
and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard 
OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following 
keywords: YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate 
the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time string 
in double quotes. For further information about specifying 
OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
<h3>/STREAM[=stream-name]</h3>
Specifies that only those queued replacements that are for the 
development stream given by the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter 
be displayed. If the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter is omitted, 
replacements for the default development stream are displayed. If the 
whole qualifier is omitted, replacements for all streams are displayed.
<h3>/TOTAL</h3>
Shows the total number of replacements that match each parameter. Other 
information about the individual replacements is not shown. A separate 
count is provided for each <strong>rep-name</strong> parameter. 
Wildcard characters are usually used in the parameter when using this 
qualifier.
<h3>/USERNAME[=username]</h3>
Specifies that only those replacements queued by a given user be 
displayed. The <strong>username</strong> parameter gives the 
OpenVMS username of that user. If you omit the 
<strong>username</strong> parameter, only your own replacements are 
displayed. If you omit the whole qualifier, replacements queued by all 
users are displayed.

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>SHOW RESERVATION [mod-name [, mod-name...]] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of a source module whose reservation is to be displayed. A 
module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square 
brackets, a module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period 
(for example, [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility name is omitted, the 
default facility is assumed. If the type name is omitted, reservations 
for all modules with the specified name in the given facility are 
displayed.

<p>
You can display reservations for more than one module using wildcard 
characters in any of the three components of the module name. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. Reservations for the source modules whose names 
match the wildcard pattern are displayed.

<p>
You can also display reservations for multiple modules by specifying 
the name of a source group instead of a module name. Source groups are 
created with the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group name, 
each reservation for a module that is a member of the group is 
displayed.

<p>
If you omit the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameter, VDE 
displays all module reservations for the default facility.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The SHOW RESERVATION command displays all existing reservations and 
queued reservation requests for a specified set of modules or for all 
modules in the default facility. A module reservation is created with 
the RESERVE command and gives you the exclusive right to modify that 
module. A reservation is terminated with the REPLACE or UNRESERVE 
command.

<p>
By default, the SHOW RESERVATION command shows reservations for all 
development streams, but the /STREAM qualifier lets you see only those 
reservations for a certain stream. Likewise, by default, the command 
shows reservations for all users, but the /USERNAME qualifier lets you 
see only those reservations that belong to a specific user, such as 
yourself. Other qualifiers, such as /BEFORE and /SINCE, lets you 
additionally restrict the set of reservations displayed.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/BEFORE=date-time</h3>
Displays only those reservations created before the specified date and 
time. The date and time can be stated in the standard OpenVMS 
date-time format or can be one of the following keywords: YESTERDAY, 
TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate the date from the 
time, remember to enclose the entire date-time string in double quotes. 
For further information about specifying OpenVMS date-time 
format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
<h3>/BRIEF (default)</h3>
<h3>/FULL</h3>
Determines the type of information displayed about each reservation. 
The /BRIEF qualifier displays the reservation identifier, the name of 
the reserved module, the reserving user, the date of the reservation, 
and the stream in which the module is reserved. This display normally 
fits on one line. The /FULL qualifier displays all database information 
about the reservation; this display requires several lines per 
reservation.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file-spec</h3>
Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file. The 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter specifies the name of the file. 
VDE creates a new file with that name, directs the command's 
print output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this 
qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
<h3>/SESSION=session-name</h3>
Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations 
together, typically to group all modules related to a particular source 
code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all component 
modules reserved to be treated as a single entity for subsequent 
replacement operations. A session also allows additional modules to be 
reserved and incorporated into an existing session at a later time.

<p>
Displays only those reservations that are members of the reservation 
session given by the <strong>session-name</strong> parameter. If you 
specify this qualifier, do not specify <strong>mod-name</strong> 
parameters on the SHOW RESERVATION command.

<p>
Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE, MODIFY 
SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL SESSION 
commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on a queued-replacement 
stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be combined into the same session.
<h3>/SINCE=date-time</h3>
Displays only those reservations created after the specified date and 
time. The date and time can be stated in the standard OpenVMS 
date-time format or can be one of the following keywords: YESTERDAY, 
TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate the date from the 
time, remember to enclose the entire date-time string in double quotes. 
For further information about specifying OpenVMS date-time 
format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
<h3>/STREAM[=stream-name]</h3>
Displays only those reservations that were created for the development 
stream given by the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. If you omit 
the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter, VDE only 
displays reservations created for your current default stream. If you 
omit the whole qualifier, VDE displays reservations for all 
streams.
<h3>/TOTAL</h3>
Shows the total number of reservations that match the specified module 
names and usernames. Other information about the individual 
reservations is not shown. A separate count is provided for each 
<strong>mod-name</strong> parameter.
<h3>/USERNAME[=username]</h3>
Specifies the OpenVMS username of a user whose reservations are 
to be shown. If this qualifier is specified, only that user's 
reservations are shown. If the <strong>username</strong> parameter is 
omitted, only your own reservations are shown. If the whole qualifier 
is omitted, reservations for all users are shown.
