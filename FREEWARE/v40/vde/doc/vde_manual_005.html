<h2>Format</h2>

<h3>COPY mod-name [, mod-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
Specifies a module to be copied using a copy script. The module name 
consist of an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, a 
module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period, such as 
[FACIL]MOD2.H. If no facility name is specified, the default facility 
is assumed. If no type name is specified, all modules of the specified 
module name in the given facility are copied.

<p>
You can copy more than one module by using wildcard characters in any 
of the three components of the module name. The percent sign (%) in a 
name matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. VDE copies those modules whose names match the 
wildcard pattern.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The COPY command copies a module the same way it is copied in a build 
job. The COPY command retrieves the copy script for each specified 
module and generates a DCL command file from the script. The command 
then executes the command file in a subprocess.

<p>
A copy step moves a module into the directory or other location where 
other build steps later expect to find it. For example, copy steps move 
INCLUDE files from delta files into clear-copy files in the 
subdirectories where other build steps will later access them. Unlike a 
compile or link step, a copy step does not transform one set of modules 
into a different set of modules; it only copies a single module from 
one form or location to another.

<p>
The COPY command can be used to perform a copy step without starting a 
build job. It is often used to test copy scripts.

<p>
The COPY command only operates on modules that have a generation in the 
current stream (the default stream or the stream specified with the 
/STREAM qualifier). In addition, it only operates on source modules 
unless you specify the type name in the <strong>mod-name</strong> 
parameter without wildcard characters. In other words, unless you 
explicitly specify a derived-module file extension, the command assumes
<a name="index_x_149"></a>
that you only want to copy source modules.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the copy step executes. 
The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the /NOLOG 
qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the copy step 
has completed, either successfully or with errors, and that the 
dependency information for the step has not been updated in the 
VDE database. (Copy steps do not normally update dependency 
information since the only input and output to the step is the module 
being copied.)
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that the modules be copied for the stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. If this qualifier is omitted, 
the modules are copied for the default stream.

This example performs the copy action for module [CODE]A.REQ. The copy

file and leaves it in clear-copy form in the [.SRC] subdirectory for 
facility CODE and the default development stream. There it is available 
to future compile steps. The output from the copy script is displayed 
on the terminal as shown. The final log messages show that the copy

<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>ctx-name</h3>
The name of the context to be created. This name may be up to 39 
characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A &quot;context&quot; specifies defaults for VDE sessions. 
When you create a context using the CREATE CONTEXT command, you specify 
the name of the context, the associated development stream, and the 
associated facility.

<p>
To apply the defaults associated with a context, specify the context 
name as a parameter to the SET CONTEXT command. To set a particular 
context as the default context for use when you issue the SET LIBRARY 
command, use the SET CONTEXT/DEFAULT command to mark a particular 
context as the default context.

<p>
There are two kinds of contexts available:

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>private context</strong> is available to and only 
  visible to the user who created it.
  <li>the <strong>public context</strong> is available to all users of 
  the current VDE library.
</ul>

You do not need special VDE privileges to create a private 
context, but you must have the VDE CRECTX privilege to create 
a public context. While
<a name="index_x_154"></a>
a private context can have the same name as a public context, neither 
two private contexts nor two public contexts can share the same name.

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ARCHITECTURE</h3>
<strong>Under Construction...</strong>
<h3>/FACILITY=facil-name</h3>
<h3>/NOFACILITY</h3>
The /FACILITY qualifier specifies the default facility for a context 
established with the SET CONTEXT command. The default facility is the 
facility that is assumed when the facility name is omitted from a 
module name. The /NOFACILITY qualifier specifies that the default 
facility established by the context is null. If you omit both 
qualifiers, the current default facility becomes the facility 
associated with the new context.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after a new context is 
created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that each new 
context has been created and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/PRIVATE (default)</h3>
<h3>/PUBLIC</h3>
Specifies whether a private or a public context is created. The 
/PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to create a context that is 
private to you. The /PUBLIC qualifier causes VDE to create a 
context that is available to all users of the library. You must have 
the CRECTX privilege to use the /PUBLIC qualifier.

<p>
Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, the former is the default.
<a name="index_x_155"></a>
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new context. The quoted 
remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the new context that you want stored in the 
VDE database. Typically the remark describes the function or 
purpose of the context.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
<h3>/NOSTREAM</h3>
The /STREAM qualifier specifies that the indicated development stream 
becomes the default stream when the context is established with the SET 
CONTEXT command. The /NOSTREAM qualifier specifies that the default 
stream established by the context is null. If you omit both qualifiers, 
the current default stream becomes the stream associated with the new 
context.

<h3>CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command creates the directory tree on disk 
for a VDE library's delta files, for a development stream, or 
for a facility. You use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command only if you 
deferred directory creation by using the /DEFER qualifier on a CREATE 
LIBRARY, CREATE STREAM, or CREATE FACILITY command. The /DEFER 
qualifier prevents these three commands from creating the disk 
directories they normally would create. You then have the opportunity 
to override the normal directory-creation rules within the SET 
DIRECTORY commands. After entering your SET DIRECTORY commands, you 
enter the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create disk directories 
according to the rules you specified with your SET DIRECTORY commands.

<p>
Directories are created using the protection setting of the parent 
directory for the UIC group and world access, any applicable ACE 
entries from the parent directory, and allowing full system and owner 
access.

<a name="index_x_159"></a>
<a name="index_x_160"></a>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/BRIEF (default)</h3>
<h3>/FULL</h3>
Determines how many log messages are displayed when VDE 
creates new disk directories. The /BRIEF qualifier only displays log 
messages for the stream or delta-file root directory and for each 
facility root directory. The /FULL qualifier displays a log message for 
every directory VDE creates, including all facility 
subdirectories. (The facility subdirectories are the most numerous 
directories.) These qualifiers have no effect if you use the /NOLOG 
qualifier.

<p>
Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
<h3>/DELTA_FILES</h3>
<h3>/STAGING</h3>
<h3>/STREAM (default)</h3>
Determines whether directories are created for the VDE 
library's delta files, for its staging areas, or for the default 
development stream. The /DELTA_FILES qualifier specifies that disk 
directories be created for the VDE library's delta files. 
These are the directories that hold CMS libraries. The /STAGING 
qualifier specifies that the root
<a name="index_x_161"></a>
directory be created for the library's staging directories. Staging 
directories are temporary holding areas for files that are replaced 
into the library with queued replacements. The /STREAM qualifier
<a name="index_x_162"></a>
<a name="index_x_163"></a>
specifies that disk directories be created for the default development 
stream.

<p>
If you specify the /DELTA_FILES qualifier but not the /FROM_CMS_LIBRARY 
qualifier, VDE creates the CMS library for each
<a name="index_x_164"></a>
facility affected by this command. If you specify the /STREAM 
qualifier, VDE runs the default stream's new-stream script 
for each facility affected by this command, provided such a script is 
defined. Depending on how it is defined, this script may populate the 
stream's facility-specific directories with source modules and other 
files.

<p>
Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
<h3>/FACILITY=fac-name</h3>
Specifies that disk directories be created only for the facility 
specified by the <strong>fac-name</strong> parameter. If this qualifier 
is omitted, directories are created for all facilities, either for 
delta files or for the default stream.

<p>
You can create directory trees for multiple facilities by using 
wildcard characters in the <strong>fac-name</strong> parameter. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. VDE creates directory trees for those 
facilities whose names match the wildcard pattern.
<h3>/FROM_CMS_LIBRARY[=date-time]</h3>
Specifies that the delta-file root directory for each facility covered 
by the current CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command already contains a CMS 
library
<a name="index_x_165"></a>
and that VDE should enter all modules and module generations 
present in that CMS library into the current VDE database. 
This qualifier, which VDE also accepts on the CREATE FACILITY 
command, gives you a way to automatically populate a VDE 
library with modules from an existing CMS library.

<p>
If you specify the optional <strong>date-time</strong> parameter, 
VDE additionally retrieves all reservations from the CMS 
library that were created since the date and time given by that 
parameter. VDE prints warning messages for any reservations 
created earlier than this time and for any reservations whose stream 
(CMS class) cannot be ascertained. If you omit the 
<strong>date-time</strong> parameter, VDE does not retrieve 
reservations from the CMS library, only modules and generations.

<p>
If this qualifier is omitted, VDE creates a new CMS library 
in each delta-file facility root directory it creates. This qualifier 
has no effect unless you also use the /DELTA_FILES qualifier.

<p>
If this qualifer is specified, all VDE streams <em>must</em> 
be created <em>prior</em> to issuing this command, and these stream 
names must match (a subset of) the CMS class names in use in the CMS 
libraries; these stream names must match the CMS classes to be uploaded 
from within the CMS library. In order to correctly establish the main 
and variant lines of descent and the correct CMS generation number 
sequence, all streams involved must be created with the appropriate 
/MAIN, /NOMAIN, /PARENT and /SUCCESSOR settings.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed when disk directories are 
created. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate the names of 
the disk directories that VDE creates. The /BRIEF and /FULL 
qualifiers control how many log messages are printed.

<p>
In this example, the CREATE FACILITY command creates a new facility 
NEWFACIL, but defers the creation of disk directories for that 
facility. A SET DIRECTORY command then specifies that directory 
[PROJDIR.NEW] should be the facility root directory for the default 
stream MAIN. Two CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE commands follow. The first one 
creates the delta-file root directory and CMS library for the facility. 
The second
<a name="index_x_169"></a>
one creates the default stream's directory tree for the facility. This 
directory tree consists of a facility root directory and four facility 
subdirectories. The /FULL qualifier causes VDE to prints log 
messages for all directories it creates for the facility; without this 
qualifier, VDE omits the subdirectory log messages.

<blockquote>
<p>
The CREATE STREAM command creates a new stream called V2.0, but defers 
creating the disk directory tree for that stream. The SET STREAM 
command makes V2.0 the default stream, and the SHOW LOCATION command 
shows that no directories are recorded in the VDE database 
for that stream. The SET DIRECTORY command specifies that directory 
[PROJDIR.VER_2] should be the root directory for the stream. The CREATE 
DIRECTORY_TREE command creates the full directory tree for stream V2.0. 
This directory tree includes the stream root directory specified by the 
SET DIRECTORY command, a facility root directory for each facility in 
the system, and several facility subdirectories for each facility. 
Because the /FULL qualifier is not specified, VDE only prints 
log messages for the stream and facility root directories, and not for 
the facility subdirectories.
