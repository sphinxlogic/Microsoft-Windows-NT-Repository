<p>
If you are the project leader for a stream, you must create new build 
streams from time to time so you can build OpenVMS for your 
release. You may also have to create the stream you are 
project-leading. This section tells you how to perform these operations.
<a name="index_x_255"></a>
<a name="index_x_256"></a>

<p>
Streams are classified into <strong>build</strong> streams, and into 
<strong>release</strong> streams. Build streams are used for builds and 
establish the files involved with each build, and are usually of 
interest only to those engineers directly involved with source code 
builds. Release streams are of general interest to all VDE or 
VSC users, as they are the streams used for managing source 
code development.

<a name="cre_bld_stream"><h2>5.7.1 Creating Build Streams</h2></a>

<p>
To create a build stream for the development stream that you project 
lead, you must perform two operations: Create the build stream in the 
VSC database and create a CMS class for that build stream. To 
create the build stream in the VSC database, use the CREATE 
STREAM command. If you are the project leader for stream BIRCH, for 
example, you could use the following command to create a build stream:
<a name="index_x_257"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ CREATE STREAM BIRCH_BUILD -
_VSC„  /PARENT=BIRCH /CMS_CLASS -
_VSC„  /REMARK="Build stream"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example creates build stream BIRCH_BUILD and specifies that its 
parent is stream BIRCH. This means that stream BIRCH_BUILD will be 
created with the same module generations as stream BIRCH currently has. 
Once you have created the new stream, the two streams can diverge; the 
next replacement into BIRCH, for example, will make it different from 
stream BIRCH_BUILD.

<p>
The CREATE STREAM command does not create a CMS class for the stream, 
but the /CMS_CLASS qualifier specifies that a CMS class for each 
facility should be maintained for the new stream as that stream is 
modified with future VSC commands (such as INSERT or DELETE 
GENERATION). How you create the CMS class initially is discussed 
shortly.
<a name="index_x_258"></a>

<p>
Specification of a remark is required; if you omit the /REMARK 
qualifier, VSC prompts you for a remark string.

<font color=black>
Specification of a remark for the new stream is required. Digital 
strongly recommends the remark indicate that the stream is a build 
stream. </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
For the OpenVMS VAX VDE library, the CREATE STREAM command 
takes about 20 minutes. You should run this command after you have 
performed all replacements that you want included in the build stream. 
It is best to run this command at less-busy times as it locks parts of 
the VSC database and can therefore prevent access by other 
users for various operations.

<p>
To create and populate a CMS class in each facility for the new stream, 
you must run the SYSBLDCOM$:POPULATE_LIBRARIES.COM command procedure. 
This procedure submits a separate batch job for each OpenVMS 
facility in order to populate the desired class as fast as possible. 
The whole operation is still time-consuming; it takes about four hours 
for the OpenVMS VAX library. To run this command procedure, enter the 
following command at DCL level:
<a name="index_x_259"></a>
<a name="index_x_260"></a>
<a name="index_x_261"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @SYSBLDCOM$:POPULATE_LIBRARIES.COM BIRCH_BUILD BIRCH
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command procedure should be run after normal working hours. While 
it runs, you cannot modify stream BIRCH by replacing modules or 
inserting generations into it. You must ensure that no PERFORM 
REPLACEMENT commands run that can affect stream BIRCH, directly or 
through change propagation. However, you can (and preferrably should) 
run the CREATE STREAM command for the new build stream at the same 
time. It is important that the VSC database is updated and 
the CMS classes are created at the same time so that they are 
consistent with each other.

<p>
If you already have an existing CMS class you want to reuse, you can 
use the
<a name="index_x_262"></a>
SYSBLDCOM$:POP_REUSED_CLASS.COM command procedure instead. Its 
invocation is similar to that of POPULATE_LIBRARIES; the comments in 
the procedure give the details.
<a name="index_x_263"></a>
<a name="index_x_264"></a>

<a name="cre_rel_stream"><h2>5.7.2 Creating Release Streams</h2></a>

<p>
To create a development stream for a new OpenVMS release (in 
other words, a stream that most OpenVMS developers will use to 
reserve and replace modules), you must make a number of decisions:

<ul>
  <li>decide what the parent stream will be. Preservation and continuity 
  of the mainline is particularly important to modules on the mainline. 
  Proper specification of stream parentage is of critical and central 
  importance when the /FROM_CMS_LIBRARY qualifer is to be used on any 
  subsequent CREATE FACILITY commands.
<a name="index_x_265"></a>
  <li>decide if the stream should become the latest stream on the 
  mainline, or if it should be treated as a variant branch and be located 
  somewhere off the mainline. Exactly <em>one</em> stream in the 
  VSC database <em>is</em> the mainline stream, while there can 
  be many streams feeding into the mainline stream---these other streams 
  are sometimes confusingly refered to as being &quot;on the 
  mainline&quot;.
  <li>Create the stream in the VSC database, create the CMS 
  class associated with it, and specify the stream's change propagation 
  behavior.
  <li>Decide if you want propogation of modules from the parent stream. 
  By default, such propogation is enabled.
  <li>You may also want to specify developers who should review 
  replacements or be notified of replacements going into the new stream.
</ul>

<p>
To create the stream, use the CREATE STREAM command, much the same as 
explained in <a href="vde_guide_008.html#cre_bld_stream">Section 5.7.1</a> for build streams. To create a new 
development stream MAPLE, for example, you might enter the following 
command:
<a name="index_x_266"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ CREATE STREAM MAPLE -
_VSC„  /OWNER=SMITH -
_VSC„  /PARENT=BIRCH /MAIN -
_VSC„  /CMS_CLASS /REPLACEMENT=QUEUE -
_VSC„  /REMARK="New-feature stream"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command specifies that the parent of the new mainline stream MAPLE 
is the existing stream BIRCH. The newly created MAPLE mainline stream 
initially inherits all current generations from the parent BIRCH stream.

<p>
The use of the /OWNER qualifier specifies the owner of the new stream; 
this person is typically the stream's project leader. If you use this 
qualifier, developers can later use the SHOW STREAM command to 
determine the stream's owner.

<p>
The /MAIN qualifier causes the new stream to become the <em>last</em> 
stream on the main line of descent, and it causes VSC to use 
whole-number CMS generation expressions for the stream. /MAIN also 
causes VSC to update all successor stream links to link to 
this new mainline stream.

<p>
The /PARENT qualifier is informational in some cases, but can be 
critical during certain VSC operations such as CMS facility 
uploads. It should always be specified, and it should always specify 
the correct parent stream.

<p>
<center>
<table bgcolor=lightskyblue border=0 width=75%>
<tr>
  <td><center><font size=+2 
  color=black><strong>Note</strong></font></center><hr size=1 noshade>
<font color=black>
The /[NO]MAIN and /PARENT qualifiers are central and necessary to the 
CMS generation number selection process used within VSC, and 
Digital recommands that these qualifiers be specified with care. In 
particular, the /MAIN qualifier can and should be used <em>only</em> on 
mainline streams, while /NOMAIN should be specified for non-mainline 
streams. Incorrect specification of /[NO]MAIN and/or /PARENT can and 
will cause longer CMS generation numbers, and has been shown to cause 
both confusion and consternation among developers accustomed to the 
typical (cardinal) progression of CMS generations that occurs for 
modules on the mainline. </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
Just as for build streams, the /CMS_CLASS qualifier specifies that a 
CMS class in each facility should be maintained for the stream.
<a name="index_x_267"></a>
<a name="index_x_268"></a>

<p>
The /REPLACEMENT qualifier specifies that the new stream requires all 
replacements into the stream to be queued (as opposed to immediate) 
replacements. Queued replacements go through the VSC review 
mechanism and give you control over when replacements are actually 
performed. The /REMARK qualifier specifies a remark string for the 
stream; if you omit this qualifier, VSC prompts you for a 
remark string.

<p>
<center>
<table bgcolor=lightskyblue border=0 width=75%>
<tr>
  <td><center><font size=+2 
  color=black><strong>Note</strong></font></center><hr size=1 noshade>
<font color=black>
Specification of a remark for the new stream is required. Digital 
strongly recommends the remark indicate that the stream is a release or 
new-feature stream. </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
As explained in <a href="vde_guide_008.html#cre_bld_stream">Section 5.7.1</a>, the CREATE STREAM command does not 
create and populate the CMS class for the stream. Instead, you must 
submit the
<a name="index_x_269"></a>
<a name="index_x_270"></a>
<a name="index_x_271"></a>
SYSBLDCOM$:POPULATE_LIBRARIES.COM or
<a name="index_x_272"></a>
<a name="index_x_273"></a>
<a name="index_x_274"></a>
SYSBLDCOM$:POP_REUSED_CLASS.COM command procedure at DCL level to 
create and populate a CMS class for the stream in each facility. 
<a href="vde_guide_008.html#cre_bld_stream">Section 5.7.1</a> describes how you use these procedures. One of these 
procedures should be run at the same time as you run the CREATE STREAM 
command, and you must ensure that no VSC commands that update 
the parent stream run at that time.

<p>
When you create a new development stream, you often want to specify 
that future replacements into some previously existing stream should be 
propagated to the new stream. For example, if stream MAPLE is created 
from stream BIRCH, you may want all future changes to BIRCH to be 
propagated to MAPLE so that MAPLE will contain all features and bug 
fixes that BIRCH contains. As a later stream, MAPLE will presumably 
also receive new features that are omitted from BIRCH. To specify this 
sort of stream successor relationship, you use the /SUCCESSOR qualifier 
to the MODIFY STREAM command. This is an example:
<a name="index_x_275"></a>
<a name="index_x_276"></a>
<a name="index_x_277"></a>
<a name="index_x_278"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ MODIFY STREAM BIRCH /SUCCESSOR=MAPLE
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command specifies that stream MAPLE is a successor to stream 
BIRCH. As a result, all code changes replaced into BIRCH will 
automatically be propagated to MAPLE if possible. If automatic change 
propagation is not possible for a given module replacement, 
VSC will create a fold record in its database.

<p>
You can specify multiple successors for a given stream if that is the 
behavior you want. To do so, specify a parenthesized list of stream 
names separated by commas with the /SUCCESSOR qualifier. Alternatively, 
specify each successor stream with a separate MODIFY STREAM command. To 
cancel successor relationships, use the /NOSUCCESSOR qualifier to the 
MODIFY STREAM command. (The HELP text has the details.)
<a name="index_x_279"></a>
<a name="index_x_280"></a>
<a name="index_x_281"></a>

<p>
To confirm that you have established the successor relationships 
correctly, use the /SUCCESSOR qualifier to the SHOW STREAM command. 
This example illustrates its output:
<a name="index_x_282"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ SHOW STREAM/SUCCESSOR BIRCH, MAPLE
Stream BIRCH
   Successor chains:
      BIRCH -&gt; MAPLE
 
Stream MAPLE
   Successor chains:
      MAPLE (no successors)
 
VSC„
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This output shows that stream MAPLE is a successor to stream BIRCH and 
that stream MAPLE does not itself have any successors. Because this is 
the desired successor relationship, VSC will perform change 
propagation correctly for these streams.

<p>
When you create a new release stream, you should also determine whether 
you want certain developers to review or be notified of all 
replacements into the stream. In particular, you probably want to be 
notified of all such replacements yourself. To specify the reviewers 
and developers to notify, use the /REVIEWER and /NOTIFY qualifiers to 
the CREATE STREAM or MODIFY STREAM command. <a href="vde_guide_007.html#review_notify">Section 5.6</a> describes 
these qualifiers.

<a name="cre_rel_stream_ex"><h2>5.7.3 Example Stream Creations</h2></a>

<p>
The following code example shows how an OpenVMS development 
stream is created and populated. The example is typical of an 
OpenVMS <em>mainline</em> development stream.

<p>
The steps outlined below create a new <em>mainline</em> stream int the 
OpenVMS database, and a matching mainline stream in the 
OpenVMS test database. It temporarily disables propogation from 
the parent stream, as populating the stream can require some time. It 
then populates the new mainline streams, disables propogation into the 
new mainlines to prevent unintentional overwriting, and finally resets 
the proper propogation attribute on the parent stream.

<p>
These operations should be performed only when the VSC 
database is quiescent, as one typically wishes all modifications to the 
parent database to be propogated into the new stream.
