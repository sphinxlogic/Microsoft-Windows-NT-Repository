This example shows how to define four different keys and associate them 
with a state named ALTERED:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>The first definition defines the key PF3 as the SET command and 
  associates this key with a state named ALTERED.
  <li>The second definition defines the keypad key 7 as &quot;CONTEXT 
  BUGFIX&quot; and makes it dependent on a state named ALTERED. When you 
  press PF3 followed by keypad key 7, VDE executes the SET 
  CONTEXT BUGFIX command.
  <li>The third definition defines keypad key 8 as &quot;CONTEXT 
  FEATURE_1&quot; and also makes it dependent on the ALTERED state. When 
  you press PF3 followed by keypad key 8, VDE executes the SET 
  CONTEXT FEATURE_1 command.
  <li>The fourth definition defines keypad key 9 as &quot;VERIFY&quot; 
  and also makes it dependent on the ALTERED state. When you press PF3 
  followed by keypad key 9, VDE executes the SET VERIFY 
  command.

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>DELETE BUILD_JOB stream-name [, stream-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>stream-name</h3>
The name of a development stream. One or more build jobs in this stream 
are deleted from the database. Use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier to 
specify the build jobs to delete. If you do not specify this qualifier, 
the most recent build job in the stream is deleted.

<p>
You can delete build jobs for more than one stream by using wildcard 
characters in the stream name. The percent sign (%) in a name matches 
any single character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*) 
matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies. Build jobs 
are deleted for those streams whose names match the wildcard pattern.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DELETE BUILD_JOB command deletes each build job that matches the 
specified stream name and build job identification numbers. When a 
build job is deleted, all information about that build job is deleted 
from the database of the current VDE library. You cannot 
delete a build job that is queued for execution or that is currently 
running. To delete such a build job, stop it using the STOP BUILD_JOB 
command before you delete it.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
build job deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for each build job asking whether you want that build 
job deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), the build job is deleted from 
the database. If you answer NO (or N), the build job is not deleted. 
The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified 
build jobs without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=id-range</h3>
Specifies the job identification numbers of the build jobs to be 
deleted from the specified stream. The <strong>id-range</strong> 
parameter can be a single integer value, a range of integers, or a 
wildcard character. If the parameter is a single integer (for example, 
/IDENT=5), VDE deletes the build job with that 
identification number. If the parameter is a range of integers 
(specified as two build job identification numbers separated by a colon 
as in /IDENT=3:5), VDE deletes all build jobs with 
identification numbers in that range. Finally, if the 
<strong>id-range</strong> parameter is the asterisk wildcard (as in 
/IDENT=*), VDE deletes all build jobs for the specified 
stream.

<p>
If you specify a zero or negative build job identification number in 
the <strong>id-range</strong> parameter, that number is relative to the 
identification number of the most recent build job in the stream. For 
example, if the most recent build job is job 5, then /IDENT=0 is 
equivalent to /IDENT=5 and /IDENT=--1 is equivalent to /IDENT=4.

<p>
If you do not use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, VDE deletes 
the most recent build job for the specified stream.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each build job is 
deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that the build 
job has been deleted from the database and that the database 
transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a deletion remark string to be stored in the database for the 
deleted build job. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 
characters long, may contain any explanatory remark that you want to 
store in the database.

The percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the 
position it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more 
characters in the position it occupies. VDE deletes the 
latest generation in the specified stream of each module whose name 
matches the wildcard pattern.

<p>
Using the /GENERATION qualifier, you can also delete a generation that 
does not belong to any stream.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DELETE GENERATION command removes the latest generation of a 
specified module from a specified development stream and makes the 
previous generation (the next most recent generation) into the latest 
generation for the stream. The result is that the most recent 
generation is discarded from the stream, so that the effect of the 
REPLACE operation that created that generation is undone.

<p>
The removed generation remains in the VDE database as long 
as it remains reachable from at least one development stream or has at 
least one successor generation. However, once a removed generation 
becomes unreachable from all streams and has no successors, the DELETE 
GENERATION command deletes it completely from the VDE 
database and library.

<p>
You cannot delete the first generation of a module (generation 1) using 
this command. The only way to delete the first generation is to delete 
the whole module with the DELETE MODULE command.

<p>
If the specified module is currently reserved in the specified stream, 
VDE terminates that reservation since it is based on a 
module generation that no longer is the latest generation for the 
stream. VDE sends a mail message to notify the owner of the 
reservation that the reservation is lost.

<p>
If you want to delete a module generation that does not belong to any 
development stream, use the /GENERATION qualifier. Do not use the 
/GENERATION qualifier for a generation that belongs to a stream; 
VDE will not delete any generation that belongs to a stream 
or that is not a leaf node in the generation tree.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
generation deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for the latest generation of each module giving the 
name of the generation and asking whether you want to delete the 
generation. If you answer YES (or Y), the generation is deleted. If you 
answer NO (or N), the generation is not deleted. The /NOCONFIRM 
qualifier causes VDE to delete each generation without 
asking for confirmation.
<h3>/GENERATION=gen-expr</h3>
Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression given 
by the <strong>gen-expr</strong> parameter be deleted. If you specify 
this qualifier, do not specify the /STREAM qualifier.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after generations are 
deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the generations have 
been deleted from the specified development stream and that the 
database transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string that explains why you deleted the generation. 
The quoted remark string can be up to 132 characters long.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that the latest generation in the development stream given by 
the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter be deleted. If both this 
qualifier and the /GENERATION qualifier are omitted, VDE 
prompts you for the stream name.

This example deletes the latest generation of module [FACIL]MODNAM.C 
from stream V2.0. The log message shows that generation 5 was deleted. 
The subsequent SHOW GENERATION command shows that generation 4 is now 
the latest generation of the module in the stream.
