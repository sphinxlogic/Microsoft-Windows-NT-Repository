</font>

<p>
One of the most important tasks found in any large software engineering 
effort involves the coordination, tracking, maintenance and protection 
of the source files. OpenVMS engineering uses the OpenVMS Development Environment 
(VDE) package for these purposes, and for arcane reasons 
refers to the aggregate collection of OpenVMS source files and 
source libraries as the <strong>Master Pack</strong>.
<a name="index_x_1"></a>
<a name="index_x_2"></a>

<p>
The OpenVMS Development Environment (VDE) package is the set of tools that the 
OpenVMS development group uses to control and to track changes to 
the multiple VDE libraries that comprise the OpenVMS 
Master Pack.

<a name="vde_what_is_this"><h1><font color=maroon>1.1 What is VDE?</font></h1></a>
<a name="index_x_3"></a>
<a name="index_x_4"></a>
<a name="index_x_5"></a>
<a name="index_x_6"></a>
<a name="index_x_7"></a>

<p>
VDE is tailored for medium to large-scale source code control 
environments, and it provides capabilities and controls useful within 
the OpenVMS development environment. Among other uses, 
VDE is used to coordinate all access to the libraries 
containing the OpenVMS source code.

<p>
VDE provides various user interfaces including the 
VDE<sup>1</sup> command interface, and the Mosaic and Motif 
graphical user interfaces.
<a name="index_x_8"></a>
<a name="index_x_9"></a>
(Information on the Motif and WWW/Mosaic graphical user interfaces is 
included in <a href="vde_guide_016.html#gui_interface">Chapter 10</a>; this chapter describes the command interface.)

<p>
The VDE command interface can be invoked directly at the DCL 
prompt. VDE can also execute one or more semicolon-seperated 
commands directly at DCL, and will return back to DCL after command 
completion.
<a name="index_x_10"></a>
<a name="index_x_11"></a>
<a name="index_x_12"></a>
<a name="index_x_13"></a>
Longer command lines can be broken across lines using the hyphen 
character; the command continuation character.
<a name="index_x_14"></a>
<a name="index_x_15"></a>
test suite library, respectively.)

<p>
An example of a single VDE command follows:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ VDE RESERVE/STREAM=FRED [ACC]FOO.MAR "Remark string"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The above example reserves module FOO.MAR in the ACC facility.

<p>
An example of a series of simple VDE commands follows:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ VDE
VDE„ RESERVE/STREAM=FRED [ACC]FOO.MAR "Remark string"
VDE„ SHOW GENERATION [ACC]*
VDE„ EXIT
$
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The above command reserves module FOO.MAR in stream FRED, and displays 
some generation-related information. The caller then exits back to DCL.

<p>
When either command is prompting for commands, there are a variety of 
functions available. One can use the keyboard arrow keys for line 
editing and command line recall, and one
<a name="index_x_16"></a>
can also define keyboard keys to invoke specific commands.

<p>
VDE<sup>2</sup> A kept subprocess starts the VDE 
utility in a subprocess the first time one uses the VDE 
command in a given process, and each subsequent VDE command 
(with /KEPT_PROCESS specified or defaulted) attaches to the existing 
subprocess to execute VDE commands. As a result, the work of 
activating the VDE utility and connecting to the source 
control database (which is a relatively slow operation) is done only 
for the first VDE command one enters in a given process. 
Subsequent VDE commands that access the database are then much 
faster. In addition, the kept subprocess retains state 
information---such as default settings, and even the initial process 
default directory---as long as that subprocess is active. The kept 
subprocess is implicitly terminated when the parent process is 
terminated. The kept subprocess is explicitly terminated via the 
VDE
<a name="index_x_17"></a>
EXIT/KEPT_PROCESS command. Further information on this topic is 
included in <a href="vde_guide_001.html#kept_subprocess">Section 1.9.1</a>.

        <h4><strong><sup>1</sup> </strong> In certain existing installations of 
        VDE, VDE users have access to three command 
        interfaces: VDE, VSC, and VTSC. The 
        command sets, the operations, and the personalities are all effectively 
        identical; the salient differences among the three command interfaces 
        include the library chosen for initial access, and the default setting 
        of the /KEPT_PROCESS qualifier. VDE, VSC, and 
        VTSC command sets and capabilities are completely 
        interchangeable. Any applicable differences will be explicitly called 
        out. <a href="vde_guide_016.html#util_comparision">Appendix B</a>.</h4>
        <h4><strong><sup>2</sup> </strong> VSC defaults to the use of

<a name="vax_library_overview"><h1><font color=maroon>1.2 VDE and  the OpenVMS VAX Library</font></h1></a>

<p>
The remainder of this chapter discusses some high-level concepts needed 
when working with the OpenVMS VAX library, and some features of 
VDE that make this easier.

<p>
<a href="vde_guide.html#mod_fac">Section 1.3</a> discusses the basic unit of source control: the module. 
Modules are organized into facilities. <a href="vde_guide.html#dev_strm">Section 1.4</a> discusses how 
parallel development is organized, while <a href="vde_guide.html#gens">Section 1.5</a> and 
<a href="vde_guide.html#prop_fold">Section 1.7</a> describe how changes to modules are propogated.

<p>
Facilities are grouped into Streams, and <a href="vde_guide.html#dev_strm">Section 1.4</a> describes the 
concept of a stream.

<p>
VDE can be extended for user requirements using a scripting 
mechanism. Some scripts, such as those needed to build a module, are 
required. Others, such as the script that triggers wheneever a module 
is replaced, are optional. A brief overview of scripts is located in 
<a href="vde_guide.html#scripts">Section 1.8</a>.

<p>
VDE has a number of convenience features. For information on 
convenience features such as contexts, session initialization files, 
user-specified key definitions, and user-specified default text 
editors, see <a href="vde_guide_001.html#conv_features">Section 1.9</a>.

<a name="mod_fac"><h1><font color=maroon>1.3 Modules and Facilities</font></h1></a>

<p>
<a name="index_x_18"></a>
<a name="index_x_19"></a>
<a name="index_x_20"></a>
The OpenVMS VAX library contains over 22,000 source modules. As this 
is far too many modules for anyone to reasonably keep track of the 
various associations, the library is broken down into over 200 
<strong>facilities</strong>, and each module belongs to one of those 
facilities. The VDE system uses the following syntax to 
specify a module and the facility to which it belongs:
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
[fac-name]mod-name.type-name 
</pre>
</font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>

For example, [FACIL]MOD.TYP refers to module MOD.TYP in facility FACIL. 
This syntax is accepted on VDE commands and is displayed in 
VDE output.
<a name="index_x_21"></a>

<p>
If you omit the bracketed facility name, as in MOD.TYP, VDE 
assumes that the module belongs to the default facility, provided a 
default facility is defined. You specify the default facility for your 
VDE session with the SET FACILITY command:
<a name="index_x_22"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET FACILITY SYS
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command makes facility SYS the default facility. Your default 
facility is normally undefined at the start of each VDE 
session. To see your default facility, use the SHOW DEFAULTS command.
<a name="index_x_23"></a>
<a name="index_x_24"></a>

<a name="dev_strm"><h1><font color=maroon>1.4 Development Streams</font></h1></a>

<p>
Streams are central to the source control system. Each stream holds a 
particular generation of a module, and each stream has information 
associated that controls the propogation of changes among releases, the 
selection of the appropriate CMS generation numbers, the list of users 
that review changes, the list of users that are notified of changes, 
and various other attributes.

<p>
The OpenVMS Development Group usually has several versions of 
OpenVMS under development at any one time. These versions are 
called <strong>development streams</strong>, or simply 
<strong>streams</strong>. Examples of development streams include past 
versions of OpenVMS (such as V4.7 or V5.0), versions currently 
under development (often with code names such as DRAGON or EAGLE), 
off-to-the-side development streams (often called &quot;variant 
streams&quot; or &quot;variant threads&quot;), and base levels.

<p>
As a VDE user, you must always reserve modules from a 
specified stream, and you must then later replace the updated modules 
into the same stream. As a result, many VDE commands require 
you to specify the development stream to which the commands should 
apply.
<a name="index_x_25"></a>
<a name="index_x_26"></a>
<a name="index_x_27"></a>

<p>
Many such commands allow you to specify the development stream with the 
/STREAM qualifier. If you omit this qualifier or the command does not 
accept it, the command acts on the default stream, provided a default 
stream is defined. One specifies the default development stream for the 
VDE session with the SET STREAM command:
<a name="index_x_28"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET STREAM EPSILON
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command makes stream EPSILON the default stream. The default 
stream is normally undefined at the start of each VDE 
session. To display the current default stream, use the SHOW DEFAULTS 
command.
<a name="index_x_29"></a>
<a name="index_x_30"></a>

<a name="gens"><h1><font color=maroon>1.5 Generations</font></h1></a>

<p>
VDE and VDE can store multiple instances of each 
source module in a library. Each instance is called a 
<strong>generation</strong> of the module.

<p>
Module generations are analogous to a railroad network---some tracks 
can branch off and run parallel to the mainline track, some sidings can 
diverge off the mainline, and some sidings can reconnect back into the 
mainline.

<p>
Each generation can represent a current or past instance of the module 
as it was at some point during its historical development. Different 
generations can also represent variants of the module that belong to 
different development streams being developed concurrently. Each 
generation of a module is created by reserving the previous generation, 
editing that generation to produce the new generation, and replacing 
the new generation into the library. Each generation (except the first) 
thus has a predecessor. A given generation may have zero or more 
successors. If there are multiple successors, these successor 
generations represent variants of the module for different development 
streams.
<a name="index_x_31"></a>

<p>
For each module that is represented in a given stream, there is exactly 
one generation that stores the current contents of that module for that 
stream. This generation is called the <strong>latest 
generation</strong> of the module for the stream. The source control 
database records what generation of each module belongs to each stream. 
A module need not have a latest generation for every stream, however. 
For example, a recently added module will not be used in older versions 
of OpenVMS and will therefore not have latest generations for 
those streams.

VDE provides a mechanism by which source code for multiple 
architectures can be maintained. As it is possible that the same module 
name is used in each architecture, VDE allows the facilities 
and the module names to overlap. By default, VDE assumes all 
source code is architecture-independent.

<p>
VDE allows a suitably privileged user to create one or more 
architecture-dependent architecture roots, or 
<strong>arch-roots</strong>. Each arch-root stores zero or more 
architecture-dependent modules in an architecture-dependent 
facility---in effect, the structure of each arch-root parallels the 
structure of the main source pool.

<p>
For further information on (arch-roots) and on architecture support, 
see <a href="vde_guide_015.html#architectures">Chapter 9</a>.

<a name="prop_fold"><h1><font color=maroon>1.7 Propogation and Folding</font></h1></a>

<p>
VDE supports <strong>propogation</strong> and 
<strong>folding</strong>. Propogation is an automatic process that 
causes the replacement of a source module in the specified replacement 
stream, and into all successor streams; into all streams that have 
descended from the specified stream.

<a name="index_x_33"></a>
<a name="index_x_34"></a>

<p>
Folding is a manual form of propogation and is used when the 
VDE automatic propogation is not feasible. A fold record is 
created as a reminder that a module must be manually propogated into 
parallel and successor streams.

<p>
Folding records can be used to coordinate files across multiple 
arch-roots. Automatic propogation of source code changes across 
multiple arch-roots is not supported as it is expected the 
architecture-specific modules will differ rather substantially.

<p>
The automatic propogation occurs in successor streams only if the 
module has not been changed in the successor stream---the change is 
propogated only if the module is of the same generation. If the module 
has changed---if the source code has diverged---in any successor 
stream, a fold record is created for each successor stream. Propogation 
is based on module generation numbers.

<a name="scripts"><h1><font color=maroon>1.8 Customization Using Scripts</font></h1></a>
VDE allows extensive user tailoring using 
<strong>scripts</strong>. A script allows you to easily perform a 
user-specified action as a part of a script-specific VDE 
operation. For instance, VDE invokes the replace script when 
a module is replaced in the VDE database.
<a name="index_x_36"></a>

<p>
Various types of scripts are optional and allow for site-specific 
processing. Specification of certain scripts is mandatory, as these 
scripts are used within VDE. For instance, the VDE 
VDE$BUILD utility
<a name="index_x_37"></a>
requires specific information when compiling and linking modules and it 
retrieves this information from the (mandatory) user-specified compile 
and link scripts.

<p>
For further information on scripts and script creation, see 
<a href="vde_guide_008.html#pl_scripts">Section 5.8</a>, <a href="vde_guide_008.html#pl_script_commands">Table 5-5</a>, and the <em>Script</em> topics in the 
<em>VDE Reference Manual</em>.
