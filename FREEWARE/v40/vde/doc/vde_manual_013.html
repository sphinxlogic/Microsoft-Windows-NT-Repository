<h3>DELETE GROUP group-name [,group-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>group-name</h3>
The name of a source group or build group defined in the default 
development stream that is to be deleted from the database.

<p>
You can delete more than one group at a time by using wildcard 
characters in the group name. The percent sign (%) in a group name 
matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. Those groups whose names match the wildcard pattern are 
deleted.
<a name="index_x_325"></a>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
This command deletes the database definition of each source group or 
build group listed as a parameter. The /SOURCE or /BUILD qualifier 
determines whether source groups or build groups are deleted. Group 
definitions are deleted only in the default development stream. This 
command does not affect the modules that are members of the deleted 
groups, only the definitions of the groups.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/BUILD</h3>
<h3>/SOURCE (default)</h3>
Specifies whether source groups or build groups are deleted. The 
/SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to delete the source groups 
with the specified names. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to 
delete the build groups with the specified names. If neither qualifier 
is specified, VDE deletes source groups.

<p>
Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
group deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a 
message giving the name of the group and asking if you want it deleted. 
If you answer YES (or Y), the group definition is deleted from the 
database. If you answer NO (or N), the group is not deleted. If you use 
a group specification that contains wildcard characters, VDE 
asks you to confirm the deletion of each group that matches the 
wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE 
to delete all specified groups without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each group has been 
deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the 
group has been deleted and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the deleted 
group. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters 
long, may contain any explanatory remark about the group or its 
deletion that you want to store in the database.

<h2>Format</h2>

<h3>DELETE MODULE mod-name [, mod-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of a module to be deleted from the current VDE 
library. This name consists of a module name and a type name separated 
by a period (such as MOD1.PAS) and can be preceded by an optional 
facility name enclosed in square brackets (as in [FACIL]MOD1.PAS). If 
no facility name is specified, the current default facility is assumed.

<p>
You can delete more than one module at a time by using wildcard 
characters in any of the three components of the module name. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. Those modules whose names match the wildcard 
pattern are deleted.
<a name="index_x_329"></a>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DELETE MODULE command deletes each specified module from the 
current VDE library. When a module is deleted, 
VDE deletes its database record and removes the module from 
the build dependency graph and from any group definitions. After 
committing the database transaction, VDE also deletes each 
specified module's delta file (CMS element). However, VDE 
does not remove the module from any stream-specific disk directories 
such as clear-copy areas or object directories.

<p>
Normally, you must have the DELMOD privilege to delete a module.
<a name="index_x_330"></a>
However, if you have created a particular module and you have not yet 
created the first generation of the module (normally done by replacing 
the first generation into the VDE library), you are allowed 
to delete the module without the DELMOD privilege. In this particular 
case, you must have the
<a name="index_x_331"></a>
 CREMOD privilege, which was required for the initial module creation. 
 The creator of a module can thus correct simple mistakes, such as 
 misnaming the module, by simply deleting the module before the initial 
 replacement is performed. The outstanding reservation on the module is 
 canceled, the module is removed from any reservation session that it 
 might be included in, and the module never appears in the 
 VDE library. For further information on the CREATE MODULE 
 command, see <a href="vde_manual_007.html#vde_cmd_cre_mod">CREATE MODULE</a>.

<p>
If you are not the creator of a module or if the module already has at 
least one generation, you must have the DELMOD privilege to delete it
<a name="index_x_332"></a>
and you can only delete a module if the <strong>delete</strong> 
attribute is set for the module. If this attribute is not set, you must 
set it with the MODIFY MODULE /DELETE command before you can delete the 
module.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
module deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a 
message for each module asking whether you want that module deleted. If 
you answer YES (or Y), that module is deleted from the library. If you 
answer NO (or N), the module is not deleted. If you enter a module name 
with a wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the 
deletion of each module that matches the wildcard specification. The 
/NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified 
modules without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each module has been

<blockquote>
<h3>rep-name</h3>
The name of a queued replacement to be deleted from the current

sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position it 
occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. Those queued replacements whose names match the

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DELETE REPLACEMENT command deletes each specified queued replacement

from the current VDE database. This command is used to 
remove replacement records from the database to free up database space. 
It can be used to delete both current replacement records and

<a name="index_x_338"></a>
replacement.

</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
replacement deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for each replacement asking whether you want that 
replacement deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement is 
deleted from the database. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement is 
not deleted. If you enter a replacement name with a wildcard 
specification, VDE asks you to confirm the deletion of each 
replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification. The 
/NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified 
replacements without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/HISTORY</h3>
Specifies that replacement history be deleted. Replacement history 
consists of database records for past replacements that have already 
been performed; it does not include currently queued replacements.
<a name="index_x_340"></a>
When used with the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, the /HISTORY qualifier 
deletes information for chronological ranges of past replacements.

<p>
If you omit the /HISTORY qualifier, VDE deletes currently 
queued replacements only.
<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=id-range</h3>
Specifies that the replacements with the unique Replacement Ids given 
by the <strong>id-range</strong> parameter be deleted. Do not specify 
the <strong>rep-name</strong> parameter when you use this qualifier.

<p>
VDE assigns a unique Replacement Id to each immediate or 
queued replacement into the VDE
<a name="index_x_341"></a>
library. VDE assigns Replacement Ids in chronological order 
so that the first replacement into the library has Id value 1, the next 
has Id value 2, and so on. When you use this qualifier, all 
replacements that have Id values in the range given by the 
<strong>id-range</strong> parameter are deleted.

<p>
The <strong>id-range</strong> parameter can be a single integer value, 
a range of integers, or a wildcard character. If the parameter is a 
single integer (for example, /IDENT=5), VDE deletes the 
replacement with that Replacement Id. If the parameter is a range of 
integers (specified as two integers separated by a colon as in 
/IDENT=3:5), VDE deletes the replacements with Ids in that 
range. Finally, if the <strong>id-range</strong> parameter is the 
asterisk wildcard character (as in /IDENT=*), VDE deletes 
all replacements.

<p>
If you specify a zero or negative number in the 
<strong>id-range</strong> parameter, that number is relative to the 
largest Replacement Id value for the VDE library (the latest 
replacement). For example, if the latest replacement has Replacement Id 
250, then /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=250 and /IDENT=--1 is 
equivalent to /IDENT=249.

<p>
The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier can be used with the /HISTORY qualifier 
to delete historical replacement information from the VDE 
database. Deleting such information allows database space to be reused.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement has 
been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the 
replacement has been deleted from the database and that the database 
transaction has successfully committed.

The name of the module that is compiled, copied, or linked by the build 
step to be deleted from the database. This name consists of an optional 
facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module name, and an 
optional type name preceded by a period (for example, 
[FACNAM]MOD1.PAS). If no facility name is specified, the current 
default facility is assumed. If no type name is specified, all build 
steps for modules with the given facility name and module name are 
deleted.

<p>
You can delete more than one build step at a time by using wildcard 
characters in any of the three components of the module name. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. Those build steps whose module names match the 
wildcard pattern are deleted.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DELETE STEP command deletes all dependency information for a given 
build step so that the database no longer records the input and output 
modules for the step. The modules themselves remain in the database; 
only their relationships to the build step are lost.

<p>
The command deletes build-step dependency information from only the 
default development stream. To delete build steps in more than one 
stream, you must repeat the DELETE STEP command for each stream. For 
each stream, first enter the SET STREAM command to set the development 
stream, then enter the DELETE STEP command to delete the desired 
build-step dependencies from the database.
</blockquote>

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/COMPILE (default)</h3>
<h3>/COPY</h3>
<h3>/LINK</h3>
Specifies the kind of build step to be deleted. /COMPILE deletes the 
compile step, /COPY deletes the copy step, and /LINK deletes the link 
step for the specified module.

<p>
Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
<h3>/CONFIRM (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the 
build-step definition deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to print a message for each build step asking whether 
you want that step deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), the build-step 
definition is deleted. If you answer NO (or N), the build-step 
definition is not deleted. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to delete all specified build-step definitions without 
asking for confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed when build-step definitions 
are deleted from the database. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages 
to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages 
indicate that each build step has been deleted and that the database 
transaction has committed successfully.
