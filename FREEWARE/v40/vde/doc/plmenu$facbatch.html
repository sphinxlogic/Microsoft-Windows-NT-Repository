<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The FACBATCH utility is used to submit a job to a batch queue for each 
CMS library that meets the selection criteria. The job submitted for 
each library will consist of a user written procedure that will have 
specific information passed to it. The information will be passed to 
the user written procedure via the P1-P8 parameters.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>library-spec</h3>
  Specifies the CMS library that is to be acted on. This specification 
  can contain wildcards, but it must be a valid CMS library directory 
  specification (i.e. VMS$:[YELLOW_TEST.CMS]). An example of a wildcarded 
  specification would be: VMS$:[Y*.CMS]. This specification would process 
  all libraries that start with the letter "Y".
<h3>command-file</h3>
  Specifies the name of the user written command procedure that is to be 
  submitted for each library that meets the selection criteria.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Command Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/AFTER=time</h3>
  Requests that the job be held until after a specific time. If the 
  specified time has already been passed, the job is processed 
  immediately.Time can be specified as either an absolute time or as a 
  combination of absolute and delta times. See the VMS DCL CONCEPTS 
  MANUAL for complete information on specifying time values.
<h3>/HOLD</h3>
  Controls whether or not the job is made available for immediate 
  processing. The /HOLD qualifier holds the job until it is released by 
  the /NOHOLD qualifier or by the /RELEASE qualifier of the SET 
  QUEUE/ENTRY command.
<h3>/[NO]LOG</h3>
  Specifies that the user wants to see messages from the utility 
  pertaining to the libraries being processed or skipped.
<h3>OUTPUT_DIR=directory</h3>
  Specifies where the log files are to be put. The default is to put all 
  the log files in SYS$LOGIN.
<h3>/POST_JOBNAME=character-string</h3>
  This qualifier is much like the /PREFIX_JOBNAME qualifer, except that 
  the character string entered for this qualifier is appended to the job 
  name.
<h3>/PREFIX_JOBNAME=character-string</h3>
  Specifies the ascii character string that is to be place at the 
  beginning of the job name. By default the job name will be the name of 
  the CMS facility that is being process. In the case of 
  VMS$:[YELLOW_TEST.CMS], the job name would be "YELLOW_TEST". If a 
  prefix of "ABC_" is entered, then the job name would be 
  "ABC_YELLOW_TEST".
<h3>/PROCESS=(attribute[,attribute,...])</h3>
  The PROCESS qualifier is used to define the selection criteria for the 
  libraries that are to be processed. Some libraries have special 
  attributes associated with them, VMSCMS$NO_PROPAGATE.FLAG is an example 
  of an attribute. This attribute indicates that this library is not to 
  have any code propagation performed within it. The process qualifier is 
  used to selectively process or skip libraries marked with certain 
  attributes. The list of acceptable attributes is:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]ALL - process all libraries no matter what attribute it may have
  <li>[NO]ARCHIVEDFACILITY - process all archived libraries
  <li>[NO]FLAGFREE - process libraries with not attributes
  <li>[NO]NOPROPAGATE - process libraries marked no propagate
</ul>

<h3>/P4=text &middot;&middot;&middot; /P8=text</h3>
  All the /Pn qualifiers accept alphanumeric strings. These strings can 
  be quoted strings containing spaces, or simpe one word strings. The 
  data accepted for each parameter qualifier is passed directly to the 
  procedure submitted. If a user enters /P4=TEST on the command line, 
  then the user would be able to do a "SHOW SYMBOL P4" command within the 
  procedure submitted and see the string "TEST".
<h3>/QUEUE=queue-name</h3>
  Identifies the batch queue on which the job is entered. The default 
  queue is SYS$BATCH.
