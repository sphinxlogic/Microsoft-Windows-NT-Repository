The facilities comparison utility (FACCOMP) is used to compare the CMS 
class contents and the VDE stream contents for a development 
stream/class.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The FACCOMP command activates the utility from DCL and then acts on the 
set of specified libraries. The utility uses the logical VDE$LIBRARY to 
locate the VDE database to process.

<p>
The FACCOMP utility produces a report of generation differences between 
the CMS representation of a stream and the VDE representation of a 
stream. The report can be printed to the log file or can be printed to 
a user specified text file.

<p>
The utility verifies that the stream to compare exists in the VDE 
library. If the stream is not present in the VDE library the utility 
will terminate. If the stream is present in the VDE library, each 
facility matching the library specification parameter is processed.

<p>
If the CMS class corresponding to the stream name is not found in a 
facility CMS library, a warning message is displayed. A warning message 
is displayed if the facility is not found in the VDE database. 
Processing continues in both of these cases.

<p>
The utility will return the highest severity error encountered as the 
final completion status. For example, the library specification 
VMS$:[A*.CMS] may result in ten CMS libraries to compare. All ten of 
the CMS library and VDE stream contents must match for a success 
status. If one or more of the facilities in the set exhibit a 
difference, then a warning return status results.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>library-spec</h3>
  Specifies the CMS library that is to be acted on. This specification 
  can contain wildcards, but it must be a valid CMS library directory 
  specification (i.e. VMS$:[YELLOW_TEST.CMS]). An example of a wildcarded 
  specification would be: VMS$:[Y*.CMS]. This specification would process 
  all libraries that start with the letter "Y".
<h3>stream</h3>
  Specifies the CMS class/VDE stream name to be compared.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Command Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/[NO]LOG</h3>
  Specifies that the FACCOMP utility should display a message for every 
  CMS LIBRARY that is processed.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file-specification</h3>
  Specifies the name of a file that is to contain all the output.

<p>
Note: error messages and informational messages will not be put into 
the output file.
<h3>/PROCESS=(attribute[,attribute,...])</h3>
  The PROCESS qualifier is used to identify what libraries are to be 
  processed. Some libraries have special attributes associated with them, 
  VMSCMS$NO_PROPAGATE.FLAG is an example of an attribute. This attribute 
  indicates that this library is not to have any code propagation 
  performed within it. The process qualifier is used to selectively 
  process or skip libraries marked with certain attributes. The list of 
  acceptable attributes is:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]ALL - process all libraries no matter what attribute it may have
  <li>[NO]ARCHIVEDFACILITY - process all archived libraries
  <li>[NO]FLAGFREE - process libraries with not attributes
  <li>[NO]NOPROPAGATE - process libraries marked no propagate
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
The user first sets the value of the logical VDE$LIBRARY to point to 
the VMS product database by executing the SET_VDE_LIBRARY command 
procedure. The user then adds the FACCOMP command to their process 
command table. In this example, the CMS class contents and the VDE 
stream contents for stream V5.5 are compared for facilities beginning 
with the letter "a". The output qualifier is not used so any 
differences will be written to SYS$OUTPUT. The process qualifier 
keyword ALL is used to process archived and nopropagate facilities.

<p>
There is a stream difference encounted in this example. In facility 
AAA_VDE_TEST there is a module, A.REQ which exists in the VDE database 
but is not present in the CMS library. The return status, X18178060 
equates to FAC-W-DIFFER, which was the warning condition encountered.
