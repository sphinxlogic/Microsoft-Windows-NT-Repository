<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=res-ident</h3>
Specifies the reservation to be replaced. This qualifier is required 
when you have multiple reservations of the same module in the default 
stream. The <strong>res-ident</strong> parameter is the reservation 
identifier of the reservation to be replaced. The reservation 
identifier is the identifier you specified or VDE assigned 
when you reserved the module, usually a small integer value. Use the 
SHOW RESERVATION command to determine the reservation identifier of 
each reservation.
<h3>/INFORMATION[=file-spec]</h3>
<h3>/NOINFORMATION</h3>
The /INFORMATION qualifier specifies that an information file be 
attached to the current replacement if it is a queued replacement. The
<a name="index_x_529"></a>
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS file 
specification of the information file. If this parameter is omitted, 
VDE asks you whether you want to edit an information file. 
If you answer YES, VDE invokes your preferred editor to edit 
the information file. You may use the information file to pass 
information about the replacement to reviewers and others. The 
/NOINFORMATION qualifier specifies that you do not want to provide an 
information file.

<p>
If you omit both qualifiers, VDE's behavior depends on the 
library attribute that is set with the /ASK_INFO_FILE or cleared with 
the /NOASK_INFO_FILE qualifier to the CREATE or MODIFY LIBRARY command. 
If this attribute is set, VDE asks you whether you want to 
edit an information file. If this attribute is not set, VDE 
queues the replacement without an information file.

<p>
For immediate replacements, VDE ignores both qualifiers and 
does not create an information file.

<p>
To edit an information file through VDE, you should first 
declare your preferred editor with the SET EDITOR command. If you do 
not declare an editor, VDE invokes the system default text 
editor.
<a name="index_x_530"></a>
<h3>/INPUT=file-spec</h3>
Specifies a file to be used as input for the replacement operation. If 
you omit the directory specification from this qualifier, the file is 
taken from your default directory. If you omit the file name or file 
extension, the module name and module type specified in the command 
parameter are used by default.
<h3>/KEEP</h3>
<h3>/NOKEEP (default)</h3>
If the administrator for your VDE library has established a 
NOKEEP script that deletes files from your directory, this qualifier 
controls whether the file used to create the new module generation is 
deleted from your directory. The /KEEP qualifier keeps the file in your 
directory without deleting it. The /NOKEEP qualifier runs the NOKEEP 
script to delete the file provided you did not also specify the 
/RESERVE qualifier. If your VDE library does not have a 
NOKEEP script, the file is not deleted.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each module is 
replaced. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that each 
module has been replaced and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/NOTE=note-number</h3>
The <strong>note-number</strong> parameter specifies the note number 
for the (previously-entered) SCT note associated with this replacement.
<a name="index_x_531"></a>

<p>
VDE can also enter the note into the conference directly, 
see the /SCT qualifier for information.
<h3>/OTHER="other-reason"</h3>
Specifies the type of check-in. The <em>other-reason</em> parameter 
specifies the reason for this check-in, and should indicate why this 
particular check-in was not classified as a fold check-in nor as an SCT 
check-in.

<p>
Also see /FOLD and /SCT.
<h3>/PROPAGATE=stream-name</h3>
<h3>/NOPROPAGATE</h3>
This qualifier controls the default module propogation behaviour of the 
replacement operation. The default for this qualifier can be altered by 
the propogation qualifier on the RESERVE command.

<p>
When specified, the /PROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to 
propagate the changed module(s) only as far as the stream specified by 
the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter, but <em>not</em> to any 
successors of that stream---change propagation thus stops at the 
specified stream.

<p>
The /NOPROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to disable all 
propagate of the change beyond the current stream (the default stream 
or the stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier).

<p>
If you omit both qualifiers, the REPLACE command will propagate the 
changed modules to all successors of the current stream.

<p>
By default, neither /NOPROPOGATE nor /PROPOGATE is specified, and the 
module changes will propogate to all subsequent streams. The behaviour 
is affected by the specification of the propogation qualifier on the 
RESERVE command.
<h3>/QAR</h3>
<h3>/NOQAR</h3>
If you have enabled the library attribute that causes the REPLACE 
command to ask for the reason for the replacement, these qualifiers 
control whether VDE also asks for problem reports related to 
the replacement. The /QAR qualifier causes VDE to prompt for 
related QARs and CLDs (Digital problem
<a name="index_x_532"></a>
<a name="index_x_533"></a>
reports) even if you give the reason as FOLD or OTHER. The /NOQAR 
qualifier causes VDE to not prompt for QAR and CLD 
information even if you give an SCT entry as the reason. If you specify 
neither /QAR nor /NOQAR, the REPLACE command prompts for QARs and CLDs 
only if you specify an SCT entry as the reason for the replacement. 
Neither qualifier has any effect if you have disabled the library 
attribute that causes the REPLACE command to ask for the reason for the 
replacement.
<h3>/QUEUE</h3>
<h3>/IMMEDIATE (default)</h3>
Controls whether each module is replaced into the specified stream 
immediately or is queued for later replacement. The /IMMEDIATE 
qualifier causes the REPLACE command to replace each module into the 
specified stream immediately so that the replacement is complete as 
soon as the command finishes. The /QUEUE qualifier causes the REPLACE 
command to queue the replacement in the VDE database---and 
causes a copy of the module to be placed into the staging area---so 
that the module remains reserved until an authorized user enters a 
PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to cause the actual replacement to
<a name="index_x_534"></a>
<a name="index_x_535"></a>
occur. If any stream into which you are replacing the module has the 
<strong>queued-replacement</strong> attribute, the module is 
automatically queued for replacement and the /IMMEDIATE is ignored.

<p>
Of /QUEUE and /IMMEDIATE, /IMMEDIATE is the default.
<h3>/PROJECT=project-name</h3>
This qualifier allows the user to specify the project name this 
replacement is associated with. The project name can be used to track 
the work and changes related to a particular project.
<a name="index_x_536"></a>

<p>
This qualifier is part of the statistics collection component of 
VDE. Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a 
library basis, using the MODIFY LIBRARY/STATISTICS command. If 
statistics collection is disabled, the statistics qualifiers are 
ignored and have no adverse effects. Certain keywords on this command 
<em>require</em> the specification of the /DEFECTS_CORRECTED or 
/NODEFECTS_CORRECTED qualifier.
<h3>/REASONS=reason-code</h3>
This qualifier allows the user a way to secify the reason the 
replacement is being made: <strong>reason-code</strong> specifies the 
particular reason code for this replacement, based on the list of 
reasons contained in <a href="vde_manual_023.html#tbl_reasons">Table 3-2</a>.
<a name="index_x_537"></a>

The <strong>reason-code</strong> is listed in <a href="vde_manual_023.html#tbl_reasons">Table 3-2</a>, as is a 
brief explaination of the code, and an indication as to whether or not 
the number of defects is collected (see /DEFECTS_CORRECTED) for the 
particular reason code.

<p>
This qualifier is part of the statistics collection component of 
VDE. Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a 
library basis, using the MODIFY LIBRARY/STATISTICS command. If 
statistics collection is disabled, the statistics qualifiers are 
ignored and have no adverse effects. Certain keywords on this command 
<em>require</em> the specification of the /DEFECTS_CORRECTED or 
/NODEFECTS_CORRECTED qualifier.
<a name="index_x_538"></a>
<a name="index_x_539"></a>
<a name="index_x_540"></a>

<p>
If statistics collection is enabled on the current library and you do 
not specify this qualifier, you will be prompted for the information.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a character string to be associated with the newly created 
generation in the VDE database. The remark is enclosed in 
quotation marks. If no remark is entered, then the remark from the 
corresponding reservation is used.

<p>
The remark string is used as the title of the SCT note, if 
VDE was asked to enter the SCT note by the specification of 
the /SCT qualifier.
<h3>/REPLACEMENT=rep-name</h3>
Specifies that the reservations for the specified modules be added to a 
queued replacement with the name given by the <strong>rep-name</strong>
<a name="index_x_541"></a>
parameter. If a queued replacement by that name already exists, the 
reservations are added to that replacement. If no such replacement 
exists, a new queued replacement by that name is created and the module 
reservations are added to it. This qualifier is ignored for immediate 
replacements; it is only meaningful if you also specify the /QUEUE 
qualifier or one of the streams into which you are replacing the 
modules have the <strong>queued-replacement</strong> attribute.

<p>
Queued replacements are implicitly and automatically created whenever a 
REPLACE is performed on a stream marked for queued replacements. For 
further information on explicitly creating a queued replacement, see 
the CREATE REPLACEMENT command.
<a name="index_x_542"></a>
<h3>/RESERVE</h3>
<h3>/NORESERVE (default)</h3>
Controls whether the replaced module is kept reserved. If you specify 
the /RESERVE qualifier, the module remains reserved and the input file 
is not deleted from your default directory. If you specify /NORESERVE, 
the module is no longer reserved after being replaced.
<h3>/REVIEWER=(username [,username...])</h3>
<a name="index_x_543"></a>
Specifies reviewers for the replacement. Each <strong>username</strong> 
parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of a user who should 
review all code replaced by the current command. The user must already 
be recorded in the VDE database. VDE notifies the 
user by mail message that the replacement has occurred. If the 
replacement is queued, the user should then review the changes in that 
replacement before it is performed. If the replacement is immediate, 
VDE notifies the user of the new module generations that 
were created, and the user may then inspect those generations.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter, you may 
omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/SCT=filename</h3>
The <strong>filename</strong> parameter specifies the name of a file to 
be loaded into the SCT notes conference. This file contains the 
previously-edited text of an SCT entry for the SCT note associated with 
this replacement.
<a name="index_x_544"></a>

<p>
If this qualifier is used, the default notes conference for the 
stream---SCT-<em>stream-name</em>---is assumed.

<p>
If this qualifier is specified, the /REMARK string is used as the title 
of the SCT note.

<p>
For information on the proper creation and protection of an SCT notes 
conference, see the <em>Guide to Using VDE</em>.

<p>
Also see /FOLD and /OTHER.
<h3>/SESSION=session-name</h3>
Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations 
together, typically to group all modules related to a particular source 
code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all component 
modules reserved to be treated as a single entity for subsequent 
replacement operations. A session also allows additional modules to be 
reserved and incorporated into an existing session at a later time.

<p>
If you use the /SESSION qualifier, those reservations that are members 
of the specified reservation session are replaced. In this case, you 
must omit the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters from the command.

<p>
Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE, MODIFY 
SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL SESSION 
commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on a queued-replacement 
stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be combined into the same session.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that the modules be replaced into the development stream 
given by the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. The changed 
modules are also propagated to any successors of that stream, if 
appropriate. If this qualifier is omitted, the modules are replaced 
into the default development stream. If this qualifier is omitted and 
no default stream is defined, VDE prompts you for the stream 
name.
<a name="index_x_545"></a>
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Specifies that modules be replaced on behalf of another user. The 
<strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the OpenVMS 
username of the other user. That user must have the module reservations 
that the replace operation will end. You must have the USERNAME 
privilege to use this qualifier.

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>RESERVE mod-name [, mod-name...] ["remark"] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
Specifies a source module in the default stream or the stream specified 
with the /STREAM qualifier to be reserved from the library. The module 
name consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, 
a module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period (such as 
[FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If you omit the facility name, source modules from 
the default facility are reserved. If you omit the type name, all 
source modules with the given module name in the given facility are 
reserved.

<p>
You can reserve more than one module by using wildcard characters in 
any of the three components of the module name. The percent sign (%) in 
a name matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. VDE reserves the source modules whose names match 
the wildcard pattern.

<p>
You can also reserve multiple modules by specifying the name of a 
source group instead of a module name. Source groups are created with 
the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group name, each module that 
is a member of the group is reserved from the library.
<h3>"remark"</h3>
Specifies a remark string for the reservation. Specifying the 
<strong>remark</strong> parameter is equivalent to specifying the 
/REMARK qualifier after the RESERVE keyword.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The RESERVE command copies the latest generation of a module in a 
specified stream to your default directory (or to another location if 
you specified the /OUTPUT qualifier) and marks the module as 
&quot;reserved&quot; in that stream.

<p>
After you have modified the module, you can return your changes to the 
library with the REPLACE command. Alternatively, you can cancel the 
reservation with the UNRESERVE command; no module modifications will be 
entered into the library.

<p>
<center>
<table bgcolor=lightskyblue border=0 width=75%>
<tr>
  <td><center><font size=+2 
  color=black><strong>Note</strong></font></center><hr size=1 noshade>
<font color=black>
The module reservation will be released with the UNRESERVE command, by 
the REPLACE command (when queued-replacement are not enabled on the 
stream), or by the PERFORM REPLACE command (when queued-replacement is 
enabled on the stream). See the <a href="vde_manual_022.html#vde_cmd_replace">REPLACE</a>, <a href="vde_manual_035.html#vde_cmd_unreserve">UNRESERVE</a>, 
<a href="vde_manual_032.html#vde_cmd_show_repl">SHOW REPLACEMENT</a>, and <a href="vde_manual_032.html#vde_cmd_show_res">SHOW RESERVATION</a> commands. </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
By default, VDE does not allow you to reserve a module that 
is already reserved by another user (or yourself) for the same 
development stream. However, you can reserve an already reserved module 
if you specify the /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT qualifier and the already 
existing reservations all allow concurrent reservations. If you do not 
wish to override a reservation, you can use the /QUEUE qualifier to 
request notification when the module becomes available for reservation.

<p>
When you reserve a generation of a module from a VDE 
library, the file that is placed in your directory has the same 
creation and revision times, record format, and record attributes as 
the file that was used to create the generation that you are reserving.

<p>
To reserve modules on behalf of another user, use the /USERNAME 
qualifier to specify the OpenVMS username of that other user. 
The modules are then reserved in the specified user's name. You must 
have the USERNAME privilege to use the /USERNAME qualifier.
<a name="index_x_551"></a>

<p>
For information on creating a new module, see <a href="vde_manual_007.html#vde_cmd_cre_mod">CREATE MODULE</a>. Depending 
on the queued-replacement setting of the target stream, you may need to 
issue a REPLACE command after CREATE MODULE; see <a href="vde_manual_022.html#vde_cmd_replace">REPLACE</a>. The 
behaviour of the CREATE MODULE and the RESERVE commands are identical, 
save for the initial absence of the module in the library for the 
CREATE MODULE, and the initial presence of the module in the library 
for the RESERVE.

<p>
On queued-replacement streams, modules created via a CREATE MODULE and 
modules reserved via a RESERVE can be combined into a single 
replacement, and can be combined into a single reservation /SESSION.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
module reserved. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print 
a message for each module that you have specified asking whether you 
want to reserve the corresponding module generation. If you answer YES 
(or Y), it is reserved. If you answer NO (or N), it is not reserved. 
The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to reserve each 
specified module without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/FOLD[=fold-ident]</h3>
Specifies a fold record to be cancelled when this module reservation is 
eventually replaced into the library. The <strong>fold-ident</strong> 
parameter gives the fold identifier of a fold record for the module 
being reserved and for the stream in which the reservation is done. 
When you later replace the module and VDE performs the 
replacement, VDE will cancel this fold record from the 
VDE database. You can omit the <strong>fold-ident</strong> 
parameter if there is only one fold record for the specified module and 
stream. You can use the /FOLD qualifier if you are modifying the module 
to satisfy an existing fold record. You can also specify the /FOLD 
qualifier with the REPLACE command to achieve the same effect.
<h3>/HISTORY[="string"]</h3>
<h3>/NOHISTORY</h3>
The /HISTORY qualifier specifies that CMS history information is to
<a name="index_x_552"></a>
be included in the file placed in your directory. The history of the 
module lists the generations that preceded the current generation of 
the module. Each generation produces one line of history information in 
the output file. This line gives the CMS generation number, user name, 
date, time, and remark associated with the generation.

<p>
 The quoted string specifies the format of the history line. The quoted 
 string must contain the characters #H or #B (lower case is allowed) and 
 can contain other printing characters (such as comment delimiters). 
 Each history line is formed by inserting the history information where 
 you specify #H or #B in the history string. If you specify #H, the 
 history information is inserted at the end of the file and if you 
 specify #B it is inserted at the beginning of the file. To include a 
 quotation mark in the output history string, type it twice 
 (&quot;&quot;). To include a number sign (#) in the output history 
 string, type it twice (##). If the <strong>string</strong> parameter is 
 omitted, VDE uses the module's default history string.

<p>
The /NOHISTORY qualifier specifies that history information is not to 
be appended to the output file placed in your directory.

<p>
If the /HISTORY and /NOHISTORY qualifiers are both omitted, the RESERVE 
command generates history information only if the history attribute is 
enabled for the module. This attribute is set with the CREATE MODULE or 
MODIFY MODULE command.

<p>
If the history-notes attribute for the VDE library is 
disabled, the RESERVE command will not generate CMS history information 
into the
<a name="index_x_553"></a>
output file and will not accept the /HISTORY qualifier. See the 
description of the /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier to CREATE LIBRARY for more 
information.
<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=res-ident</h3>
Specifies a reservation identifier for the new reservation. Each 
reservation has a unique reservation identifier so that you can 
distinguish between multiple concurrent reservations of the same module 
by the same user. By default, the RESERVE command assigns a unique 
numeric identifier to each reservation, such as &quot;1&quot;, 
&quot;2&quot;, and so on. The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier overrides this 
default and allows you to select a reservation identifier of your 
choice, such as a mnemonic name. The <strong>res-ident</strong> 
parameter specifies the reservation identifier. It can be up to 39 
characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each module generation 
is reserved. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the modules have 
been reserved and that the database transaction has successfully 
committed.
<h3>/MERGE=stream-name</h3>
<h3>/MERGE=(gen-expr)</h3>
Controls whether another generation of the module (called the merge 
generation) is to be merged with the generation that is being reserved 
(called the retrieved generation). If you specify the /MERGE qualifier 
with the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter, the merge generation 
is the latest generation of the module in the specified stream. If you 
specify the /MERGE qualifier with the <strong>gen-expr</strong> 
parameter enclosed in parentheses, the merge generation is the 
generation with the specified generation expression (for example, 
&quot;2A3&quot;).

<p>
When you specify the /MERGE qualifier, VDE merges the lines 
of the retrieved generation with the lines of the merge generation and 
delivers the merged text as a single file to your output directory. The 
file that is placed in your directory has the current creation and 
revision times. The merge generation cannot be on the same line of 
descent as the retrieved generation. When there is a conflict between 
blocks of one or more lines, VDE includes the conflicting 
lines and flags the conflict.

<p>
VDE uses the callable interface to CMS to provide the merge 
capability.
<a name="index_x_554"></a>
For a detailed explanation of how two generations are merged and how 
CMS (and therefore VDE) treats conflicts between the 
generations, see the CMS documentation.
<h3>/NOCONCURRENT</h3>
Specifies that the module cannot be reserved by another user while you 
have it reserved. You must replace or unreserve the module before 
others can reserve it. By default, VDE allows concurrent 
reservations if the module has the <strong>concurrent</strong> 
attribute set.
<h3>/NOTES[="string"]</h3>
<h3>/NONOTES</h3>
The /NOTES qualifier specifies that CMS notes are to be appended to the 
lines of the output file. CMS notes indicate in what module generation 
each source line was created.

<p>
The quoted string specifies the format of the note. The quoted string 
can contain text (including the appropriate comment delimiter) and the 
characters #G or #g. The CMS generation expression of the generation in 
which the line first appeared in inserted where you specify #G or #g. 
The resulting string is appended to the end of the output line. To 
include a quotation mark in the output notes string, type it twice 
(&quot;&quot;). To include a number sign (#) in the output notes 
string, type it twice (##). If the <strong>string</strong> parameter is 
omitted, VDE uses the module's default notes string. (You 
set the default notes string with the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE 
command.)
