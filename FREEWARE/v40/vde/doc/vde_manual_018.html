<blockquote>
<a name="index_x_406"></a>
Modifies the attributes and membership of a source group or build group 
in the VDE database. The attributes of a group that you can 
modify are the group's name and remark string. The membership of a 
group is the list of modules that are members of the group.

<h2>Format</h2>

<h3>MODIFY GROUP group-name [= mod-name [, mod-name...]] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>group-name</h3>
The name of a group whose definition is to be modified. This group must 
be defined in the default development stream. The group name may not 
contain wildcard characters.
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of a module that should be added to or removed from the 
specified group. If the group is a source group, this module must be a 
source module. The module name consists of an optional facility name 
enclosed in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name 
preceded by a period (for example, [FACNAM]MODNAM.MAR). If no facility 
name is specified, the default facility is assumed. If no type name is 
specified, all source modules (for a source group) or all modules (for 
a build group) with the given module name in the given facility are 
added to or removed from the group.

<p>
You can add or remove more than one module at a time by using wildcard 
characters in any of the three components of the module name. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. Those source modules (for a source group) or 
those modules (for a build group) whose names match the wildcard 
pattern are added to or deleted from the group.

<p>
If no module-name parameters are specified, the membership of the group 
is not changed.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A group is always defined in a specific development stream. You can 
only refer to the group from within that stream. As a result, the 
MODIFY GROUP command only modifies the group definition in the default 
development stream.

<p>
To modify group definitions for more than one development stream, you 
must use the MODIFY GROUP command for each stream. For each stream, 
first enter the SET STREAM command to set the development stream then 
enter the MODIFY GROUP command to change the group in that stream.

<p>
To apply a qualifier to the command as a whole, place the qualifier 
immediately after the MODIFY GROUP keywords and before the 
<strong>group-name</strong> parameter. With this placement, qualifiers 
such as the /REMARK qualifier apply to the entire specified group or, 
as with such qualifiers as /ADD or /REMOVE, to all modules specified 
after the equal sign.
<a name="index_x_408"></a>

<p>
Only the /ADD and /REMOVE qualifiers can modify an individual 
module-name parameter. To add or remove an individual module, place the 
/ADD or /REMOVE qualifier immediately after the module-name parameter. 
The /ADD or /REMOVE qualifier placed after an individual module-name 
parameter overrides the command-level qualifier for that one parameter.
<a name="index_x_409"></a>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ADD (default)</h3>
<h3>/REMOVE</h3>
Controls whether the modules specified in the parameter list are added 
to or removed from the group. The /ADD qualifier adds the specified 
modules to the group and the /REMOVE qualifier deletes them from the 
group. To set the default for the command as a whole, specify the 
qualifier after the MODIFY GROUP keywords. To override that default for 
a single module, specify the qualifier after the 
<strong>mod-name</strong> parameter you choose to add or delete. If you 
do not specify one of these qualifiers, modules are added to the group.

<p>
Of /ADD and /REMOVE, /ADD is the default.
<h3>/BUILD</h3>
<h3>/SOURCE (default)</h3>
Specifies whether a source group or build group is modified. The 
/SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to modify the source group with 
the specified name. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to 
modify the build group with the specified name. If neither qualifier is 
specified, VDE modifies a source group.

<p>
Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the 
group definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE 
to print a message for the group it is about to modify giving the name 
of the group and asking whether you want that group modified. If you 
answer YES (or Y), the group definition is modified. If you answer NO 
(or N), the group definition is not modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier 
causes VDE to modify the group definition without asking for 
confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the group definition is 
modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that the group 
has been modified and that the database transaction has successfully 
committed.
<h3>/NAME=group-name</h3>
Specifies a new name for the indicated group. After the group name is 
changed, the group must be referred to by the new name in all 
subsequent VDE commands. The old name is lost from the 
database. The new name can be up to 39 characters long and must follow 
normal VDE name syntax.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the specified group. This 
remark string replaces the remark specified with the CREATE GROUP 
command that created the group. The quoted remark string can be up to 
132 characters long and may contain any explanatory remark about the 
group that you want to store in the VDE database.

overridden. However, the /ADD qualifier specified for module A.PAS 
overrides the default for that module and A.PAS becomes a member of the

<a name="index_x_410"></a>
Modifies information in the database header record for the current 
VDE library. This command can modify the library name, the 
library remark string, the standard authorized and default privileges 
for new users of the library, and various other library attributes. It 
can also enable or disable after-image journalling for the library's 
VDE database.

<h3>MODIFY LIBRARY </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
None.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ALLOW_DELETE</h3>
<h3>/NOALLOW_DELETE</h3>
Specifies the default value for the <strong>delete</strong> attribute 
for new modules, facilities, and streams. The /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier 
sets a library attribute that causes VDE to set the 
<strong>delete</strong> attribute by default when users create new such 
entities. As a result, users can delete these entities without first 
having to set the <strong>delete</strong> attribute with a separate 
MODIFY command. The /NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier clears this library 
attribute so that VDE clears the <strong>delete</strong> 
attribute by default for new modules, facilities, and streams. As a 
result, it is harder for a user to delete an entity by mistake; the 
entity's <strong>delete</strong> attribute must be set with a separate 
MODIFY command before the entity can be deleted with a DELETE command. 
When creating new modules, facilities, and streams, you can override 
this default setting with an explicit /DELETE or /NODELETE qualifier to 
the CREATE command.

<p>
Use the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you expect to make frequent changes 
to your library, often deleting modules, facilities, and streams. Use 
the /NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you are more concerned about 
preventing accidental deletion of such entities.
<h3>/ASK_INFO_FILE</h3>
<h3>/NOASK_INFO_FILE</h3>
Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the user 
whether he or she wants to edit an information file when creating a 
queued replacement. The /ASK_INFO_FILE qualifier sets a library 
attribute that causes the REPLACE command to ask for an information 
file by default. The /NOASK_INFO_FILE qualifier clears this library 
attribute so that the REPLACE command does not ask for an information 
file by default. This library attribute only affects queued replacements
<a name="index_x_412"></a>
(not immediate replacements), and it only affects the REPLACE command's 
default behavior; users can always use the command's /INFORMATION or 
/NOINFORMATION qualifier to explicitly request either behavior.
<h3>/ASK_REPL_CAUSE</h3>
<h3>/NOASK_REPL_CAUSE</h3>
Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the user 
for the &quot;cause&quot; of the replacement. The cause may be a fold 
operation, a Source Control Tracking (SCT) entry in a Notes conference,
<a name="index_x_413"></a>
<a name="index_x_414"></a>
<a name="index_x_415"></a>
or some other cause. The /ASK_REPL_CAUSE qualifier sets a library 
attribute that causes the REPLACE command to query the user for the 
cause of the replacement. The /NOASK_REPL_CAUSE qualifier clears this 
library attribute so that the REPLACE command does not ask for this 
information.
<h3>/AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies the standard authorized privileges of new users of the 
current library. However, any privileges specified with the CREATE USER 
command override these privileges. Because the privilege list you 
create replaces the authorized privilege list of the current library, 
you must specify all authorized privileges that you want new users of 
the library to have.

<p>
Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If only one 
privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted.

<p>
For a list of privileges, see <a href="vde_manual_028.html#tbl_privileges">Table 3-5</a> in <a href="vde_manual_028.html#vde_cmd_set_priv">SET PRIVILEGES</a>.
<h3>/AUTO_ADD_USER[=rights-ident]</h3>
<h3>/NOAUTO_ADD_USER</h3>
Specifies whether new users should be added to the library database 
automatically when they first access the library. The /AUTO_ADD_USER 
qualifier specifies that new users should be added to the library 
database automatically when they first access the library. If the 
<strong>rights-ident</strong> parameter is specified, new users are 
only added to the library if they hold the OpenVMS rights 
identifier specified by the parameter. The /NOAUTO_ADD_USER qualifier 
specifies that new users not be added to the library database 
automatically. In this case, new users can only be added with explicit 
CREATE USER commands.

<p>
The owner information specified in the OpenVMS SYSUAF
<a name="index_x_416"></a>
 database will be used as the owner of any new VDE username 
 created. VDE will ignore any leading numerics, leading 
 hyphens, leading space characters, and leading tilde characters, listed 
 in the SYSUAF owner field.
<h3>/AUTO_CONVERT</h3>
<h3>/NOAUTO_CONVERT</h3>
Specifies whether the library and its database are automatically 
converted to the new library format when a new version of 
VDE is used on the library. The /AUTO_CONVERT qualifier 
specifies that the library should be converted automatically the first 
time a user uses a new version of VDE on the present library 
and its database. /NOAUTO_CONVERT specifies that the library should not 
be converted automatically; instead a privileged user must explicitly 
convert the library with the CONVERT LIBRARY command. See the CREATE 
LIBRARY and the CONVERT LIBRARY commands.
<a name="index_x_417"></a>
<a name="index_x_418"></a>
<a name="index_x_419"></a>
<h3>/AUTO_MAIL</h3>
<h3>/NOAUTO_MAIL</h3>
<a name="index_x_420"></a>
Specifies whether VDE should automatically send mail 
notification to the user who has queued a replacement when that 
replacement is later performed. The /AUTO_MAIL qualifier sets a library 
attribute that causes the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to send such mail 
notification. The /NOAUTO_MAIL qualifier clears this library attribute 
so that the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command does not send such notification.
<h3>/CMS_ELEM_HIST</h3>
<h3>/NOCMS_ELEM_HIST</h3>
Specifies whether VDE creates the CMS elements for new 
modules with default CMS history and notes strings. The /CMS_ELEM_HIST 
qualifier causes VDE to
<a name="index_x_421"></a>
create the CMS elements for new modules with default history and notes 
strings and the /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST qualifier causes VDE to 
create CMS elements with no default history or notes strings. 
/NOCMS_ELEM_HIST is normally only used if you regularly fetch 
VDE modules using the CMS FETCH command and you want to make 
sure you do not get CMS history or notes by default.
<h3>/DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies the standard default privileges of new users of the current 
library. However, any privileges specified with the CREATE USER command 
override these privileges. Because the privilege list you create 
replaces the default privilege list of the current library, you must 
specify all default privileges that you want new users of the library 
to have. Each default privilege specified also becomes a standard 
authorized privilege for the library.

<p>
Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If only one 
privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted. For a list of 
privileges, see <a href="vde_manual_028.html#tbl_privileges">Table 3-5</a> in <a href="vde_manual_028.html#vde_cmd_set_priv">SET PRIVILEGES</a>.
<h3>/HISTORY_NOTES</h3>
<h3>/NOHISTORY_NOTES</h3>
Specifies whether VDE's RESERVE command can produce CMS 
history or notes
<a name="index_x_422"></a>
<a name="index_x_423"></a>
information in its output files. The /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier allows 
the RESERVE command to produce history and notes information and to 
accept the /HISTORY, /NOTES, and /POSITION qualifiers. The 
/NOHISTORY_NOTES qualifier causes the RESERVE command to never produce 
history and notes information (even when such information is the 
default for a module being reserved) and to not accept the /HISTORY, 
/NOTES, and /POSITION qualifiers. In this case, you must use the 
VDE FETCH command to get CMS history or notes information 
for a module. Disabling history and notes information in reserved files 
makes certain mistakes less likely where such information gets replaced 
into the VDE library as part of the module text.
<h3>/JOURNAL=dir-spec</h3>
<h3>/NOJOURNAL</h3>
Enables or disables after-image journalling for the VDE 
database. The /JOURNAL qualifier enables after-image journalling and 
specifies that a database after-image journal (.AIJ) file be created in 
the directory location given by the <strong>dir-spec</strong> 
parameter. When used with the RMU backup and restore facilities, 
after-image journalling allows you to recover the up-to-date contents 
of your database after a disk failure. The specified directory should 
always reside on a different physical disk than any of your other 
database files so that the journal file cannot be damaged by the same 
disk failure as the database itself.

<p>
The /NOJOURNAL qualifier disables after-image journalling for the 
VDE database. However, Digital recommends that you always 
use journalling.
<h3>/LOCK</h3>
<h3>/UNLOCK</h3>
The /LOCK and /UNLOCK qualifiers provide a method by which RESERVE, 
REPLACE, UNRESERVE, and other similar commands can be disabled on a 
copy of a VDE library. This mechanism is not intended to 
completely lock-out all access to a VDE library.

<p>
Specification of /LOCK write-locks the library, and the corresponding 
/UNLOCK qualifier reverses the lock. The write-lock status is read only 
when the user initially accesses the library---once a user has 
connected to the library, the lock status is <em>not</em> updated.

<p>
A write-locked library can be used to prevent various user 
modifications to the contents of the library during library 
maintenance, or to maintain a shadow copy of a library.

<p>
Users holding the MODLIB privilege are allowed to override the library 
write-lock.
<a name="index_x_424"></a>
  An informational message will be displayed when the lock is overridden.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the database header 
record of the library is modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such 
messages to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages 
indicate that library attributes have been modified and that the 
database transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/NAME=lib-name</h3>
Specifies a new name for the current library. The new library name can 
be up to 39 characters long and must follow normal VDE name 
syntax.

<p>
This value is available to procedures calling VDE via the 
VDE$LIBRARY_MNEMONIC name,
<a name="index_x_425"></a>
<a name="index_x_426"></a>
and the database manager should set this value to match the values 
associated with this library that are specified in the 
VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS logical name.
<a name="index_x_427"></a>
<a name="index_x_428"></a>
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a new remark string for the library. The quoted remark 
string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the library that you want stored in the 
library database. This string replaces the remark string from the 
original CREATE LIBRARY command or from any previous MODIFY LIBRARY 
command.

<p>
This value is available to procedures calling VDE via the 
VDE$LIBRARY_LABEL name,
<a name="index_x_429"></a>
<a name="index_x_430"></a>
and the database manager should set this value to match any values 
associated with this library that are specified in the 
VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS logical name.
<a name="index_x_431"></a>
<a name="index_x_432"></a>
<h3>/REPL_HISTORY</h3>
<h3>/NOREPL_HISTORY</h3>
Specifies whether VDE should maintain a history of all past 
source code replacements into the VDE library. The 
/REPL_HISTORY qualifier specifies that such history information be 
maintained in the VDE database. The /NOREPL_HISTORY 
qualifier specifies that such information not be maintained. When you 
maintain replacement history, you can display past replacements using 
the /HISTORY qualifier to the SHOW REPLACEMENT command.
<h3>/SEND_MAIL</h3>
<h3>/NOSEND_MAIL</h3>
<a name="index_x_433"></a>
Specifies whether VDE should send mail notification messages 
for those VDE operations that normally send such messages. 
The /SEND_MAIL qualifier sets a library attribute that enables 
VDE to send such mail messages. The /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier 
clears that attribute, thus suppressing all VDE mail 
messages. The /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier is useful when you want to test or 
play with a private VDE library without sending notification 
messages to other people. However, for normal production use, you 
should always enable mail messages.
<h3>/SHOW_ARCH_NAME</h3>
<h3>/NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME</h3>
Specifies whether the architecture name is displayed as part of every 
module name in VDE output. The /SHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier 
sets a library attribute that causes VDE to always include 
the architecture name in every module name it displays. This attribute 
also causes the SHOW DEFAULTS command to display the default 
architecture. The /NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier clears this library 
attribute so that VDE omits the architecture names when 
displaying module names. You normally only want to see the architecture 
name if you have defined multiple architectures for your VDE 
library.

<p>
<em>This qualifier is not yet implemented.</em>
<h3>/SHOW_GEN_EXPR</h3>
<h3>/NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR</h3>
Specifies whether the expected replace-time CMS generation expression 
for each module is displayed by the RESERVE command. The /SHOW_GEN_EXPR 
qualifier sets a library attribute that causes the RESERVE command to 
compute and display the CMS generation expression that the 
corresponding REPLACE command is most likely to use for the new module 
generation. You can use this value as an &quot;audit trail 
identifier&quot; in your code if your project uses this convention. 
This library attribute also causes the SHOW RESERVATION command to 
display the expected CMS generation expression and it causes the 
REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to print an informational 
message if the actual CMS generation expression for the replaced 
generation turns out to be different than the expected one. The 
/NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR qualifier disables this library attribute.

<p>
Please note that VDE cannot guarantee that the expected CMS 
generation expression will actually be used. It is not possible to 
determine at RESERVE time whether a CMS variant letter should be used 
when the module is eventually replaced; that decision can only be made 
at REPLACE time and depends on propagation decisions and stream 
successor relationships at that time. However, the expected CMS 
generation expression is generally the one that is actually used.
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3>
Enables statistics collection on the specified library. This will cause 
various extra questions to be asked during replacement and related 
operations. This includes the addition of questions around the reason 
for the change, the number of defects fixed, and the particular project 
a change is associated with.
<a name="index_x_434"></a>
<h3>/WILD_INS_GEN</h3>
<h3>/NOWILD_INS_GEN</h3>
Specifies whether wildcard characters are allowed in the parameters to 
the INSERT GENERATION command when the /GENERATION qualifier is 
specified. The /WILD_INS_GEN qualifier sets a library attribute that 
causes VDE to allow wildcard characters in such parameters 
while the /NOWILD_INS_GEN qualifier clears this attribute. When the 
/GENERATION qualifier to INSERT GENERATION specifies a specific CMS 
generation expression, it is unlikely that this generation expression 
could apply to more than one module. As a result, it is unlikely that 
the use of wildcard characters in the module-name parameters will give 
the result the user intended. To prevent mistakes, VDE 
therefore does not allow such wildcard usage by default. However, there 
are some situations when such usage might be correct (for example, if 
the specified CMS generation expression is 1). For such situations, you 
can enable the use of wildcard characters with the /WILD_INS_GEN 
qualifier.
