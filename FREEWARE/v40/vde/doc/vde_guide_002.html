In this example, module MOD.TYP in facility FACIL is reserved from the 
OpenVMS VAX library. The module is reserved for stream BIRCH and all 
successor streams that have the same generation of MOD.TYP as BIRCH. 
One of the log messages indicates that generation 3 in that stream was 
fetched out. The new generation created when you later replace the 
module is expected to have the generation expression 3A1; you should 
use this string as the audit trail identifier in the code comments 
explaining your changes.

<a name="concur_res"><h2>2.2.1 Concurrent Reservations</h2></a>

<p>
A module reservation is said to &quot;cover&quot; all development 
streams to which you expect the module to be propagated when you later 
replace it. This means that, if the stream that you reserve a module 
from has a successor stream and if the module has not yet diverged 
between the two streams, the reservation covers both streams. If the 
successor stream also has a successor, that stream is covered too (if 
the module has not diverged), and so on. If two reservations of the 
same module cover at least one common development stream, then the two 
reservations are said to be <strong>concurrent reservations</strong> of 
the module.
<a name="index_x_96"></a>

<p>
The source control system does not by default create a concurrent 
reservation for you when you reserve a module. If someone else's 
existing reservation conflicts with the reservation you are trying to 
create, it is best for you to wait for the other developer to replace 
(or unreserve) the module before you reserve it and start to modify it. 
If both of you modify a module at the same time for the same stream, 
one of you will have to manually merge the parallel sets of changes to 
make the module right. This extra step in effect requires someone to 
enter his or her changes twice, which is more work and increases the 
risk of errors. Avoiding concurrent reservations is therefore your best 
policy.

<p>
However, there are exceptions. Sometimes you might need to change a 
module to fix a bug in the current build, for example, even though 
someone else (or even you yourself) already has reserved the module for 
more extensive changes. In such cases, you can use the 
/OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT qualifier on the RESERVE command to concurrently 
reserve the module. When you have completed your change, you queue the 
module for replacement with the REPLACE command. When the release 
project leader performs your replacement, the other developer's 
reservation is cancelled and he or she is notified of this fact by a 
mail message. That other developer must then rereserve the module, 
merge his or her changes with your changes, and then continue his or 
her work. When you create a concurrent reservation for a module and 
then replace the module first, you thus create work for another 
developer, so you need a good reason for doing so.

<p>
The following example illustrates what happens when you try to reserve 
a module that is already reserved:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; RESERVE [RMS]MODULE_E.B32 "Emergency bug fix"
Module [BUILD_TEST]E.B32 is currently reserved:
   Reservation 1 by user HOFFMAN on 18-JAN-1990 15:45:51.77
      Remark: FIRST RESERVATION
%VDE-E-MODALRRES, module [RMS]MODULE_E.B32 already reserved by another user
 attempt to reserve module has failed
%VDE-I-ROLLBACK, database transaction rolled back
VSC&gt;
</pre>
</font>
</table>

In this example, the RESERVE command fails because the module is 
already reserved by another user. The command's output identifies the 
conflicting reservation so you can see who owns it (user HOFFMAN in 
this example). The reservation conflicts with the one you wanted to 
make because it covers some common stream for the same module.

<p>
If you decide that you must create a concurrent reservation for the 
module after all, you enter this command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; RESERVE/OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT [RMS]MODULE_E.B32 "Emergency bug fix"
Module [BUILD_TEST]E.B32 is currently reserved:
   Reservation 1 by user HOFFMAN on 18-JAN-1990 15:45:51.77
      Remark: FIRST RESERVATION
%VDE-I-FETCHED, generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;1(1) fetched from library
%VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MODULE_E.B32;
%VDE-I-RESERVED, generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;1(1) reserved from stream BIRCH
%VDE-I-EXPGENEXPR, expected generation expression at replacement is 2
%VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
VSC&gt;
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This RESERVE command creates a concurrent reservation for the module 
because it contains the /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT qualifier. It also sends 
mail to user HOFFMAN to notify HOFFMAN that you just concurrently 
reserved the module.

<p>
When you reserve a module, you can specify that you do not want other 
developers to create concurrent reservations for that module. To do so, 
use the /NOCONCURRENT qualifier on the RESERVE command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; RESERVE/NOCONCURRENT [RMS]MODULE_E.B32 "Remark string"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This qualifier causes the source control system to reject future 
attempts to create reservations that are concurrent with this one until 
you replace the module into the library or unreserve it. If you are 
about to make complicated changes to a module, you can thus prevent 
others from concurrently reserving that module. Normal usage, however, 
is to omit this qualifier and to allow concurrent reservations in case 
they are needed in an emergency. You can change a reservation's 
noconcurrent attribute with the MODIFY RESERVATION command.

<a name="queued_res"><h2>2.2.2 Queued Reservations</h2></a>

<p>
VSC and VSC support queued reservations. When you 
queue a reservation request, the source control system records the 
queued reservation in its database, pending the availability of the 
specified module. When the developer who owns the current reservation 
later replaces the module into the library or cancels the reservation, 
VSC sends a mail message to each user who has queued a 
reservation request for the module.

<p>
The queued reservation request mail message indicates that the module 
is now available for reservation, and it lists all users who have 
requested it, in the order the requests were posted. The users listed 
in the message must decide among themselves who should reserve the 
module first.

<p>
To actually reserve the module, one must enter an explicit RESERVE 
command.
<a name="index_x_97"></a>
<a name="index_x_98"></a>
<a name="index_x_99"></a>

<p>
In addition to displaying other reservation information, the SHOW 
RESERVATION command displays all queued reservations.

<a name="cre_new_mod"><h1><font color=maroon>2.3 Creating New Modules</font></h1></a>

<p>
To create a new source module, use the CREATE MODULE command:
<a name="index_x_100"></a>
<a name="index_x_101"></a>
<a name="index_x_102"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; CREATE MODULE [FACIL]MOD.TYP /STREAM=BIRCH /REMARK="Remark string"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command records the new module in the source control database and 
creates a reservation for the module in the specified stream. It does 
not create the first generation of the module, however. You must use a 
subsequent REPLACE command to actually create the initial generation of 
the module.

<p>
You can create multiple modules with a single CREATE MODULE command by 
specifying a list of module names separated by commas.

<p>
VDE also allows you to associate a number of modules from 
various RESERVE and CREATE MODULE commands together, by using the 
/SESSION qualifier. The /SESSION qualifier allows you to pick a name 
for a group of modules, and to avoid having to specify each module on 
the REPLACE command. The use of /SESSION also provides the reviewers 
and the project leader with a clear indication that a group of 
replacement modules are related.

<p>
If you should mistakenly create a module under an incorrect module 
name, or should you create a module that becomes unnecessary, you 
can---<em>prior to module replacement</em>---issue a DELETE MODULE 
command. The DELETE MODULE command will cancel the
<a name="index_x_103"></a>
reservation, and will correctly back out the CREATE MODULE command. For 
further details on this, see the <em>VDE Reference Manual</em>.

<p>
The CREATE MODULE command accepts a number of qualifiers. The help text 
and the reference manual have the details on all of the qualifiers 
accepted by the command. <a href="vde_guide_002.html#qualtbl_cremod">Table 2-2</a> lists some of the more 
commonly-used qualifiers. <p>

       also provides a clear indication to the reviewers and to the project 
       leader that the modules being replaced are associated. The particular

VSC&gt;
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example makes stream PHOENIX the default development stream and 
then creates the new module NEWMOD.C in facility FACNAM. The CREATE 
MODULE command adds the module to the source control database and 
reserves it from the default stream. A subsequent REPLACE command (not 
shown) is needed to create the first generation of the module in the 
library.

<a name="fetch_mod"><h1><font color=maroon>2.4 Fetching Modules</font></h1></a>

<p>
To fetch an existing module without reserving it, use the FETCH 
command. For example:
<a name="index_x_110"></a>
<a name="index_x_111"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; FETCH/STREAM=FOO [FACIL]MOD.TYP
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command copies the latest generation for stream FOO of module 
MOD.TYP in facility FACIL to your default directory.

<p>
The FETCH command accepts multiple module names separated by commas and 
accepts the asterisk (*) and percent sign (%) wildcard characters in 
the module-name parameters. Those modules whose names match the 
wildcard patterns are fetched.

<p>
You can specify the specific generation you want to fetch in two ways. 
One way is to specify a generation number preceded by a semicolon after 
the module name. For example, MOD.TYP;5 refers to absolute generation 5 
for the specified development stream. MOD.TYP;0 refers to the latest 
generation of the module in the specified stream and MOD.TYP;--1 refers 
to generation --1 relative to the latest generation in the stream (in 
other words, to the next most recent generation). The second method to 
specify the generation you want is to use the 
/GENERATION=<em>gen-expr</em> qualifier to specify the CMS 
&quot;generation expression&quot; of the desired generation. If you 
specify neither a generation number nor the /GENERATION qualifier, 
VSC fetches the latest generation for the specified (or 
default) development stream.

<p>
In addition to the /GENERATION qualifier, the FETCH command accepts a 
subset of the RESERVE command qualifiers. The FETCH command also 
accepts an optional quoted remark parameter for compatibility with CMS, 
but since there is no reason to record fetch operations, the remark 
string is simply discarded.

<p>
The FETCH command accepts a number of qualifiers. The help text and the 
reference manual have the details on the qualifiers accepted by the 
command. <a href="vde_guide_002.html#qualtbl_fetch">Table 2-3</a> contains some of the more commonly-used

This command cancels the reservation of module MOD.TYP in facility 
FACIL. The /STREAM qualifier specifies the stream for which the 
reservation was made. If you omit this qualifier, your default stream 
is assumed. If you have more than one reservation of the module for 
that stream, you must specify its reservation identifier with the 
/IDENTIFICATION qualifier. The command can cancel both queued 
reservation requests and real reservations.

<p>
The UNRESERVE command accepts wildcard characters in the module-name 
parameter. Those modules whose names match the wildcard pattern are 
unreserved. The command also accepts multiple module-name parameters 
separated by commas.

<p>
The optional remark string parameter specifies a remark that explains 
why the module reservation was cancelled. You can also specify the 
remark string with the /REMARK qualifier.

<p>
The UNRESERVE command accepts a subset of the REPLACE command 
qualifiers (see <a href="vde_guide_003.html#qualtbl_replace">Table 2-5</a>). The following qualifiers have the same 
meanings as for the REPLACE command: /CONFIRM, /NOCONFIRM, 
/IDENTIFICATION, /LOG, /NOLOG, /STREAM, and /USERNAME.

<p>
Once a reservation has been entered into the source control system's 
database, you can display it with the SHOW RESERVATION command. This is 
a typical example:
<a name="index_x_119"></a>
<a name="index_x_120"></a>
<a name="index_x_121"></a>

      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; SHOW RESERVATION [FACIL]MOD.TYP
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command shows all reservations and queued reservation requests for 
module MOD.TYP in facility FACIL. If the module-name parameter is 
omitted, the command displays all reservations for modules in your 
default facility.

<p>
The SHOW RESERVATION command accepts a list of module names separated 
by commas, and you can use the asterisk (*) and percent sign (%) 
wildcard characters in the module names. All reservations for modules 
that match the wildcard patterns are displayed.

<p>
The SHOW RESERVATION command accepts a number of qualifiers. The help 
text and the reference manual have the details on all of the qualifiers 
accepted by the command. <a href="vde_guide_002.html#qualtbl_shores">Table 2-4</a> describes a number of the more 
commonly-used qualifiers. <p>
