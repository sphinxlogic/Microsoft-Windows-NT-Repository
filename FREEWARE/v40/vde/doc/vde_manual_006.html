<h3>CREATE FACILITY facil-name [, facil-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>facil-name</h3>
The name of the new facility to be created. This name can be up to 39 
characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.

<p>
VDE prohibits the creation of any facilities with names that 
begin with the character sequences &quot;VDE$&quot;, &quot;VSC$&quot;, 
and &quot;VTSC$&quot;, as these prefixes are used within VDE.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A facility is the highest level of organization in a VDE 
library and identifies a set of related modules. For example, the RMS 
facility is composed of all the modules needed to build the Record 
Management Services portion of the OpenVMS operating system.

<p>
All modules within a given facility must have unique names; no two 
modules in the same facility can have the same module name and module 
type. If, however, two modules belong to different facilities, they can 
have the same module name and type.

<p>
The VDE library stores modules from separate facilities in 
separate disk directories. Therefore, you may want to create a separate 
facility for each component of your software system that is developed 
independently.

<p>
When you create a facility, the CREATE FACILITY command first creates 
an entry for the new facility in the VDE database. It then 
creates a disk directory to hold the delta files of the facility's 
source modules. VDE uses callable CMS
<a name="index_x_172"></a>
to create a CMS library in that directory. When you later
<a name="index_x_173"></a>
create source modules in the facility, VDE uses callable CMS 
to create delta files for those modules. A delta file (which is 
identical to a CMS &quot;element&quot;) contains all past and present 
versions of your source file in a compressed form.

<p>
The CREATE FACILITY command also creates a disk directory structure 
(directory tree) for the new facility for the default stream. This 
directory structure is repeated for all streams that are successors of 
the default stream. These directories will hold all files associated 
with the facility that are stream-specific. Such files include 
clear-copy source files, object files, object libraries, executable 
images, and other derived files. For each stream, this
<a name="index_x_174"></a>
structure consists of the following directories:

<ul>
  <li> a facility root directory, which is a subdirectory of the stream 
  root directory
  <li> several facility subdirectories that will contain source files, 
  derived files, build log files, and certain other kinds of files. The 
  subdirectories that are created depend on the SET DIRECTORY commands 
  you have used as well as VDE defaults.
</ul>

<p>
If the default disk directory structure is not suitable for the new 
facility, you can defer its creation until you have defined the 
structure you want. To defer creation of the directory structure, use 
the /DEFER qualifier. Then use the SET DIRECTORY command to define the 
directory structure you want. Finally, use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE 
command to create the desired directory structure.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/DEFER</h3>
<h3>/NODEFER (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the creation of the disk directory structure for the 
new facility should be postponed. The /DEFER qualifier postpones 
creation of the disk directory structure and the /NODEFER qualifier 
causes the directory structure to be created immediately. Use the 
/DEFER qualifier when the default directory structure is inappropriate 
for the new facility.

<p>
If the /NODEFER qualifier is specified (or /DEFER is omitted), the 
CREATE FACILITY command first creates the delta-file directory for the 
facility and creates a CMS library within that directory. It
<a name="index_x_175"></a>
then creates the facility root directory for the default stream. Next 
it creates the facility subdirectories within that root directory. The 
subdirectories that are created are determined by the SET DIRECTORY 
commands entered for the stream and by the default rules of the 
VDE utility. Once the directory structure exists, source 
modules and other files can be added to the new facility. The 
directory-creation sequence is repeated for all successors of the 
default stream.

<p>
If the /DEFER qualifier is specified, the CREATE FACILITY command does 
not create the delta-file directory, nor the stream-specific root 
directories, nor the associated subdirectories. You can therefore enter 
SET DIRECTORY commands to specify the disk directories you want created 
for the facility. You then use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to 
create the directory structure on disk according to the rules specified 
by the SET DIRECTORY commands and VDE defaults.
<h3>/DELETE</h3>
<h3>/NODELETE</h3>
Controls whether the <strong>delete</strong> attribute is set for the 
new facility. This attribute allows the facility to be deleted with the 
DELETE FACILITY command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete 
attribute so that the new facility can be deleted. The /NODELETE 
qualifier clears the delete attribute so that the new facility cannot 
be deleted unless you first reset this attribute with a MODIFY FACILITY 
command. Marking a facility as /NODELETE makes it harder to 
accidentally delete the facility.

<p>
If this qualifier is not specified, VDE uses the value of the 
allow-deletion library attribute. The library allow-deletion default 
attribute can be set or reset by using the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier on 
the CREATE LIBRARY or on the MODIFY LIBRARY command.
<h3>/FROM_CMS_LIBRARY[=date-time]</h3>
Specifies that the delta-file root directory for the new facility 
already contains a CMS library and that VDE should enter all 
modules and module
<a name="index_x_176"></a>
generations present in that CMS library into the current VDE 
database. This qualifier gives you a way to automatically populate a 
VDE library with modules from an existing CMS library. If 
this qualifier is omitted, VDE creates a new CMS library in 
the facility's delta-file root directory.

<p>
If you specify the optional <strong>date-time</strong> parameter, 
VDE additionally retrieves all reservations from the CMS 
library that were created since the date and time given by that 
parameter. VDE prints warning messages for any reservations 
created earlier than this time and for any reservations whose stream 
(CMS class) cannot be ascertained. If you omit the 
<strong>date-time</strong> parameter, VDE does not retrieve 
reservations from the CMS library, only modules and generations.

<p>
This qualifier has no effect if you also specify the /DEFER qualifier. 
If you defer directory creation, you must use the /FROM_CMS_LIBRARY 
qualifier on the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command that actually creates 
the delta-file directories for the new facility.

<p>
If this qualifer is specified, all VDE streams <em>must</em> 
be created <em>prior</em> to issuing this command, and these stream 
names must match (a subset of) the CMS class names in use in the CMS 
libraries; these stream names must match the CMS classes to be uploaded 
from within the CMS library. In order to correctly establish the main 
and variant lines of descent and the correct CMS generation number 
sequence, all streams involved must be created with the appropriate 
/MAIN, /NOMAIN, /PARENT and /SUCCESSOR settings.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the new facilities are 
created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that each new 
facility has been created, that its CMS library has been created, that 
its disk directories have been created, and that the database 
transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/PROPAGATE (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOPROPAGATE</h3>
Specifies whether automatic change propagation is allowed by default 
for new modules created in this facility. /PROPAGATE causes new modules 
added to the facility to be marked as allowing automatic change 
propagation when reserved and replaced. /NOPROPAGATE marks such modules 
as not allowing change propagation. When you create new modules, you 
can override these defaults with qualifiers to the CREATE MODULE 
command.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new facility. The quoted 
remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the new facility that you want stored in the 
VDE database. Typically the remark describes the function or 
contents of the facility.

<p>
Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.

<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>CREATE FOLD mod-name [, mod-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
Specifies a module for which a fold record is to be created. The module 
name consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, 
a module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period (such as 
[FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility name is omitted, the module is 
assumed to belong to the default facility. If the type name is omitted, 
VDE creates fold records for all source modules with the 
specified module name in the given facility.

<p>
You can create fold records for more than one module by using wildcard 
characters in any of the three components of the module name. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. VDE creates fold records for the source 
modules whose names match the wildcard pattern.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A fold record is a record in the VDE database that reminds a 
user to manually &quot;fold&quot; a source change from one development 
stream into another. A fold record is created when the REPLACE or 
PERFORM REPLACEMENT command attempts to propagate a source change from 
a given development stream to one of its successors, but finds that it 
cannot automatically propagate the change because the source module has 
already diverged between the two streams. The user must then reserve 
the module in the successor stream, manually edit the change into that 
generation of the module, and then replace it. This operation is known 
as &quot;folding&quot; the change into the successor stream. Once the 
fold operation has been performed, its fold record should be deleted 
from the VDE database with the /FOLD qualifier to the REPLACE 
command or with the CANCEL FOLD command.

<p>
The CREATE FOLD command lets you manually enter a fold record into the 
VDE database. This fold record and its remark string can 
serve as a reminder to perform some action on a specified module in a 
specified stream. Once you have performed this action, you can delete 
the fold record with the CANCEL FOLD command. The new fold record 
records that some change should be propagated from the latest 
generation of the specified module in the default development stream 
into another development stream that you specify.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want a fold 
record created for each module. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to print a message for each module asking whether you 
want to create a fold record for that module. If you answer YES (or Y), 
VDE creates a fold record for it. If you answer NO (or N), 
VDE does not create a fold record for it. If you enter a 
module name with a wildcard specification, VDE asks you to 
confirm the creation of a fold record for each module whose name 
matches the wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to create the fold records without asking for 
confirmation.
<h3>/FROM_STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies the development stream from which the source change should be 
folded. The <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter gives the name of 
the stream. If you omit this qualifier, VDE determines what 
generation you want to fold by looking up the latest generation for the 
current default stream. VDE then records that you want to 
fold the change from the stream in which that generation was created.
<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=fold-ident</h3>
Specifies a fold identifier for the new fold record. Each fold record 
has a unique fold identifier so that you can distinguish between 
multiple fold records for the same module and user in the same stream. 
By default, the CREATE FOLD command assigns a unique numeric identifier 
to each fold record, such as &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and so on. 
The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier overrides this default and allows you to 
select a fold identifier of your choice, such as a mnemonic name. The 
<strong>fold-ident</strong> parameter specifies the fold identifier. It 
can be up to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name 
syntax.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed when the new fold records are 
created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that a fold 
record has been created for each specified module and that the database 
transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for each new fold record. The 
quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may 
contain any explanatory remark about the fold to be performed that you 
want stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark 
describes the function or contents of the source change to be folded 
into the new stream.

<p>
Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.
<a name="index_x_179"></a>
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies the development stream into which the source change should be 
folded. The <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter gives the name of 
the stream. This qualifier is required; if you do not specify it, 
VDE prompts you for the stream name.
<a name="index_x_180"></a>
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Specifies that the fold record be created on behalf of another user. 
The <strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the OpenVMS 
username of the other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege to use 
this qualifier.

Creates a new group definition in the VDE database. A group 
is either a source group or a build group. A source group consists of a 
set of source modules to be acted upon when the group name is specified 
with various source control commands. A build group consists of a set 
of modules to be built when the group name is specified with a BUILD 
command.

</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>CREATE GROUP group-name = mod-name [, mod-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>group-name</h3>
The name of the new group to be created. This name may be up to 39 
characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of a module to be included in the group. The module name 
consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, a 
module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period. An example 
is [FACIL]MOD1.PAS. If no facility name is specified, the current 
default facility is assumed. If no type name is specified, all source 
modules (for a source group) or all module (for a build group) with the 
given module name in the given facility are included in the group.

<p>
You can add many modules to the group with one 
<strong>mod-name</strong> parameter by specifying wildcard characters 
in any of the three components of the module name. The percent sign (%) 
in a name matches any single character in the position it occupies and 
the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. Those source modules (for a source group) or modules (for a 
build group) whose names match the wildcard pattern become members of 
the new group.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A group consists of the set of modules that are members of the group. A 
source group only consists of source modules. When the name of a source 
group is specified with the RESERVE, REPLACE, FETCH, UNRESERVE, or SHOW 
RESERVATION command, that command acts on all modules that are members 
of the group. A build group can consists of both source modules and 
derived modules, although it normally only consists of executable
<a name="index_x_184"></a>
images and other derived modules that can be the outputs of a system 
build. When the name of a build group is specified with the BUILD 
command, that command builds all modules that are members of the group.

<p>
When a new group is created, it is only defined in the default 
development stream. You can refer to the new group only from within the 
stream to which it belongs.

<p>
When you want to create the same group for more than one development 
stream, you must use the CREATE GROUP command for each stream. For each 
stream, first enter the SET STREAM command to set the development 
stream, then enter the CREATE GROUP command to create the desired group 
within the stream.

<p>
When a new development stream is created, all group definitions from 
the parent stream are copied to the child stream. If modified, the 
group definitions then evolve independently in the two development 
streams.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/BUILD</h3>
<h3>/SOURCE (default)</h3>
Specifies whether a source group or build group is created. The /SOURCE 
qualifier causes VDE to create a source group and the /BUILD 
qualifier causes VDE to create a build group. If neither 
qualifier is specified, VDE creates a source group.

<p>
Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
module matching the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters added to the 
group. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a message 
for each matching module asking whether you want that module added. If 
you answer YES (or Y), the module is added to the group. If you answer 
NO (or N), the module is not added to the group. The /NOCONFIRM 
qualifier causes VDE to add all modules matching the 
<strong>mod-name</strong> parameters to the group without asking for 
confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the new group has been 
created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that the new 
group has been created, that the requested modules are members of the 
group, and that the database transaction has committed successfully.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new group. The quoted 
remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the new group that you want stored in the 
VDE database. Typically the remark describes the purpose or 
contents of the group.
