</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of the module being created. The module name must consist of a 
module name and a module type separated by a period (as in MODNAM.FOR). 
It may optionally be preceded by a facility name enclosed in square 
brackets (as in [ACCTNG]MODNAM.FOR where ACCTNG is the facility name). 
If no facility name is specified, the module is assumed to belong to 
the current default facility. The facility name, module name, and type 
name may each be up to 39 characters long and must follow VDE 
name syntax.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The CREATE MODULE command creates a new module in the current 
VDE library. It records the new module in the VDE 
database, including its facility, name, type, remark string, and other 
attributes. Every module belongs to some facility, either the facility 
you explicitly specify or the current default facility.

<p>
Modules are classified as source modules or derived modules. A
<a name="index_x_227"></a>
<strong>source module</strong> is a text file (normally) which you 
create and modify manually with an editor. A source module can be 
reserved from and replaced into the VDE library with the 
RESERVE and REPLACE commands. The text of each source module is stored 
in a delta file within a CMS library in the form of
<a name="index_x_228"></a>
a CMS &quot;element.&quot;

<p>
By default, the CREATE MODULE command does not create the initial 
generation of a source module. Instead it records the module in the 
VDE database and reserves it for you in your default 
development stream. You must then use the REPLACE command to actually 
create the initial generation of the module. This should be the normal 
way of creating new modules once the VDE library is 
established. However, if you use the /INPUT or /FROM_DIRECTORY 
qualifier, the CREATE MODULE command creates the initial generations of 
the new modules; these qualifiers are useful when you initially 
establish your VDE library. (Note that /INPUT may not be 
available, depending on the setting of the queued-replacement option on 
the stream. If /INPUT is not accepted, you must use a subsequent 
REPLACE command to specify the contents of the module under creation.)

<p>
A <strong>derived module</strong> is a file or other entity that is
<a name="index_x_229"></a>
produced by an automated build step, such as an object module or an 
executable image. A derived module cannot be reserved or replaced. In 
most cases, VDE automatically enters derived modules into the 
VDE database when the modules are produced; you seldom need 
to enter them with the CREATE MODULE command. However, when a derived 
module needs to be entered into the database manually, you can do so 
with the /DERIVED qualifier to the CREATE MODULE command.

<p>
If a module is mistakenly created, one can use the DELETE MODULE 
command to reverse the action and delete it---the UNRESERVE command
<a name="index_x_230"></a>
 will <em>refuse</em> to delete modules that lack a first generation.

<p>
The DELETE MODULE command allows the creator of an errant module to 
correct simple mistakes---such as a misnamed module---without requiring 
unusual privileges. With the DELETE MODULE command, the creator can 
delete the module <em>prior</em> to the initial module replacement. 
DELETE MODULE will cancel the outstanding reservation on the module, 
will remove the module from any reservation session that it might be 
included in, and will prevent the module from ever appearing in the 
VDE library. For further information on the DELETE MODULE 
command, see <a href="vde_manual_013.html#vde_cmd_del_mod">DELETE MODULE</a>. (The DELETE MODULE
<a name="index_x_231"></a>
 command normally requires DELMOD
<a name="index_x_232"></a>
 privilege. In this particular situation,
<a name="index_x_233"></a>
 CREMOD privilege is sufficient to permit module deletion.)
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/BINARY</h3>
<h3>/NOBINARY (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the source module is a binary file or not. The 
/BINARY qualifier specifies that the source module is a binary 
(non-text) file. Binary source files cannot be reviewed or differenced 
with the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command because they do not consist of 
ordinary ASCII text. The /NOBINARY qualifier specifies that the source 
module is an ordinary ASCII text file. These qualifiers are only 
meaningful for source modules.

<p>
Large files that undergo extensive changes at frequent intervals, or 
are the output of a language or application, may not be suited for 
storage as standard delta files as the file delta is never used, 
occupies a considerable amount of disk space, and grows rapidly. See 
the /MARKER qualifier. Examples of files well-suited for storage as
<a name="index_x_234"></a>
marker files include most executable images, object files, Postscript 
files, and BACKUP savesets.
<h3>/CONCURRENT(default)</h3>
<h3>/NOCONCURRENT</h3>
Specifies whether the module can be reserved concurrently by more than 
one user. The /CONCURRENT qualifier allows the module to be reserved 
concurrently unless a user overrides this default with for a specific 
reservation. The /NOCONCURRENT qualifier specifies that the module 
cannot be reserved concurrently.
<h3>/DELETE</h3>
<h3>/NODELETE</h3>
Controls whether the <strong>delete</strong> attribute is set for the 
new facility. This attribute allows the facility to be deleted with the 
DELETE FACILITY command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete 
attribute so that the new facility can be deleted. The /NODELETE 
qualifier clears the delete attribute so that the new facility cannot 
be deleted unless you first reset this attribute with a MODIFY FACILITY 
command. Marking a facility as /NODELETE makes it harder to 
accidentally delete the facility.

<p>
If this qualifier is not specified, VDE uses the value of the 
allow-deletion library attribute. The library allow-deletion default 
attribute can be set or reset by using the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier on 
the CREATE LIBRARY or on the MODIFY LIBRARY command.
<h3>/DERIVED</h3>
<h3>/SOURCE (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the new module is a source module or a derived 
module. By definition, a source module is a module that can be reserved 
from and replaced into the library. The generations of each such module 
is stored in a &quot;delta file&quot; (a CMS element). Most source 
modules are text files that you modify with an editor, but 
VDE also supports binary (non-text) source modules.

<p>
A derived module is a module that is produced from source modules or 
other derived modules by an automated build step. It cannot be reserved 
or replaced, and is often ignored during command wildcard processing. 
Derived modules are automatically recorded in the
<a name="index_x_235"></a>
<a name="index_x_236"></a>
VDE database when they are produced; they are seldom entered 
into a library with the CREATE MODULE command. However, new source 
modules are not automatically recorded in the VDE database 
and must be entered into a library with the CREATE MODULE command. For 
this reason, the /SOURCE qualifier is the default.
<h3>/FROM_DIRECTORY=dir-spec</h3>
Specifies that modules be created for all files in a specified disk 
directory. The <strong>dir-spec</strong> parameter gives the 
OpenVMS directory specification of the disk directory. When this 
qualifier is specified, the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters are 
omitted, and the CREATE MODULE command creates a new module in the 
current default facility for each file in the specified directory. Each 
file becomes the initial generation of the corresponding module. The 
<strong>dir-spec</strong> parameter may also consist of a wildcarded 
file specification, in which case VDE creates a module for 
each file that matches the specification. (This feature can be used to 
create modules for only those files in a directory that have a certain 
file extension, for example.) This qualifier lets you enter a large 
number of new modules into the VDE library with a single 
command, provided that the initial versions of those modules are stored 
in a single disk directory and that all modules belong to the same 
facility.

<p>
The initial generation of each module created with this qualifier is 
inserted into (becomes the latest generation of) the stream you specify 
with the /STREAM qualifier or into the default stream if you omit the 
/STREAM qualifier. It is also inserted into all successors of that 
stream.

<p>
<strong>This qualifier requires the PERFREP privilege.</strong>
<a name="index_x_237"></a>
<h3>/HISTORY[="string"]</h3>
<h3>/NOHISTORY[="string"] (default)</h3>
Specifies the CMS history string to be associated with the module
<a name="index_x_238"></a>
and whether history information should be included in source files when 
modules are retrieved with the FETCH or RESERVE command. History 
information gives a historical record of previous changes to the module.

<p>
The /HISTORY qualifier specifies that history information should be 
included in source files by default when such files are retrieved with 
the FETCH or RESERVE command. The /NOHISTORY qualifier specifies that 
history information should be omitted. The <strong>string</strong> 
parameter to either qualifier specifies the default history string if 
the user specifies that history information should be included in a 
retrieved file. (If you specify the /NOHISTORY qualifier on the CREATE 
MODULE command, you must use the /HISTORY qualifier on the FETCH or 
RESERVE command to use the default history string.) If you do not 
specify a <strong>string</strong> parameter, VDE supplies a 
default history string that depends on the module type.

<p>
See the CMS documentation for a description of the CMS history string 
and its format.
<h3>/INPUT[=file-spec]</h3>
The /INPUT qualifier causes the CREATE MODULE command to create the 
initial generation of the new module. This qualifier is only applicable 
to source modules. The <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter gives the 
OpenVMS file specification of a file that contains the initial 
generation of the module. If the file-name part of the file 
specification is omitted, the file name is assumed to be the same as 
the module name. If the directory specification part is omitted, the 
file is assumed to be in your current default directory. If you omit 
the whole <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter, VDE creates 
the initial generation from the file in your default directory with the 
same name as the new module.

<p>
The initial generation of each module created with the /INPUT qualifier 
is inserted into (becomes the latest generation of) the stream you 
specify with the /STREAM qualifier or into the default stream if you 
omit the /STREAM qualifier. It is also inserted into all successors of 
that stream.

<p>
If neither /INPUT nor /FROM_DIRECTORY is specified, the CREATE MODULE 
command records the module in the VDE database and marks it 
as reserved to you. You must then use the REPLACE command to actually 
create the initial generation of the module. This is the preferred way 
of creating new modules once a VDE library has been 
established.

<p>
The /INPUT qualifier is rejected on any streams marked for
<a name="index_x_239"></a>
 queued replacement. To create and insert a module on a stream marked 
 for queued replacement, omit the /INPUT qualifier, and specify the file 
 to load into the new module via a REPLACE command.

<p>
<strong>This qualifier require the PERFREP privilege.</strong>
<a name="index_x_240"></a>
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the new modules have 
been created. The /LOG qualifier prints the messages and /NOLOG 
suppresses them. The messages indicate that the new modules have been 
added to the VDE library and that the database transaction 
has successfully committed.
<h3>/MARKER</h3>
<h3>/NOMARKER (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the source module uses a marker file or not. The 
/MARKER qualifier specifies that the source module uses a marker file. 
When a source module uses a marker file, the module is stored as an 
ordinary file in one of the delta-file directories. A small text file, 
called the marker file, contains the full file name of that source 
file, and this marker file is stored in the module's delta file (CMS 
element). In short, the delta file contains a small text file that 
points to the module's actual source file. The marker-file mechanism is 
normally only used for large or frequently changed binary source 
modules, for which the delta-file mechanism may give poor performance 
or use excessive disk space. Executable images, object modules, 
Postscript files, and BACKUP savesets are all example of 
&quot;source&quot; modules for which the marker-file mechanism may be 
appropriate.

<p>
The actual source files for modules that use marker files are stored
<a name="index_x_241"></a>
in a subdirectory for the module's facility within the VDE 
library's delta-file directory tree. This subdirectory must have the 
special
<a name="index_x_242"></a>
 directory symbol VDE$MARKER. See the description of
<a name="index_x_243"></a>
 the SET DIRECTORY command for an explanation of how to establish 
 subdirectories and assign them directory symbols. See the description 
 of the command SHOW DIRECTORY/DELTA for information on displaying the 
 current marker file directory (or directories) setting.

<p>
The /NOMARKER qualifier specifies that the source module does not use a 
marker file and that its text is stored directly in the delta file (CMS 
element) for the module. Ordinary ASCII text modules should not use 
marker files.

<p>
Also see the /[NO]BINARY qualifier.
<h3>/NOTES[="string"]</h3>
<h3>/NONOTES[="string"] (default)</h3>
Specifies the CMS notes string to be associated with the module and 
whether CMS notes should be included in source files when modules are 
retrieved with the FETCH or RESERVE command. CMS notes indicate in what 
module generation each source line was created.

<p>
The /NOTES qualifier specifies that notes information should be 
included in source files by default when such files are retrieved with 
the FETCH or RESERVE command. The /NONOTES qualifier specifies that 
notes information should be omitted. The <strong>string</strong> 
parameter to either qualifier specifies the default notes string if the 
user specifies that notes information should be included in a retrieved 
file. (If you specify the /NONOTES qualifier on the CREATE MODULE 
command, you must use the /NOTES qualifier on the FETCH or RESERVE 
command to use the default notes string.) If you do not specify a 
<strong>string</strong> parameter, VDE supplies a default 
notes string that depends on the module type.

<p>
See the CMS documentation for a description of the CMS notes string and 
its format.
<h3>/NOTIFY=(username [,username...])</h3>
<a name="index_x_244"></a>
Specifies users to notify of all changes to the new module. Each 
<strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the OpenVMS 
username or mail address of a user who should be notified by mail 
message each time the specified module is replaced into the 
VDE library.

<p>
Each <strong>username</strong> parameter can specify the username of a 
user already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS 
mail address with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), or a 
mail forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of 
users to notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind that the 
logical name must be defined when it is later used to send notification 
messages. It should thus be a group or system logical name or a logical 
name that is in some other way defined for all users of the 
VDE library.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter, you may 
omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/POSITION=column-number</h3>
Specifies the default column number in which CMS notes are to be placed 
when this source module is retrieved with a FETCH or RESERVE command. 
The column number must be an integer in the range 1 to 511. If this 
qualifier is omitted, the default column number is 81. This qualifier 
has no effect unless notes are enabled with the /NOTES qualifier on the 
CREATE MODULE command or on the FETCH or RESERVE command.

<p>
See the CMS documentation for a description of CMS notes and how notes 
are formatted at the ends of source lines.
<h3>/PROPAGATE</h3>
<h3>/NOPROPAGATE</h3>
Specifies whether automatic change propagation is allowed for this 
module when it is reserved and replaced into the library. /PROPAGATE 
allows automatic change propagation and /NOPROPAGATE disallows change 
propagation. If change propagation is disallowed, VDE 
automatically inhibits change propagation when the module is reserved 
or replaced as if the /NOPROPAGATE qualifier had been specified for the 
RESERVE or REPLACE command. If you omit both qualifiers, the value of 
the facility's <strong>nopopulate</strong> attribute is used to set the 
new module's <strong>propogate</strong> attribute.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new module. The quoted 
remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the new module that you want stored in the 
VDE database. Typically the remark describes the purpose or 
content of the module.

<p>
Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.
<a name="index_x_245"></a>
<h3>/REVIEWER=(username [,username...])</h3>
<a name="index_x_246"></a>
Specifies reviewers for all changes to the new module. Each 
<strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the OpenVMS 
username of a user who should review all changes to the specified 
module. The user must already be recorded in the VDE 
database. When a change to the module is replaced into the 
VDE library, VDE notifies the user of the change by 
mail message. If the replacement is queued, the user
<a name="index_x_247"></a>
should then review the queued replacement before it is performed. If 
the replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the user of the 
new module generation that was created, and the user may then inspect 
that generation.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter, you may 
omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/SESSION[=session-name]</h3>
Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations 
together, typically to group all modules related to a particular source 
code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all component 
modules reserved to be treated as a single entity for subsequent 
replacement operations. A session also allows additional modules to be 
reserved and incorporated into an existing session at a later time.

<p>
If the new module is being created such that the initial generation 
will be created by a subsequent replacement, /SESSION specifies that 
VDE should add the new module reservation to the reservation 
session given by the <strong>session-name</strong> parameter.

<p>
If no session with the specified <strong>session-name</strong> session 
name currently exists, VDE will create a new reservation 
session under the specified session name and will incorporate the 
module reservation(s) into it.

<p>
If the <strong>session-name</strong> parameter is omitted, 
VDE generates a unique session name, creates a new session by 
that name, and adds the module reservation to it.

<p>
If the /SESSION qualifier is omitted on the CREATE MODULE command, 
VDE will reserve the module (as expected), and will not add 
the new module reservation to any session.

<p>
Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE, MODIFY 
SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL SESSION 
commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on a queued-replacement 
stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be combined into the same session.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that the module be reserved for the stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter or that the initial generation 
of the module be inserted into that stream. If neither /INPUT nor 
/FROM_DIRECTORY is specified, the /STREAM qualifier causes 
VDE to mark the module as reserved for the specified stream. 
If the /INPUT or /FROM_DIRECTORY qualifier is specified, /STREAM causes 
the the initial generation of the new module to become the latest 
generation of the module for the specified stream and all its successor 
streams.

<p>
If the /STREAM qualifier is omitted, the module is reserved for or 
inserted into your current default stream.
