<p>
<em>Section under construction...</em>

<p>
After establishing your VDE library, you should set up the 
backup and recovery procedures that allow you to recover the contents 
of your VDE library in case the library is destroyed or 
damaged. A disk failure, for example, could destroy your VDE 
database or any of the associated delta files (CMS libraries). To be 
able to recover from such failures, you must establish several separate 
backup procedures. This section describes those procedures.
<a name="index_x_484"></a>
<a name="index_x_485"></a>
<a name="index_x_486"></a>
<a name="index_x_487"></a>
<a name="index_x_488"></a>
<a name="index_x_489"></a>

<a name="maint_lib_backup_oview"><h2>7.4.1 Overview of Backup Procedures</h2></a>

<p>
To establish the necessary backup procedures for your VDE 
library, you need to take the following actions:

<ul>
  <li>Place the directories and files associated with your VDE 
  library on two or more disks. In order to recover from the failure of 
  any one disk, you must have VDE backup and journal files on 
  a different disk than the disk or disks that hold the rest of your 
  VDE library.
  <li>Enable after-image journalling for your VDE database. 
  After-image journalling causes Rdb to record all changes to 
  your VDE database in a journal file. If you later must 
  restore your database from a backup, you can use the journal file to 
  &quot;roll&quot; the restored database forward until it contains all 
  changes that your lost database had just before the failure.
  <li>Edit the database backup and restore procedures that come with the 
  VDE kit to make them refer to your VDE library. 
  Place these procedures in a backup directory associated with your 
  VDE library. Configure the site-specific backup procedure to 
  execute periodically.
  <li>Make sure that someone performs regular backups of all files in 
  your VDE library using the OpenVMS BACKUP utility. 
  These backup are normally written to tape and backup tapes should 
  periodically be moved to fire storage. If your system manager or 
  operations staff performs this function for you, you need only ensure 
  that the appropriate staff knows to back up the disks that hold your 
  VDE library. Otherwise, you may have to perform such backups 
  yourself. <br>See <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup_creback">Section 7.4.4</a> for information specific to the 
  synchronization problems that are likely when attempting to use 
  OpenVMS BACKUP utility to perform backups of Rdb 
  database files such as those used by VDE.
  <li>For additional protection against disk or other hardware failures, 
  you can consider using OpenVMS shadow sets for the disks that 
  hold your VDE library and its backup files. Disk shadowing 
  is appropriate when your VDE library requires high 
  availability and when the cost of an unavailable library is high. Using 
  disk shadowing doubles the number of disks you need.
</ul>

<p>
The sections that follow describe how you perform these steps. They 
also describe how you restore your VDE database and other 
files in your VDE library in case of a failure. However, 
this manual does not further describe how to use the OpenVMS 
BACKUP utility to back up files and directory trees. Neither does it 
describe how to set up disk shadowing. For a full description of these 
topics, see the appropriate OpenVMS documentation or see your 
system manager.

Due to Rdb database transaction synchronization issues, disk

<p>
The database for your VDE library is an Oracle Rdb7 
database. (Rdb is a relational database package.) An 
Rdb database must be backed up periodically using the RMU 
utility described in the <em>Oracle Rdb7 RMU Reference Manual</em> and the 
<em>Oracle Rdb7 Guide to Database Maintenance</em>.

<p>
The OpenVMS BACKUP command can potentially take a snapshot of 
your database as it looks in the middle of an update transaction. This 
results in an invalid backup file because Rdb must preserve 
transaction semantics, meaning that an update transaction must complete 
fully or not at all.

<p>
The RMU utility, a component of the Rdb product, ensures 
that the backed-up database is internally consistent and observes 
transaction semantics, which the OpenVMS BACKUP utility cannot 
do. Unlike OpenVMS BACKUP, the RMU utility takes a consistent 
snapshot of the database as it is synchronized with any database 
transactions that might potentially be active. The RMU utility is also 
be used to back up and maintain the Rdb after-image journal 
files. These journal files allow Rdb to recover database 
transactions performed after the last backup operation.

<p>
The VDE kit contains a command procedure that you can modify 
to back up the Rdb database for your VDE library. 
This command procedure performs the appropriate RMU operations. To 
create the database backup procedure for your VDE library, 
perform the following step:

<p>
<em>Section under destruction...</em>

<p>
To back up your VDE database, you must first set up a 
database backup procedure as described in <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup_creback">Section 7.4.4</a>. In the 
present section, we will assume that this procedure is called 
VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP.COM and is found in directory JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL] 
as suggested in <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup_place">Section 7.4.2</a>. We will also assume that disk JNLDEV$ 
is your journal and backup device and that you have set up 
subdirectories [PROJ.BACKUP], [PROJ.BACKUP_OLD], and [PROJ.AIJ] as 
outlined in <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup_place">Section 7.4.2</a>.
<a name="index_x_491"></a>
<a name="index_x_492"></a>
<a name="index_x_493"></a>
<a name="index_x_494"></a>

<p>
Once your database backup procedure is in place, you can run it to 
perform full backups with database verification, full backups without 
database verification, or incremental database backups. A full backup 
saves all database information in a backup file. An incremental backup 
saves all database information that has changed since the last full 
backup in an incremental backup file. Database verification causes the 
RMU utility to check the internal structure of the Rdb 
database for consistency and validity.
<a name="index_x_495"></a>
<a name="index_x_496"></a>
<a name="index_x_497"></a>

<p>
To perform a full database backup without verification, you invoke your 
edited backup command procedure as follows:
<a name="index_x_498"></a>
<a name="index_x_499"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP FULL_NOVERIFY
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This invocation of the procedure performs a full backup of the source 
control database. It does not attempt to verify the database.

<p>
The backup procedure performs the following steps for a full backup. It 
deletes all files in the JNLDEV$:[PROJ.OLD_BACKUP] directory and then 
renames all files in the JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP] directory to the 
OLD_BACKUP directory. The previous backup files are thus preserved in 
the OLD_BACKUP directory so they cannot be lost in case the current 
backup operation fails. Next, the RMU/BACKUP command performs a full 
database backup, producing the Rdb backup file 
VDE$DATABASE_FULL.RBF in the BACKUP directory. An &quot;online 
backup&quot; is used, meaning that other users can use the 
VDE database while it is being backed up. Finally, the 
active after-image journal file is backed up to the BACKUP directory 
under the name VDE$DATABASE_FULL.AIJ, after which the active journal 
file is set to be empty. After all this is done, the BACKUP directory, 
along with the active journal file in directory JNLDEV$:[PROJ.AIJ], 
contains all files needed to fully recover the VDE database.

<p>
If you want to perform a full backup and also verify the database 
(using the RMU/VERIFY command), invoke the backup procedure as follows:
<a name="index_x_500"></a>
<a name="index_x_501"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP FULL
</pre>
</font>
</table>

For a large database, verification can be very time-consuming. You 
should nevertheless verify the database periodically, such as weekly.

<p>
If you omit the FULL parameter on the command line, you get a FULL 
database backup by default.

<p>
An incremental backup saves all changes to your database since the last 
full backup in an incremental backup file. To perform an incremental 
backup of the database, enter the following command:
<a name="index_x_502"></a>
<a name="index_x_503"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP INCREMENTAL
</pre>
</font>
</table>

For an incremental backup, the backup procedure invokes RMU to perform 
an online incremental backup of the database. The output file is file 
VDE$DATABASE_INCR.RBF in the BACKUP directory. This file contains all 
changes since the last full backup. An incremental backup normally 
takes substantially less time than a full backup. How much less depends 
on how much your database has been changed since the last full backup.

<p>
By default, the VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP procedure displays the inputs and 
outputs of the backup operation and asks you to confirm that those are 
the right inputs and outputs. You must then answer YES if you want the 
backup operation to proceed. This is an example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP FULL_NOVERIFY
    The backup operation will be performed using the following
    device and directory specifications:
 
    The location of the database to back up is LIBDEV$:[PROJROOT]
    The database will be backed up to JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP]
    Existing backup files on JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP] will be renamed
        to JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP_OLD] before the backup starts
    The definition of VDE$JOURNAL is JNLDEV$:[PROJ.AIJ]
 
Do you want to continue with the database backup? (Y or N) : Y
</pre>
</font>
</table>

To suppress the request for confirmation, you can add the keyword 
NOQUERY to the end of the command line invoking the procedure. For 
example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP FULL NOQUERY
</pre>
</font>
</table>

You always need the NOQUERY keyword when you run the backup procedure 
in a batch job.

<p>
Because database backups should be performed regularly, the normal way 
to perform them is to submit a command procedure that runs every night 
to perform a full backup once a week and incremental backups the other 
nights. To start this command procedure, enter the following DCL 
command:
<a name="index_x_504"></a>
<a name="index_x_505"></a>
<a name="index_x_506"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SUBMIT /LOG=JNLDEV$:[PROJ.LOG]NIGHTLY_VDE_BACKUP.LOG -
_$       /NOPRINT/KEEP/RESTART/AFTER="TOMORROW+1:00" -
_$       JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]NIGHTLY_VDE_BACKUP.COM
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command procedure resubmits itself each time it runs. You should 
therefore not need to restart it manually unless batch queues have been 
lost due to a system failure. In this example, the SUBMIT command 
causes the procedure to run at 1:00 am the following night. That is 
also the time that the procedure restarts itself on subsequent nights.

<p>
The database backup operations must produce backup and journal files on 
a disk (JNLDEV$: in these examples) different from the disk or disks 
containing the VDE library and the VDE database. 
Because the backup files are on disk, they are immediately available 
for restoring the VDE database after a failure. However, the 
backup disk must itself be backed up to tape (using the OpenVMS 
BACKUP utility) on a regular basis.

<p>
The following example illustrates the output that you will get when you 
back up your database:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>

    The database will be backed up to JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP]
    Existing backup files on JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP] will be renamed
        to JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP_OLD] before the backup starts
    The definition of VDE$JOURNAL is JNLDEV$:[PROJ.AIJ]

<a name="maint_lib_backup_restore"><h2>7.4.7 Restoring the VDE Database</h2></a>

<p>
If a failure has corrupted or damaged your VDE database, you 
must restore the database before your VDE library becomes 
usable again. As described in <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup_place">Section 7.4.2</a>, the backup files needed 
to restore the database are found in the JNLDEV$:[PROJ.BACKUP] 
directory and the after-image journal file that records all 
transactions since the last backup is found in the JNLDEV$:[PROJ.AIJ] 
directory. The present section also assumes that you have set up the 
command procedure VDE_DATABASE_RESTORE.COM in directory 
JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL] as described in <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup_crerest">Section 7.4.5</a>. Given that, you can 
restore the VDE database and recover all journalled 
transactions by entering the following DCL command:
<a name="index_x_507"></a>
<a name="index_x_508"></a>
<a name="index_x_509"></a>
<a name="index_x_510"></a>

      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_RESTORE
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command procedure runs the RMU utility to first restore the 
VDE database and to then recover all journalled 
transactions. After this procedure has run, you should have a fully 
functional and completely up-to-date VDE database. You must 
have the OpenVMS SYSPRV privilege to perform these steps.
<a name="index_x_513"></a>
<a name="index_x_514"></a>
<a name="index_x_515"></a>
<a name="index_x_516"></a>

<p>
If this procedure cannot restore the database, you should determine 
why. If the reason is that the BACKUP directory is not correctly set 
up, you may have to restore the BACKUP directory from the OLD_BACKUP 
directory or from a backup tape. If you do so, you must be sure that 
you do not lose any after-image journal files. You need all journal 
files used to log transactions since the backup files you are using 
were created and these journal files must be applied to the database in 
order by date to avoid loss of transactions. After setting up the 
BACKUP directory, you should be able to rerun the command procedure. If 
all else fails, you may have to restore the database using the RMU 
utility directly. See the <em>VAX Rdb/VMS RDO and RMU Reference 
Manual</em> for detailed descriptions of the RMU/RESTORE and 
RMU/RECOVER commands.

<p>
By default, the VDE_DATABASE_RESTORE procedure displays the inputs and 
outputs of the restore operation and asks you to confirm that those are 
the right inputs and outputs. You must then answer YES if you want the 
restore operation to proceed. This example illustrates this behavior:

<p>
If the after-image journal file for your VDE database 
becomes unavailable due to a disk failure or other cause, nobody will 
be able to use the database and VDE operations will fail. To 
recover from this condition, you must close, alter, back up, and 
restore the database. The following sequence of commands will perform 
the necessary operations:
<a name="index_x_517"></a>
<a name="index_x_518"></a>
<a name="index_x_519"></a>
<a name="index_x_520"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RMU/CLOSE/ABORT=DELPRC LIBDEV$:[PROJ]VDE$DATABASE
$ RMU/OPEN  LIBDEV$:[PROJ]VDE$DATABASE
$ RMU/CLOSE LIBDEV$:[PROJ]VDE$DATABASE
$ ! RMU/ALTER for versions of Rdb before V6.0...
$ RMU/ALTER LIBDEV$:[PROJ]VDE$DATABASE
RdbALTER&gt; DEPOSIT ROOT AIJ_FILENAME = ""
RdbALTER&gt; COMMIT
RdbALTER&gt; EXIT
$ ! RMU/SET for Rdb version V6.0 and later...
$ RMU/SET AFTER_JOURNAL LIBDEV$:[PROJ]VDE$DATABASE/DISABLE
$ ! 
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_BACKUP FULL_NOVERIFY
$ @JNLDEV$:[PROJ.TOOL]VDE_DATABASE_RESTORE
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The first RMU/CLOSE command closes the database; it deletes all user 
processes attached to the database and denies access to new users. Any 
transactions the deleted processes had in progress are lost. The 
RMU/OPEN command rolls back any such transactions, thus making the 
database consistent. The second RMU/CLOSE command closes the database 
so that new users cannot access it. The RMU/ALTER command prepares the 
database to be altered. The DEPOSIT ROOT AIJ_FILENAME = "" command sets 
the database root file to have after-image journaling turned off. This 
will permit the database to be backed up. The COMMIT command causes the 
DEPOSIT command to be committed. The EXIT command then exits from the 
RMU/ALTER utility.
<a name="index_x_521"></a>
<a name="index_x_522"></a>
<a name="index_x_523"></a>
<a name="index_x_524"></a>

<p>
The next command backs up the database (without verifying it since 
verification can be very time-consuming) and the last command restores 
the database from the backup file. Restoring the database creates a new 
after-image journal file, so it should only be done when the failed 
disk is available again or a new disk is substituted. After this is 
done, the database should be fully functional.

<p>
You must have the SYSPRV privilege to perform this recovery procedure.
<a name="index_x_525"></a>

<p>
If you want to place the after-image journal file on a different disk 
than the original location, you need to specify the new journal file 
immediately after performing the above recovery procedure. To do so, 
use the VDE MODIFY LIBRARY command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ VDE MODIFY LIBRARY/JOURNAL=NEWDEV$:[PROJ.AIJ]
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This operation should be done before any operations are done that 
update the VDE database.

<p>
Note that the after-image journal file becomes unavailable if the disk 
holding it runs out of space. To prevent this situation, the journal 
file should be placed on a disk with ample space. However, if the 
journal file still runs out of space, you should close, open, close, 
and alter the database as just described, and then delete the journal 
file. After that, you can back up and restore the database to make it 
functional again. The restore operation will create a new, initially 
empty journal file.
