<p>
The release project leader menu provides an interface to perform 
functions which manipulate the VDE VMS Source Control (VSC) Database 
and it's underlying CMS libraries. The operations available from the 
menu are usually performed by a release project leader or by a builder. 
Most of the menu functions require special VDE privileges not available 
to the general VMS developer. The primary purpose of the menu is to 
provide a convenient means for the release project leader to maintain 
the integrity between the VMS source control environment and the VMS 
system building environment.

<p>
The VSC tool is used for source control of VMS versions. VSC uses a RDB 
database to track reservations, replacements and other updates to a VMS 
version. VSC uses CMS libraries to store the actual source code changes 
for a version. Presently, there are over two hundrec CMS libraries 
maintained on the masterpack. Each CMS library contains CMS classes 
which mirror a VSC stream stored in the RDB database. Maintenance of 
the CMS classes requires much overhead in terms of I/O and processing 
time. Due to this overhead, the CMS classes are not completely 
maintained by VSC. + VSC will not update CMS classes on many 
version-wide operations such as stream creation, stream population and 
stream renaming. The project leader menu provides a convenient means to 
perform CMS commands on the many CMS libraries to mirror the VSC 
command. Failure to successfully perform the CMS commands can cause 
problems between source control and system building.

<p>
VMS system building requires a CMS class representing the target 
version to build. Typically a build stream is created from a snapshot 
of a development stream. The build stream is used as the target version 
of a system build. Creating a build stream currently requires over 
eleven thousand RDB table updates and over eleven thousand 
corresponding CMS insert generation commands in the VMS masterpack CMS 
libraries. In addition, the CMS class must be created in all applicable 
CMS libraries before performing the insert generations. The project 
leader menu provides a method to create, populate and rename build 
streams.
<p>
<a name="sh_cmsclsss"><strong>UPDATE: CMS Classes are optional for streams created after January 1993</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
VMS development projects can now chose not to maintain CMS classes for 
their build streams. The VMS build procedures and the Project Leader 
Menu tools have been modified to fetch all generations of the VMS 
source code using the VDE database alone. The behaviour of the build, 
and of the tools, is determined by the value of a logical, 
VDE$FETCH_METHOD. If VDE$FETCH_METHOD is "VDE", then the tools and the 
build procedures will maintain only the VDE library with the build 
stream generations.

<p>
<strong>It is important to define the VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical in the 
LOGIN.COM file for the account that will be creating, populating, 
renaming and building streams.</strong> The logical must be defined for 
the batch jobs submitted by the PLMENU tools and the logical must be 
defined for the VMS build batch jobs.

<p>
Stream creation, population and renaming is significantly faster for 
streams that do not maintain CMS classes in all the VMS facility 
libraries. For example, to create a build class for the CORAL(V6.1) 
stream, takes about 6 hours with the CMS classes and about 40 minutes 
without the CMS classes. Stream population times are also drastically 
reduced. The source fetching during the build is also more 
efficient(faster) using the VDE subprocess to fetch the sources rather 
than image activating CMS to perform each fetch operation.

<p>
<strong>Why should you use the project leader menu?</strong>

<p>
Below as reasons why you should use the menu for masterpack operations:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>The menu provides a means to perform operations that cannot be 
  completely executed using VSC alone or CMS alone. Some operations, such 
  as renaming a stream, require execution of a VSC MODIFY STREAM /NAME 
  command and execution of a CMS MODIFY CLASS/NAME command for every CMS 
  library.
  <li>Consistency between the VSC stream and the underlying CMS class is 
  better maintained using the project leader menu.
  <li>The menu tools provide increased performance over VSC for 
  stream-wide operations.
  <li>The menu provides safeguards against initiating operations that 
  would lock out other update usage on the masterpack during regular 
  working hours.
  <li>Use of the menu provides for a consistent stream naming convention 
  across VMS versions.
  <li>Free disk space on the VMS masterpack is a valuable commodity. The 
  CMS history produced by the project leader tools is tagged with a 
  special string to allow purging the CMS history without losing valuable 
  historic events in the library.
</ol>

<p>
 The project leader menu consists of ten options. Masterpack operations 
 should be performed on the STAR VMS production cluster. Following is an 
 example of how to invoke the menu on the STAR cluster:

<p>
This section describes prompts which are common to most of the PLMENU 
options. The logical names referenced in this section can be assigned 
values with the Set/Show PLMENU logicals option of the menu.

<p>
The project leader menu functions are performed by batch jobs which are 
submitted for you by the menu. Batch jobs are used because the 
functions of the menu take minutes or hours to complete. There are five 
questions which are asked by all the menu options to control the batch 
job attributes.
<p>
<a name="sh_cmmnprmts"><strong>Common Prompts</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
There are five prompts common to the PLMENU functions.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product Root [VMS$]</strong>: The product root defines the 
  VDE database and the CMS libraries that are to be processed. The 
  product root will default to VMS$. You can override this default value 
  by defining the logical name PLMENU$DEFAULT_PRODUCT to another value. 
  The valid product roots available are TOOLS$, VMS$ and VMSTEST$.
  <li><strong>Queue to submit job [SYS$LOBUILD]</strong>: You must give a 
  queue in which to run the batch job. The batch queue will default to 
  SYS$LOBUILD. You can override the queue default value by defining the 
  logical name PLMENU$DEFAULT_BATCH_QUEUE to another value. Note that 
  using the SYS$LOBUILD and SYS$BUILD queues requires you to hold the 
  SYSTEM_BUILDER process rights identifier.
  <li><strong>Directory for log and work files? [default]</strong>: This 
  prompt defines where the log file produced by the submitted batch job 
  will be located. Some of the menu options, like populate a build 
  stream, produce work files. The work files produced by a submitted job 
  will be located in this directory. The directory will default to your 
  current default directory. You can override the directory default by 
  defining the logical name PLMENU$DEFAULT_DIRECTORY to another value.
  <li><strong>Time to submit job? [default]</strong>: The batch job will 
  be submitted to begin execution at the time specified by the answer to 
  this prompt. The default value to this prompt varies depending on what 
  menu option you are performing. The default submission time for a new 
  stream create is usually midnight(it's the current time if you are 
  working on weekends or between midnight and 3:00AM on weekdays). The 
  default submit time for a VDE/CMS stream comparison is "NOW" (submit 
  the job immediately).
  <li><strong>Do you wish to proceed? [default]</strong>: Each option 
  displays a summary of the job to be submitted and asks for your 
  confirmation to proceed.

<a name="create_build"><h1>Chapter 3<br>Creating a New Build Stream</h1></a>
</font>

<p>
Creating a new stream is one of the most expensive operations performed 
on the VMS master pack. Over 11,000 RDB updates and 11,000 CMS updates 
are needed to create the new stream. Due to this overhead, it is 
undesirable to create a new build stream during working hours. The 
create stream option of the menu prompts you for all the information 
necessary to successfully create a build stream in the VSC database and 
the masterpack CMS libraries.

<p>
    This option of the menu should always be used to create new build 
    streams, regardless of whether CMS classes are maintained or are not 
    maintained for the build stream. The create build stream option avoids 
    locking up the VDE database by breaking the create stream into two 
    separate transactions. To create a stream in the VDE database only, 
    remember to have the logical VDE$FETCH_METHOD define to "VDE" before 
    invoking the menu. NOTE: A CMS class is still created in the 
    VMS$:[SYS.CMS] library because of the system base level updating 
    procedures.

<p>
The VDE CREATE STREAM command executes as a single transaction. If the 
VDE CREATE STREAM command is used to create AND POPULATE a new stream, 
the transaction creating the stream locks out all other write access to 
much of the VDE database. This lockout would be from 30 to 40 minutes 
for the current development stream size(V6.0 &amp; CORAL).

<p>
The create stream option uses the VDE CREATE STREAM command with the 
/NOGENERATIONS qualifier. This qualifier tells VDE to not insert any of 
the generations from the parent stream into the newly created stream. 
This transaction takes about 1 minute. The VDE POPULATE STREAM command 
is then used to insert the parent stream module generations into the 
new stream. The POPULATE STREAM command uses many transactions to 
insert small sets of generations into the new stream. The small 
transactions allow other write access users to update the database 
while the populate is in progress. For more information on the VDE 
CREATE STREAM command, consult the VDE reference manual.
<p>
<a name="sh_rqrdprvl_ns"><strong>Required Privileges</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
The create build stream option requires that the user hold the VDE 
privileges <strong>CRESTRM and PERFREP</strong> and the process rights 
identifiers <strong>VMS_ENABLE_CMS and VMS_SOURCE</strong>. If the user 
does not hold these privileges, the submitted batch job will fail.

<a name="h1_icbs"><h1><font color=maroon>3.1 Invoking the create build stream procedure</font></h1></a>

<p>
To create a new build stream, select option one from the main menu. The 
create build stream command procedure executes.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
What action do you want to perform? (1-6,EXIT,HELP): 1 
 
Create Build Stream Version X-1 
 
Enter ? or "HELP" at any prompt to obtain help 
Prompt default values (if any) appear in brackets [] 
Enter &lt;Ctrl Z&gt;, "Quit" or "Exit" to exit immediately 
 
 Product Root [VMS$]: 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Enter the product root. See <a href="plmenu.html#general">Chapter 2</a> for a definition of product 
root.

<p>
The next prompt asks you for the parent stream of the build stream. The 
parent stream is the stream for which the build stream is to be a 
snapshot. The parent stream module generations are used to populate the 
new build stream. The build stream will be marked as a descendent of 
the parent stream. The parent defaults to the value of logical name 
PLMENU$DEFAULT_SOURCE_STREAM. In the example below, the user enters 
stream V5.5 to create a new build stream for version V5.5.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
Parent stream for new build stream [V5.4]: V5.5 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
After you enter the parent stream you will be asked to supply the new 
build stream name. It is a convention in VMS that the build stream name 
begin with the development stream name followed by the string "_BLD" 
and a suffix. Please try to adhere to this convention. In the example 
below, the new stream is named "V5.5_BLD_Z". You can define the logical 
PLMENU$DEFAULT_TARGET_STREAM to suppy a default value to this prompt.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
 Enter the new build stream name [V5.5_BLD0]: V5.5_BLD_Z 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
The create stream procedure now asks for a remark string to be 
associated with the new build stream. This remark string is used for 
the CMS classes and the VDE stream remark. This remark is displayed by 
a VSC show stream or CMS show class command. Enter a remark string (no 
quotes) if you do not like the default remark.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
Remark string for V5.5_BLD_Z [Build stream for V5.5]: 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You are now asked for the work directory into which to place the log 
file and work files produced by the procedure. The submitted job name 
is formatted as CREATE_'new_build_stream_name'. In our example the job 
name is CREATE_V55_BLD_Z. Periods are removed from the build stream 
string in the job name.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>

</table>

<p>
Enter the batch queue to submit the creation job at the next prompt.

</table>

<p>
The procedure prompts you for the time to begin the create job. On 
weekdays, you are warned of possible masterpack disk contentions if you 
choose a time between 3:00AM and 11:59PM. You may submit the job at the 
entered time if you answer affirmatively to the "Do you want to submit 
the job anyway?" question.

Due to lock conflicts and disk contention on the master pack, this job should 
be submitted after 12:00AM and before 3:00AM on working days.  It is strongly 
advised to avoid creating a stream during regular working hours. 
 
 Do you want to submit the job anyway? [N]:BACK

The batch job submitted by the create stream procedure performs the 
following steps to create a build stream:

<ol type=i start=1>
  <li>Creates a CMS build class for all facilities which contain the 
  parent class and which are not marked archived or marked no propagation.
  <li>Checks if there is a facility whose name matches the parent stream 
  name. If a match is found, the CMS build class is created in the 
  matched facility even if the facility is marked no propagation.
  <li>Creates an empty (no module generations) build stream in the VDE 
  database.
  <li>Populates the build stream from the parent stream module 
  generations. The population method used is identical to the stream 
  population processing described in <a href="plmenu_001.html#pop_stream">Chapter 4</a>.
</ol>

<a name="h1_crsp_sugg"><h1><font color=maroon>3.3 Suggestions for creating new build streams</font></h1></a>

<p>

<ul>
  <li>It's a good idea to plan ahead and create build streams before you 
  actually need them, but don't create more than you need!
  <li> Please coordinate your stream creations with other VMS development 
  projects so that your stream creation does not interfere with a system 
  build or with other stream creations.
  <li>It is not useful to attempt to create more than one build stream at 
  the same time because there will be many conflicts on the masterpack. 
  If you need to create multiple streams it is suggested that you space 
  the submit times by at least four hours.
  <li>If the create a stream batch job fails, the recovery steps vary 
  depending upon where the job failed.

  <ul>
    <li>If the job fails before the VDE stream is created, rerun the create 
    a stream procedure from the menu and use the same input. The restarted 
    batch job may give you warnings that the CMS class already exists in 
    some facilities.
    <li>If the batch job fails after the VDE stream is created, use the 
    populate stream option of the menu to populate your new stream from the 
    parent stream.
    <li>If your job fails due to a privilege problem, you need your VMS or 
    VDE user profile changed to include all the privileges and identifiers 
    noted in the beginning of this chapter.
