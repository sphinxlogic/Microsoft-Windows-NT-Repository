</font>

<p>
<em>This chapter contains preliminary information; sections are 
currently under construction... And other sections are currently 
undergoing demolition...</em>

<p>
This chapter describes how to set up a new VDE library by 
creating its database, setting up its disk directory structure, and 
populating it with users, development streams, facilities, and source 
modules. These commands must be performed before VDE can be 
used to manage the source code or or build the software system.

<p>
Commands and operations described in this section are normally 
performed only by the maintainers of the source code control libraries, 
by the database maintainance staff, or by the maintainers of 
VDE. These commands are also used by those users that wish to 
maintain private libraries using VDE.

<p>
Information pertaining to the tailoring and to the performance of 
VDE database backup operations is included in <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup">Section 7.4</a>. 
Once you have created the library, you should establish the appropriate 
backup procedures, and determine the appropriate backup scheduling.

<p>
A VDE library consists of various components: a root 
directory, a VDE database, and a disk directory tree. The 
<strong>root directory</strong> is the disk directory that contains the 
VDE database and that normally serves as the root directory 
for the remaining disk directories in the library. The 
<strong>VDE database</strong> is a Oracle Rdb7 database 
which stores all information that VDE needs about your 
software system. Rdb is a relational database management 
system, and VDE reads and writes the VDE database 
using SQL, and industry-standard query language for relational 
databases. The library's <strong>directory tree</strong> consists of 
all disk directories that hold the CMS libraries, source files, build 
output files, and other files that comprise your software system. The 
VDE database records the locations of all directories in the 
directory tree.
<a name="index_x_287"></a>
<a name="index_x_288"></a>
<a name="index_x_289"></a>
<a name="index_x_290"></a>

<p>
To create a VDE library, you must first create the root 
directory and the VDE database. Thereafter, VDE can 
create the rest of the directory tree for you, depending on what 
facilities and development streams you need for your software system. 
VDE can create the directory tree using its own default 
rules, but you can also explicitly specify how you want the directory 
tree created.

Once you have successfully created a VDE library, you should 
tailor or create the procedures necessary to perform periodic database 
backup operations. See <a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup">Section 7.4</a> for details. </font>

<a name="estab_lib_upload_cmd"><h2>6.1.1 The VDE$UPLOAD CMS Upload Utility</h2></a>

<p>
VDE includes a utility, VDE$UPLOAD, that can perform the 
entire creation of a VDE database, based on the specification 
of a directory containing one or more CMS libraries.
<a name="index_x_291"></a>

<p>
The contents of all of the CMS libraries under the target directory are 
uploaded into VDE, including converting the specified CMS 
classes into VDE streams.

<p>
For information on VDE$UPLOAD, see the VDE Reference Manual.
<a name="index_x_292"></a>
<a name="index_x_293"></a>
<a name="index_x_294"></a>
<a name="index_x_295"></a>
<a name="index_x_296"></a>
<a name="index_x_297"></a>
<a name="index_x_298"></a>

<p>
As an alternative to the VDE$UPLOAD procedure, the VDE 
database can be created via a series of manual commands. An example is 
included in the kit, the VDE$CREATE procedure. For further information 
on this, see <a href="vde_guide_012.html#estab_cms_upload">Section 6.7.3</a>.
<a name="index_x_299"></a>

<a name="estab_lib_cre_lib_cmd"><h2>6.1.2 The CREATE LIBRARY Command</h2></a>

<p>
To create the root directory and the VDE database, use the 
CREATE LIBRARY command. This command creates the root directory you 
specify, creates and initializes a VDE database in that 
directory, and sets up an initial facility and an initial stream in the 
library. In short, it creates the minimal usable VDE library. 
The following example illustrates the command syntax:
<a name="index_x_300"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE LIBRARY DEV$:[ROOTDIR] /NAME=LIBNAME /CREATOR="John Doe" -
_VDE„                              /REMARK="Library for gadget development"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example creates a VDE library with root directory 
DEV$:[ROOTDIR]. After creating the root directory, VDE 
creates the library's VDE database in that directory and 
records a library name, the library creator, a remark string, and 
certain other attributes in the database. (The library name is LIBNAME 
and the library creator is John Doe in this example.) You should expect 
library creation to take at least two to ten minutes of elapsed time, 
depending on your system configuration and load. The bulk of this time 
is required to create and initialize the Rdb database.

<p>
It is strongly recommended that you use a system-wide concealed logical 
name for the disk name so that you can move the VDE library 
to another disk at a later time by simply moving the library's files 
and directories and redefining the logical name. The VDE 
database records the device names and full directory specifications of 
numerous subdirectories within the root directory. This makes it 
difficult to move the VDE library to another disk unless a 
concealed logical name is used to denote the disk. It should be a 
system-wide name so it is accessible to all users of the VDE 
library. A group-wide concealed logical name is acceptable if all 
users, present and future, will belong to the same UIC group.

<p>
The CREATE LIBRARY command establishes a default facility called CODE 
in your library. For a simple software system, you can use this 
facility for your source code and then set up other facilities for 
tools, specifications, and documentation as needed. For a more complex 
software system, you can delete the CODE facility and create other 
facilities that better suit your needs. In addition, the CREATE LIBRARY 
command creates a default development stream called MAIN. You can use 
this stream for your main development thread unless your software 
system requires a more complex stream structure. Stream MAIN is the 
ancestor of all other streams you create as the library evolves.

<p>
When you enter the CREATE LIBRARY command, you are required to specify 
the desired library root directory, the library name, the name of the 
library creator (your own first and last names), and a remark string. 
The root directory name is the command parameter while the library 
name, creator name, and remark string are specified with qualifiers. 
VDE stores the library name and remark string in the 
&quot;database header record&quot; in the Rdb database. 
Because you are the library creator, VDE records your full 
name (as specified with the /CREATOR qualifier) and your OpenVMS 
user name in a User Table entry in the database. A field in the 
database header record points to your User Table entry to indicate that 
you created the library.

<p>
If you omit any required item, VDE prompts you for its value. 
The following example illustrates how VDE prompts for 
information if all required items are omitted:
<a name="index_x_301"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE LIBRARY
Enter directory specification for the new library: DEV$:[ROOTDIR]
Enter the name you want for the new library: LIBNAME
Enter your full name (first and last names): John Doe
Enter the remark for new library: Library for gadget development
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example creates exactly the same library as the previous example.

<p>
By default, the CREATE LIBRARY command creates the initial directory 
tree for your library. VDE creates a <strong>delta-file root 
directory</strong> called VDE$CMS.DIR within the library root 
directory. The delta-file root directory will contain one subdirectory 
for each facility in your software system to hold the facility's CMS 
library. Each CMS library will hold CMS elements, also called 
&quot;delta files,&quot; to contain all generations of each source 
module in a condensed form. VDE accesses these CMS libraries 
using callable CMS.

<p>
VDE creates one <strong>stream root directory</strong> and 
associated directory tree for each development stream in your system. 
Because the CREATE LIBRARY command always creates stream MAIN, it also 
creates the root directory and directory tree for that stream by 
default. The stream MAIN root directory is named MAIN.DIR and is a 
subdirectory of the library root directory.

<p>
The CREATE LIBRARY command also creates the <strong>staging area 
directories</strong> for the library. The top-level of this directory 
tree is called VDE$STAGE.DIR, and is a subdirectory of the library root 
directory. VDE uses subdirectories of the staging area 
directories to store, or &quot;stage,&quot; source files for queued 
replacements. <a href="vde_guide_003.html#queued_repl">Queued Replacements</a> describes queued replacements and how they 
use staging area directories.
<a name="index_x_302"></a>
<a name="index_x_303"></a>

<p>
By default, the CREATE LIBRARY command creates the directories just 
described for the new library. It also creates the CMS library for 
facility CODE. However, you can defer directory creation by specifying 
the /DEFER qualifier with the CREATE LIBRARY command. /DEFER causes 
VDE to not create any directories other than the library root 
directory and to not create the CMS library for facility CODE. You can 
then use the SET DIRECTORY command to specify where you want these 
deferred directories to be created (see <a href="vde_guide_010.html#estab_lib_dir">Section 6.3</a>). After entering 
all desired SET DIRECTORY commands, you can enter the CREATE 
DIRECTORY_TREE command to actually create the directory tree (or 
various components thereof) for your library. Using this method, you 
can specify that some directories be placed on other disks, for 
example, or that each facility get additional subdirectories. 
<a href="vde_guide_010.html#estab_lib_dir">Section 6.3</a> describes how to use these capabilities.

<p>
The CREATE LIBRARY command also specifies a number of other library 
attributes. These attributes include the default and authorized 
VDE privileges that new users are assigned, information on 
how new users are added to the library, whether the RESERVE command 
displays the expected CMS generation expression for the corresponding 
replacement, whether the REPLACE command requests information files by 
default, and various other attributes. <a href="vde_guide_009.html#estab_lib_opt">Section 6.2</a> gives more detail 
on these attributes. If you do not specify these optional attributes 
with the CREATE LIBRARY command, VDE provides default 
settings. You can modify all such settings later with the MODIFY 
LIBRARY command. You can also use the MODIFY LIBRARY command to change 
the library name and remark string. The only attribute you cannot 
change with MODIFY LIBRARY is the library root directory.

In this example, VDE creates a new library in root directory 
DEV$:[ROOTDIR]. The library has name LIBNAME and the library creator is 
named John Doe. The VDE output shows that VDE has 
created the library root directory (which turned out to already exist 
in this case), the VDE database, the VDE staging 
area directories, the delta-file directory tree including the CMS 
library for facility CODE, and the directory tree for stream MAIN. The 
new VDE library thus has the initial facility CODE and the 
initial stream MAIN fully set up. There are no modules in the library, 
however, and only one allowed user (the creator John Doe) is recorded 
in the library database.

<p>
In the following example, the library is created the same way except 
that the library creator (Jane Smith) specifies the /DEFER qualifier to 
defer the creation of the library directory tree and the CMS library 
for facility CODE. In addition, all required parameters and qualifiers 
are omitted from the command line. As a result, VDE prompts 
for all required information:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE LIBRARY /DEFER

Enter the name you want for the new library: LIBNAME
Enter your full name (first and last names): Jane Smith
Enter the remark for new library: Library remark string
Library LIBNAME to be created in root directory DEV$:[ROOTDIR]
   Library root directory DEV$:[ROOTDIR] has been created.
   Logical name VDE$LIBRARY now points to the new library.
   Creating library database; please wait...
   Library database has been created.
 
Library creation completed.
 
VDE„
</pre>
</font>
</table>

As the output shows, VDE creates the library root directory 
and the library database, but does not create the rest of the directory 
tree. The user thus has the opportunity to modify the directory 
structure and its exact locations with SET DIRECTORY commands before 
using CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE commands to create the directory tree.

<p>
The following example shows the VDE library creation, as well 
as a number of other ancillary steps involved.

<a name="estab_lib_opt"><h1><font color=maroon>6.2 Optional Library Attributes and Settings</font></h1></a>

<p>
There are a number of library attributes that you can optionally set 
with the CREATE LIBRARY command. These attributes all have default 
values (which is why their specification is optional) and most of them 
can be altered later with the MODIFY LIBRARY command. However, before 
you specify the CREATE LIBRARY command, you should consider whether you 
need to set these optional attributes.

When dealing with critical libraries, it is strongly recommended that 
the staging area directories, the CMS libraries (the delta files) and 
the VDE database each be kept on a unique disk spindle or 
unique disk shadowset. Further, Rdb should be run with multiple files, 
and these component files should also be spread across unique disk 
spindles or shadowsets. </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<a name="estab_lib_opt_db_placmnt"><h2>6.2.1 Database Placement</h2></a>

<p>
One attribute you must consider before creating the VDE 
library is the placement of the VDE database. The 
VDE database consists of three files: a database root file, a 
storage area file, and a snapshot file file. (These three files use the 
file extention types RDB, RDA, and SNP, respectively.)
<a name="index_x_309"></a>
<a name="index_x_310"></a>
<a name="index_x_311"></a>

<p>
The database root file (VDE$DATABASE.RDB) must reside in the 
VDE library root directory; the library root directory is by 
definition the directory that contains the database root file. This 
file is small, however; it only contains information that Rdb 
needs to manage the database.

<p>
The database storage area file (VDE$DATABASE.RDA) contains the actual 
data that VDE keeps about your software system. This file can 
be quite large, its actual size depending on the size of your software 
system.

<p>
The snapshot file (VDE$DATABASE.SNP) retains the information necessary 
to support concurrent access to the database. This file can also be 
relatively large.

<p>
By default, VDE places all three files in your VDE 
library's root directory. However, if your software system is 
sufficiently large or sufficiently active, you should place the storage 
area (RDA) and snapshot (SNP) files on seperate disk spindles or disk 
seperate shadow sets.
<a name="index_x_312"></a>

<p>
To relocate the storage and snapshot areas, specify the desired 
directory for each on the CREATE LIBRARY /DATABASE and /SNAPSHOT 
qualifiers. If /SNAPSHOT is <em>not</em> specified, the snapshot file 
will be coresident in the /DATABASE database directory. If neither 
qualifier is specified, all three database files will be coresident.
<a name="index_x_313"></a>
<a name="index_x_314"></a>

<p>
The following example illustrates how you can use these qualifiers to 
control the placement of the various database files:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE LIBRARY DEV1$:[ROOTDIR] /DATABASE=DEV2$:[PROJDIR.DB] -
_VDE„                               /SNAPSHOT=DEV1$:[SNAPDIR]
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command causes VDE to place the database root file 
(VDE$DATABASE.RDB) in the library root directory on disk 
DEV1$, to place the database data file (VDE$DATABASE.RDA) in directory 
[PROJDIR.DB] on disk DEV2$, and to place the database snapshot file in 
directory [SNAPDIR] on disk DEV1$. Spreading the database files over 
two disks, as done here, can improve the performance of the database.

<p>
The Rdb database may also use a fourth file, an after-image 
journal file (with file type AIJ). When an Rdb database has 
after-image journalling enabled, all changes to the database are 
recorded in that journal file. If the database is later lost or 
damaged, perhaps due to hardware problems or disk corruption, you can 
restore the database from a backup file and then use the journal file 
to recover all updates since the last backup. Journalling is optional 
but strongly recommended. To enable journalling, you must specify the 
location of the journal file using the /JOURNAL qualifier to the CREATE 
LIBRARY or MODIFY LIBRARY command. The journal file should always be 
placed on a different physical disk from the other database files. 
<a href="vde_guide_013.html#maint_lib_backup">Section 7.4</a> describes how to back up and recover your VDE 
database and gives more information on journal files.

<a name="estab_lib_opt_stdpriv"><h2>6.2.2 Standard User Privileges</h2></a>

<p>
When you create your VDE library, you can specify the default 
and authorized VDE privileges you want assigned to new users 
as they are added to your VDE library. VDE 
privileges determine whether a user is allowed to reserve and replace 
modules or not, whether a user is allowed to perform queued 
replacements or not, whether a user is allowed to create modules, 
streams, and facilities or not, and so on. The description of the SET 
PRIVILEGES command contains the full list of all VDE 
privileges.
<a name="index_x_315"></a>
<a name="index_x_316"></a>
<a name="index_x_317"></a>

<p>
Each user has a set of default privileges and a set of authorized 
privileges. The default privileges are those privileges that are 
enabled by default each time the user starts a new VDE 
session. The authorized privileges are those privileges that the user 
is allowed to enable with the SET PRIVILEGES command. The default 
privileges are always a subset of (or the same as) the authorized 
privileges.

<p>
The VDE database stores a &quot;standard&quot; set of default 
and authorized privileges that are assigned to new users as they are 
added to the database. You can override these standard privileges for 
any given user by explicitly specifying different privileges with the 
CREATE USER or MODIFY USER
<a name="index_x_319"></a>
<a name="index_x_320"></a>
command. However, use of the standard privileges relieves you of the 
necessity of specifying VDE privileges for each user 
individually. This is especially important if you allow users to be 
added to the database automatically (see <a href="vde_guide_010.html#estab_lib_opt_add_user">Section 6.2.3</a>).

<p>
The /DEF_PRIVILEGES qualifier to the CREATE LIBRARY command allows you 
to specify the default privileges you want new users to have. The 
/AUTH_PRIVILEGES qualifier allows you to specify the authorized 
privileges you want new users to have. You can later use these 
qualifiers with the MODIFY LIBRARY command to change the library's 
standard privileges. If you do not specify standard privileges for your 
VDE library, VDE gives new users the CREMOD and 
RESREP privileges by default.

<a name="index_x_322"></a>

<p>
The following example shows how you can specify the standard default 
and authorized privileges for a VDE library being created:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE LIBRARY /DEF_PRIVILEGES=(CREMOD,RESREP) -
_VDE„               /AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(CREMOD,RESREP,CREGRP)
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The example omits other qualifiers and parameters for clarity.
