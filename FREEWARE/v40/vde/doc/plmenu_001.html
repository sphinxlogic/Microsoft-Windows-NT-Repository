</font>

<p>
Stream population refers to producing a snapshot of a stream at some 
point in time. VMS build streams are populated from a VMS development 
stream and then used as input to a system build. The overhead of 
populating a build stream varies depending upon how "close" the target 
build stream module generations are to the development stream module 
generations. If there are only a few differences between the target 
build stream and the development stream, then a populate can be 
completed in a matter of minutes. If the two streams diverge 
significantly, then the populate stream overhead degenerates close to 
the create stream overhead. The populate stream option of the menu 
prompts you for all the information necessary to successfully populate 
a stream in the VSC database and in the masterpack CMS libraries.

<p>
    The populate build stream option of the project leader menu is updated 
    to process build streams which do not maintain CMS classes. The 
    option's current behaviour to populate build streams maintained in both 
    VDE and CMS is retained. The value of the logical VDE$FETCH_METHOD 
    determines how the build stream will be populated.

<p>
    The VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical is used by the menu option AND by the 
    batch stream submitted to determine how to populate the stream. If the 
    VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical value is VDE, the stream is populated in the 
    VDE database only. If the VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical value is not VDE or 
    undefined, the job tries to populate the stream in VDE and CMS. If the 
    VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical is set to VDE, there is no time warnings for 
    when a VDE only stream populate should run. If CMS classes are to be 
    populated, the option will warn the user about populating the stream 
    during normal working hours.

<p>
    If your build streams do not maintain CMS classes, you may choose to 
    use the VDE POPULATE STREAM command directly from VSC to populate you 
    build stream. The POPULATE STREAM command requires the user hold the 
    VDE privilege PERFREP. The VDE FROZEN privilege must also be held by 
    the user if the build stream state is frozen. See the VDE reference 
    manual for a description of the POPULATE STREAM command. The file 
    VMSCMS$:POPSTRM.COM contains the populate stream command used to 
    currently populate build streams. The command format is:

</pre>
</font>

<p>
<a name="sh_rqrdprvl_nbs"><strong>Required Privileges</strong></a>

<p>
The populate build stream option requires that the user hold the VDE 
privileges <strong>FROZEN and PERFREP</strong> and the process rights 
identifiers <strong>VMS_ENABLE_CMS and VMS_SOURCE</strong>. If the user 
does not hold these privileges, the submitted batch job will fail.

<p>
Next you are asked for the source stream for the population. The source 
stream is the stream to populate from, or, if you like, the stream to 
copy. Usually the source stream is a VMS development stream, but this 
is not a requirement. The source stream is similar to the parent stream 
of the create stream option. The source stream defaults to the value of 
logical name PLMENU$DEFAULT_SOURCE_STREAM.

</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Upon entering the source stream you will be asked for the target stream 
to populate. This is usually a build stream for a development project. 
The target stream must have the VDE stream population attribute set for 
this procedure to work. The target stream defaults to the value of 
logical name PLMENU$DEFAULT_TARGET_STREAM.

<p>
The procedure prompts you for the time to begin the populate job. On 
weekdays, you are warned of possible masterpack disk contentions if you 
choose a time between 5:00AM and 6:00PM. You may submit the job at the 
entered time if you answer affirmatively to the "Do you still want to

<p>
The populate stream batch job maintains a status file to indicate the 
current state of the stream population. Any warnings or errors 
encountered during the population are marked in this file. A population 
status is mailed to the user upon completion of the populate job. The 
populate batch job processing is summarized as follows:

<ol type=i start=1>
  <li>The target VDE stream is populated from the source VDE stream. The 
  population is broken down into many small RDB transactions to avoiding 
  locking out other update usage on the masterpack. If any error is 
  detected at this point the batch job will terminate.
  <li>The procedure submits a batch job to perform the CMS insert 
  generation commands for every non-archived facility which allows change 
  propagation.
  <li>Each CMS insert generation procedure checks if the source stream 
  exists in the facility CMS library. If the source stream does not 
  exist, a warning message will be output in the log file and into the 
  procedure status file. If the source stream exists, the target stream 
  is populated from the source. +
  <li>The procedure waits for the hundreds of CMS insert generation batch 
  jobs to complete. When all jobs are complete the status file is checked 
  for errors. The user who submitted the job will receive a mail message 
  indicating the status of the population.

  command can corrupt a CMS library so, please don't delete the CMS 
  population jobs. A future version of CMS is supposed to correct this 
  problem. If you need to stop CMS population jobs from processing, the 
  jobs can be stopped by defining the logical name FAC$ABORT_POPLIBS in 
  the system logical name table on all relevant nodes. The 
  FAC$ABORT_POPLIBS logical stops ALL populate jobs from processing. 
  After your jobs have stopped, be sure to deassign this logical to allow 
  future populations to run successfully.
  <li>If the stream you are populating is very different from the source 
  stream, please don't submit the populate during "regular" working hours.
  <li>Don't panic if you receive warning messages in the population 
  status. There may be facilities for future VMS releases that are not 
  applicable to your development stream.
  <li>If you are going to do a build with the target stream, it's not 
  wise to allow changes to the source stream during the population. If 
  you allow replacements into the development stream during the 
  population, the VDE representation of the build stream will differ from 
  the CMS representation of the build stream. This could be a source of 
  confusion after the build. Remember, it is the CMS representation of 
  the stream that is used to build VMS.

<a name="rename_stream"><h1>Chapter 5<br>Renaming a Stream</h1></a>
</font>

<p>
Renaming a stream requires updating the VDE stream name and the CMS 
facility class names. Rename stream processing can be performed during 
normal working hours because it does not lock up the VDE database or 
CMS libraries for prolonged periods of time.

<p>
    The rename stream option of the project leader menu is updated to 
    process streams which do not maintain CMS classes as well as streams 
    that do maintain CMS classes. The option determines whether CMS classes 
    are maintained for the stream by the value of the logical 
    VDE$FETCH_METHOD. The VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical is used by the menu 
    option AND by the batch stream submitted to determine how to rename the 
    stream. If the VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical value is VDE, the stream is 
    renamed in the VDE database and the VMS$ SYS facility only. If the 
    VDE$FETCH_METHOD logical value is not VDE or undefined, the job tries 
    to rename the stream in VDE and all product CMS libraries.

<p>
    If your build streams do not maintain CMS classes, you can use the VDE 
    MODIFY STREAM/NAME= command directly from VSC to rename your stream. 
    The MODIFY STREAM command requires the user hold the VDE privilege 
    MODSTRM. See the VDE reference manual for a description of the MODIFY 
    STREAM command. Remeber if you are modifying a VMS stream, you will 
    still need to rename the CMS class in the SYS facility because the CMS 
    class still needs to be maintained for the system baselevel procedures. 
    However, if you do not plan to use the stream for building in the 
    future, you may omit the CMS rename. The file VMSCMS$:RENSTRM.COM 
    contains the MODIFY STREAM command used to currently rename streams. 
    The command format is:

<p>

<p>
The create baselevel stream function is another way to rename a stream. 
This option is available as a convenience to maintain consistent stream 
naming conventions. A baselevel is a milestone in the development cycle 
that should be preserved for future reference. The baselevel stream is 
associated with a baselevel result disk which is the output from the 
stream system build. An important difference between creating a 
baselevel and renaming a stream is that creating a baselevel modifies 
the new stream to prevent future populations of the new stream. 
Creating a baselevel "freezes" the stream.+

<p>
The create baselevel stream procedure modifies the build stream to 
disallow the population of the VDE stream. The procedure then submits 
the same rename stream batch procedure as used in the rename stream 
option. The rename stream batch job first modifies all the CMS facility 
class names to the new stream name. After the CMS library classes are 
renamed, the VDE stream name is modified.

<ul>
  <li>If a rename stream job fails it is sufficient to restart the job 
  assuming it did not fail for a privilege violation.
  <li>This option is available to retain a consistent naming convention 
  across development streams. If you prefer to use the rename stream 
  option please try to adhere to the naming convention used in this 
  procedure.
  <li>Make sure you read the confirmation prompt to insure you are 
  renaming the correct stream. You don't want to rename a VMS version 
  development stream!
