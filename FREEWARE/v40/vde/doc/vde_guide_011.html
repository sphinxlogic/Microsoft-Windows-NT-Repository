<a name="estab_lib_dir_stream"><h2>6.3.3 Development Stream Directories</h2></a>

<p>
If you intend to use VDE to build your software system, you 
must set up a directory tree for each development stream that you want 
to build. That directory tree will contain clear copies (as opposed to 
delta-file copies) of your source files along with all output files 
produced by the builds. If you intend to use VDE only for 
source control and not for building, you do not need directory trees 
for streams unless you want VDE to maintain clear copies of 
your modules for debugging or for general reference. This section 
explains both how to set up stream directory trees if needed and how to 
suppress them if not needed.
<a name="index_x_359"></a>
<a name="index_x_360"></a>

<p>
By default, VDE creates a directory tree for each new 
development stream that you create. The root directory for this 
directory tree has the same name as the stream and is a subdirectory of 
the library root directory. Any periods (.) in the stream name are 
changed to underscores (_) in the directory name to maintain valid 
OpenVMS file names. Within the stream root directory, there is 
one subdirectory for each facility in your software system. Each such 
subdirectory has the same name as the facility. <a href="vde_guide_011.html#libtbl_stream_dir">Table 6-3</a> shows 
this structure.

<p>
Within each facility subdirectory, VDE creates several 
additional subdirectories. By default, there are four such 
subdirectories called SRC, OBJ, VDE$COM, and VDE$LOG. The SRC 
subdirectory is meant to hold source files in clear-copy form. The OBJ 
directory is meant to hold object files, executable images, and all 
other derived modules that can be produced when your software system is 
built. The VDE$COM subdirectory will hold command files that 
VDE creates to perform build steps and the VDE$LOG 
subdirectory will hold the corresponding log files. The contents of the 
VDE$COM and VDE$LOG subdirectories are thus under VDE control 
while the contents of the SRC and OBJ directories are under your 
control when you set up the VDE library. These subdirectories 
are further illustrated in <a href="vde_guide_011.html#libtbl_stream_dir">Table 6-3</a>. <p>

<p>
You can direct VDE to create additional subdirectories within 
the facility root directory and you can explicitly specify your own 
locations for the stream and facility root directories. This topic is 
covered in more detail later in this section.
<p>
<a name="estab_lib_dir_stream_supp"><strong>Suppressing Stream Directories</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
If you want to use VDE for source control only and not for 
building, you may want to suppress the creation of stream directory 
trees because you are not going to use them. (However, if you want 
VDE to maintain clear copies of source files on replacement 
then you do need stream directories.) To suppress creation of stream 
directory trees, take the following steps:

<ul>
  <li>Specify the /DEFER qualifier with the CREATE LIBRARY command. This 
  qualifier prevents VDE from creating the directory tree for 
  the default stream MAIN when creating the library.
  <li>Enter CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE commands with the /DELTA_FILES and 
  /STAGING qualifiers in order to create the delta-file directory tree 
  and the staging area root directory. See <a href="vde_guide_010.html#estab_lib_dir_delta">Section 6.3.1</a> and 
  <a href="vde_guide_010.html#estab_lib_dir_stage">Section 6.3.2</a>.
  <li>Enter the SET DIRECTORY command with the /STREAM and /DEFER 
  qualifiers for stream MAIN:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET STREAM MAIN
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /STREAM /DEFER
</pre>
</font>
</table>

/DEFER specifies that when new streams are created from the current 
stream, directory-tree creation will be deferred for those streams. 
This means that the descendants of stream MAIN will not get directory 
trees unless you enter explicit CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE commands for them.
</ul>

<p>
After these steps are done, you can create new streams with the CREATE 
STREAM command as needed. Because of the SET DIRECTORY command, each 
subsequent CREATE STREAM command has an implicit /DEFER qualifier which 
suppresses creation of the stream's directory tree.
<p>
<a name="estab_lib_dir_stream_def"><strong>Defining Your Own Stream Directories</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
If you need stream directory trees but you do not like the default 
directory structure or placement, then you can define your own stream 
directories. One way to do so is to explicitly specify the root 
directory for new streams when you create the streams. Another way is 
to use the SET DIRECTORY command with the /STREAM qualifier to specify 
the directory structure and placement you want for a given stream. You 
can enter multiple SET DIRECTORY commands to specify different aspects 
of the desired directory structure; together these commands define a 
template for the directory structure and placement that you want. Then 
use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command with the /STREAM qualifier to 
actually create the directory tree for that stream. In addition, any 
future child streams that are created from a given stream will inherit 
the directory structure of the parent. The actual directory trees for 
such descendant streams are created when the streams are created.

<p>
The following are the options you have in specifying the directory 
structure and placement for streams:

<ul>
  <li>To specify the placement of a new stream's root directory, create 
  the stream using the /DIRECTORY qualifier with the CREATE STREAM 
  command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE STREAM BIRCH /DIRECTORY=DEV2$:[MY_BIRCH]
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example creates stream BIRCH and makes DEV2$:[MY_BIRCH] its root 
directory. This is generally the best way to specify the root directory 
for a new development stream. Specifying stream root directories this 
way allows you to spread your VDE library over multiple disks for 
better performance and disk utilization. <br>You can also specify that 
all future descendants of the current stream must have their root 
directories specified when those streams are created. To do so, enter a 
SET DIRECTORY command with the /PROMPT qualifier for the current 
stream. For example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET STREAM BIRCH
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /STREAM /PROMPT
</pre>
</font>
</table>

These commands specify that a stream root directory must be explicitly 
specified for each future descendant of the existing stream BIRCH. When 
each such descendant is created with the CREATE STREAM command, 
VDE prompts the user for the name of the stream root 
directory unless the user specifies it with the /DIRECTORY qualifier. 
This feature is useful when you want each future stream's directory 
tree to go on a separate device to be selected when the stream is 
created. <br>Note that the SET DIRECTORY /STREAM command acts on the 
current default stream. For it to act on a given stream, you must thus 
set that stream using the SET STREAM command, as shown in the example.
  <li>To specify the placement of the root directory of an already 
  existing stream's directory tree, use the SET DIRECTORY command with 
  the /STREAM qualifier. Then use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to 
  actually create the stream directory tree. For example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET STREAM BIRCH
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /STREAM DEV2$:[MYDIR]
VDE„ CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE /STREAM
VDE„ CANCEL DIRECTORY /STREAM
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The first three commands make directory DEV2$:[MYDIR] the root 
directory for the existing stream BIRCH. If these commands are not 
specified, VDE uses subdirectory BIRCH in the library root 
directory by default. After you have created the directory tree, you 
should use the CANCEL DIRECTORY command to prevent future child streams 
from inheriting the DEV2$:[MYDIR] root directory. This ensures that 
subsequent streams created from stream BIRCH do not attempt to use the 
same root directory; instead they get a subdirectory within the library 
root directory by default.
  <li>To specify the placement of the root directory for a given facility 
  for the current stream, use the /FACILITY qualifier as well:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET STREAM BIRCH
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /STREAM /FACILITY=FOO DEV2$:[BIRCHFOO]
VDE„ CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE /STREAM/ /FACILITY=FOO
VDE„ CANCEL DIRECTORY /STREAM /FACILITY=FOO
</pre>
</font>
</table>

These commands make directory DEV2$:[BIRCHFOO] the root directory for 
facility FOO within stream BIRCH. If this command is not specified, 
VDE uses subdirectory FOO within the stream root directory by 
default. This form of the SET DIRECTORY command is seldom used because 
there is usually no need to place the directories for an individual 
facility on a different disk than other facilities. However, if you do 
use it, use the indicated CANCEL DIRECTORY command after creating the 
directory so that subsequent child streams will not use the same 
directory.
  <li>To specify that a given stream's directory tree should have 
  additional subdirectories within each facility's root directory, use 
  the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier to the SET DIRECTORY command. To specify 
  that each facility should have a subdirectory for analysis (.ANA) 
  files, for example, you would use the following commands:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ SET STREAM BIRCH
VDE„ SET DIRECTORY /STREAM /SUBDIRECTORY=ANASYM [.ANA]
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This SET DIRECTORY command specifies that each facility in stream BIRCH 
and its descendant streams should have a subdirectory ANA. The form of 
the directory specification [.ANA] indicates that it is relative to 
each facility's root directory. The ANASYM parameter is a directory 
symbol which is used later in VDE scripts to reference the 
new subdirectory. (Usually the directory symbol is the same as the 
directory name but here they differ for clarity of exposition.) 
<br>VDE gives you four facility subdirectories by default: 
SCR, OBJ, VDE$COM, and VDE$LOG. The /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier to SET 
DIRECTORY allows you to specify additional such subdirectories. As 
always, the SET DIRECTORY command only creates a template for the 
desired directory tree; the actual directories are not created until 
you use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command or create new streams that 
inherit the template from their parent.
</ul>

<p>
These various ways of specifying directory placement and structure give 
you considerable control over VDE's stream directory trees. 
You can spread your VDE library over multiple disks using 
these capabilities. You can control how the various subdirectories for 
each facility are used by the way that you write the VDE 
scripts that determine how build steps and certain other operations are 
performed.

<a name="estab_lib_add_user"><h1><font color=maroon>6.4 Adding Users to the Library</font></h1></a>

<p>
Before users other than yourself (the library creator) can use the new 
VDE library you have created, those users must be added to 
the library's database. This was described briefly in <a href="vde_guide_010.html#estab_lib_opt_add_user">Section 6.2.3</a>. 
When a user is added to the database, VDE creates a User 
Table entry for the user in the VDE database. When that user 
subsequently tries to access the VDE library through the 
VDE utility, VDE checks that the user is recorded 
in the database. Provided this is the case, VDE retrieves the 
user's VDE privileges and other attributes from the User 
Table entry and uses those attributes to control the rest of the 
VDE session. VDE denies access to the library to 
users who are not recorded in the database.
<a name="index_x_361"></a>
<a name="index_x_362"></a>
<a name="index_x_363"></a>
<a name="index_x_364"></a>
<a name="index_x_365"></a>

<p>
There are three ways of adding users to your library's database:

<ul>
  <li>VDE automatically adds the library creator to the 
  database when the library is created. This user is authorized to set 
  all VDE privileges and has all administrative privileges set 
  by default.
  <li>You can use the CREATE USER command to add users. This command lets 
  you manually specify the users to add to the database, including their 
  privileges and other attributes.
<a name="index_x_366"></a>
  <li>You can enable a library attribute that causes VDE to 
  automatically add new users to the library database when they first 
  access the library through the VDE utility. Each such user 
  gets the standard default and authorized privileges for the library.
<a name="index_x_367"></a>
</ul>

The addition of the library creator has been described previously in 
this chapter. The rest of this section describes the other two methods 
in more detail.

<a name="create_user_cmd"><h2>6.4.1 The CREATE USER Command</h2></a>

<p>
The CREATE USER command lets you specify the OpenVMS username, 
the full name (first and last names), the VDE default and 
authorized privileges, and certain other information about each user to 
be added to the database. This is an example of a CREATE USER command 
that adds user Jane Smith to the database:
<a name="index_x_368"></a>
<a name="index_x_369"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE USER SMITH /NAME="Jane Smith" /REMARK="Project leader" -
_VDE„        /AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(CREFAC,CREMOD,CRESTRM,RESREP,PERFREP) -
_VDE„        /DEF_PRIVILEGES=(CREMOD,RESREP,PERFREP)
</pre>
</font>
</table>

After this command has completed, Jane Smith can start VDE 
sessions using the VDE library. By default, she has the 
privileges necessary to create new source modules, to reserve and 
replace modules, and to perform queued replacements for herself and 
other developers. In addition, she is authorized to set the privileges 
necessary to create new facilities and development streams.

<p>
Using the CREATE USER command is the most practical way to add users to 
a VDE library if the library has a small number of users or 
if you want to exercise careful control over who accesses the library.

<a name="automatic_add_users"><h2>6.4.2 Automatic Addition of Users</h2></a>

<p>
If you specify the /AUTO_ADD_USER qualifier with the CREATE LIBRARY or 
MODIFY LIBRARY command, VDE will automatically add new users 
to the library database the first time each such user uses 
VDE to access the library. If this qualifier is used without 
a parameter, any user who attempts to access the VDE library 
through VDE is automatically added to the database. Each such 
user gets the standard default and authorized VDE privileges 
for that library. The OpenVMS username is retrieved from the 
operating system. The full name of the user is taken from the owner 
field of the user's record in the system User Authorization File (UAF). 
Other attributes, such as the remark string, are not set.

<p>
The /AUTO_ADD_USER qualifier can also be specified with a OpenVMS 
rights identifier parameter, as in /AUTO_ADD_USER=<em>rights-id</em>. 
In this case, VDE stores the given rights identifier in the 
database. Subsequently, VDE adds only those users to the 
database who hold the stored rights identifier. The users are added 
when they first access the library through VDE, just as for 
the plain /AUTO_ADD_USER qualifier. This way of adding users is useful 
when you use a OpenVMS rights identifier to protect the files and 
directories of your project. Because the intended users of your 
VDE library must hold the rights identifier anyway, you can 
use the rights identifier as your mechanism to control access to the 
library.

<p>
If you use automatic addition of users to your VDE library, 
you should periodically run the program VDE/READ_UAF.
<a name="index_x_370"></a>
<a name="index_x_371"></a>
<a name="index_x_372"></a>
This program reads the system user authorization file (SYSUAF) of your 
OpenVMS system and updates the User Table in your VDE 
database to be consistent with the SYSUAF. It updates each user's full 
name in the VDE database to match the owner field in the 
SYSUAF. VDE/READ_UAF also marks users as deleted in the 
VDE database if they no longer have accounts in the UAF. 
VDE/READ_UAF thus allows you to maintain your database User 
Table by having it automatically track the SYSUAF, which your system 
manager must maintain anyway. And with /WRITE_UAF, the command can 
update the process quotas of OpenVMS users in the System 
Authorization Database (SYSUAF). The VDE/READ_UAF command 
should be included in a command procedure that runs regularly, perhaps 
every night or every weekend.

<p>
To run VDE/READ_UAF, you must specify the target 
VDE via the /LIBRARY qualifier or via the VDE$LIBRARY logical 
name. You must also have read access to the OpenVMS system 
authorization database, or read and write access when the /WRITE_UAF 
qualifier is specified. <em>Installation of the VDE/READ_UAF 
image with enhanced privileges is not recommended.</em> You can execute 
the program as follows:
<a name="index_x_373"></a>
<a name="index_x_374"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ SET PROCESS/PRIVILEGE=BYPASS
$ VDE/READ_UAF/WRITE_UAF/LIBRARY=lib-name
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Automatic addition of users is the most practical approach for 
VDE libraries with a large number of potential users. Even if 
you automatically add users, you can of course still use the CREATE 
USER command to add users. This makes sense if you want to add a user 
who does not hold the rights identifier required to be added 
automatically or who should be added with a different set of privileges 
than the standard privileges for the library. In addition, you can 
always use the MODIFY LIBRARY command to change the privileges or other 
attributes of any user already recorded in the database.
<a name="index_x_375"></a>
<a name="index_x_376"></a>
<a name="index_x_377"></a>

<p>
The VDE/READ_UAF command, with the specification of the 
/WRITE_UAF qualifier and with read-write access to the System 
Authorization Database, can update process quotas of VDE 
users in the System Authorization Database (SYSUAF).
<a name="index_x_378"></a>
<a name="index_x_379"></a>
This command is particularly useful when users are reporting 
quota-related messages when invoking VDE.

<a name="estab_lib_cre_stream"><h1><font color=maroon>6.5 Creating Streams</font></h1></a>

<p>
<em>Section under construction...</em>

<p>
To create a stream, use the CREATE STREAM command. You normally need to 
select a parent stream for the operation, and you need to consider the 
stream propogation order.
<a name="index_x_380"></a>
<a name="index_x_381"></a>
<a name="index_x_382"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE STREAM V2.0/PARENT=V1.0
</pre>
</font>
</table>

In addition to choosing the parent stream, you need to choose whether 
or not the new stream is a direct descendent of the parent stream 
(/MAINLINE), or if it is a variant and will diverge (/NOMAINLINE). 
(Mainline streams will keep the same generation identification values 
as the parent, while variant streams select longer generation 
identification values. The main line of descent is often an integer 
generation number, while variants tend to include increasing numbers of 
letters in the identification value. There are no other differences. 
Once the stream has been created, this setting cannot be easily 
changed.)

<p>
Other qualifiers of interest during stream creation include 
/CONFERENCE, /[NO]INIT_CMS_CLASS, /NOTIFY, /[NO]GENERATIONS, and 
/REVIEW.

<p>
Once created, streams can be repopulated via a POPULATE STREAM command. 
Once a stream is populated, either via the initial CREATE STREAM 
command or via the POPULATE STREAM command, a MODIFY STREAM/NOPOPULATE 
command should be issued, to prevent accidental repopulation of the 
stream.

This command cancels the reservation of module MOD.TYP in facility 
FACIL. The /STREAM qualifier specifies the stream for which the 
reservation was made. If you omit this qualifier, your default stream 
is assumed. If you have more than one reservation of the module for 
that stream, you must specify its reservation identifier with the 
/IDENTIFICATION qualifier. The command can cancel both queued 
reservation requests and real reservations.

<p>
There are various ways to load modules into a VDE database. 
One can upload modules into a facility from an existing CMS library, an 
operation that normally only occurs during library creation, and one 
can also upload a directory containing a number of modules into a 
facility in a VDE database using the CREATE 
MODULE/FROM_DIRECTORY command. And one can upload individual modules 
into a facility using the CREATE MODULE command.

<p>
A new VDE database can be created and loaded using the 
procedure described in <a href="vde_guide_012.html#estab_cms_upload">Section 6.7.3</a>.

<a name="estab_lib_pop_dir"><h2>6.7.1 Getting Source Modules from a Directory</h2></a>

<p>
One can use the CREATE MODULE/FROM_DIRECTORY command for this task. 
This command will create one module in the facility for every file
