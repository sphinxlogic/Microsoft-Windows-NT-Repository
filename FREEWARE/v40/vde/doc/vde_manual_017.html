name, remark, default development stream, and default facility. One 
context can be used to set the default stream and facility when first 
connecting to a VDE database.

<h3>MODIFY CONTEXT ctx-name [, ctx-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>ctx-name</h3>
The name of an existing context whose attributes are to be modified. 
You can modify more than one context at a time by using wildcard 
characters in the context name. The percent sign (%) in a context name 
matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. Those contexts whose names match the wildcard pattern are 
modified.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A &quot;context&quot; specifies defaults for VDE sessions. 
When you modify a context using the MODFY CONTEXT command, you specify 
the name of the context, the associated development stream, and the 
associated facility.

<p>
To apply the defaults associated with a context, specify the context 
name as a parameter to the SET CONTEXT command. To set a particular 
context as the default context for use when you issue the SET LIBRARY 
command, use the SET CONTEXT/DEFAULT command to mark a particular 
context as the default context.

<p>
There are two kinds of contexts available:

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>private context</strong> is available to and only 
  visible to the user who created it.
  <li>the <strong>public context</strong> is available to all users of 
  the current VDE library.
</ul>

You do not need special VDE privileges to create or modify a 
private context, but you must have the VDE CRECTX privilege 
to create or modify a public context. While
<a name="index_x_393"></a>
a private context can have the same name as a public context, neither 
two private contexts nor two public contexts can share the same name.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ARCHITECTURE</h3>
<strong>Under Construction...</strong>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
context definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to print a message for the specified context giving the 
name of the context and asking whether you want to modify that context. 
If you answer YES (or Y), the attributes are modified. If you answer NO 
(or N), the attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier 
causes VDE to modify the attributes of the context without 
asking for confirmation.
<h3>/FACILITY=facil-name</h3>
<h3>/NOFACILITY</h3>
The /FACILITY qualifier specifies that the indicated facility becomes 
the default facility when the context is established with the SET 
CONTEXT command. The default facility is the facility that is assumed 
when the facility name is omitted from a module name. The /NOFACILITY 
qualifier specifies that the default facility established by the 
context is null.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the context definitions 
are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the context 
definitions have been modified and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/NAME=ctx-name</h3>
Specifies a new name for the context. The new context name can be up to 
39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax. After 
the context name is changed, you must refer to the context by its new 
name in all subsequent VDE commands. The old name is lost 
from the database.
<h3>/PRIVATE (default)</h3>
<h3>/PUBLIC</h3>
Specifies whether the context that is modified is private or public. 
The /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to modify your private 
context by that name. The /PUBLIC qualifier causes VDE to 
modify the public context by that name. You must have the CRECTX
<a name="index_x_394"></a>
privilege to use the /PUBLIC qualifier.

<p>
Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /PRIVATE is the default.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string for the context. This string replaces the 
remark string from the original CREATE CONTEXT command or from any 
previous MODIFY CONTEXT command. The quoted remark string, which can be 
up to 132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the 
context that you want stored in the VDE database. Typically 
the remark describes the function or purpose of the context.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
<h3>/NOSTREAM</h3>
The /STREAM qualifier specifies that the indicated development stream 
becomes the default stream when the context is established with the SET 
CONTEXT command. The /NOSTREAM qualifier specifies that the default 
stream established by the context is null.

<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each

print a message for the specified facility giving the name of the 
facility and ask whether you want to modify that facility. If you 
answer YES (or Y), the attributes are modified. If you answer NO (or

VDE to modify the attributes of the facility without asking 
for confirmation.
<h3>/DELETE</h3>
<h3>/NODELETE (default)</h3>
Sets or clears the <strong>delete</strong> attribute for the facility. 
This attribute allows the facility to be deleted with the DELETE 
FACILITY command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete attribute so 
that the facility can be deleted. The /NODELETE qualifier clears the 
delete attribute so that the facility cannot be deleted without first 
resetting the attribute.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the facility 
definitions are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be 
printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the 
facility definitions have been modified and that the database 
transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/NAME=facil-name</h3>
Specifies a new name for the facility. The new facility name can be up 
to 39 characters long and must follow normal VDE name 
syntax. After the facility name has been changed, you must refer to the 
facility by its new name in all subsequent VDE commands. The 
old name is lost from the database.
<h3>/PROPAGATE</h3>
<h3>/NOPROPAGATE</h3>
Specifies whether automatic change propagation is allowed by default 
for new modules created in this facility. /PROPAGATE causes new modules 
added to the facility to be marked as allowing automatic change 
propagation when reserved and replaced. /NOPROPAGATE marks such modules 
as not allowing change propagation. When you create new modules, you 
can override these defaults with qualifiers to the CREATE MODULE 
command.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string for the facility. This string replaces the 
remark string from the original CREATE FACILITY command or from any 
previous MODIFY FACILITY command. The quoted remark string, which can 
be up to 132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about 
the facility that you want stored in the VDE database. 
Typically the remark describes the function or contents of the facility.

<h3>mod-name</h3>
Specifies a module for which a fold record is to be modified. The 
module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square 
brackets, a module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period 
(such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility name is omitted, the module

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
fold record modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for each fold record asking whether you want that 
record modified. If you answer YES (or Y), that fold record is modified 
in the database. If you answer NO (or N), the fold record is not 
modified. If you enter a module name with a wildcard specification, 
VDE asks you to confirm the modification of fold records for 
each module whose name matches the wildcard specification. The 
/NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify the specified fold 
records without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/IDENTIFICATION=fold-ident</h3>
Specifies the fold record to be modified. This qualifier is required 
when you have multiple fold records for the same module in the same 
stream. The <strong>fold-ident</strong> parameter is the fold 
identifier of the fold record to be modified. The fold identifier is 
the identifier you specified or VDE assigned when you 
created the fold record, usually a small integer value. Use the SHOW 
FOLD command to determine the fold identifier of each fold record.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each fold record has 
been modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed 
and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that 
the fold record has been modified and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a new remark string for the fold record. This string replaces 
the remark string from the original REPLACE or CREATE FOLD command or 
from any previous MODIFY FOLD command. The quoted remark string, which 
can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark 
about the fold record that you want stored in the VDE 
database. Typically the remark describes the purpose or contents of a 
source change to be folded into a development stream.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies the development stream for which fold records should be 
modified. The <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter gives the name of 
the stream. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE modifies fold 
records for the default development stream only.
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Specifies that fold records are to be modified on behalf of another 
user. The <strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the 
OpenVMS username of the other user. You must have the USERNAME 
privilege to use this qualifier.

<h3>MODIFY GENERATION gen-spec [, gen-spec...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>gen-spec</h3>
Specifies a module generation in a specified (or the default) 
development stream whose attributes are to be modified. A generation 
specification consists of the following in order:

<ul>
  <li> an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets
  <li> a module name
  <li> an optional type name preceded by a period
  <li> an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon
</ul>

An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

<p>
If you omit the facility name, module generations from the default 
facility are modified. If you omit the type name, generations for all 
modules with the specified module name in the specified facility are 
modified. If you omit the generation number, the most recent generation 
of the module in the specified stream is modified.

<p>
If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number is 
relative to the most recent generation of the module in the stream 
specified with the /STREAM qualifier (or the default stream if that 
qualifier is omitted). For example, if the most recent generation is 
generation 5, then generation 0 is the same as generation 5 and 
generation --1 is the same as generation 4.

<p>
If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE modifies the 
generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores the 
generation number on the <strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter.

<p>
You can modify more than one generation by using wildcard characters in 
the facility name, module name, or type name. The percent sign (%) in a 
name matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. An asterisk (*) in place of the generation number matches all 
generations of a module. Those module generations whose names match the 
wildcard pattern are modified.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The MODIFY GENERATION command allows you to modify the attributes 
associated with a specific module generation in the VDE 
library.

<p>
Attributes that can be altered via the MODIFY GENERATION command 
include:

<ul>
  <li>The generation's remark string. This string is originally created 
  by the CREATE MODULE or REPLACE command.
  <li>The module's status in the specified development stream. This 
  command can be used to mark a specific generation of the module as as 
  obsolete in the specified development stream. An obsolete module 
  remains in the VDE database since it may not be obsolete for 
  old streams, only for new ones. Once a module is marked as obsolete for 
  a given stream, that module is not carried over to any future stream 
  that has the given stream as its parent.
  <li>The module's status as the main line of descent in the the 
  specified development stream.
</ul>

</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the 
attributes of each generation modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to print a message for each generation giving the name 
of the generation and asking whether you want to modify the generation. 
If you answer YES (or Y), the generation's attributes are modified. If 
you answer NO (or N), the attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM 
qualifier causes VDE to modify the attributes of each 
generation without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/GENERATION=gen-expr</h3>
Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression given 
by the <strong>gen-expr</strong> parameter be modified. When this 
qualifier is specified, the generation number specified on the 
<strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter is ignored.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the attributes of 
generations are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be 
printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the 
generations have been modified and that the database transaction has 
successfully committed.
<h3>/MAIN_STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies the stream that &quot;owns&quot; the main development thread 
for the specified generation. If the generation is later reserved and 
its successor is replaced into the stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter (directly or through change 
propagation), the successor generation will get a 
&quot;whole-number&quot; CMS generation expression. If the current 
generation has generation expression 10, for example, the generation 
created by replacing into the specified stream gets generation 
expression 11. A replacement into any other stream gets a generation 
expression such as 10A1 or 10B1. Similarly, if the current generation 
has generation expression 5A2, the specified stream gets the 
&quot;whole-number&quot; successor 5A3 instead of a generation 
expression such as 5A2A1.

<p>
VDE automatically maintains information about what stream 
owns the whole-number successor for each generation in the library. 
This information is determined by your use of the /MAIN qualifier to 
the CREATE STREAM command. For this reason, you will seldom need the 
/MAIN_STREAM qualifier to the MODIFY GENERATION command. However, there 
are exceptional cases where you may need to change what stream owns the 
whole-number successor for a given generation, and then this qualifier 
lets you set that attribute.
<h3>/NOTE=note-number</h3>
The <strong>note-number</strong> parameter specifies the note number 
for the (previously-entered) SCT note associated with this replacement.
<a name="index_x_404"></a>

<p>
VDE can also enter the note into the conference directly, 
see the /SCT qualifier for information.
<h3>/OBSOLETE</h3>
<h3>/NOOBSOLETE</h3>
Specifies whether the module is marked as obsolete in the specified 
development stream. The /OBSOLETE qualifier specifies that the module 
is obsolete in that stream. An obsolete module is not propagated to 
future streams created from that stream. The /NOOBSOLETE qualifier 
specifies that the module is not obsolete. If neither qualifier is 
specified, the current status of the module is not changed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a new remark string to be stored for the generation. This 
string replaces the generation's current remark string. The quoted 
remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the generation that you want stored in the 
VDE database.

<p>
The remark string is used as the title of the SCT note, if 
VDE was asked to enter the SCT note by the specification of 
the /SCT qualifier.
<h3>/SCT=filename</h3>
The <strong>filename</strong> parameter specifies the name of a file to 
be loaded into the SCT notes conference. This file contains the 
previously-edited text of an SCT entry for the SCT note associated with 
this replacement.
<a name="index_x_405"></a>

<p>
If this qualifier is used, the default notes conference for the 
stream---SCT-<em>stream-name</em>---is assumed.

<p>
If this qualifier is specified, the /REMARK string is used as the title 
of the SCT note.

<p>
For information on the proper creation and protection of an SCT notes 
conference, see the <em>Guide to Using VDE</em>.

<p>
Also see /FOLD and /OTHER.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that generations for the development stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter be modified. This qualifier thus 
affects the interpretation of generation numbers on the command's 
<strong>gen-spec</strong> parameter. If this qualifier is omitted, 
VDE modifies generations for the default development stream.
