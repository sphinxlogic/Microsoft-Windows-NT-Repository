<h3>CREATE STEP step-mod-name = mod-name [, mod-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>step-mod-name</h3>
The name of the module that is compiled, copied, or linked by the build 
step. This name consists of a module name and a type name separated by 
a period (such as MOD1.PAS) and may include a facility name enclosed in 
square brackets (such as [FACNAM]MOD1.PAS). The module name may not 
contain wildcard characters. If no facility name is specified, the 
current default facility is assumed.

<p>
If the step is a compile step, this module is recorded as an input to 
the step. If the step is a link step, this module is recorded as an 
output of the step. If the step is a copy step, this module is recorded 
as the module that is copied (fetched out) by the step.
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of a module that you declare to be an input to or output from 
the build step. This name consists of a module name and a type name 
(for example, MOD1.OBJ) and may include a facility name enclosed in 
square brackets (for example, [FACNAM]MOD1.OBJ). If no facility name is 
specified, the current default facility is assumed.

<p>
You can declare many modules to be inputs to or outputs from the build 
step by specifying wildcard characters in any of the three components 
of the module name. The percent sign (%) in a name matches any single 
character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero 
or more characters in the position it occupies. Those modules whose 
names match the wildcard pattern are recorded as inputs to or outputs 
from the build step.

<p>
If an output module you specify does not already exist in the database, 
the CREATE STEP command adds it to the database. Input modules must 
already be defined in the database, however. Also, you cannot specify a 
source module as an output of a build step.

<p>
If you specify the /COPY qualifier to create a copy step, you must omit 
the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters and the preceding equal sign 
(=). A copy step fetches a module from its CMS library, but has no 
inputs or outputs other than the module
<a name="index_x_268"></a>
given by the <strong>step-mod-name</strong> parameter.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
To be able to perform minimal system builds, VDE records all 
inputs and outputs for each build step. This information is known as 
&quot;build dependency information.&quot; The build dependency 
information from all build steps is known collectively as the 
&quot;build dependency graph.&quot; Normally, VDE collects 
build dependency information automatically when you perform system 
builds. However, for some build steps it is not possible to collect 
this information automatically; some compilers and other tools do not 
make this information available to VDE. For such build 
steps, you must use the CREATE STEP command to enter the build 
dependency information into the VDE database.

<p>
You can define three kinds of build steps with the CREATE STEP command: 
compile steps, link steps, and copy steps. A <strong>compile 
step</strong> processes the <strong>step-mod-name</strong> module and 
possibly other input modules to produce one or more output modules. 
Typically, a compile step runs a compiler of some sort on a source 
module, but the exact semantics of the step are determined by the 
VDE script that generates the DCL commands that perform the 
step.

<p>
A <strong>link step</strong> produces the 
<strong>step-mod-name</strong> module and possibly other output modules 
from one or more input modules. Typically, a link step runs the linker 
to produce a shareable or executable image, but again the exact 
semantics are determined by the VDE script associated with 
the step. Since a script can perform any action you want, a compile 
step need not run a compiler and a link step need not run the linker. 
To VDE, the only real difference between a compile step and 
a link step is that a compile step is named for one of the input 
modules while a link step is named for one of the output modules.

<p>
A <strong>copy step</strong> copies the <strong>step-mod-name</strong> 
module from one place to another. Normally, a copy step is used to 
fetch out a source module from its delta file (CMS element) into a 
clear-copy file that can be used directly by subsequent build steps. 
For example, C programs generally include various .H files in their 
compile steps. A copy step is needed for each .H file to fetch it from 
its CMS library
<a name="index_x_269"></a>
into a text file that subsequent compile steps can use. Likewise, 
linker options files (.OPT files) must be fetched out before you can 
use them for subsequent link steps. You must create a copy step for any 
module that must be fetched into the VDE library's directory 
tree during builds but which does not need any separate processing to 
produce other output modules. For a copy step, the specified module can 
be seen as both the input and the output of the step.

<p>
The CREATE STEP command deletes all dependency information for the 
build step before recording the inputs and outputs you specify. Thus, 
you can use the CREATE STEP command to completely replace the 
dependency information for a build step. To change only some of the 
dependency information for a step, use the MODIFY STEP command.

<p>
Build dependency information is always specific to the default 
development stream. Different development streams in a software system 
contain different versions of the code and generally have different 
build dependency graphs.

<p>
To define the same build step for more than one development stream, you 
must use the CREATE STEP command for each stream. For each stream, 
first enter the SET STREAM command to set the development stream, then 
enter the CREATE STEP command to enter the desired build-step 
dependencies into the database.

<p>
When a new development stream is created, the build dependency graph 
from the parent stream is copied to the child stream. The build 
dependency graph then evolves independently in the two streams.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/COMPILE (default)</h3>
<h3>/COPY</h3>
<h3>/LINK</h3>
Specifies whether the build step is a compile step, copy step, or link 
step. The /COMPILE qualifier causes VDE to mark the step as 
a compile step and to record the <strong>step-mod-name</strong> 
parameter as an input module to the compile step. The /COPY qualifier 
causes VDE to mark the step as a copy step and to record the 
<strong>step-mod-name</strong> parameter as the module that is copied 
by the step. The /LINK qualifier causes VDE to mark the step 
as a link step and to record the <strong>step-mod-name</strong> 
parameter as an output module of the link step.

<p>
Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
<h3>/INPUT (default)</h3>
<h3>/OUTPUT</h3>
Specifies whether the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters are recorded 
as inputs to or outputs from the build step. The /INPUT qualifier 
records modules as inputs to the build step and the /OUTPUT qualifier 
records them as outputs of the step. If no qualifier is specified, all 
modules are assumed to be inputs.

<p>
To set the default for the command as a whole, specify the qualifier 
after the CREATE STEP keywords. To override that default for a single 
module, specify the qualifier after the <strong>mod-name</strong> 
parameter you choose to mark as an input or output.

<p>
Of /INPUT and /OUTPUT, /INPUT is the default.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the build step is 
recorded in the database. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be 
printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate 
that the build step has been created, that the specified modules are 
inputs or outputs for the step, and that the database transaction has 
committed successfully.

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A development stream (or simply, a &quot;stream&quot;) is any 
separately evolving version of your software system. A stream may 
correspond to a previous or future version of your system or to a 
base-level of the system. It may correspond to any instance of the 
system that evolves separately from the rest of the system. Each stream 
of your software system captures a different state of the system, and 
that state may evolve independently for each stream.

<p>
Each stream of your software system contains its own versions of all 
modules in the system, and you may change these modules independently 
in each stream. Each stream also contains its own versions of various 
database tables, such as group definitions and module dependency 
information. This information may also evolve independently for each 
stream.

<p>
When you create a stream, the CREATE STREAM command first creates an 
entry for the new stream in the VDE database. It then copies 
all stream-specific information from the parent stream (by default, the 
default stream) to the new stream (the child stream). This information 
includes directory-creation rules, group definitions, the build 
dependency graph, and information about what module generations belong 
to the parent stream. In addition, the CREATE STREAM command executes 
scripts which may copy files from the parent stream's disk directories 
to the child stream's directories.

<p>
There are several key attributes to VDE module propogation 
controlled by the CREATE STREAM command, including the sequence of 
streams on the various lines of descent, and the presence of the 
particular stream on the main line of development or on a variant line 
of descent. The former is controlled by the parentage and successor 
settings, and the latter is controlled by the mainline setting.

<p>

<table bgcolor=lightskyblue border=0 width=75%>
<tr>
  <td><center><font size=+2 
  color=black><strong>Note</strong></font></center><hr size=1 noshade>
<font color=black>
The CREATE STREAM command can and does perform specific and potentially 
non-reversable modifications to the internal VDE data 
associated with <em>other</em> streams present in the VDE 
database, particularly around the /MAIN and /NOMAIN settings, and 
around the /PARENT and /SUCCESSOR settings. The CREATE STREAM command 
should be used with caution.

<p>
The explicit specification of the appropriate value for the /[NO]MAIN 
qualifier (/MAIN or /NOMAIN) on a CREATE STREAM command is strongly 
recommended. </font>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CMS_CLASS</h3>
<h3>/NOCMS_CLASS(default)</h3>
Specifies whether a CMS class with the same name as the stream should 
be maintained in each facility's CMS library. The /CMS_CLASS qualifier
<a name="index_x_272"></a>
causes VDE to create a CMS class for the stream in each 
facility's CMS library and to then maintain that class when the REPLACE 
command and certain other commands change what module generations 
belong to the stream. The /NOCMS_CLASS qualifier causes VDE 
to not maintain a CMS class for the stream.

<p>
The /CMS_CLASS qualifier interacts with the /INIT_CMS_CLASS and 
/NOINIT_CMS_CLASS qualifiers; see the descriptions of these qualifiers 
for details.
<h3>/CONFERENCE=file-spec</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFERENCE(default)</h3>
<a name="index_x_273"></a>
Specifies whether a OpenVMS Notes conference for replacement 
information should be associated with the new stream. The /CONFERENCE 
qualifier specifies that the notes conference file specification given 
by the <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter should be used to record 
all replacements into the stream. VDE then enters a new note 
into the conference for each queued or immediate replacement and a 
reply to that note when a queued replacement is actually performed. The
<a name="index_x_274"></a>
/NOCONFERENCE qualifier specifies that no such notes conference should 
be used.

<p>
Under normal circumstances, just the file name should be specified in 
the <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter. VDE applies 
defaults to the notes conference file specification based on the 
translation of the logical name VDE$NOTES_LIBRARY.
<a name="index_x_275"></a>
<a name="index_x_276"></a>
If this logical name is not defined, the default file specification 
&quot;NOTES$LIBRARY:.NOTE&quot; is applied to the 
<strong>file-spec</strong> parameter.
<h3>/DEFER</h3>
<h3>/NODEFER (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the creation of the disk directory structure for the 
stream should be postponed. The /DEFER qualifier postpones creation of 
the disk directory structure and the /NODEFER qualifier causes the disk 
directory structure to be created immediately. Use the /DEFER qualifier 
when the default directory structure is inappropriate for the new 
stream.

<p>
If the /NODEFER qualifier is specified (or /DEFER is omitted), the 
CREATE STREAM command creates the disk directory structure for the 
stream. This structure includes a stream root directory, a root 
directory for each facility, and facility subdirectories that hold the 
files that are the contents of the facility in the new stream. The 
directory structure is determined by the SET DIRECTORY commands entered 
for the new stream (or inherited from the parent stream) or by 
VDE default rules. Once VDE has created the new 
stream's directory structure for a given facility, VDE runs 
the stream's new-stream script for that facility, provided such a 
script is defined. Depending on how it is defined, this script may 
populate the directories for that facility with source modules and 
other files.

<p>
If the /DEFER qualifier is specified, the CREATE STREAM command does 
not create a directory structure for the new stream. If you use the 
/DEFER qualifier, you can enter SET DIRECTORY commands to specify the 
structure of the disk directories. Then use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE 
command to create the directory structure on disk. The CREATE 
DIRECTORY_TREE command uses VDE defaults and the rules you 
specified with the SET DIRECTORY commands to create the new directory 
structure.
<h3>/DELETE</h3>
<h3>/NODELETE</h3>
Controls whether the <strong>delete</strong> attribute is set for the 
new stream. This attribute allows the stream to be deleted with the 
DELETE STREAM command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete attribute 
so that the new stream can be deleted. The /NODELETE qualifier clears 
the delete attribute so that the new stream cannot be deleted unless 
you first reset this attribute with a MODIFY STREAM command. This makes 
it harder to accidentally delete a stream. If you specify neither 
qualifier, VDE uses the value of the allow-deletion library 
attribute as the initial value of the stream's delete attribute. This 
library attribute is set with the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier to the CREATE 
and MODIFY LIBRARY commands.
<h3>/DIRECTORY=dir-spec</h3>
Specifies the name of the root directory of the stream. The root 
directory normally contains a subdirectory for each facility. Each 
subdirectory has additional subdirectories for the sources and derived 
files of the facility and stream. (To modify the default
<a name="index_x_277"></a>
directory structure, first use the CREATE STREAM command with the 
/DEFER qualifier then use the SET DIRECTORY and CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE 
commands to create the directory structure you want.) Use the 
OpenVMS directory specification format to specify the 
<strong>dir-spec</strong> parameter.
<h3>/INIT_CMS_CLASS</h3>
<h3>/NOINIT_CMS_CLASS</h3>
Specifies whether VDE initializes the CMS class for the 
stream in each facility's CMS library when the /CMS_CLASS qualifier 
specifies that such
<a name="index_x_278"></a>
a class should be maintained. /INIT_CMS_CLASS causes the CREATE STREAM 
or MODIFY STREAM command with the /CMS_CLASS qualifier to create and 
populate a CMS class with the same name as the stream in each facility. 
/NOINIT_CMS_CLASS causes these commands to not create or populate such 
CMS classes. /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS is useful for very large VDE 
libraries where the initialization of CMS classes take an excessively 
long time. For such libraries, it is better to use a separate command 
procedure to initialize the desired CMS classes; such a procedure can 
process the facilities of your library in parallel for faster 
completion.

<p>
If you specify neither of these qualifiers, VDE uses the 
initialization attribute of the new stream's parent stream. By default, 
the initial stream for the VDE library (stream MAIN) is 
created with initialization enabled (in effect, /INIT_CMS_CLASS is the 
default). All other streams will inherit this attribute unless you 
change it with an explicit /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS qualifier.

<p>
Unless you have existing command procedures or programs that depend on 
the presence of CMS classes, Digital recommends that you not maintain 
CMS classes for the streams in your VDE library. Maintaining 
CMS classes is quite slow, especially when creating new streams, and 
VDE does not need CMS classes for any of its functions.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after new streams are 
created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that each new 
stream has been created, that its disk directory structure has been 
created, and that the database transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/MAIN</h3>
<h3>/NOMAIN (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the new stream is part of the main development thread 
for your project. The /MAIN qualifier says that the new stream is part 
of the main development thread for the project and is expected to be in 
use for a relatively long time, and is expected to be in use after the 
parent stream has been closed. VDE assigns the shortest 
possible CMS &quot;generation expressions&quot; to new generations in a 
main stream. The /NOMAIN qualifier says that the new stream is not part 
of the project's main development thread and is expected to have a 
shorter future lifetime than the parent stream. In this case, 
VDE may assign longer CMS generation expressions (using CMS 
&quot;variant letters&quot;) to future module generations in the stream.

<p>
You normally use the /MAIN qualifier when you create a stream for your 
project that will be the future continuation of the parent stream. 
Creating stream V2.0 from stream V1.0 is an example since development 
of Version 1.0 of your project will cease as Version 2.0 carries the 
project into the future. You use the /NOMAIN qualifier when you create 
base levels or other streams that are expected to have short lifetimes 
compared to the parent stream.

<p>
If you specify the /MAIN qualifier, the new stream automatically 
becomes a successor of the parent stream so that changes are propagated 
from the parent to the new stream. If you specify the /MAIN qualifier 
but you do not specify the /SUCCESSOR or /NOSUCCESSOR qualifier, the 
main streams that are successors of the parent stream are removed as 
successors of the parent stream and instead become successors of the 
new stream. The effect is that the new stream is inserted into the 
successor chain after the parent stream. If you specify the /NOMAIN 
qualifier, no such insertion takes place.

<p>
For information on changing the main line of descent attribute specific 
to a particular module generation, see the documentation on the MODIFY 
GENERATION/MAIN_STREAM command in <a href="vde_manual_017.html#vde_cmd_mod_gen">MODIFY GENERATION</a>.

<h3>/NOGENERATIONS</h3>
Specifies that the new stream should not be populated with the latest 
generations of the parent stream. If you use this qualifier, you get a 
new stream containing no generations. If you omit this qualifier, 
VDE populates the new stream with the latest generations of 
the parent stream.
<h3>/NOTIFY=(username [,username...])</h3>
Specifies users to notify of all changes replaced into the new stream. 
Each <strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the OpenVMS 
username or mail address of a user who should be notified by mail 
message each time a module is replaced into the stream, and each time a 
new facility is created in the stream.
<a name="index_x_281"></a>

<p>
Each <strong>username</strong> parameter can specify the username of a 
user already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS 
mail address with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail 
forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of users to 
notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind that the logical 
name must be defined when it is later used to send notification 
messages. It should thus be a group or system logical name or a logical 
name that is in some other way defined for all users of the 
VDE library.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter, you may 
omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/OPEN (default)</h3>
<h3>/FROZEN</h3>
<h3>/CLOSED</h3>
Determines the status of the new stream: open, frozen, or permanently 
closed. If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all users can reserve and 
replace source modules from the stream and thereby modify the contents 
of the stream.

<p>
If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve modules 
from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN privilege to
<a name="index_x_282"></a>
replace modules into the stream; non-privileged users cannot change the 
contents of the stream. You can later change the status to open with 
the MODIFY STREAM command, so the stream is not permanently frozen.

<p>
If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved from 
or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed with a 
subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the UNCLOSE privilege.
<a name="index_x_283"></a>
Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want the contents of the 
stream to change again, for example, when capturing a base-level of 
your software system or when capturing the final state of a released 
version of your software.

<p>
Of /OPEN, /FROZEN and /CLOSED, /OPEN is the default.
<h3>/OWNER=username</h3>
Specifies the owner of the new stream. The <strong>username</strong> 
parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of a user who should be 
considered to be the &quot;owner&quot; of the stream. VDE 
assigns no special meaning to the owner of a stream, but the SHOW 
STREAM command displays the owner. The owner could thus be the person 
to contact with questions about the stream.

<p>
If you omit this qualifier, VDE records no owner for the 
stream.
<h3>/PARENT=stream-name</h3>
Specifies the parent of the new stream. If this qualifier is specified, 
the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter gives the name of the 
development stream that should be the parent of the new stream being 
created. If this qualifier is omitted, the default stream becomes the 
parent of the new stream.

<p>
Correct specification of this qualifier is of central importance when 
uploading facilities and streams from an existing set of CMS libraries. 
See the CREATE FACILITY/FROM_CMS_LIBRARY command.

<p>
Specification of /PARENT is required.
<h3>/POPULATE (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOPOPULATE</h3>
Specifies whether the stream is allowed to be populated with 
generations from another stream using the POPULATE STREAM command. 
/POPULATE allows subsequent use of the POPULATE STREAM command to 
populate the stream and /NOPOPULATE disallows such use.
<h3>/PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count</h3>
Specifies the default number of processes to execute build jobs for the 
new stream. This parameter determines the degree of parallelism for the 
stream's build jobs. See the description of the BUILD command for a 
detailed description of this qualifier.
<h3>/QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])</h3>
Specifies the default batch queues to which build jobs for the new 
stream are submitted. See the description of the BUILD command for a 
detailed description of this qualifier and for a description of its 
interaction with the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier.
<a name="index_x_285"></a>
<a name="index_x_286"></a>
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new stream. The quoted 
remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the new stream that you want stored in the 
VDE database. Typically the remark indicates the version or 
base-level of your system.
