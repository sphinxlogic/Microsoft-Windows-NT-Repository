<h3>/NOTIFY=(username [,username...])</h3>
<h3> /NONOTIFY[=(username [,username...])]</h3>
<a name="index_x_480"></a>
The /NOTIFY qualifier specifies a list of users to notify of all 
replacements into the specified stream, and of all facility creation 
operations. VDE appends these users to the stream's existing 
notification list. Each <strong>username</strong> parameter gives the 
OpenVMS username or mail address of a user who should be 
notified by mail message each time a module is replaced into the stream.

<p>
Each <strong>username</strong> parameter can specify the username of a 
user already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS 
mail address with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail 
forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of users to 
notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind that the logical 
name must be defined when it is later used to send notification 
messages. It should thus be a group or system logical name or a logical 
name that is in some other way defined for all users of the 
VDE library.

<p>
The /NONOTIFY qualifier specifies that a list of users already on the 
stream's notification list be removed from that notification list. Each 
<strong>username</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS username 
or mail address of a user to remove from the notification list. If you 
omit the <strong>username</strong> parameters, VDE removes 
the entire notification list for the stream.

<p>
If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users 
specified with the /NONOTIFY qualifier from the notification list 
before adding the users specified with the /NOTIFY qualifier.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter with either 
qualifier, you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/OPEN</h3>
<h3>/FROZEN</h3>
<h3>/CLOSED</h3>
Sets the status of the stream to open, frozen, or permanently closed. 
If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all users can reserve and replace 
source modules from the stream and thereby modify the contents of the 
stream.

<p>
If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve modules 
from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN privilege to
<a name="index_x_481"></a>
replace modules into the stream; non-privileged users cannot change the 
contents of the stream. You can later change the status to open with 
another MODIFY STREAM command, so the stream is not permanently frozen.

<p>
If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved from 
or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed with a 
subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the UNCLOSE privilege.
<a name="index_x_482"></a>
Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want the contents of the 
stream to change again, for example, when capturing a base-level of 
your software system or when capturing the final state of a released 
version of your software.

<p>
You must have the UNCLOSE privilege to use the /OPEN or /FROZEN
<a name="index_x_483"></a>
qualifier for a closed stream.
<h3>/OWNER=username</h3>
<h3>/NOOWNER</h3>
The /OWNER qualifier specifies the owner of the specified stream. The 
<strong>username</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS username 
of a user who should be recorded as the &quot;owner&quot; of the 
stream. VDE assigns no special meaning to the owner of a 
stream, but the SHOW STREAM command displays the owner. The owner could 
thus be the person to contact with questions about the stream.

<p>
The /NOOWNER qualifier specifies that the stream has no owner. Both 
qualifiers remove the previous owner's ownership of the stream.
<h3>/POPULATE</h3>
<h3>/NOPOPULATE</h3>
Specifies whether the stream is allowed to be populated with 
generations from another stream using the POPULATE STREAM command. 
/POPULATE allows subsequent use of the POPULATE STREAM command to 
populate the stream and /NOPOPULATE disallows such use. You must have 
the CRESTRM privilege to use these qualifiers.
<a name="index_x_484"></a>
<h3>/PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count</h3>
Specifies the default number of processes to execute build jobs for the 
stream. This parameter determines the degree of parallelism for the 
stream's build jobs. See the description of the BUILD command for a 
detailed description of this qualifier.
<h3>/QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])</h3>
Specifies the default batch queues to which build jobs for the stream 
are submitted. See the description of the BUILD command for a detailed 
description of this qualifier and for a description of its interaction 
with the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier.
<a name="index_x_485"></a>
<a name="index_x_486"></a>
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string for the stream. The quoted remark string, 
which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any explanatory 
remark about the stream that you want stored in the VDE 
database. Typically the remark describes what version or base-level of 
your system the stream represents. This string replaces the remark 
string from the original CREATE STREAM command or from any previous 
MODIFY STREAM command.
<h3>/REPLACEMENT=keyword</h3>
Sets or clears the <strong>queued-replacement</strong> attribute for 
the stream. This attribute controls whether the REPLACE command permits 
immediate replacements into the stream or requires queued replacements.
<a name="index_x_487"></a>
If the <strong>keyword</strong> parameter is IMMEDIATE, the REPLACE 
command will immediately replace modules into the stream by default. If 
the parameter is QUEUE, the REPLACE command will always queue 
replacements for the stream so that modules are not replaced into the 
stream until a privileged user enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.
<h3>/REVIEWER=(username [,username...])</h3>
<h3> /NOREVIEWER[=(username [,username...])]</h3>
<a name="index_x_488"></a>
The /REVIEWER qualifier specifies a list of reviewers for all module 
replacements into the specified stream. VDE appends these 
reviewers to the stream's existing reviewer list. Each 
<strong>username</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS username 
of a user who should review all replacements into the stream. The user 
must already be recorded in the VDE database. When a module 
is replaced into the stream, VDE notifies the user of the 
replacement by mail message. If the replacement is
<a name="index_x_489"></a>
queued, the user should then review the queued replacement before it is 
performed. If the replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the 
user of the new module generation that was created, and the user may 
then inspect that generation.

<p>
The /NOREVIEWER qualifier specifies that a list of existing reviewers 
for the specified stream be removed from the reviewer list. Each 
<strong>username</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS username 
of a user who should be removed from the reviewer list. If you omit the 
<strong>username</strong> parameters, VDE removes the entire 
reviewer list for the stream.

<p>
If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users 
specified with the /NOREVIEWER qualifier from the reviewer list before 
adding the users specified with the /REVIEWER qualifier.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter with either 
qualifier, you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/STEP_DELAY=time-interval</h3>
Specifies the default step-delay time interval used by build jobs for 
the stream. See the description of the BUILD command for a
<a name="index_x_490"></a>
detailed description of this qualifier.
<h3>/SUCCESSOR=(succ-name [, succ-name...])</h3>
Specifies new successors to the stream being modified. A successor to a 
stream is another stream to which source changes are propagated by the 
REPLACE command. Each <strong>succ-name</strong> parameter specifies 
the name of a stream that becomes a successor to the stream given by 
the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. The specified successors 
are added to the list of successors already stored in the database. You 
must have the CRESTRM privilege to use this qualifier.
<a name="index_x_491"></a>
<h3>/TIMEOUT=time-interval</h3>
Specifies the default timeout interval used by build jobs for the 
stream. See the description of the BUILD command for a detailed 
description of this qualifier.

This example illustrates the /CONFIRM qualifier. This qualifier causes 
VDE to ask the user whether each specified stream should be

remark string for that stream is modified in the database, as the log 
message shows. For stream BLVL-9, the user answers N (for NO) and that 
stream is not modified. Hence there is no log message for that stream.

The OpenVMS username of the user whose record is to be modified 
in the current VDE library. You can modify more than one 
user record by using wildcard characters in the username. The percent 
sign (%) in a username matches any single character in the position it 
occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. The attributes of those user records whose 
usernames match the wildcard pattern are modified.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies a new set of authorized privileges that the user is allowed 
to set with the SET PRIVILEGE command. The privilege list you create 
replaces the user's current privilege list. Therefore, you must specify 
all authorized privileges you want the user to have.

<p>
Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If only one 
privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted.

<p>
For a list of privileges, see <a href="vde_manual_028.html#tbl_privileges">Table 3-5</a> in <a href="vde_manual_028.html#vde_cmd_set_priv">SET PRIVILEGES</a>.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
user record modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for each user giving the username and asking whether 
you want to modify the user record. If you answer YES (or Y), the user 
record is modified. If you answer NO (or N), the user record is not 
modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify the 
user record without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies the default privileges which are enabled each time the user 
starts a new VDE session. Each default privilege specified 
also becomes an authorized privilege for the user. The privilege list 
you create replaces the user's current privilege list. Therefore, you 
must specify all default privileges you want the user to have.

<p>
Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If only one 
privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted. For a list of 
the privilege names you can specify, see the SET PRIVILEGES command.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the user records are 
modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the user records 
have been modified and that the database transaction has successfully 
committed.
<h3>/NAME="string"</h3>
Specifies a full name for the user. The quoted name string, which can 
be up to 40 characters long, should contain a new full name string 
(first name, middle initial, and last name) for the user.
<h3>/NOTIFY=(username [,username...])</h3>
<h3> /NONOTIFY[=(username [,username...])]</h3>
<a name="index_x_494"></a>
The /NOTIFY qualifier specifies a list of users to notify each time the 
specified user replaces a module into the VDE library. 
VDE appends these users to the specified user's existing 
notification list. Each <strong>username</strong> parameter gives the 
OpenVMS username or mail address of a user who should be 
notified by mail message each time the specified user replaces a module 
into the library.

<p>
Each <strong>username</strong> parameter can specify the username of a 
user already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS 
mail address with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail 
forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of users to 
notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind that the logical 
name must be defined when it is later used to send notification 
messages. It should thus be a group or system logical name or a logical 
name that is in some other way defined for all users of the 
VDE library.

<p>
The /NONOTIFY qualifier specifies that a list of users already on the 
specified user's notification list be removed from that notification 
list. Each <strong>username</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS 
username or mail address of a user to remove from the notification 
list. If you omit the <strong>username</strong> parameters, 
VDE removes the entire notification list.

<p>
If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users 
specified with the /NONOTIFY qualifier from the notification list 
before adding the users specified with the /NOTIFY qualifier.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter with either 
qualifier, you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the user. The quoted remark 
string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the user that you want stored in the 
VDE database. This string replaces the remark string from 
the original CREATE USER command or from any previous MODIFY USER 
command. Typically the remark describes the user's affiliation or 
function within the organization.
<h3>/REVIEWER=(username [,username...])</h3>
<h3> /NOREVIEWER[=(username [,username...])]</h3>
<a name="index_x_495"></a>
The /REVIEWER qualifier specifies a list of reviewers for all changes 
replaced into the VDE library by the specified user. 
VDE appends these reviewers to the user's existing reviewer 
list. Each <strong>username</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS 
username of a user who should review all changes created by the 
specified user. The new reviewer must already be recorded in the 
VDE database. When the specified user replaces a module into 
the VDE library, VDE notifies the reviewer of the 
change by mail message. If the replacement is queued, the reviewer 
should then review the queued replacement before it is
<a name="index_x_496"></a>
performed. If the replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the 
reviewer of the new module generation that was created, and he or she 
may then inspect that generation. This qualifier can be used to set up 
&quot;buddy systems&quot; where two users always review each other's 
code.

<p>
The /NOREVIEWER qualifier specifies that a list of existing reviewers 
for the specified user be removed from the reviewer list. Each 
<strong>username</strong> parameter gives the OpenVMS username 
of a user who should be removed from the reviewer list. If you omit the 
<strong>username</strong> parameters, VDE removes the entire 
reviewer list for the user.

<p>
If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users 
specified with the /NOREVIEWER qualifier from the reviewer list before 
adding the users specified with the /REVIEWER qualifier.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter with either 
qualifier, you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Specifies a new OpenVMS username for the user. The new username 
can be up to 12 characters long and must follow normal VDE 
name syntax. If you change a username in the VDE database 
you should also remember to have your system manager change it in the 
system User Authorization File. After the username is changed, you must 
refer to the user by the new name in all subsequent VDE 
commands and the user must access the database with the new username.

<h3>PERFORM REPLACEMENT rep-name [, rep-name...] </h3>

<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>rep-name</h3>
The name of a queued replacement to be performed. You can perform more
<a name="index_x_500"></a>
than one replacement at a time by using wildcard characters in the 
replacement name. The percent sign (%) in a name matches any single 
character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero 
or more characters in the position it occupies. Those queued 
replacements whose names match the wildcard pattern are performed.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The PERFORM REPLACEMENT command replaces the modules that are members 
of a specified queued replacement into the VDE library. Once 
this command has completed, each member module has a new generation in 
the library and is no longer marked as reserved in the affected 
streams. In addition, the replacement is no longer queued in the 
VDE database.

<p>
The PERFORM REPLACEMENT command only performs those replacements that 
match the <strong>rep-name</strong> parameters and that belong to your 
default stream or to another stream specified with the /STREAM 
qualifier. To perform replacements belonging to more than one stream, 
you can use wildcard characters in the stream name you specify with the 
/STREAM qualifier.

<p>
The PERFORM REPLACEMENT command is normally used by a user who is 
authorized to determine when changed modules should be replaced into 
the VDE library. Other developers reserve source modules, 
make changes to them, and queue them for replacement with the REPLACE 
command. The REPLACE command queues modules for replacement (as opposed 
to replacing them immediately), if the user specifies the /QUEUE 
qualifier or if any affected development stream has the 
queued-replacement attribute. Once a replacement is queued, it can 
optionally be reviewed using the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command and its 
subcommands. When the authorized user decides that the modules that are 
members of the queued replacement are
<a name="index_x_501"></a>
ready to be replaced into the VDE library, the user enters 
the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to actually perform the replacement. 
When replacements are queued, it is the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command 
that actually creates new generations for the modules and that 
terminates the module reservations.

<p>
Whether you should use queued replacements or not is a policy decision
<a name="index_x_502"></a>
that may be different for different VDE libraries or for 
different development stream within a given library. If you decide to 
always use immediate replacements, the REPLACE command will perform the 
actual replacement and you do not use the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
replacement performed. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for each replacement asking whether you want that 
replacement performed. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement is 
performed. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement is not performed. 
If you enter a replacement name with a wildcard specification, 
VDE asks you to confirm that VDE should perform 
each replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification. The 
/NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to perform the specified 
replacements without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement has 
been performed. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed 
and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that 
the associated modules have been replaced, that the replacement has 
been performed, and that the database transaction has successfully 
committed.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that only those replacements that belong to certain streams 
be performed. The <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter specifies a 
stream name and can contain wildcard characters. The percent sign (%) 
in a name matches any single character in the position it occupies and 
the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. VDE performs a given replacement only if it 
belongs to a stream whose name matches the <strong>stream-name</strong> 
parameter. If you omit this qualifier, VDE performs only 
those replacements that belong to your default stream.

<p>
For each replacement that matches a <strong>rep-name</strong> parameter 
but does not belong to a stream matching the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter, VDE prints an 
informational message saying that the replacement is not performed.
