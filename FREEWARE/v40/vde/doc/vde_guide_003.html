<a name="repl_mods"><h1><font color=maroon>2.7 Replacing Modules</font></h1></a>

<p>
After you have reserved a module and changed it, you need to build it, 
test it, and replace it onto the OpenVMS VAX library. This chapter 
describes how you replace modules back onto the OpenVMS VAX library 
after you have changed, built, and tested them as appropriate.

<p>
You use the REPLACE command to copy a new or changed module from your 
default directory (or another directory you specify) into the specified 
library. Before you can use the REPLACE command for a module, you must 
first reserve the module with the RESERVE command or create the module 
with the CREATE MODULE command. The REPLACE command replaces the module 
into the development stream you specify and automatically propagates 
the change to that stream's successors. The following example shows how 
to use the REPLACE command:
<a name="index_x_125"></a>
<a name="index_x_126"></a>
<a name="index_x_127"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; REPLACE/STREAM=FOO [FACIL]MOD.TYP "Remark string"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example replaces module MOD.TYP in facility FACIL onto the 
OpenVMS VAX library. The module is replace into stream FOO, which 
means that the module must already be reserved for that stream and the 
input file becomes the latest generation of the module for that stream. 
If you omit the /STREAM qualifier, the module is replaced into your 
default stream.

<p>
With the REPLACE command, you can specify a list of module names 
separated by commas, and you can use the asterisk (*) and percent sign 
(%) wildcard characters in the module names. All modules that match the 
wildcard patterns are replaced.

<p>
VDE also allows you to associate a number of modules from 
various RESERVE and CREATE MODULE commands together, by using the 
/SESSION qualifier. The /SESSION qualifier allows you to pick a name 
for a group of modules, and you can avoid having to specify each 
individual module on the REPLACE command. The use of /SESSION also 
provides the reviewers and the project leader with a clear indication 
that a group of replacement modules are related.

<p>
Optionally, you can specify a remark string as a parameter at the end 
of the command, as shown in the previous example. The remark parameter 
has the same effect as the /REMARK qualifier described in <a href="vde_guide_003.html#qualtbl_replace">Table 2-5</a> 
and applies to all modules being replaced unless overridden by /REMARK 
qualifiers on the individual module-name parameters. If you do not 
specify a remark, VSC prompts you for it. If you then enter a 
null remark string, VSC uses the remark from your original 
RESERVE command.

<p>
The REPLACE command also asks you for the cause that is the reason or 
justification for the the replacement. The reason can be a fold record, 
a Source Control Tracking (SCT) entry, or other cause. If the reason is 
specified by an SCT entry, VSC allows several options: it can 
enter the SCT note for you, it can ask you for the number of a 
pre-existing SCT entry, and it allows you to edit the SCT note during 
the replacement. VSC also asks for any related QARs (Quality 
Assurance Reports) or CLDs (urgent customer problems).
<a name="index_x_128"></a>
<a name="index_x_129"></a>
The following partial example shows how you specify the SCT entry and 
problem reports associated with a replacement:

<p>
<a name="queued_repl"><strong>Queued Replacements</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
When you use the REPLACE command to replace a module into a normal 
OpenVMS VAX development stream, VSC does not immediately 
replace the module into the library, and it does not immediately cancel 
your reservation on the module. Instead, it queues the module for 
replacement at a later time when the release project leader for the 
stream allows the actual replacement to take place. The release project 
leader normally will not allow the actual replacement to proceed until 
your replacement has been reviewed.
<a name="index_x_131"></a>
<a name="index_x_132"></a>

<p>
When the REPLACE command queues your replacement (also called creating 
a <strong>queued replacement</strong>), it performs the following 
operations:

<ul>
  <li>The source control system records the queued replacement in its 
  database and assigns it a name. This name can later be used with other 
  commands to reference the queued replacement. By default, VSC 
  creates the replacement name by concatenating your user name, a hyphen, 
  and a small integer, where the integer makes the replacement name 
  unique. If your username is SMITH, for example, your first replacement 
  is named SMITH--1. You can override this default name with the 
  /REPLACEMENT qualifier.
  <li>The source control system records what modules belong to this 
  queued replacement. All modules you list on the REPLACE command become 
  members of the queued replacement. These modules are still marked as 
  reserved in the database since they have not actually been replaced yet.
  <li>The source control system copies each replaced module to a special 
  disk directory under its own control so that the module no longer needs 
  to remain in your directory. This special disk directory is called the 
  replacement's <strong>staging area</strong>. (An added benefit of 
  staging areas is that they allow lost generations to be recovered after 
  a VDE failure; see <a href="vde_guide_014.html#maint_lib_backup_recover_cms">Section 7.4.10</a>.)
  <li>The source control system asks you whether you want to edit an 
  information file for the replacement to pass instructions or other 
  information to the reviewers and the release project leader. If you 
  answer YES, it invokes your preferred editor to create the file.
</ul>

<p>
VSC queues the module replacement request into the 
VDE database for review, and notifies the release project 
leader. Once the changes are reviewed, the release project leader then 
uses the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to accept the replacement. Once 
the replacement has been accepted, the pending modification request 
will be dequeued and the modification will be committed into the 
VDE database. You will typically receive a mail message from 
VSC when your replacement has been performed. See 
<a href="vde_guide_006.html#rev_repl">Chapter 4</a> and <a href="vde_guide_007.html#perf_que_repl">Section 5.1</a> for information on the VSC 
commands used by reviewers and by project leaders, respectively.
<a name="index_x_133"></a>
<p>
<a name="immed_repl"><strong>Immediate Replacements</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
For some development streams, the VSC utility performs 
<em>immediate</em> replacements. An immediate replacement updates the 
library---you guessed it---immediately. When you enter the REPLACE 
command, the module is copied into the library. OpenVMS VAX does not 
typically permit immediate replacements into its major development 
streams, but might allow them for selected off-to-the-side development 
streams used by small numbers of developers. Whether the REPLACE 
command performs a queued or immediate replacement is thus a property 
of the development stream you are replacing modules into. If any 
development stream affected by the replacement (directly or through 
change propagation) requires queued replacements, the replacement is 
queued.
<a name="index_x_134"></a>
<a name="index_x_135"></a>

<p>
A disadvantage of immediate replacements is that they do not create 
staging areas, which can prevent recovery of lost generations after a 
VDE failure.
<p>
<a name="replace_quals"><strong>Qualifiers</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
The REPLACE command accepts a number of qualifiers. The help text and 
the reference manual have the details on the qualifiers accepted by the 
command. <a href="vde_guide_003.html#qualtbl_replace">Table 2-5</a> lists the more commonly-used qualifiers. <p>

       /SESSION allows you to replace a number of reserved and created modules 
       together with a single command, and allows you to avoid specifying each 
       module on the command. When used with the queued-replacement 
       environment, the use of sessions also provides a clear indication to 
       the reviewers and to the project leader that the modules being replaced 
       are associated. The particular session name used is typically a 
       mnemonic name chosen by the user when the CREATE MODULE or RESERVE 
       command is issued, and usually reflects the particular set of changes 
       being made.

      default development stream.

In the following example of a queued replacement, user HOFFMAN replaces 
module FOO.MAR into facility SYS in development stream PHOENIX:

As the log messages show, VSC queues the replacement and 
assigns it the name HOFFMAN--1. VSC also asks whether the 
user wants to edit an information file for the replacement. An 
information file passes information to the reviewers and the release 
project leader. In this example, the answer is NO, but had the answer 
been YES, VSC would have invoked an editor to create the 
information file. Replacement HOFFMAN--1 is then available for review. 
It will be reviewed by user JONES and by any automatic reviewers for 
the module and stream. After it has been reviewed, it is up to the 
release project leader to actually perform the replacement.

<p>
In the following example of an immediate replacement, module MOD.TYP in 
facility FACIL is replaced into development stream TOM:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC&gt; REPLACE/STREAM=TOM [FACIL]MOD.TYP "Remark string"/NOTE=321

Please specify related QARs and CLDs if applicable:
Enter name of QAR database (or RETURN if none): V54-FT
Enter QAR number: 35
Enter name of QAR database (or RETURN to end list): 
Enter the CLD number (or RETURN if none): APO-12345

%VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
VSC&gt;
</pre>
</font>
</table>

Because stream JERRY is a successor of stream TOM in this example and 
because this module has not diverged between those two streams, the 
change (the new module generation) is automatically propagated to 
stream JERRY. The new instance of this module thus becomes the latest 
generation of the module for those two streams. The /NOTE qualifier 
indicates that additional information on this change was included in a 
previously-created SCT note, 321.0; this note was previously loaded 
into the SCT notes conference SCT-TOM.
