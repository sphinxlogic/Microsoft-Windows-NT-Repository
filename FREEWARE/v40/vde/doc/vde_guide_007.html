Use the SHOW REPLACEMENT command (see <a href="vde_guide_004.html#disp_repl">Section 2.9</a>) to display the 
status of a replacement being reviewed. For each replacement, this 
command can list the reviewers and whether each reviewer has accepted, 
rejected, or not reviewed the replacement.

</font>

<p>
This chapter explains how to perform those source control operations 
normally performed by release project leaders and by maintainers of the 
various VDE libraries. These operations include performing 
queued replacements, inserting generations into development streams, 
removing generations from streams, deleting generations, specifying 
reviewers for streams and modules, and creating build streams.

<p>
These operations are typically not performed by most developers. All 
commands here require VSC privileges. <em>Many of the 
commands documented in this section can have serious adverse effects on 
a VDE library.</em>

<a name="perf_que_repl"><h1><font color=maroon>5.1 Performing Queued Replacements</font></h1></a>

<p>
If you are the project leader for a given development stream, you are 
responsible for performing all replacements queued for that stream. To 
see what replacements are queued for your stream, use the SHOW 
REPLACEMENT command (see <a href="vde_guide_004.html#disp_repl">Section 2.9</a>) with the /STREAM qualifier. The 
/STREAM qualifier selects those replacements that are for your stream. 
You might also want to use the /FULL qualifier to display the list of 
reviewers for each replacement and their votes to accept or reject it. 
However, even the brief SHOW REPLACEMENT output summarizes the review 
status of a replacement. You should also use the REVIEW REPLACEMENT 
command to read the queuing user's information file since that file 
might have information meant for you.
<a name="index_x_223"></a>
<a name="index_x_224"></a>
<a name="index_x_225"></a>

<p>
Based on the advice of the reviewers and your own judgement, you must 
decide whether to perform each such replacement. Once you have decided 
to perform a given replacement, you do so by entering the PERFORM 
REPLACEMENT command. For example:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ PERFORM REPLACEMENT SMITH-1 /STREAM=BIRCH
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This command performs the queued replacement specified by the 
replacement name parameter (SMITH--1). This replacement must belong to 
stream BIRCH. All modules included in the replacement are copied from 
the source control system's staging area to the appropriate CMS 
libraries. The new module generations are inserted into the development 
stream for which the replacement was queued and all successor streams 
reachable through change propagation. The queued replacement and the 
associated module reservations are then deleted from the database.

<p>
The PERFORM REPLACEMENT command accepts a list of replacement names 
separated by commas, and you can use the asterisk (*) and percent sign 
(%) wildcard characters in the names. The command performs all queued 
replacements that match the wildcard patterns and belong to the 
specified stream or streams.

<p>
The /STREAM qualifier specifies that replacement should be performed 
only if they belong to a specified stream. The stream name can contain 
wildcard characters, in which case VSC performs all 
replacements that match both the specified replacement names and the 
specified stream name. If you omit the /STREAM qualifier, VSC 
performs only those specified replacements that belong to your default 
stream.

<p>
Since the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command can be time-consuming, you might 
want to include it in a DCL command file that you run as a batch job.

<p>
The log messages that the command prints indicate that each module has 
been replaced into the appropriate streams. If a module is replaced 
into multiple streams due to change propagation, you will see one 
message per stream. Other messages tell you if VSC created 
fold records. VSC also prints an informational message for 
each replacement that matches the specified replacement names but is 
not performed because it does not belong to a requested stream.

<p>
In some unusual circumstances, you might also see a message that tells 
you that a module generation did not get the same generation expression 
(such as 5A1) as VSC expected when the module was reserved. 
In this case, you should notify the developer since he or she might 
have used the expected generation expression as an audit trail 
identifier in code comments.

<p>
VSC also includes all log messages in a mail message that it 
sends to the developer who queued the reservation. The developer will 
therefore see what happened during the replacement and will be aware of 
any errors that arose. If errors occurred, you should work with the 
developer to resolve the errors so that replacement can be performed 
again.

<p>
The PERFORM REPLACEMENT requires the VSC privilege PERFREP.

<a name="ins_gen"><h1><font color=maroon>5.2 Inserting Generations</font></h1></a>

<p>
In addition to providing automatic change propagation, the source 
control system gives you a manual way to insert a change already made 
to one development stream into another stream. The INSERT GENERATION 
command makes an existing generation of a module into the latest 
generation for a specified development stream. This command is mainly 
used to take bug fixes and other changes that have already been 
replaced into some development stream and insert them into a base level 
or variant stream that needs those changes to build correctly. This 
command requires the VSC privilege PERFREP. The following 
example shows how to use the INSERT GENERATION command:
<a name="index_x_229"></a>
<a name="index_x_230"></a>
<a name="index_x_231"></a>
<a name="index_x_232"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ INSERT GENERATION [FACIL]MOD.TYP/STREAM=PHOENIX P-BUILD "remark"
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example inserts the latest generation of module [FACIL]MOD.TYP in 
stream PHOENIX into stream P--BUILD. PHOENIX is thus the source stream 
and P--BUILD is the destination stream for the generation. The command 
also inserts that generation into the corresponding CMS class if the 
destination stream maintains a CMS class. The quoted remark string is 
optional; if specified, it should explain the reason for inserting the 
generation into the stream.

<p>
You can specify a generation number for the source stream if you want 
to select a generation other than the latest one. Zero and negative 
generation numbers are allowed; they specify generation numbers 
relative to the latest generation for the source stream. You can also 
use the qualifier /GENERATION=<em>gen-expr</em> to identify the 
generation by its CMS generation expression.

<p>
If you omit both the /STREAM qualifier and the /GENERATION qualifier, 
VSC prompts you for the source stream.

<p>
The inserted generation's position in the source stream is not affected 
by this command. In the previous example, the selected generation thus 
winds up being the latest generation for both stream PHOENIX and stream 
P--BUILD.

<a name="rem_gen"><h1><font color=maroon>5.3 Removing Generations</font></h1></a>

<p>
Sometimes it is necessary to remove a generation from a given 
development stream so that the module no longer has a latest generation 
in that stream. For example, sometimes one needs to undo an INSERT 
GENERATION command directed to the wrong stream. After you have removed 
a module generation from a stream, the module no longer 
&quot;belongs&quot; to that stream and can no longer be fetched, 
reserved, or built for the stream. The REMOVE GENERATION command 
removes a generation from a stream. For example:
<a name="index_x_234"></a>
<a name="index_x_235"></a>
<a name="index_x_236"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ REMOVE GENERATION [FACIL]MOD.TYP/STREAM=FOO
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example removes the latest generation of module MOD.TYP in 
facility FACIL from stream FOO. Afterwards, no generation of MOD.TYP is 
the latest generation of the module for stream FOO; the module is no 
longer represented in that stream.

<p>
The removed generation remains in the VDE library, and it can 
still be the latest generation of the module for some other stream. The 
REMOVE GENERATION command thus breaks the association between the 
module generation and the specified stream but does not delete the 
generation.

<p>
The REMOVE GENERATION command accepts a list of module names separated 
by commas, and you can use the asterisk (*) and percent sign (%) 
wildcard characters in the module names. The latest generations of 
those modules that match the wildcard patterns are removed from the 
specified stream.

<p>
Keep in mind that the REMOVE GENERATION command may not be the command 
you actually want to use. It is not very common that you want a module 
to not belong to a given stream at all; it is much more common that you 
want some other generation of the module to be the latest generation 
for the stream. Before you use the REMOVE GENERATION command, you 
should thus make sure that INSERT GENERATION or DELETE GENERATION is 
not the appropriate command.

<p>
The REMOVE GENERATION command requires the VSC privilege 
PERFREP.

<a name="del_gen"><h1><font color=maroon>5.4 Deleting Generations</font></h1></a>

<p>
When it is necessary to undo a change to a module, you can delete the 
latest generation of the module in a specified stream with the DELETE 
GENERATION command. This command requires the VSC privilege 
PERFREP. The following example shows how to use the DELETE GENERATION 
command:
<a name="index_x_239"></a>
<a name="index_x_240"></a>
<a name="index_x_241"></a>
<a name="index_x_242"></a>

      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ DELETE GENERATION [FACIL]MOD.TYP/STREAM=FOO
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example deletes the most recent generation of module MOD.TYP in 
facility FACIL from stream FOO. The previous generation then becomes 
the latest generation for that stream. The command also inserts the 
previous generation into the CMS class that corresponds to that stream. 
The deleted generation remains in the CMS library until it has been 
deleted from all streams that it belongs to.

<p>
The DELETE GENERATION command can only delete the latest generation in 
a stream; it cannot delete generations in the middle of a stream's 
generation chain. The purpose of the command is only to allow a recent 
bad replacement to be undone when that is necessary. Usually, however, 
developers should fix bad replacements by reserving the module, fixing 
it, and replacing it again.

<p>
The DELETE GENERATION command accepts a list of module names separated 
by commas, and you can use the asterisk (*) and percent sign (%) 
wildcard characters in the module names. The latest generations of 
those modules that match the wildcard patterns are deleted from the 
VDE library.

When a module has become obsolete, it can be marked as such in the

<a name="review_notify"><h1><font color=maroon>5.6 Specifying Reviewer and Notification Lists</font></h1></a>

<p>
VSC allows you to specify that certain developers should 
review or be notified of all changes to certain streams or modules. To 
specify that a certain developer should review all changes replaced 
into a certain stream, use the /REVIEWER qualifier with the MODIFY 
STREAM command. For example:
<a name="index_x_245"></a>
<a name="index_x_246"></a>
<a name="index_x_247"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>

    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ MODIFY STREAM BIRCH /REVIEWER=(SMITH,SNURD)
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example causes VSC to record that developers SMITH and 
SNURD should review all code changes replaced into stream BIRCH. 
VSC appends these developers to the module's existing 
reviewer list. Thereafter, the REPLACE command sends mail notification 
to SMITH and SNURD each time a developer replaces modules into stream 
BIRCH, and SMITH and SNURD are automatically recorded as reviewers for 
each such replacement. They are thus able to accept or reject these 
replacements with the ACCEPT and REJECT REPLACEMENT commands. The user 
replacing modules into the stream can also specify additional reviewers 
with the /REVIEWER qualifier to the REPLACE command, but he or she 
cannot omit the automatic reviewers for the stream.

<p>
To remove reviewers from a stream's reviewer list, you should use the 
/NOREVIEWER qualifier to the MODIFY STREAM command. For example:
<a name="index_x_248"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ MODIFY STREAM BIRCH /NOREVIEWER=SNURD
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example removes developer SNURD from the reviewer list for stream 
BIRCH. If you specify the /NOREVIEWER qualifier without user name 
parameters, VSC removes all reviewers for the stream.

<p>
VSC also allows you to specify that certain developers should 
review all changes to a given module. The /REVIEWER qualifier to the 
MODIFY MODULE command attaches reviewers to modules. For example:
<a name="index_x_249"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>

VSC„ MODIFY MODULE [BAD]BADMAIN.B32 /REVIEWER=BROWN

</font>

This example causes VSC to make developer BROWN an automatic 
reviewer for all replacements of module BADMAIN.B32 in facility BAD, 
regardless of stream. The /NOREVIEWER qualifier removes reviewers for a 
module.

<p>
In addition to specifying reviewers for streams and modules, you can 
specify that certain developers be notified of all replacements to a 
certain stream or of a certain module. VSC automatically 
notifies such developers of replacements for the stream or module, but 
does not add them to the reviewer lists. They can therefore not accept 
or reject the replacements. This example shows how to add user BROWN to 
the list of users to notify of all changes to stream BIRCH:
<a name="index_x_250"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ MODIFY STREAM BIRCH /NOTIFY=BROWN
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
Each parameter to the /NOTIFY qualifier can specify the user name of a 
OpenVMS developer already recorded in the VSC database, 
an OpenVMS mail address containing one or more node names (such 
as NODE::SMITH), or a logical name bound to a list of users to notify. 
If you specify a logical name, keep in mind that the logical name must 
be defined both when you specify it and when it is later used to send 
the notification messages. The logical should thus be a group or system 
logical name, or a mail forwarding alias in the OpenVMS 
VMSMAIL.DATA database.

<p>
Similarly, the following example shows how to specify that users SMITH 
and SNURD be notified of all changes to module [BAD]BADMAIN.B32:
<a name="index_x_251"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ MODIFY MODULE [BAD]BADMAIN.B32 /NOTIFY=(SMITH,SNURD)
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
To remove users from a stream's reviewer list, you should use the 
/NONOTIFY qualifier to the MODIFY STREAM command. For example:
<a name="index_x_252"></a>

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ MODIFY STREAM BIRCH /NONOTIFY=BROWN
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example removes developer BROWN from the notification list for 
stream BIRCH. If you specify the /NONOTIFY qualifier without 
parameters, VSC deletes the entire notification list. This 
qualifier is used the same way with the MODIFY MODULE command.

<p>
The MODIFY STREAM command requires the VSC privilege CRESTRM; 
MODIFY MODULE requires CREMOD.
