<h2>Format</h2>

<h3>POPULATE STREAM stream-name [, stream-name...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>stream-name</h3>
The name of a target stream to be populated with the module generations 
from another stream. You can populate more than one stream at a time by 
using wildcard characters in the stream name. The percent sign (%) in a 
name matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. Those streams whose names match the wildcard pattern are 
populated.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The POPULATE STREAM command populates a specified development stream 
(the target stream) with the latest generations from another stream 
(the source stream). The target stream is specified with a command 
parameter and the source stream is specified with the /FROM_STREAM 
qualifier. The latest generation of each module in the source stream is 
inserted into the target stream and any modules not represented in the 
source stream are removed from the target stream. After the command 
completes, the target stream contains exactly the same generations as 
the source stream.

<p>
Using the CREATE STREAM command to create a new stream with the same 
contents as a parent stream can be a time-consuming operation if the 
VDE library is large. Using the POPULATE STREAM command to 
update an existing stream whose contents are already close to the 
desired source stream is generally a much faster way to make a copy of 
a stream. This command allows you to create new base-level streams by 
reusing old base-level streams that are no longer needed, thus saving 
both time and database space.

<p>
The POPULATE STREAM command updates only the VDE database. 
It does not insert the updated generations into the CMS class for the 
stream, not even if the attribute to maintain the CMS class is set for 
the target stream. Neither does the command update the source 
directories for the stream. If such operations are needed, they must be 
done manually outside of VDE. Alternatively you can use the 
INSERT GENERATION command to insert generations into a stream while 
maintaining CMS classes and stream source directories. Because it does 
more work, the INSERT GENERATION command is generally much slower than 
the POPULATE STREAM command.

<p>
VDE populates the target streams in three phases. First, it 
determines what streams to populate using a read-only database 
transaction. Second, it determines the differences between the source 
and target streams for one target stream. This step is done using a 
read-only transaction. Third, VDE loops over the differences 
it found to update the generation membership of the target stream. This 
phase gives the target stream the same generation membership as the 
source stream had during the preceding read-only transaction. During 
this phase, VDE updates 20 modules at a time (by default), 
commits the transaction, and repeats the process until all modules are 
updated. VDE uses multiple short read-write transactions in 
order not to lock the database against other users more than a few 
seconds at a time. After the target stream is fully populated, 
VDE loops to populate the next stream until none remain.

<p>
You can only populate an open stream if the <strong>populate</strong> 
attribute is set for the stream. If this attribute is not set, you must 
set it with the MODIFY STREAM /POPULATE command before you can populate 
the stream. You can only populate a frozen stream if the 
<strong>populate</strong> attribute is set and you have the FROZEN 
privilege. You cannot populate a closed stream.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/COMMIT_LIMIT=number</h3>
Specifies the maximum number of modules VDE will update in, 
insert into, or remove from the target stream before committing the 
database transaction and starting a new transaction. The 
<strong>number</strong> parameter must be an integer value in the range 
from 1 to 1,000,000.

<p>
Specification of a smaller value reduces the interval during which the 
database is locked, allowing access to the database by other users. 
Specification of a larger value does reduce the overhead involved with 
recycling locks and repeated commits, but restricts the access to the 
database by other users.

<p>
By default, VDE commits and restarts a read-write 
transaction for every 20 modules.
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
target stream populated. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE 
to print a message for each stream asking whether you want that stream 
populated. If you answer YES (or Y), that stream is populated from the 
source stream. If you answer NO (or N), the stream is not populated. If 
you enter a stream name with a wildcard specification, VDE 
asks you to confirm the populate action for each stream whose name 
matches the wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to populate the specified streams without asking for 
confirmation.
<h3>/FROM_STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies the source stream from which the target stream is to be 
populated. VDE makes the generation membership of the target 
stream identical to that of this source stream. This qualifier is 
required; if you omit it, VDE prompts you for the name of 
the source stream.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each stream has been 
populated. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate the 
number of modules to update, insert, or remove to populate the target 
stream, that the stream has been populated from the source stream, and 
that the database transaction has successfully committed.

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>REJECT REPLACEMENT rep-name [, rep-name...] ["remark"] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>rep-name</h3>
The name of a queued replacement to be marked as rejected. You can 
reject more than one replacement at a time by using wildcard characters 
in the replacement name. The percent sign (%) in a name matches any 
single character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*) 
matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies. Those 
queued replacements whose names match the wildcard pattern are marked 
as rejected.
<h3>"remark"</h3>
Specifies a one-line remark for the replacement. Typically this remark 
summarizes why you reject the replacement. Specifying the 
<strong>remark</strong> parameter is equivalent to specifying the 
/REMARK qualifier after the REJECT REPLACEMENT keywords. This parameter 
or the /REMARK qualifier is required; if you do not specify either, 
VDE prompts you for a remark string.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The REJECT REPLACEMENT command updates the VDE database to 
record that
<a name="index_x_508"></a>
<a name="index_x_509"></a>
you have reviewed the code changes in a specified queued replacement 
and that you judge those changes not acceptable for replacement into 
the VDE library. You must be a reviewer for a replacement in 
order to mark it as rejected.

<p>
The REJECT REPLACEMENT command allows you to attach a comment file to 
the queued replacement. The comment file typically explains why you 
reject the replacement. If you have already created such a file, use 
the /INPUT qualifier to copy it to the replacement's staging area. If 
you omit the /INPUT qualifier, VDE asks you whether you want 
to edit a comment file for the replacement. If you respond YES (the 
default answer), VDE invokes your preferred editor to create 
the comment file. If you specify both the /INPUT and the /EDIT 
qualifier, VDE copies the input file to the replacement's 
staging area and then invokes your editor to further modify that file. 
If you have already created a comment file for the replacement with an 
earlier ACCEPT or REJECT command, VDE lets you edit that 
file again. This capability is useful if you change your mind or want 
to add more information.

<p>
If you wish to mark a replacement as acceptable, use the ACCEPT 
REPLACEMENT command. If you wish to see the review status of a queued 
replacement, use the SHOW REPLACEMENT command.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
replacement rejected. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to 
print a message for each replacement asking whether you want to reject 
that replacement. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement is marked 
as rejected. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement status is not 
changed. If you enter a replacement name with a wildcard specification, 
VDE asks you to confirm the rejection of each replacement 
whose name matches the wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier 
causes VDE to mark the specified replacements as rejected 
without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/EDIT</h3>
Specifies that VDE should invoke your preferred editor so 
that you can edit your comment file for each queued replacement. If 
such a comment file already exists (due to a previous ACCEPT or REJECT 
REPLACEMENT command for the same replacement) or if you specify an 
input file with the /INPUT qualifier, the editor modifies that file. 
Otherwise, the editor creates a new file in the replacement's staging 
directory. Its file name is your OpenVMS username and its file 
extension is VDE$COMMENT. The comment file typically contains comments 
for the
<a name="index_x_510"></a>
author of the replacement and the other reviewers.

<p>
This qualifier is ignored if you are running in batch mode.
<h3>/INPUT=file-spec</h3>
Specifies a comment file for the queued replacement. VDE 
reads the text file given by the <strong>file-spec</strong> parameter 
and writes its contents into a new file in the replacement's staging 
directory. The file name of the new file is your OpenVMS 
username and its file extension is VDE$COMMENT. The comment file 
typically contains remarks to the
<a name="index_x_511"></a>
author of the replacement or information for the other reviewers.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement has 
been marked as rejected. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be 
printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages 
indicate that the replacement has been rejected and that the database 
transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a one-line remark for the replacement. Typically this remark 
summarizes why you reject the replacement. For longer comments, you may 
create a comment file with the /INPUT or /EDIT qualifier. The /REMARK 
qualifier (or the remark parameter at the end of the command) is 
required; if you do not specify it, VDE prompts you for a 
remark string.
<a name="index_x_512"></a>
<h3>/USERNAME=username</h3>
Specifies that the replacement be marked as rejected on behalf of 
another user. The <strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the 
OpenVMS username of the other user. That user must be a reviewer 
for the specified replacement. You must have the USERNAME privilege to
<a name="index_x_513"></a>
use this qualifier.

</blockquote>

<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
The name of a source module whose latest generation is to be removed 
from the specified development stream. The module name consists of an 
optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module name, and 
an optional type name preceded by a period, such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR. If 
no facility name is specified, the default facility is assumed. If no 
type name is specified, the latest generations of all source modules of 
the specified module name in the given facility are removed.

<p>
You can remove more than one module from the stream by using wildcard 
characters in any of the three components of the module name. The 
percent sign (%) in a name matches any single character in the position 
it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the 
position it occupies. VDE removes each module whose name 
matches the wildcard pattern from the stream.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The REMOVE GENERATION command removes a specified module from a 
specified development stream so that the module no longer has a latest 
generation in that stream. The result is that the module no longer 
&quot;belongs&quot; to that stream and can no longer be fetched, 
reserved, or built in the stream.

<p>
The removed generation remains in the VDE database and the 
VDE library, and it can still be the latest generation of 
the module for some other stream. The REMOVE GENERATION command thus 
breaks the association between the module generation and the specified 
stream but does not delete the generation.

<p>
If the specified module is currently reserved in the specified stream, 
VDE terminates that reservation since it is based on a 
module generation that no longer is the latest generation for the 
stream. VDE sends a mail message to notify the owner of the 
reservation that the reservation is lost.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each

name of the generation and asking whether you want to remove the 
generation. If you answer YES (or Y), the generation is removed. If you 
answer NO (or N), the generation is not removed. The /NOCONFIRM 
qualifier causes VDE to remove each generation without 
asking for confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after generations are removed 
from streams. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
/NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the generations have 
been removed from the specified development stream and that the 
database transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>

<h3>REPLACE mod-name [, mod-name...] ["remark"] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>mod-name</h3>
Specifies a reserved source module to be replaced into the library. The 
module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square 
brackets, a module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period 
(such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility name is omitted, the module 
is assumed to belong to the default facility. If the type name is 
omitted, all source modules with the specified module name in the given 
facility are replaced.

<p>
You can replace more than one module by using wildcard characters in 
any of the three components of the module name. The percent sign (%) in 
a name matches any single character in the position it occupies and the 
asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in the position it 
occupies. VDE replaces the source modules whose names match 
the wildcard pattern.

<p>
You can also replace multiple modules by specifying the name of a 
source group instead of a module name. Source groups are created with 
the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group name, each module that 
is a member of the group is replaced.

<p>
If you use the /SESSION qualifier, those reservations that are members 
of the specified reservation session are replaced. In this case, you 
must omit the <strong>mod-name</strong> parameters from the command.
<h3>"remark"</h3>
Specifies a remark string for the replacement. VDE stores 
this remark string with each module generation that the REPLACE command 
creates. Specifying the <strong>remark</strong> parameter is equivalent 
to specifying the /REMARK qualifier after the REPLACE keyword.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
For each module you have specified, the REPLACE command creates a new 
generation of the module by transferring a file from your default 
directory to the current VDE library, possibly by way of an 
intermediate staging area.
<a name="index_x_521"></a>
This new generation becomes the most recent generation of the source 
module in the default development stream (or the stream specified with 
the /STREAM qualifier) and receives a new generation number. The new 
generation number is formed by adding 1 to the number of the previous 
generation. After creating the new module generation, the REPLACE 
command terminates the reservation of that module unless you specify 
the /RESERVE qualifier.

<p>
After the reserved module is replaced in the VDE library, 
VDE may delete the file used to create the module (as well 
as any earlier versions of the file in the same directory). The file is 
only deleted if the library administrator has defined a NOKEEP script 
for your VDE library and the specified development stream. 
If you specify either the /KEEP or the /RESERVE qualifier, 
VDE does not delete the file even if a NOKEEP script is 
defined.

<p>
The file in your default directory normally has the same name as the 
module in the library. However, you can direct VDE to 
replace a file with a different name or a file in another directory 
than your default directory by specifying the /INPUT qualifier.

<p>
VDE stores the following information about the file that 
creates the new generation: the creation date and time, the revision 
date and time, the record format, and other record attributes. When you 
fetch or reserve a generation of a module from a VDE 
library, the file that is placed in your directory has the same 
creation and revision times, record format, and record attributes as 
the file that was used to create the generation that you are fetching 
or reserving.

<p>
If you specify the /QUEUE qualifier or one of the streams that you are 
replacing the module into has the queued-replacement attribute, then 
the REPLACE command does not actually perform the replacement of your 
module. Instead it copies your files to a &quot;staging area&quot; on 
disk and queues the replacement in the VDE database. An 
authorized user must then enter a subsequent PERFORM REPLACEMENT 
command in order to actually perform the replacement. In this case, it 
is the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command the creates the new module 
generation and terminates the module reservation.

<p>
If you have more than one concurrent reservation of a module, you must 
specify the exact reservation to be replaced using the /IDENTIFICATION 
qualifier. Use the SHOW RESERVATION command to determine the 
identification of each reservation.

<p>
If you or another user has a concurrent reservation for the module 
being replaced and that reservation covers at least one stream affected 
by your replacement, then the REPLACE command terminates that 
reservation. VDE sends a mail message to notify the owner of 
that reservation that the reservation is lost.
<a name="index_x_522"></a>

<p>
To replace another user's reservation, you must have the USERNAME 
privilege and use the /USERNAME qualifier to specify OpenVMS 
username of that user.
<a name="index_x_523"></a>
<p>
<a name="vde_cmd_replace_statistics"><strong>Source Tracking and Statistics Collection</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
VDE can collect replacement statistics and associated 
change-related information, including the reason for the change, the 
project the change is associated with, and can also be asked to add an 
entry to the source code tracking (SCT) DEC Notes conference 
describing the change.
<a name="index_x_524"></a>
<a name="index_x_525"></a>

<p>
Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a library basis. If 
collection is enabled and the information is not provided via REPLACE 
qualifiers, VDE will prompt the user for the information 
during the replacement operation.

<p>
For further information, see the /FOLD, /OTHER, and /SCT qualifiers, as 
well as the /PROJECT qualifier.
<p>
<a name="vde_cmd_replace_chngprop"><strong>Change Propagation to other Streams</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
Replacing a module makes the new module generation the latest 
generation in the default development stream or the stream specified 
with the /STREAM qualifier. That generation is thus the generation you 
get by default in a subsequent FETCH or RESERVE command, and is the 
generation that is compiled when you build your system in that stream.

<p>
If the specified stream has successors, the REPLACE command propagates 
the new module generation to all successor streams. For example, if 
stream V2 is a successor of stream V1, then any module that is replaced 
into stream V1 is also replaced in stream V2 automatically. If stream 
V2 has additional successors (such as stream V3), the new module 
generation is propagated to those streams, and so on recursively.

<p>
Propagation works as follows. If the latest generations of the module 
for the original stream and the successor stream are the same, then the 
new module generation created by the REPLACE command becomes the latest 
generation for both streams. Both streams are thus equally up-to-date 
with respect to the changes made to that module. However, if the latest 
generations of the module differ for the two streams, which means that 
the module has diverged between those two streams, VDE does 
not propagate the new module generation to the successor stream. 
Instead, it creates a &quot;fold&quot; record in the database to remind 
the developer that the change made to the module for the first stream 
must be manually &quot;folded&quot; into the successor stream. 
Outstanding folds can be displayed with the SHOW FOLD command and a 
fold record is deleted with the CANCEL FOLD command.
<p>
<a name="vde_cmd_replace_histnote"><strong>Replacing a Module with History or Notes  Information</strong></a>
<br>

<p>
If you reserve a generation of a module with an embedded history and 
then replace it, the REPLACE command ignores the history; that is, 
VDE does not copy the history into your VDE 
library. If you add text to the file in or above the history (relative 
to #B), or in or below the history (relative to #H), the REPLACE 
command issues an error message and the command is not executed.

<p>
If you reserve a file with embedded notes and then replace it, the 
REPLACE command does not copy the notes to the VDE library. 
If, while editing the file, you insert text that looks like an embedded 
note, that text is deleted when the file is replaced.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
module replaced. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print 
a message for each specified module asking whether you want to replace 
that module into the library. If you answer YES (or Y), it is replaced. 
If you answer NO (or N), it is not replaced. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier 
causes VDE to replace each specified module without asking 
for confirmation.
<h3>/DEFECTS_CORRECTED=error-count</h3>
<h3>/NODEFECTS_CORRECTED</h3>
Specifies the number of defects corrected by this replacement: these 
defects could due to problems with the specification, design, logic, 
implementation and/or testing. The <strong>error-count</strong> 
parameter is a value indicating the number of defects corrected.

<p>
/NODEFECTS_CORRECTED sets the number of defects corrected to zero.

<p>
This qualifier is part of the statistics collection component of 
VDE. Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a 
library basis, using the MODIFY LIBRARY/STATISTICS command. If 
statistics collection is disabled, these qualifiers are ignored and 
have no adverse effects. This command is <em>required</em> when certain 
keywords are specified on the /REASONS qualifier; see <a href="vde_manual_023.html#tbl_reasons">Table 3-2</a> 
for further information.

<a name="index_x_527"></a>
<a name="index_x_528"></a>

<p>
If statistics collection is enabled on the current library and you do 
not specify the /REASONS qualifier, you will be prompted for the 
information.
<h3>/FOLD[=fold-ident]</h3>
Specifies that a fold record be cancelled when this replacement is 
performed. The <strong>fold-ident</strong> parameter gives the fold 
identifier of a fold record for the module being replaced and for the 
stream in which the replacement takes place. When VDE 
performs the replacement, it will cancel this fold record from the 
VDE database. You can omit the <strong>fold-ident</strong> 
parameter if there is only one fold record for the specified module and 
stream. You should use the /FOLD qualifier if the current replacement 
is done to satisfy an existing fold record in the database.
