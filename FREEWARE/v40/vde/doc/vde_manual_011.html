<p>
Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.
<a name="index_x_287"></a>
<h3>/REPLACEMENT=keyword</h3>
Controls whether the REPLACE command permits immediate replacements 
into the new stream or requires queued replacements. If the
<a name="index_x_288"></a>
<strong>keyword</strong> parameter is IMMEDIATE, the REPLACE command 
will immediately replace modules into the stream by default. If the 
parameter is QUEUE, the REPLACE command will always queue replacements 
for the stream so that modules are not replaced into the stream until a 
privileged user enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT command. If you omit this 
qualifier, VDE permits immediate replacements into the new 
stream. (See the descriptions of the /IMMEDIATE and /QUEUE qualifiers 
to the REPLACE command for more information.)
<h3>/REVIEWER=(username [,username...])</h3>
<a name="index_x_289"></a>
Specifies reviewers for all changes replaced into the new stream. Each 
<strong>username</strong> parameter specifies the OpenVMS 
username of a user who should review all changes to the specified 
stream. The user must already be recorded in the VDE 
database. When a module is replaced into the stream, VDE 
notifies the user of the replacement by mail message. If the 
replacement is queued, the user should then
<a name="index_x_290"></a>
review the queued replacement before it is performed. If the 
replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the user of the new 
module generation that was created, and the user may then inspect that 
generation.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter, you may 
omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/STEP_DELAY=time-interval</h3>
Specifies the default step-delay time interval used by build jobs for 
the new stream. See the description of the BUILD command for
<a name="index_x_291"></a>
a detailed description of this qualifier.
<h3>/SUCCESSOR=(succ-name [, succ-name...])</h3>
<h3>/NOSUCCESSOR (default)</h3>
The /SUCCESSOR qualifier specifies successors to the stream being 
created. A successor to a stream is another stream to which source 
changes are propagated by the REPLACE command. Each 
<strong>succ-name</strong> parameter specifies the name of a stream 
that should be a successor to the new stream given by the 
<strong>stream-name</strong> parameter.

<p>
The /NOSUCCESSOR qualifier specifies that the new stream does not have 
any successors.

<p>
If both the /SUCCESSOR and /NOSUCCESSOR qualifiers are omitted, the new 
stream has no successors unless you specify the /MAIN qualifier. See 
the description of the /MAIN qualifier for the special rules that apply 
in this case.
<h3>/TIMEOUT=time-interval</h3>
Specifies the default timeout interval used by build jobs for the new 
stream. See the description of the BUILD command for a detailed 
description of this qualifier.

</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The CREATE USER command creates the database record for a new user of 
the current VDE library.

<p>
Each user of a VDE library must have a record in the 
database of that library. This record contains the user's 
OpenVMS username, full name string, authorized and default 
privileges, and remark string. After the record has been created, the 
user has access to the VDE library as constrained by the 
specified privileges. A user who does not have a record in a given 
VDE database cannot use the VDE Utility to gain 
access to the database or the corresponding library.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies the new user's authorized privileges, which are the 
privileges the user is allowed to set with the VDE command 
SET PRIVILEGE. Each parameter to this qualifier names a single 
privilege. If only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be 
omitted. If this qualifier is not specified, VDE assigns the 
standard authorized privileges of the library to the new user.

<p>
For a list of privileges, see <a href="vde_manual_028.html#tbl_privileges">Table 3-5</a> in <a href="vde_manual_028.html#vde_cmd_set_priv">SET PRIVILEGES</a>.
<h3>/DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies the new user's default privileges, which are the privileges 
enabled each time the user starts a new VDE session. Each 
parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. Each privilege 
specified becomes an authorized privilege as well as a default 
privilege, even if it has not been listed with the /AUTH_PRIVILEGES 
qualifier. If only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be 
omitted. If the /DEF_PRIVILEGES qualifier is not specified, 
VDE assigns the standard default privileges of the library 
to the new user.

<p>
For a list of privileges, see <a href="vde_manual_028.html#tbl_privileges">Table 3-5</a> in <a href="vde_manual_028.html#vde_cmd_set_priv">SET PRIVILEGES</a>.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after users have been added 
to the database. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed 
and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that users have been 
added and that the database transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/NAME="string"</h3>
Specifies the full name of the new user. The quoted name string, which 
can be up to 40 characters long, should contain the full name (first 
name, middle initials, and last name) of the new user.

<p>
This qualifier is required. You can specify an empty name string but 
this is not recommended. If you do not specify the /NAME qualifier, 
VDE prompts you for a name string.
<a name="index_x_294"></a>
<h3>/NOTIFY=(username [,username...])</h3>
<a name="index_x_295"></a>
Specifies users to notify of all code changes replaced into the 
VDE library by the new user. Each <strong>username</strong> 
parameter specifies the OpenVMS username or mail address of a 
user who should be notified by mail message each time the new user 
created by this command replaces a module into the VDE 
library.

<p>
Each <strong>username</strong> parameter can specify the username of a 
user already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS 
mail address with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail 
forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of users to 
notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind that the logical 
name must be defined when it is later used to send notification 
messages. It should thus be a group or system logical name or a logical 
name that is in some other way defined for all users of the 
VDE library.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter, you may 
omit the surrounding parentheses.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new user. The quoted 
remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any 
explanatory remark about the new user that you want stored in the 
VDE database. Typically the remark describes the user's 
affiliation or function within the organization.

<p>
This qualifier is required although you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.
<a name="index_x_296"></a>
<h3>/REVIEWER=(username [,username...])</h3>
<a name="index_x_297"></a>
Specifies reviewers for all code changes replaced into the 
VDE library by the new user. Each <strong>username</strong> 
parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of a user who should 
review all changes created by the new user. The reviewer must already 
be recorded in the VDE database. When the new user created 
by this command replaces a module into the VDE library, 
VDE notifies the reviewer of the change by mail message. If 
the replacement is queued, the reviewer should then review the queued 
replacement before it is performed. If the replacement is immediate, 
VDE notifies the reviewer of the new module generation that 
was created, and he or she may then inspect that generation. This 
qualifier can be used to set up &quot;buddy systems&quot; where two 
users always review each other's code.

<p>
If you specify only one <strong>username</strong> parameter, you may 
omit the surrounding parentheses.

<h2>Format</h2>

<h3>DEFINE/COMMAND symbol-name="command-string" </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>symbol-name</h3>
Specifies the symbol name that you want associated with a list of 
VDE commands. The symbol can be up to 255 characters long 
and can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. It 
cannot start with a digit. If <em>symbol-name</em> is already defined, 
the new definition replaces the old definition.
<h3>command-string</h3>
Specifies the string of VDE commands to associate with the 
symbol name. The command string must be enclosed in quotation marks and 
consists of the first part of a VDE command, a whole 
command, or a list of commands separated by semicolons.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DEFINE/COMMAND command associates a symbol name with a 
VDE command string. The command string consists of zero or 
more VDE commands separated by semicolons and must end with 
a partial or full VDE command.

<p>
When the symbol name appears at the beginning of a VDE 
command, the symbol name is replaced by its associated command string. 
The resulting string is then parsed and executed as a normal command 
line by VDE. DEFINE/COMMAND thus gives you the same command 
abbreviation capability as the symbol assignment statement (symbol-name 
:= command-string) in DCL. Symbol substitution only happens once at the 
beginning of each command. A symbol's associated command string can 
therefore not begin with another command symbol.

<p>
To display the current symbol definitions created by DEFINE/COMMAND, 
use the SHOW SYMBOL command.

<h3>string</h3>
Specifies the string that is entered when you press the defined key. 
<strong>String</strong> can be any VDE command, such as SHOW 
DEFAULTS or SET CONTEXT. To preserve spaces and lowercase characters, 
enclose the string in quotation marks.

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DEFINE/KEY command, on certain terminals, enables you to assign 
definitions to keys other than those on the main keyboard. The command 
can be used on a variety of terminals including the VT340, VT510 and 
the DECterm terminal emulator.

<p>
The string parameter to the DEFINE/KEY command can contain different 
types of information and usually consists of an entire VDE 
command. For example, you can assign the SHOW DEFAULTS command to KP0. 
Then, when you press zero on the keypad, VDE displays your 
current default settings. Other definitions can consist of text strings 
to be appended to command lines. When you define a key to insert a text 
string, use the /NOTERMINATE qualifier so you can continue typing more 
data after the string has been inserted.

<p>
In most instances you will want to use the echo feature. The /ECHO 
qualifier displays the key definition on the screen each time you press 
the key. The default setting is /ECHO.

<p>
You can create as many definitions for a key as you want as long as you 
specify a new context for each definition. This new context is called a 
<em>state</em>. To create additional key definitions you must use two 
steps. First, using the /SET_STATE qualifier, you must define a key 
that establishes a state for the definition you want to create. Then 
you must create the new definition for your key and specify its state 
using the /IF_STATE qualifier.

<p>
State names can include letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscores. 
Create state names that are easy to remember and type and that remind 
you of the types of definitions you created. For example, you can 
create a state called SETSHOW. The key definitions for this state might 
refer to various VDE SET and SHOW commands.

<p>
Like various other utilities on OpenVMS, VDE supplies 
three built-in states called DEFAULT, GOLD, and BLUE. You can assign 
different definitions to keys used in combination with the GOLD and 
BLUE keys by using the /IF_STATE qualifier.

<p>
By convention, the GOLD state is selected by pressing the PF1 key, and 
the BLUE state is seected by pressing the PF4 key.

<p>
The SET KEY command changes the keypad state. Use the SHOW KEY command 
to display key definitions and states.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ECHO (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOECHO</h3>
Specifies whether the command line is displayed on your screen after 
you press the defined key. You cannot define a key specifying both 
/NOECHO and /NOTERMINATE.
<h3>/IF_STATE=(state-name,...)</h3>
<h3>/NOIF_STATE (default)</h3>
Specifies a list of states, any one of which must be set to enable the 
specified key definition. (By including several state names, you can 
define a key to have the same function in all the specified states.) If 
you use the /NOIF_STATE qualifier or omit the /IF_STATE qualifier, the 
current state at the time you define the key must be set when you use 
the key definition. The state name can include letters, digits, dollar 
signs, and underscores. States are established with the /SET_STATE 
qualifier on another key definition or with the SET KEY command. If you 
specify only one state name, you can omit the parentheses.
<h3>/LOCK_STATE</h3>
<h3>/NOLOCK_STATE (default)</h3>
Specifies that the state set by the /SET_STATE qualifier remain in 
effect until explicitly changed. (By default, the /SET_STATE qualifier 
is in effect only for the next definable key you press or the next 
read-terminating character that you type.) Can only be specified with 
the /SET_STATE qualifier.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Specifies whether a log message is displayed after a key is defined. 
The message indicates a key definition has been created successfully. 
The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be displayed and the /NOLOG 
qualifier suppresses them.
<h3>/SET_STATE=state</h3>
<h3>/NOSET_STATE (default)</h3>
Causes the specified state to be set when the key is pressed. (By 
default, the current locked state is reset when the key is pressed.) A 
state name can include letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscores. 
If you omit or negate this qualifier, the current state remains 
unchanged. You cannot define a key specifying both /SET_STATE and 
/TERMINATE.
<h3>/TERMINATE</h3>
<h3>/NOTERMINATE (default)</h3>
Determines whether the specified command string executes when you press 
the key. When you use /NOTERMINATE, you must press RETURN to execute 
the command string. When you use /TERMINATE, VDE executes 
the command string immediately when you press the key. You cannot 
define a key specifying both /SET_STATE and /TERMINATE.

This example shows how to create two definitions for the KP7 key using 
the /SET_STATE and /IF_STATE qualifiers. The first command defines KP7 
as the SHOW MODULE command and executes the command when the key is 
pressed. This is the default key definition for KP7. The second command 
establishes a new state for the key: when you press PF3, the state is 
set to TEXAS. The third command creates a new definition for KP7: when 
you press KP7, VDE executes the SHOW FACILITY command if the 
state has been set to TEXAS. You can thus execute the SHOW MODULE 
command by pressing KP7 by itself, and you can execute the SHOW 
FACILITY command by pressing the PF3 key followed by the KP7 key.
