<a name="db_defrag"><h1><font color=maroon>7.7 Defragmenting the CMS Library</font></h1></a>

<p>
This section contains a simple set of procedures used to defragment the 
CMS portion of the VDE database using the OpenVMS 
BACKUP utility, using the steps appropriate for a VDE 
database located on a shadow set.
<a name="index_x_581"></a>
<a name="index_x_582"></a>

<p>
The following example assumes the VDE database is at 
ddcu:[vde]VDE$DATABASE.RDB, and the CMS libraries are located on the 
$11$DSA1: shadow set device, a shadow set comprised of $11$DUA10: and 
$11$DUA11:. $11$DUA100: is assumed to be a scratch disk equivilent to 
$11$DUA10: and $11$DUA11:.

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
$ RMU/CLOSE/CLUSTER/ABORT=DELPRC ddcu:[vde]VDE$DATABASE.RDB 
$ DISMOUNT/CLUSTER $11$DSA1: 
$ MOUNT/OVER=(SHADOW,IDENT)/NOWRITE $11$DUA10: 
$ MOUNT/OVER=(SHADOW,IDENT)/NOWRITE $11$DUA11: 
$ MOUNT/FOREIGN $11$DUA100: 
$ BACKUP/IMAGE $11$DUA10: $11$DUA100:/VERIFY/INITIALIZE 
$ DISMOUNT/NOUNLOAD $11$DUA10:

$ MOUNT $11$DSA1:/SHADOW=($11$DUA10:,$11$DUA11:) - 
_$ VMSCMSMASTER DISK$VMSCMSMASTER 
</pre>
</font>
</table>

The above steps quickly bring the defragmented database shadow set 
volumes into synchronization. While the shadow set copy operation could 
also be used to resynchronize the defragmented volume, shadowing merge 
performance is not tuned for this particular (infrequent) situation; it 
is far slower than the double BACKUP/PHYSICAL shown above.

<a name="db_reloc"><h1><font color=maroon>7.8 Relocating Rdb Components</font></h1></a>

<p>
It is normally best to use the Rdb RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESORE 
commands to relocate a database. As this is not always possible, the 
following commands are used to close and then to relocate various 
individual Rdb component files associated with the 
VDE Rdb database:

As part of the process described in <a href="vde_guide_015.html#db_reloc">Section 7.8</a>, you may sometimes 
need to recreate the snapshot file and the after-image journal (AIJ) 
file, via the following commands:

<p>
The AIJTERMINATE error
<a name="index_x_600"></a>
 can arise when the journal file is inaccessable, or when it is 
 corrupted. Typically, an AIJTERMINATE error is generated whenever any 
 operation attempts to access a database after a journal file problem 
 has been detected by Rdb.

<a name="architectures"><h1>Chapter 9<br>Architecture Support</h1></a>
</font>

<p>
This chapter provides an overview and a general description of how to 
use the multiple-architecture support present within VDE

<a name="arch_roots"><h1><font color=maroon>9.1 Architectures in the Source Code Library Roots</font></h1></a>

<p>
VDE architecture support adds the 
<strong>arch-variant</strong>, the architecture variant. One
<a name="index_x_660"></a>
<a name="index_x_661"></a>
<a name="index_x_662"></a>
processor-independent root is present---&quot;VMS&quot; -- and zero or 
more processor-dependent variants can be created. <em>Previous versions 
of VDE included implicit support for arch-variants, and all 
such versions use &quot;VMS&quot; as the name of the processor 
architecture independent arch-variant.</em>

<p>
As a specific example of adding arch-variants, one can support both 
OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX development in parallel if the 
OpenVMS source code libraries are logically reorganized as 
follows:

<ul>
  <li>The VMS arch-variant directory contains the facility subdirectories 
  for all architecture independent modules in OpenVMS. There is a 
  CMS library within the
<a name="index_x_663"></a>
VMS arch-variant for each facility that contains at least one 
architecture-independent module.
  <li>Subdirectories within the VAX arch-variant directory contain CMS 
  libraries for all facilities that contain at least one module specific 
  to the VAX architecture. Likewise, subdirectories within the Alpha 
  arch-variant directory contain CMS libraries for all facilities that 
  contain at least one module specific to the Alpha architecture.
  <li>If a module is architecture-independent, it is only represented in 
  a CMS library within the VMS arch-variant. When a module becomes 
  architecture-specific, it is turned into two modules so that a CMS 
  element is created for it within both the VAX and the Alpha 
  arch-variants. The CMS element within the VMS arch-variant remains 
  since it contains the module's contents for all old development 
  streams. In the VMS arch-variant, the stream (CMS class) in which the 
  module was made architecture-specific is bound to a generation whose 
  text says that the module is now architecture-specific. In the the VAX 
  and Alpha arch-variants, this stream is bound to the initial 
  generations of the new architecture-specific modules in those 
  arch-variants. These new generations have the same contents as the 
  latest generation in the VMS arch-variants before the module was made 
  architecture-specific. Thereafter, the three modules (the VMS, VAX, and 
  Alpha modules, all with the same module name) evolve separately as 
  separate CMS elements.
  <li>If a new module is specific to a single architecture, that module 
  is only represented in a CMS library within the VAX or the Alpha 
  arch-variant, whichever architecture applies. New modules specific to 
  OpenVMS Alpha, for example, will only appear within the Alpha 
  arch-variant.
</ul>

<p>
The structure described here is not a proposed structure, but the 
actual structure as it is presently implemented.

<a name="arch_commands"><h1><font color=maroon>9.2 Commands to Specify Multiple Architectures</font></h1></a>

<p>
To support multiple architectures within a source code library 
structure, the VDE source control system must represent the 
concept of an architecture in its module-name syntax and in its 
database. The module-name syntax we will use in this specification is 
ARCH:[FAC]MOD.TYP. Here ARCH is the architecture of the module: VMS for 
architecture-independent modules and VAX or Alpha for 
architecture-specific modules. The remaining fields ([FAC]MOD.TYP) have 
the normal meanings explained earlier in this document. The 
architecture field is optional; if it is omitted, a user-settable 
default architecture is supplied.

<p>
To set up architecture information in the source control database, the 
VDE utility supports the following command:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE ARCHITECTURE VAX
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This command creates an architecture entry in the database and assigns 
the architecture a name and a remark string. This command is only used 
when the database is initially set up (and whenever we invent 
additional architectures in the future). In addition, the VDE utility 
supports a MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command (to change the remark string), a 
DELETE ARCHITECTURE command (to correct mistakes in defining 
architectures), and a SHOW ARCHITECTURE command. The SHOW ARCHITECTURE 
command displays information about all defined architectures. The SHOW 
DEFAULTS command shows the current default architecture, along with 
other defaults.
<a name="index_x_664"></a>
<a name="index_x_665"></a>
<a name="index_x_666"></a>
<a name="index_x_667"></a>

<p>
A command that is of more interest to most developers is the command 
that establishes a default architecture for the current VSC 
or VDE session:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VSC„ SET ARCHITECTURE Alpha
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_668"></a>

<p>
This example specifies that Alpha is the default architecture when the 
architecture name is omitted from module names. This command also 
resets the default facility to be the facility in the new architecture 
that has the same name as the current default facility. If there is no 
such facility, the default facility setting is cleared so that the 
default facility becomes undefined.

<a name="arch_dependencies"><h1><font color=maroon>9.3 Creating Architecture-Specific Modules</font></h1></a>

<p>
The VSC and VDE utilities provide a qualifier to 
the MODIFY MODULE command that makes a module architecture-specific by 
creating one or more single-architecture modules from an existing 
architecture-independent module. This is the command syntax:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ MODIFY MODULE/ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFIC VMS:[FACIL]FOO.BAR
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
This command makes module VMS:[FACIL]FOO.BAR architecture-specific by 
creating the two modules VAX:[FACIL]FOO.BAR and Alpha:[FACIL]FOO.BAR. 
The command fetches out the latest generation of the module for the 
default development stream and makes that the initial generation for 
the two new modules. It also fetches out the latest generations of any 
successor development streams (if different) and inserts those into the 
new modules. The default stream and its successors are thus all defined 
for the two new architecture-specific modules. In addition, this 
command creates a new generation of the architecture-independent module 
in the VMS arch-variant. This generation is bound to the default stream 
and its successors and contains fixed text that indicates that the 
module is now architecture-specific. The database record for this 
generation contains a flag indicating that the module is obsolete 
because it was made architecture-specific; hence the source control 
system can determine that the module is obsolete without actually 
examining the text of the module.

<p>
The /ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFIC qualifier can optionally take an 
architecture name as a parameter. If this parameter is specified, the 
MODIFY MODULE command creates a new module for that one architecture 
only, and not for other architectures.
<a name="index_x_669"></a>

<p>
To make an architecture-specific module architecture-independent again, 
a developer must first insert the appropriate generations of the module 
into the architecture-independent module (such as VMS:[FACIL]FOO.BAR). 
This is done with a combination of FETCH, RESERVE, REPLACE, and INSERT 
GENERATION commands, and it must be done for all active streams. 
Merging two architecture-specific versions of a module into one 
architecture-independent version is thus largely a manual operation. 
Thereafter, the module must be marked as obsolete for each such stream 
in the two single-architecture modules (for example, VAX:[FACIL]FOO.BAR 
and Alpha:[FACIL]FOO.BAR).

<p>
To create a new module which is specific to a single architecture, a 
user enters the CREATE MODULE command, specifying the architecture:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ CREATE MODULE Alpha:[FACIL]FOO.BAR
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<a name="index_x_670"></a>

<p>
This example creates a module for the Alpha architecture only. If the 
module should be architecture-independent, the architecture must be 
specified as VMS, explicitly or by default.

<a name="arch_op_cmds"><h1><font color=maroon>9.4 Operation of Existing Commands</font></h1></a>

<p>
The presence of multiple architectures affects the look-up rules for 
all commands that accept module names as parameters. Commands that 
refer directly to modules behave a bit differently from commands that 
refer to module generations.

<p>
Commands that refer directly to modules, such as the CREATE, MODIFY, 
DELETE, and SHOW MODULE commands, only create or reference the module 
in the architecture the user specified. If the architecture is not 
specified explicitly on the module name, the command uses the default 
architecture established by the most recent SET ARCHITECTURE command. 
On any command where the module name may be wildcarded, the 
architecture part may also be wildcarded. The following command thus 
shows three modules if the module has forms that are both dependent and 
independent of architecture:

<p>
Commands that refer to module generations need to look up a generation 
of a module in a given development stream. Usually the latest 
generation of the module in the given stream is requested. Whether such 
a generation exists depends on the module's architecture as well as the 
stream.

<p>
Given an architecture (specified explicitly or by default), a module, 
and a development stream, the FETCH or RESERVE command looks up the the 
module with the specified name in the specified architecture. If such a 
module is found, the command looks up the latest generation of the 
module in the requested development stream. If such a generation is 
found and is not marked as obsolete because the module was made 
architecture-specific, that is the generation that is fetched or 
reserved. Otherwise, the command prints a message saying that the 
module does not exist, is not defined in the given stream, or is 
obsolete for the given stream. If the module was made 
architecture-specific, the command prints the names of the 
architectures in which the module is defined. It is then up to the user 
to fetch or reserve the corresponding module for each desired 
architecture.
<a name="index_x_671"></a>
<a name="index_x_672"></a>

<p>
A developer who primarily works on OpenVMS Alpha code may thus set his 
or her default architecture to Alpha. He or she will get the instance 
of the module specific to OpenVMS Alpha, if there is one, else a a 
message indicating the module exists for the architecture VMS will be 
displayed. A developer whose work is not focused on a specific 
architecture could instead set his or her default architecture to VMS. 
When fetching or reserving a module, such a developer will either get 
the architecture-independent instance of the module or a message saying 
that the module is defined for architecture VAX or Alpha, whichever 
applies, or for both.

<p>
The REPLACE command does not look up generations in the same sense. It 
looks up a reservation for a specified module and development stream on 
the assumption that the module belongs to the architecture that the 
user specifies, either explicitly or by default. If there is no such 
reservation, the command prints an error message. The UNRESERVE command 
uses the same procedure.
<a name="index_x_673"></a>

<p>
The SHOW and MODIFY GENERATION commands only look up generations that 
belong to the module in the architecture the user specifies (explicitly 
or by default). Generations that have been made architecture-specific 
are marked as such in the SHOW GENERATION output. When the SHOW 
GENERATION command displays the list of generations that gave rise to 
the latest generation of the module in a specified stream, it also 
shows at what generation the module was converted from being 
architecture-independent to being architecture-specific. The INSERT 
GENERATION and DELETE GENERATION commands only work on the architecture 
that the user specifies.

<a name="arch_propogations"><h1><font color=maroon>9.5 Change Propagation and Fold Records</font></h1></a>

<p>
When a module is replaced into the library, the source control system 
may have to propagate the change from the specified development stream 
to its successors. Change propagation and fold records have already 
been explained for the one-architecture case. In the presence of 
multiple architectures, the following additional rules apply:

<ul>
  <li>If the stream successor chain does not cross from the 
  architecture-independent to the architecture-specific instance of the 
  module being replaced, change propagation and fold record generation 
  work as described earlier in this document.
  <li>If the development stream successor chain crosses an architecture 
  boundary for module [FACIL]FOO.BAR (for example, if VMS:[FACIL]FOO.BAR 
  contains the generation in stream AETNA and VAX:[FACIL]FOO.BAR and 
  Alpha:[FACIL]FOO.BAR contain the generations in stream PHOENIX), then 
  the source control system generates fold records saying that the change 
  to VMS:[FACIL]FOO.BAR must be manually propagated to modules 
  VAX:[FACIL]FOO.BAR and Alpha:[FACIL]FOO.BAR. The same is true if the 
  change must be propagated from an architecture-independent module to a 
  single-architecture module.
<a name="index_x_677"></a>
<a name="index_x_678"></a>
  <li>Source changes will not be propagated automatically across an 
  architecture boundary in Version 1 of the new source control system. In 
  general, a module will not be made architectures-specific unless its 
  Alpha form is different from its architecture-independent form. The VAX 
  form is more likely to be the same as the original 
  architecture-independent form, which would make change propagation 
  across architectures useful, but the implementation of such change 
  propagation is difficult and will therefore be deferred. This means 
  that change propagation across architectures must be done manually, 
  just as folds are. Fold records will remind developers when such change 
  propagation is required.
  <li>If a module is architecture-specific, then a change to the Alpha 
  module can optionally generate a fold record that reminds the user to 
  make the same change to the VAX module, and vice versa. In this 
  situation, the REPLACE command will ask the user whether to create such 
  a fold record.
<a name="index_x_679"></a>
<a name="index_x_680"></a>
</ul>

<p>
In summary, while VDE does include support multiple source 
code architectures, there is no support automatic change propagation 
across architectures. VDE does support fold records for 
changes that span architectures.
