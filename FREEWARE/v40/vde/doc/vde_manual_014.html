<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>stream-name</h3>
The name of a stream to be deleted from the current VDE 
library. You can delete more than one stream at a time by using 
wildcard characters. The percent sign (%) in a name matches any single 
character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero 
or more characters in the position it occupies. Those streams whose 
names match the wildcard pattern are deleted.
<a name="index_x_348"></a>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DELETE STREAM command deletes each specified development stream 
from the current VDE library. When a stream is deleted, all 
database information associated with the stream is deleted. The deleted 
database information includes the stream's group definitions, scripts, 
and build dependency graph. The stream is also removed from any stream 
successor chains it belongs to. The stream's disk directories remain 
unchanged, however; they are not deleted.

<p>
You can only delete a stream if the <strong>delete</strong> attribute 
is set for the stream. If this attribute is not set, you must set it 
with the MODIFY STREAM /DELETE command before you can delete the 
stream. Unless the library's allow-deletion attribute is set, the 
stream must also be closed before it can be deleted. (Use MODIFY STREAM 
/CLOSED to close a stream.)
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
stream deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a 
message for each stream asking whether you want that stream deleted. If 
you answer YES (or Y), that stream is deleted from the library. If you 
answer NO (or N), the stream is not deleted. If you enter a stream name 
with a wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the 
deletion of each stream whose name matches the wildcard specification. 
The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified 
streams without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each stream has been 
deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the 
stream has been deleted from the library and that the database 
transaction has successfully committed.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the deleted 
stream. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters 
long, may contain any explanatory remark that you want to store in the 
database.

<h3>DELETE USER username [, username...] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>username</h3>
The OpenVMS username of the VDE user whose record is 
deleted from the database of the current VDE library. You 
can delete more than one username at a time by using wildcard 
characters. The percent sign (%) in a username matches any single 
character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*) matches zero 
or more characters in the position it occupies. Those users whose 
usernames match the wildcard pattern are deleted.
<a name="index_x_351"></a>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DELETE USER command disables access by, and disallows any command 
specification of, the specified user. It also cancels all review and 
notification entries for the specified user.

<p>
The command marks the specified user records in the database as 
deleted, though the user records are not physically deleted from the 
database. As a result of this behaviour, records in the VDE 
database can continue to refer to the user records marked as deleted. 
For example, the record for each module indicates who created the 
module, and the SHOW MODULE command shows the creator's username and 
full name string. That information is found in the creator's user 
record, even if the creator has since left the project and a DELETE 
USER command has marked the associated user record as deleted.

<p>
A user that lacks a matching user entry, or has a deleted user entry, 
will be unable to access the VDE utility<sup>1</sup> 
Further, usernames that have been deleted will <em>not</em> be accepted 
on VDE commands. However, the username record does remain 
within the database, should manual recovery be required at a later date.

<p>
Lists of valid VDE users can also be automatically 
maintained using the VDE/READ_UAF command.
<a name="index_x_352"></a>
VDE/READ_UAF compares the current list of users stored in the 
VDE database with those stored in the OpenVMS system 
authorization
<a name="index_x_353"></a>
<a name="index_x_354"></a>
 database (SYSUAF). The VDE/READ_UAF command is described in 
 <a href="vde_manual_001.html#vde_read_uaf">VDE/READ_UAF</a>.

<p>
As an alternative to the DELETE USER command, one could clear all bits 
in the associated privilege mask, and/or one could use the MODIFY 
USER/USER command to rename the user.
<a name="index_x_355"></a>
These steps prevent the user from performing operations on the 
VDE database, but these options preserve the ability to 
specify the username in VDE commands.

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3>
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3>
Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each 
user record deleted from the database. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes 
VDE to print a message for each user record giving the 
username and asking whether you want that record deleted. If you answer 
YES (or Y), that user record is deleted from the database. If you 
answer NO (or N), the user record is not deleted. If you enter a 
username with a wildcard specification, VDE asks you to 
confirm the deletion of each username that matches the wildcard 
specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete 
the specified users from the database without asking for confirmation.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after each user record has 
been deleted. These messages indicate that the user has been deleted 
from the database and that the database transaction has successfully 
committed. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them.
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="index_x_356"></a>
Displays the differences between any two module generations.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>DIFFERENCES gen-spec-1 [gen-spec-2] </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>gen-spec-1</h3>
Specifies the first module generation to be compared. The generation 
specification consists of the following in order:

<ul>
  <li> an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets
  <li> a module name
  <li> a type name
  <li> an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon
</ul>

An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

<p>
If you omit the facility name, a module generation from the default 
facility is compared. If you omit the generation number, the most 
recent generation of the module in the specified (or default) stream is 
compared.

<p>
If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number is 
relative to the most recent generation of the module in the stream 
specified by the /STREAM qualifier (or the default stream if that 
qualifier is omitted). For example, if the most recent generation is 
generation 5, then generation 0 is the same as generation 5 and 
generation --1 is the same as generation 4.

<p>
If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE compares the 
generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores the 
generation number on the <strong>gen-spec-1</strong> parameter.
<h3>gen-spec-2</h3>
Specifies the second module generation to be compared. This parameter 
can have the same form as the first parameter 
(<strong>gen-spec-1</strong>) to fully specify a VDE 
generation. If the facility, module, and type names are the same as for 
the first parameter, this second parameter can be abbreviated to just 
the generation number, optionally preceded by a semicolon. For example, 
&quot;;5&quot; or just &quot;5&quot; is enough to specify generation 5 
of the module given by the <strong>gen-spec-1</strong> parameter.

<p>
If the <strong>gen-spec-2</strong> parameter is omitted, VDE 
compares the generation given by the <strong>gen-spec-1</strong> 
parameter with the immediately preceding generation. You can also use 
the /GENERATION and /STREAM qualifiers to compare other generations of 
the same module.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The DIFFERENCES command determines the differences between any two 
module generations in the VDE library. It fetches the two 
specified generations into a scratch directory and runs the DCL 
DIFFERENCES
<a name="index_x_357"></a>
<a name="index_x_358"></a>
command in a subprocess to compare the texts of the two generations and 
to display the differences between them on your terminal.

<p>
The command fetches the specified generations into a scratch directory 
determined as follows. If logical name VDE$SCRATCH is defined, 
VDE
<a name="index_x_359"></a>
<a name="index_x_360"></a>
<a name="index_x_361"></a>
<a name="index_x_362"></a>
fetches the files into the directory that this logical name is bound 
to. If this logical name is not defined, VDE fetches the 
files into a VDE-created subdirectory [.VDE$SCRATCH] under 
the current SYS$SCRATCH directory. (By default, SYS$SCRATCH is defined 
as your
<a name="index_x_363"></a>
<a name="index_x_364"></a>
SYS$LOGIN login directory. This logical name can be redefined by a user 
to reference a user-created subdirectory; all scratch files can thus be 
corraled in a particular subdirectory.) VDE creates the 
[.VDE$SCRATCH] subdirectory if it does not already exist, and defines 
the logical name VDE$SCRATCH to reference it. VDE then 
spawns a subprocess to run the DCL DIFFERENCES command and display the 
differences. VDE deletes the fetched files at the end of the 
command unless you specify the /KEEP qualifier. The difference output 
goes to your terminal by default, but you can direct it to a file using 
the /OUTPUT qualifier.

<p>
Although the DIFFERENCES command can compute the differences between 
any two generations in the VDE library, it is almost always 
used to compare two generations of the same module. For this reason, 
you can reduce the second generation specification parameter so it 
consists of only a generation number. The following example compares 
generations 5 and 2 of module [FACIL]MOD.TYP for your default stream:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP;5 ;2
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You can also omit the second generation specification parameter 
entirely. In this case, the specified generation is compared to its 
immediate predecessor. The following command thus compares generation 5 
with generation 4:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP;5
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
When you omit the second parameter, you can use the /GENERATION 
qualifier to specify the CMS generation expressions of the two 
generations to compare. For example, the following command compares the 
generations with CMS generation expressions 10A2 and 11B1:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP/GENERATION=(10A2,11B1)
</pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>
You can also use the /STREAM qualifier to specify that the latest 
generations from two streams be compared. The following example 
illustrates this use of the /STREAM qualifier:

<p>
<table border=0>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor=blanchedalmond>
      <br>
      <font color=mediumblue><pre>
VDE„ DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP/STREAM=(V2.0,V2.2)
</pre>
</font>
</table>

This example compares the latest generations of the given module in 
streams V2.0 and V2.2.

<p>
In addition to accepting certain VDE-specific qualifiers, 
the DIFFERENCES command accepts all qualifiers that the DCL DIFFERENCES 
command accepts. These qualifiers are simply passed through to the 
subprocess that runs the OpenVMS DIFFERENCES program.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/GENERATION=gen-expr</h3>
Specifies that the module generation that has the CMS generation 
expression given by the <strong>gen-expr</strong> parameter be 
compared. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE uses the 
generation given by the generation number on the module-name parameter. 
If both this qualifier and the generation number are omitted, the 
command uses the latest generation of the module for the specified 
development stream.
<h3>/KEEP</h3>
Specifies that one or both of the fetched and compared module 
generations be retained in the scratch directory after the command 
completes. If this
<a name="index_x_365"></a>
qualifier is omitted, the files containing those generations are 
deleted after the differences are computed. If you specify the /KEEP 
qualifier after the <strong>gen-spec-1</strong> parameter, the file 
containing that generation is kept. Likewise, if you specify the /KEEP 
qualifier after the <strong>gen-spec-2</strong> parameter, the file 
containing that generation is kept. If you specify the qualifier after 
the DIFFERENCES keyword or after both parameters, the files containing 
both generations are kept.
<h3>/STREAM=stream-name</h3>
Specifies that the generation to be compared should be taken from the 
development stream given by the <strong>stream-name</strong> parameter. 
If this qualifier is omitted, the generation is taken from your default 
stream unless you use the /GENERATION qualifier.
<h3> /CHANGE_BAR <br> /COMMENT_DELIMITER</h3>
<h3> /IGNORE <br> /MAXIMUM_DIFFERENCES</h3>
<h3> /MATCH <br> /MERGED</h3>
<h3> /MODE <br> /NUMBER</h3>
<h3> /NONUMBER <br> /OUTPUT</h3>
<h3> /PARALLEL <br> /SEPARATED</h3>
<h3> /SLP <br> /WIDTH /WINDOW</h3>
These qualifiers are passed through to the spawned DCL DIFFERENCES 
command without change. See the description of the DIFFERENCES command 
in the <em>OpenVMS DCL Dictionary</em> manual for a description 
of these qualifiers and their parameters.

extracted. See the description of the CREATE SCRIPT command for an 
explanation of the format of scripts, the different types of scripts, 
and how scripts are selected using script-type qualifiers. You must 
also specify the script segment number unless the default value applies.

<p>
Keywords used within scripts are documented in <a href="vde_manual_025.html#vde_script_keywords">Script Keywords</a>, while 
script functions are in <a href="vde_manual_026.html#vde_script_functions">Script Functions</a>, and script types are in

<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/BUILD</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's BUILD script be extracted.
<h3>/COMPILE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's COMPILE script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/COPY=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's COPY script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/CREATE_FACILITY</h3>
Specifies that the script that VDE invokes when a new 
facility is created should be extracted.
<h3>/DELETE_GENERATION=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's DELETE_GENERATION script with the 
specified <strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/DIFFERENCES=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's DIFFERENCES script with the 
specified <strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/FETCH=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's FETCH script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/INSERT_GENERATION=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's INSERT_GENERATION script with the 
specified <strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/LINK=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's LINK script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed after the script is 
extracted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed and 
the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the 
script has been extracted and identify the output file.
<h3>/NEW_STREAM=fac-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's NEW_STREAM script with the 
specified <strong>fac-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/NOKEEP=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's NOKEEP script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/REPLACE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's REPLACE script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/RESERVE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's RESERVE script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/SEGMENT=seg-num</h3>
Specifies the segment number of the script to extract. The 
<strong>seg-num</strong> parameter specifies the integer segment 
number. If you omit this qualifier, VDE extracts the script 
with segment number 10.
<h3>/SET_FACILITY=fac-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's SET_FACILITY script with the 
specified <strong>fac-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/SET_STREAM</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's SET_STREAM script be extracted.
<h3>/STAGING=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's STAGING script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
<h3>/UNRESERVE=mod-name</h3>
Specifies that the default stream's UNRESERVE script with the specified 
<strong>mod-name</strong> specification be extracted.
