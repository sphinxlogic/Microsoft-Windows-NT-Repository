<MSG>(ABKEYW\ambiguous qualifier or keyword '<EMPHASIS>(text)' - supply more 
characters )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
VDE cannot complete the command because '<EMPHASIS>(text)' 
is ambiguous in the context of this command.

<MSG>(ABTBADST\VDE may be in an inconsistent internal state )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The user has typed 3 or more CTRL/Cs.  VDE normally responds
to a CTRL/C by continuing execution until a consistent
internal state is achieved and then aborts the current
command.  However, if VDE is in an infinite loop and does not 
detect this "consistent" state, it will abort anyway after
the 3rd CTRL/C.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Leave and enter VDE again to make sure the internal state is
consistent.

<MSG>(ABTCNTLC\command aborted by Control-C )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The current VDE command has been aborted due to a 
control C issued by the user.  VDE will attempt to 
gracefully recover. 
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Issue another command to VDE.  It has gracefully 
to a consistent internal state.

<MSG>(ARCHADDED\architecture <EMPHASIS>(architecture) added to the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated architecture 
definition has been added to the VDE database.  This 
message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
on the CREATE ARCHITECTURE command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(ARCHDEL\architecture <EMPHASIS>(architecture) deleted from the database )

<MSG>(ARCHEXISTS\architecture <EMPHASIS>(architecture)  already exists in database; not changed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated architecture name was specified on a CREATE 
ARCHITECTURE command, but an entry for that architecture 
is already present in the database.  Hence a new entry was 
not created for that architecture.  Alternatively, the 
indicated name was specified as the new name for an existing 
architecture on the MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command, but another 
architecture already has the requested new name.  Hence the 
name of the existing architecture could not be changed to 
the new name.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you entered the wrong architecture name, reenter the 
command with the correct name.  If you entered the right 
architecture name, use the SHOW ARCHITECTURE command to 
display the database information for that architecture.  
If you are not satisfied with that information, use the 
MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command to change it.

<MSG>(ARCHMOD\information for architecture <EMPHASIS>(architecture) modified in the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that information for the indicated 
architecture has been modified in the VDE database.  This 
message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on 
the MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)

<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated architecture name was entered on a SHOW 
ARCHITECTURE command, but no such architecture was found 
in the VDE database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated architecture does not exist in the 
database. 

<MSG>(ARCHSYNTAX\invalid architecture name syntax: <EMPHASIS>(name) )

specified on a FETCH or RESERVE of a module that uses
a marker file.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Examine the text of the CMS generation using CMS directly 
to determine what is wrong.  If the module should not use 
marker files, change its marker-file attribute with the 
MODIFY MODULE command.  If it should use marker files, 
determine what is wrong with the CMS element and repair 
it with CMS so it points to the appropriate actual source 
module.  If /OUTPUT=NLA0: was specified, respecify the
command with a non-null device and directory.

<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to create a new build job with the BUILD 
command when another build job for the same development 
stream is already active.  A build job is <QUOTE>(active) 
unless it has completed execution or has been stopped.  
You cannot have more than one active build job for the 
same stream at any one time since that could cause two 
build jobs to write to the same result directories at the 
same time.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Allow the first build job to complete before you create 
the next one.  Alternatively, you can stop the previous 
build job with the STOP BUILD_JOB command and then create 
the new build job.

<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated build step needs to be performed to make all 
input modules up-to-date for the compile or link operation 
you have requested.  This situation can occur if, for example, 
you have modified a source module without compiling it (so 
that the corresponding object module is no longer up-to-date) 
and you then request a link that includes the old, non-current 
object module.  This is an informational message to alert 
you that your compile or link will not produce fully 
up-to-date outputs, but the requested compile or link will 
still be performed as you requested.

<MSG>(CTXEXISTS\context <EMPHASIS>(context) already exists in database; context not changed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated context name was specified on a CREATE CONTEXT 
command, but an entry for that context is already present 
in the database.  Hence a new entry was not created for that 
context.  Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as 
the new name for an existing context on the MODIFY CONTEXT 
command, but another context already has the requested new 
name.  Hence the name of the existing context could not be 
changed to the new name.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you entered the wrong context name, reenter the command 
with the correct name.  If you entered the right context 
name, use the SHOW CONTEXT command to display the database 
information for that context.  If you are not satisfied 
with that information, use the MODIFY CONTEXT command to 
change it.

VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated context name was entered on a SHOW CONTEXT
command, but no such context was found in the VDE database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated context does not exist in the database. 

<MSG>(CTXSYNTAX\invalid context name syntax: <EMPHASIS>(name) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)

<MSG>(DCLBUFOVFL\DCL command line being generated is too long for buffer )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
Some command which generates a DCL command file to perform 
part of its actions generated a DCL command line that is 
too long for its buffer; this normally means that the line 
is excessively long since the buffer size is ample for 
normal use.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Change the command line specification in the script for it.

<MSG>(DCLERROR\error status returned by spawned DCL <EMPHASIS>(DCL) command )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)

<MSG>(DEFARCH\architecture <EMPHASIS>(architecture) not deleted; you cannot delete default architecture )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated architecture, 
namely the current default architecture, has not been 
deleted from the database.  You are not allowed to delete 
the default architecture.  This prohibition prevents you 
from accidentally deleting all architectures, especially 
when using a wildcarded architecture name specification.  
There is thus no way to delete all architectures from the 
database.  (If you could delete all architectures, the 
library would become useless since it could not contain 
any modules.)
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you want to delete a given architecture from the database, 
set your default architecture to another architecture that you 
want to keep.  Then issue the DELETE ARCHITECTURE command.

<MSG>(DEFKEY\<EMPHASIS>(state-name) key <EMPHASIS>(key-name) has been defined )

reissue the command that invokes the script.

<MSG>(DIRNOTFOULOG\directory location not found for build-step log file )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The subdirectory in the VDE library that should be used 
for the log file for the current build step is not found 
in the database.  This message indicates that some required 
subdirectory is not present in the directory tree for the 
current development stream.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)

<MSG>(DIRNOTFOUSCRP\directory location not found by script function <EMPHASIS>(function) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The current script has invoked the indicated script 
function (such as $DIR or $FACROOT), but the directory 
location specified with that function invocation is not 
found in the VDE database.  This may mean that the 
directory tree for the specified stream or facility 
has not been created, or that the function invocation 
specifies a directory symbol that is not used for that 
stream and facility.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Create the directory tree for the facility or stream, or 
correct the directory symbol name in the function call.  
Then reissue the command that invokes the script.

<MSG>(DIRSPECREQ\directory specification required for stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
A root directory specification for the indicated stream 
is required on the CREATE STREAM command but was not 
specified.  You need to use the /DIRECTORY qualifier to 
specify the root directory for the stream, or you need 
to enter that directory specification when prompted for 
it.  This message is only given if an earlier 
SET DIRECTORY/PROMPT command has specified that the 
CREATE STREAM command should prompt for the directory 
specification if the /DIRECTORY qualifier is missing.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Enter a directory specification for the stream root 
directory when prompted for it or reissue the CREATE 
STREAM command with the /DIRECTORY qualifier.

<MSG>(DIRTOOLONG\directory specification is too long; maximum length is 255 )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)

<MSG>(DIRTRENOTDEL\not all files deleted in directory tree <EMPHASIS>(tree) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that not all files in the indicated 
directory tree were deleted for some reason, such as 
insufficient privileges.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use DCL commands to check the security on the remaining files 
in the directory tree, and take the appropriate action to 
delete them if possible.

<MSG>(DUPLNAME\duplicate name in list not allowed: <EMPHASIS>(name) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)

<MSG>(EXARANGE\hexadecimal number not valid; valid range is <EMPHASIS>(number) to <EMPHASIS>(number) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
Illegal hexadecimal range provided as input.  
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Verify that the provided hexadecimal range is in an accepted 
format. 

<MSG>(EXPGENDIFF\expected generation expression <EMPHASIS>(expression) differs from actual <EMPHASIS>(expression) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
When you reserved the module you are replacing, the 
RESERVE command displayed the expected replace-time CMS 
generation expression of the new module generation.  
However, the actual CMS generation expression that VDE 
assigned during the current replacement differs from that 
expected generation expression.  This situation is normal 
because VDE cannot predict the actual replace-time CMS 
generation expression when you reserve the module; it 
can only tell you the most likely generation expression.  
By the time you replace the module, various circumstances 
can change the appropriate generation expression to use.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
None.  This message is informational only.  However, if 
you used the expected CMS generation expression in code 
comments, you may have to change those comments.

<MSG>(EXPGENEXPR\expected generation expression at replacement is <EMPHASIS>(generation) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
When you replace the module you just reserved, the new 
generation of the module is expected to have the indicated 
CMS generation expression.  You may use this generation 
expression as an <QUOTE>(audit trail identifier) in the 
comments in your code if your project uses that convention.  
The indicated generation expression may differ from the 
one that VDE actually assigns when you replace the module, 
but only in certain unusual circumstances.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
None.  This message is informational only.

<MSG>(EXPGENLONG\expected CMS generation expression is too long )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The expected replace-time CMS generation expression for 
the module you are reserving will be longer than 16 
characters, which is longer than CMS allows.  As a result, 
you cannot reserve the module.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This error indicates that you have reserved and replaced 
modules on too many nested non-main streams.  You should 
create new streams off the main development stream and 
place the offending generations there so that they have 
CMS generation expressions of modest size.  Even though 
you cannot reserve the generation in question, you can 
still fetch it out and replace it into the new streams.

<MSG>(FACADDED\facility <EMPHASIS>(facility) added to the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

<MSG>(FIRGENNODEL\generation <EMPHASIS>(generation) is first generation of module; cannot be deleted )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are trying to delete the first generation of a module 
with the DELETE GENERATION command, which VDE does not 
allow.  If you want to delete all generations of a module, 
you must delete the entire module with the DELETE MODULE 
command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you mistyped the generation number, reenter it correctly.  
If you want to delete all generations of the module, use 
the DELETE MODULE command.

<MSG>(FIRNUMMAY\first number of a range may not be less than <EMPHASIS>(number) )

<MSG>(FOLDEXP\fold record for <EMPHASIS>(fold) expected for stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that VDE expects to generate a fold
record for the indicated stream.  The fold record will be
generated when this module change is approved and performed
by the project leader -- when the queued replacement is
performed.  Because there may be a delay before the
replacement is performed by the project leader and
because the project leader may reject the replacement, the
fold record will not immediately appear via commands such
as SHOW REPLACEMENT.  The fold will be generated when VDE
sends you the notification that the replacement has been
performed.  This message is only issued when you use the
/LOG qualifier on the REPLACE command, and only for a queued
replacement from which VDE expects to generate a fold record.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
You may/will need to resolve the fold record that will
(eventually) be generated by this replacement.  Use the
/NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to
see the message.  

<MSG>(FOLDIDREQ\fold identifier required for module <EMPHASIS>(module) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have multiple fold records for the indicated module.  
You must therefore specify a fold identifier with the 
/IDENTIFICATION or /FOLD qualifier (depending on the 
command) to uniquely indicate to which fold record you 
want the command to apply.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reissue the command with the /IDENTIFICATION or /FOLD 
qualifier to indicate the specific fold record to which 
you want the command to apply.

<MSG>(FOLDIDUSED\fold identifier <EMPHASIS>(identifier) already used for module <EMPHASIS>(module)      attempt to create fold record has failed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are trying to create a fold record for a module using 
the same fold identifier as you have used on a previous 
fold record for the same module in the same development 
stream.  This is not allowed, since fold identifiers must 
be unique.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reissue the CREATE FOLD command with a different fold 
identifier specified on the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.  
Alternatively, you can omit the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, 
in which case VDE will assign a unique identifier for you.

<MSG>(FOLDINSTRM\generation <EMPHASIS>(generation) must be folded into stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that you must manually fold the 
indicated module generation into the indicated development 
stream in order to propagate the changes in that generation 
into the stream.  VDE cannot propagate the changes 
automatically because the module has already diverged 
between that stream and its predecessor.  This message 
is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the 
REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish 
to see the message.

<MSG>(FOLDMOD\fold record <EMPHASIS>(record) for module <EMPHASIS>(module) modified in database )

module has been modified in the VDE database.  This message 
is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the 
MODIFY FOLD command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish 
to see the message. 

<MSG>(FOLDNOTFOUND\fold record <EMPHASIS>(record) not found for module <EMPHASIS>(module) and stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to reference a fold record for the indicated 
module in the indicated development stream, but there is no 
such fold record.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated module has no fold records in the 
indicated stream.

<MSG>(FROMDIREMPTY\the directory <EMPHASIS>(directory) specified with /FROM_DIRECTORY is empty )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)

<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are trying to delete a generation of a module which is 
still reachable by at least one stream and/or is not a leaf 
generation (some other generation points to it as its previous 
generation).  VDE does not allow a generation to be deleted 
in either of these cases.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Check that you have specified the correct generation for 
deletion.

<MSG>(GENNOPRED\generation <EMPHASIS>(generation) of <EMPHASIS>(module) has no predecessor )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The generation of the indicated module with the shown 
CMS generation expression does not have a predecessor 
generation.  As a result, the current operation cannot 
be performed.  For example, the DIFFERENCES command 
cannot compare generation 1 with its predecessor because 
it has no predecessor.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Specify a generation that has a predecessor (normally any 
generation except generation 1) and rerun the command.

<MSG>(GENNOTCLASSMEM\generation <EMPHASIS>(generation) is not a member of CMS class <EMPHASIS>(class) )

<MSG>(INMODNOTFOU\input module <EMPHASIS>(module) of build step not found in database; ignored )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The automatically collected dependency information for the 
current build step specifies that the indicated module is 
an input to the step.  However, the module is not found in 
the VDE database; it is neither specified as a source module

the VDE database is not consistent with the actual contents 
of the facility subdirectory in which the compiler or other 
processor found the module.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Determine whether the module should be in the VDE library.  
If it should be there, create the module with the CREATE 
MODULE command.  If it should not be there, delete it from 
the facility subdirectory in which the compiler or other 
processor found it.

<MSG>(INVDBFORM\invalid database format; VDE is unable to access library )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The VDE database does not have the proper format.  The 
database header record could be read successfully, but 
that record does not contain the proper sentinel value 
or its database version value indicates an out-of-date 
or invalid database format.  This error could indicate 
that the database has been corrupted in some way or 
that VDE has generated it incorrectly.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Try to connect to the database again using the SET LIBRARY 
command.  If that does not work, you may have to recreate 
the library (and thus the database) from scratch with the 
CREATE LIBRARY command.  If that still does not work, 
please contact VDE support for assistance.

Reissue the command with the appropriate number.

<MSG>(INVDIRSPEC\invalid directory specification: <EMPHASIS>(text) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
A directory specification on a VDE command is not 
syntactically correct.  This message is also printed 
if a logical name (such as VDE$LIBRARY) that is supposed 
to be bound to a directory specification is not bound to 
a syntactically correct directory specification.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reenter the VDE command with a valid directory specification 
or define the logical name to be bound to a valid directory 
specification.

<MSG>(INVGENEXPR\invalid CMS generation expression:  <EMPHASIS>(expression) )

<MSG>(INVINPUT\invalid interactive command input; command aborted )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The current command has queried the user for input and has 
gotten invalid input several times in a row.  This can be 
caused by specifying insufficient parameter or qualifier 
information on a command in a command file, which may cause 
subsequent commands to be read as responses to interactive 
queries.  Due to the invalid input, the current command is 
aborted.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reissue the command with correct qualifiers and parameters 
or with correct input to interactive queries for command 
information.

<MSG>(INVINTVAL\invalid integer value on command line: <EMPHASIS>(integer) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)

<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated module name or facility name is wildcarded 
in a way that is not valid in a module-name or facility 
specification used to select scripts.  The only form of 
wildcarding that is allowed in this context is a single 
asterisk <PARENDCHAR>(*); other, more general forms of 
wildcarding are not allowed in script selectors.  Also, 
the components of a full module (such as [FAC]MOD.TYP) 
may all be wildcarded individually, but only in certain 
combinations.  Invalid combinations yield this error 
message.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reissue the command with an acceptable wildcard specification.

<MSG>(MISTYPNAM\missing type name for module <EMPHASIS>(string); type name required )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
A module name has been specified without a module type in 
a context where the module type is required.  For example, 
the command CREATE MODULE M1 is incorrect because a module 
type, as in CREATE MODULE M1.FOR (where FOR is the module 
type), is required for this command.  The type name must 
be separated from the module name by a dot (.) as shown in 
the example.

<MSG>(MNEMONIC\library (<EMPHASIS>(mnemonic)) <EMPHASIS>(library) available )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)

VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated module 
definition has been added to the VDE database.  This 
message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
on the CREATE MODULE command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to 
see the message. 

<MSG>(MODALRINSTEP\module <EMPHASIS>(module) is already an input to build step )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated module is 
already an input to the build step.  This message is 
only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the 
MODIFY STEP command and specify a new input module 
which is already an input to the step.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(MODALROUTSTEP\module <EMPHASIS>(module) is already an output from build step )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)

already an output from the build step.  This message 
is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the 
MODIFY STEP command and specify a new output module 
which is already an output from the step.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(MODALRQUEREP\module <EMPHASIS>(module) already queued for replacement <EMPHASIS>(replacement) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to replace or unreserve a module that already 
belongs to the indicated queued replacement.  A reservation 
that already belongs to a queued replacement cannot be 
unreserved or queued for another replacement; the reservation 
remains until the original replacement is performed or 
cancelled.  As a result, your attempt to replace or unreserve 
the module has failed.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you want to remove the module reservation from its current 
queued replacement, you must cancel that replacement with the 
CANCEL REPLACEMENT command.  You can then unreserve the 
module or replace it as part of another replacement.

<MSG>(MODALRRES\module <EMPHASIS>(module) already reserved; reservation has failed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to reserve a module that is already reserved 
by another user (possibly yourself).  That reservation does
not allow concurrent reservations, or you have not requested
a concurrent reservation.  The reservation may be in the
current default stream, or in an ancestor stream.  As a
result of this prior reservation, your attempt to 
reserve the module has failed.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Wait until the user who has reserved the module replaces it 
in the library.  Then reserve it yourself.  You can use the 
SHOW RESERVATION/FULL command to see who currently has the
module reserved, and in what stream the module was originally
reserved.  Alternatively, you can use the /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT
qualifier to concurrently reserve the module, or the /QUEUE
qualifier to queue a request for notification when the
module becomes available.

<MSG>(MODDEL\module <EMPHASIS>(module) deleted from the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the definition for the 
indicated module has been deleted from the VDE database.  
This message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
on the DELETE MODULE command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to 
see the message. 

<MSG>(MODEXISTS\module <EMPHASIS>(module) already exists in database; module not changed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated module name was specified on a CREATE MODULE 
command, but an entry for that module is already present in 
the database.  Hence a new entry was not created for that 
module.  Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as 
the new name for an existing module on the MODIFY MODULE 
command, but another module in the same facility already has 
the requested new name.  Hence the name of the existing 
module could not be changed to the new name.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you entered the wrong module name, reenter the command 
with the correct name.  If you entered the right module 
name, use the SHOW MODULE command to display the database 
information for that module.  If you are not satisfied 
with that information, use the MODIFY MODULE command to 
change it.

<MSG>(MODINSTEP\module <EMPHASIS>(module) is an input to the build step )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated module is 
recorded as an input to the build step being defined.  
This message is only issued when you use the /LOG 
qualifier on the CREATE STEP or MODIFY STEP command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(MODLOCKED\module <EMPHASIS>(module) locked for replacement by another user )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The module you are trying to replace is currently being 
replaced by another user who is updating the same generation 
as you want to update.  As a result, your replacement attempt 
failed.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Wait a minute or two and then try the operation again.  
If the other user deleted your concurrent reservation 
through his or her replacement, your second attempt will 
fail with a message to that effect.  If the other user's 
replacement failed or did not conflict with yours, your 
new replacement attempt can succeed.

<MSG>(MODMODIF\information for module <EMPHASIS>(module) modified in the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that information for the indicated 
module has been modified in the VDE database.  This message 
is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the MODIFY 
MODULE command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to 
see the message. 

<MSG>(MODNOTDEL\module <EMPHASIS>(module) not deleted )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated module name was entered on a SHOW MODULE 
command, but no such module was found in the VDE database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated module does not exist in the database. 

<MSG>(MODNOTINSTEP\module <EMPHASIS>(module) is not now an input to build step )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated module is 
not now recorded as an input to the build step whose 
definition you are modifying.  Removing it from the 
build step is thus redundant.  This message is only 
issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the MODIFY 
STEP command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(MODNOTINSTRM\generation <EMPHASIS>(generation) not in stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)

STEP command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(MODNOTRES\module <EMPHASIS>(module) is not currently reserved )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are trying to replace the indicated module but that 
module is not currently reserved in the current stream 
development stream.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reserve the module before trying to replace it.

<MSG>(MODNOTREV\module <EMPHASIS>(module) not found in review list )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have specified a module that does not exist in the 
current review list.  As a result, you cannot select the 
module with the name you specified.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reenter the SELECT command specifying a module that is 
present in the review list for the current REVIEW command.  
Use the DIRECTORY subcommand to determine what modules are 
present in the list.

<MSG>(MODOBS\module <EMPHASIS>(module-name) superceded or marked obsolete )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

<MSG>(NOBLDJOB\no build jobs found for stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
No build job is present in the database that belongs to 
the indicated stream and matches the selection criteria 
you specified on the SHOW BUILD_JOB or other BUILD_JOB 
command.  The selection criteria you have specified may 
include the build-job identification number, the build-job 
status, or bounds on the build-job creation date and time.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the no build job exists for the stream and 
selection criteria you specified.

<MSG>(NOBLDSTEPS\build job contains no build steps; build job is not created )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You tried to create a build job with the BUILD command, 
but the build job turns out to contain no build steps.  
As a result, the build job is not created in the database.  
The usual cause of this error is that you specified a 
minimal build of modules that are already up-to-date with 
respect to their source modules.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you intended to perform a minimal build, the build job 
is unnecessary.  If you intended to perform a full build, 
specify the /FULL qualifier on the BUILD command.

<MSG>(NOBUILD\no BUILD privilege; cannot create build jobs in this library )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)

reservation.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you no longer want the reservation that will create the 
first generation of the module, you must delete the module 
with the DELETE MODULE command.  If you just want to change 
the attributes of the reservation, you must do so with the 
MODIFY RESERVATION command.

<MSG>(NOCAUSE\replacement cause not known; module not replaced )

<MSG>(NODIRDELTA\no delta-file directory found for facility <EMPHASIS>(facility) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
VDE tried to access the delta-file directory for the 
indicated facility, but no such directory is recorded 
in the database.  This normally means that you have 
not yet created the disk directories for the facility.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
To create the facility's delta-file directory, use the 
CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command with the /DELTA_FILES and 
possibly /FACILITY qualifiers.  Use the SHOW LOCATION

symbol VDE$MARKER for the indicated facility.  Such a 
directory must exist for you to create modules that use 
marker files.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
To create the needed subdirectory, use the SET DIRECTORY 
command with the /DELTA_FILES and /SYMBOL=VDE$MARKER 
qualifiers.  Then create the facility's delta-file 
directory tree with the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command, 
using the /DELTA_FILES and possibly /FACILITY qualifiers.  
Use the SHOW LOCATION command to see what disk directories 
are recorded in the VDE database.

<MSG>(NOFACSPEC\no facility specified for operation )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have entered a command that requires a default facility 
to exist, but you have not established a default facility.

<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Specify the target VDE library.  To determine the
available libraries, issue the "SET LIBRARY" command
with no parameters.  As part of the error message, this
command will display the names of the predefined VDE
libraries, the Rdb root directory for each, and the
mnemonic name for each.  Once the mnemnonic name or the
Rdb root directory name for the target library is known,
one can: A) use the mnemnonic name or the Rdb root directory
name as the libname parameter on a "SET LIBRARY libname"
VDE command.  B) Use use the mnemnonic name or the Rdb root
directory name as the parameter on the VDE /LIBRARY=libname.

<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to create queued replacement for some module, 
but no staging area root directory exists for the library.  
Hence VDE cannot create a disk directory for saving (or 
<QUOTE>(staging)) the files to be replaced.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE/STAGING command to create 
the root directory for the library's staging areas.  Then 
reenter the REPLACE command.  Alternatively, replace the 
module with an immediate (as opposed to queued) replacement.  
An immediate replacement does not use a staging area.

<MSG>(NOSTRMROOT\no stream root directory exists for stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to create a directory tree for a specific 
facility within the current stream, but no root directory 
exists for the stream.  Hence VDE cannot create any disk 
directories for the indicated facility.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create a 
directory tree for the current stream.  That will 
automatically create both the stream root directory 
and the subdirectories for all facilities.

<MSG>(NOSTRMSPEC\no stream specified for operation )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The command you have entered requires that you specify 
the name of a development stream, either with the /STREAM 
qualifier or as a command parameter, but the stream name

<MSG>(NOSUCHARCH\architecture <EMPHASIS>(architecture) not found in database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated architecture name was entered on a command, 
but no such architecture was found in the VDE database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated architecture does not exist in the 
database.  However, if you had expected such an architecture 
to exist, you may use the SHOW ARCHITECTURE command to see 
what architectures are found in the database.  If the 
desired architecture is not there, ask your project 
administator to add it to the database.  Then reenter your 
command with a valid architecture name.

<MSG>(NOSUCHCTX\context <EMPHASIS>(context) not found in database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)

However, if you had expected such a context to exist, you may 
use the SHOW CONTEXT command to see what contexts are found 
in the database.

<MSG>(NOSUCHDIRSYM\directory symbol <EMPHASIS>(symbol) not found in database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated directory symbol was referenced by a script 
but no such directory symbol was found in the VDE database.
VDE tried to use the directory symbol either to look up the 
directory location for the script's DCL command file or to 
evaluate a script function such as $DIR or $STRMDIR.  The 
most likely reason for the error is that you used a script 
function that takes a directory symbol as a parameter, and 
you misspelled the symbol name or specified a symbol you 
have not yet defined.  Directory symbols are defined with 
the /SYMBOL qualifier of the SET DIRECTORY command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Correct the script function call to have a correct directory 
symbol that is already defined.  Then reenter the script in 
the database with the CREATE SCRIPT command and reenter the 
command that got the error message.

<MSG>(NOSUCHFAC\facility <EMPHASIS>(facility) not found in database )

<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to reference a fold record with the indicated 
fold identifier for the indicated module and stream, but 
there is no such fold record in the VDE database.  As a 
result, VDE has aborted the current command and rolled 
back the current transaction.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Specify a valid fold record and reenter the command.

<MSG>(NOSUCHFUNC\no such script function exists: <EMPHASIS>(function) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated script function was specified in a VDE 
script, but no such function exists.  The most likely 
cause for this error is that you misspelled the function 
name.  VDE recognizes a script function by the fact that 
all script function names begin with a dollar sign.  
Directory symbol names, which can appear in the same 
places as functions in scripts, should not begin with 
dollar signs.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Correct the spelling of the function name or select a 
directory symbol name that does not begin with a dollar 
sign.

<MSG>(NOSUCHGEN\generation <EMPHASIS>(generation) not found in database )

no such group was found in the VDE database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated group does not exist in the 
database. However, if you had expected such a group 
to exist, you may use the SHOW GROUP command to see 
what groups are found in the database.  If the desired 
group is not there, use the CREATE GROUP command 
to add it to the database.  Then reenter your command with 
a valid group name.

<MSG>(NOSUCHMOD\module <EMPHASIS>(module) not found in database )

be connected to an existing VDE library, but you are not 
connected to such a library.  This normally means that you 
have not defined logical name VDE$LIBRARY to point to the 
root directory of a properly formed VDE library that you 
are authorized to use.  This problem can also occur after 
you have encountered an error when trying to set or create 
a new library; you are then disconnected from the formerly 
set library without successfully connecting to the new one, 
leaving you unconnected to any library.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Define logical name VDE$LIBRARY to point to the root 
directory for the VDE library you wish to access.  Then 
try the command again.

indicated stream, but the module is not reserved in that 
stream.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the SHOW RESERVATION/FULL command to see what stream the 
reservation was made in.  Then use the SET STREAM command 
to set the current stream to the appropriate stream and
re-enter the command, or (when available) you can append
the /STREAM qualifier on the failing command and reissue
the command.  If you are performing a REPLACEMENT, a
replacement performed in the ancestor stream propogated

If you are authorized to use the privilege, use the 
VDE SET PRIVILEGES command to give yourself the necessary 
privilege.  Then try the original operation again.  If 
you are not authorized to use the qualifier, you should 
either request the necessary privilege from your project 
administrator or you should not use the qualifier.

<MSG>(NOUSERNAME\no USERNAME privilege; cannot reserve and replace for other users )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)

<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you are authorized to use the privilege, use the 
VDE SET PRIVILEGES command to give yourself the necessary 
privilege.  Then try the original operation again.  If 
you are not authorized to use the qualifier, you should 
either request the necessary privilege from your project

<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
Indicates the output file of the current command.  The 
FETCH and RESERVE commands display this message to show 
the location of the output file containing the fetched 
module generation.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
None.  This is an informational message.

<MSG>(OUTMODSRC\output module <EMPHASIS>(module) of build step is a source module; ignored )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The automatically collected dependency information for the 
current build step specifies that the indicated module is 
an output from the step.  However, the module is marked as 
a source module in the VDE database, and a source module 
cannot be an output of a build step.  Hence this dependency 
information is ignored and is not recorded in the database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If the module is erroneously marked as a source module in 
the VDE database, you should delete the module and rerun 
the build step.  If the module actually is a source module, 
you should investigate why the compiler or other processor 
specifies it as an output from the build step.

<MSG>(OUTNLA0\if /OUTPUT=NLA0: was used, respecify with non-null output )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message suggests a workaround for a failure to fetch
a module -- this situation occurs only when fetching or
reserving a module that uses a marker file, and when
/OUTPUT=NLA0: was specified on the command.  The underlying
problem will be fixed in a future release of VDE.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If fetching or reserving a module that uses a marker file,
respecify the command with a non-null output device and
directory.

<MSG>(OVERRIDE\VDE library controls overridden via OpenVMS privileges )

<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
A VDE command line may only consist of records that are less 
than 1024 characters long.  
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you want more than 1024 characters for input, divide each 
line into records that are less than 1024 characters and use 
the continuation character "-" at the point of each break.  If 
the sum of these records are greater than 32,768 characters, 
then the complete command line cannot be processed.

<MSG>(PREFIXNOTALL\prefix VDE$ not allowed in facility or stream names )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to create or rename a facility or stream 
with a name that begins with the prefix <QUOTE>(VDE$) 
but VDE does not allow facilities or streams to have 
such names.  VDE uses facility and stream names as disk 
directory names, but VDE also creates directories reserved 
for its own use whose names always begin with the VDE$ 
prefix.  To prevent name conflicts between facility or 
stream directories and these reserved directories, VDE 
does not allow facility or stream names to begin with 
the VDE$ prefix.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reenter the command with a facility or stream name that 
does not begin with VDE$.

MODIFY REPLACEMENT command, but another replacement already has 
the requested new name.  Hence the name of the existing 
replacement could not be changed to the new name.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you entered the wrong replacement name, reenter the command 
with the correct name.  If you entered the right replacement
name, use the SHOW REPLACEMENT command to display the database

Reissue the command with the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier to 
indicate the specific reservation to which you want the 
command to apply.

<MSG>(RESIDUSED\reservation Id <EMPHASIS>(ID) already used for module <EMPHASIS>(module)      attempt to reserve module has failed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are trying to reserve a module concurrently using the 
same reservation identification as you have used on a previous 
reservation of the same module in the same stream 
development stream.  This is not allowed, since reservation 
identifications must be unique.

<MSG>(STEPNOTCRE\build step not created; module <EMPHASIS>(module) not found in database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have specified a module that does not exist in the 
VDE database as the primary input to a compile step.  As a 
result, the CREATE STEP command does not add the compile 
step or its dependency information to the database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Correct the module name to be the name of an existing 
module or create the module with the CREATE MODULE command 
before reentering the CREATE STEP command.

<MSG>(STEPNOTFOUND\build step for module <EMPHASIS>(module) not found in database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have specified a build step that does not exist in the

definition has been added to the VDE database.  This 
message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
on the CREATE STREAM command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to 
see the message. 

<MSG>(STRMCLOSED\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) is permanently closed; state not changed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You have tried to change the state of a stream development 
stream with the /OPEN or /FROZEN qualifier on the MODIFY 
STREAM command when the stream is already in the 
permanently closed state.  The rest of the command still 
takes effect, but the stream state is not changed; the 
stream remains closed.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
No user action is necessary; the state cannot be changed 
and the command did not change it.

<MSG>(STRMDEL\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) deleted from the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the definition for the 
indicated stream has been deleted from the VDE database.  
This message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
on the DELETE STREAM command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to 
see the message. 

<MSG>(STRMEXISTS\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) already exists in database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated stream name was specified on a CREATE 
STREAM command, but an entry for that stream is already 
present in the database.  Hence a new entry was not created 
for that stream.  Alternatively, the indicated name was 
specified as the new name for an existing stream on the 
MODIFY STREAM command, but another stream already has 
the requested new name.  Hence the name of the existing 
stream could not be changed to the new name.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you entered the wrong stream name, reenter the command 
with the correct name.  If you entered the right stream 
name, use the SHOW STREAM command to display the database 
information for that stream.  If you are not satisfied 
with that information, use the MODIFY STREAM command to 
change it.

<MSG>(STRMMOD\information for stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) modified in the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that information for the indicated 
stream has been modified in the VDE database.  This message 
is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the MODIFY 
STREAM command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to 
see the message. 

<MSG>(STRMNOTCLOSED\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) can not be deleted because it is not closed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are trying to delete a stream which is in an open or 
frozen state.  Only streams in a closed state may be deleted.  
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If appropriate, change the state of the stream to closed 
and repeat the delete stream command.

<MSG>(STRMNOTDEL\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) not deleted )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are attempting to delete a stream that
cannot be deleted.  Additional messages are normally
included with this message, and these messages
indicate why the strean cannot be deleted.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Resolve the problem(s) flagged by the other error
messages, and reenter the DELETE STREAM command.

<MSG>(STRMNOTFOUND\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) not found in database; parameter ignored )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated stream name was entered on a SHOW STREAM 
command, but no such stream was found in the VDE database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated stream does not exist in the database. 

<MSG>(STRMNOTOPEN\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) is not open; operation not allowed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are trying to reserve or replace a module, but the 
currently active stream (whose name is given in the 
message) is either frozen or closed.  It is thus not open 
for the reservation or replacement of modules.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
You can use the SHOW STREAM/FULL command to see the status 
of the current stream.  If the stream is closed, it is 
permanently protected against being changed, and you should 
not be trying to reserve or replace modules in it.  If the 
stream is frozen, it is currently protected against being 
changed, but changes may be allowed later when the library 
administrator sets the state back to open.  You must then 
wait until the stream becomes open.  (You may reserve 
modules from a frozen stream, but not replace them.)  
Finally, if you meant to reserve or replace modules in 
another stream, you should use the SET STREAM command 
to switch your context to that stream and then reserve 
or replace the desired modules.

<MSG>(STRMNOTPOP\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) is not allowed to be populated )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
You are attempting to populate the indicated stream with 
the POPULATE STREAM command but a stream attribute disallows 
use of this command for the stream.   Hence the stream has 
not been populated.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Either you should not be trying to populate the stream or 
else you must set the stream attribute that allows you to 
populate the stream before retrying the operation.  To set 
that attribute, use the /POPULATE qualifier to the MODIFY 
STREAM command.

<MSG>(STRMPOP\stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) populated from stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated stream has 
been populated with all generations from the second 
indicated stream.  This message is only issued when you 
use the /LOG qualifier on the POPULATE STREAM command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(STRMPOPCOUNT\populate module counts: update <EMPHASIS>(count), insert <EMPHASIS>(count), remove <EMPHASIS>(count) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message tells you how many modules were updated in, 
inserted into, and removed from the target stream by the 
current POPULATE STREAM command.  This message is only 
issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the POPULATE 
STREAM command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
wish to see the message. 

<MSG>(STRTOOLONG\quoted string too long; must be shortened )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The maximum length of the quoted string is determined 
by the nature of the string.  For the DEFINE command, 
the string is limited to 255 characters.  For remark 
strings, it is limited to 132 characters.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Try to shorten the size of the string. 

<MSG>(SUCGENEXIST\successor generation for <EMPHASIS>(module) already exists in library )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The new generation of the indicated module created by the 
current REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command should get 
a whole-number CMS generation expression but the reserved 
generation already has a successor generation in the VDE 
library with that whole-number CMS generation expression.  
This situation can arise if you have placed the reserved 
generation into a stream using the INSERT GENERATION 
command or if you have changed the stream that <QUOTE>(owns) 
the whole-number successor generation with the /MAIN_STREAM 
qualifier to the MODIFY GENERATION command.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If the existing whole-number successor generation should 
not be in the VDE library, delete it and its successors 
with the DELETE GENERATION command.  Then repeat the failed 
replacement.  Otherwise, use the /MAIN_STREAM qualifier to 
the MODIFY GENERATION command to allocate ownership of the 
whole-number successor generation to the stream that already 
owns that generation, but not to any stream into which you 
are trying to replace the module.  This will force the 
replacement to use a CMS variant letter.  Then repeat the 
replacement.

<MSG>(SUCLNKADD\successor link from stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) to stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) added )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The successor stream relationship, from the first stream
specified to the second stream specified, has been added.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish
to see the message.

<MSG>(SUCLNKREM\successor link from stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) to stream <EMPHASIS>(stream) removed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The successor stream relationship, from the first stream
specified to the second stream specified, has been removed.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish
to see the message.

<MSG>(SYNTAX\command syntax error at or near: '<EMPHASIS>(text)' )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
All commands  have a 
specific syntax that must be followed. Failure to do so
will result in this error.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
See <reference>(VDE_MANUAL_NAME) for assistance with
the command syntax.

<MSG>(TOOMANPARM\too many poundsign parameters in history or notes stringinvalid string is: <EMPHASIS>(string) )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The history or notes string specified contains more than 
one history or notes parameter.  This is not allowed.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reenter the command with a valid history or notes string.

<MSG>(TRANTOODEEP\translation of logical name <EMPHASIS>(logical) more than 7 deep )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated logical name is either too deeply nested, 
or is defined incorrectly to point back to itself causing 
an infinite translation loop.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Reenter the command without using the logical name.

<MSG>(UIDSKEW\possible UID skew detected; check for correct UID file. )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)

please contact VDE support for assistance.

<MSG>(UNACONVDBFORM\unable to convert database format due to access conflict with another user )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The VDE database does not have the format required by the 
current version of VDE and VDE has attempted to convert 
the database to the required format.  This operation has 
failed because of an access conflict with another user 
attempting to convert the database at the same time.  That 
other user has probably succeeded in converting the database 
format, which is why you cannot do so.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
Retry the CONVERT LIBRARY command and try accessing the 
database again.  You should find that you are now able to 
convert the database format or that the format has already 
been converted.  Either way, you should be able to use VDE 
with that database.

<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
An erroneous attempt was made to UNRESERVE a just-created module.
To cancel the module reservation and the module creation caused
by a CREATE MODULE command, use the DELETE MODULE command.  After
the DELETE MODULE command is accepted, the module will not be
created, the outstanding module reservation will be canceled,
and no further user action is required.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)

<MSG>(USEREXISTS\user <EMPHASIS>(user) already exists in database; user not changed )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated username was specified on a CREATE USER 
command, but an entry for that user is already present 
in the database.  Hence a new entry was not created for 
that user.  Alternatively, the indicated username was 
specified as the new username for an existing user on the 
MODIFY USER command, but another user already has the 
requested new username.  Hence the username of the existing 
user could not be changed to the new username.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you entered the wrong username, reenter the command 
with the correct username.  If you entered the right 
username, use the SHOW USER command to display the database 
information for that user.  If you are not satisfied with 
that information, use the MODIFY USER command to change it.

<MSG>(USERMOD\information for user <EMPHASIS>(user) modified in the database )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that information for the indicated 
user has been modified in the VDE database.  This message 
is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the MODIFY 
USER command.

<MSG>(USERNOTDEL\user <EMPHASIS>(user) not deleted; you cannot delete yourself )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
This message informs you that the indicated user, namely 
you yourself, has not been deleted from the database.  
You are not allowed to delete yourself from the database.  
This prohibition prevents you from accidentally deleting 
yourself from the database, especially when using a 
wildcarded username specification.  There is thus no way 
to delete all users from the database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
If you want to delete yourself from the database, someone 
else with the required privilege must do it for you.

<MSG>(USERNOTFOUND\user <EMPHASIS>(user) not found in database; parameter ignored )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
The indicated username was entered on a SHOW USER 
command, but no such user was found in the VDE database.
<MSG_TEXT>(User Action)
This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
you that the indicated user does not exist in the database. 

<MSG>(USERNOTUAF\user <EMPHASIS>(user) not found in system User Authorization File )
<MSG_TEXT>(Facility)
VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment
<MSG_TEXT>(Explanation)
