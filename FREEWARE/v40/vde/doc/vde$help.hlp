 

1  VDE
   The VDE utility allows users to manage source code libraries and
   to build applications.
 

1  @
   Executes a VDE command procedure.

   Format

     @  file-name
 

2  Parameter
 

file-name

   Indicates the name of the file from which VDE commands should be
   read. If no file extension is specified, the file type is assumed
   to be .VDE.
 

2  Description
   A command procedure is a file containing a sequence of VDE
   commands. When the command procedure is executed, the commands
   in the file are processed in order as if each command had been
   entered individually from the terminal or workstation.

                         DCL COMMAND PROCEDURES

      If invoking VDE commands from within a DCL command
      procedure, do not use a VDE kept subprocess.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> @INFILE

     This example shows how to execute the VDE commands in the file
     INFILE.VDE in your default directory. As there was no file
     extension explicitly specified in the example command, VDE
     defaults the file extension to .VDE.

   2.VDE> @[MYDIR]MYFILE.TMP

     This example shows how to execute the VDE commands in file
     MYFILE.TMP in directory [MYDIR].
 

1  ACCEPT
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   Marks a queued replacement as accepted in the VDE database. You
   can only mark a replacement as accepted if you are a reviewer for
   that replacement.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     ACCEPT REPLACEMENT  rep-name [, rep-name...] ["remark"]
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of a queued replacement to be marked as accepted. You
   can accept more than one replacement at a time by using wildcard
   characters in the replacement name. The percent sign (%)  in a
   name matches any single character in the position it occupies and
   the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position
   it occupies. Those queued replacements whose names match the
   wildcard pattern are marked as accepted.
 

"remark"

   Specifies a one-line remark for the replacement. Typically this
   remark summarizes why the replacement is acceptable. Specifying
   the remark parameter is equivalent to specifying the /REMARK
   qualifier after the ACCEPT REPLACEMENT keywords.
 

3  Description
   The ACCEPT REPLACEMENT command is used during the (optional)
   code review process supported by VDE, and is the negation of the
   REJECT REPLACEMENT command.

   The ACCEPT REPLACEMENT command updates the VDE database to record
   that you have reviewed the code changes in a specified queued
   replacement and that you judge those changes to be acceptable
   for replacement into the VDE library-the replacement into the
   VDE library is performed with a subsequent PERFORM REPLACMENT
   command. You must be a reviewer for a replacement in order to
   issue to ACCEPT REPLACEMENT and mark the replacement as accepted.

   The ACCEPT REPLACEMENT command allows you to attach a comment
   file to the queued replacement. This file gives your comments to
   the author of the replacement and to the other reviewers. If you
   have already created such a file, use the /INPUT qualifier to
   copy it to the replacement's staging area. If you want to create
   such a file, use the /EDIT qualifier. This qualifier causes VDE
   to invoke your preferred editor to create a comment file for
   the replacement. If you have already created a comment file for
   the replacement with an earlier ACCEPT or REJECT command, the
   /EDIT qualifier lets you edit that file again. This capability is
   useful if you change your mind or want to add more information.

   If you wish to mark a replacement as not acceptable, use the
   REJECT REPLACEMENT command. If you wish to see the review status
   of a queued replacement, see the documentation on the SHOW
   REPLACEMENT command in SHOW REPLACEMENT.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   replacement accepted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each replacement asking whether you want to accept
   that replacement. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement
   is marked as accepted. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement
   status is not changed. If you enter a replacement name with a
   wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the acceptance of
   each replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification.
   The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to mark the specified
   replacements as accepted without asking for confirmation.
 

/EDIT

   Specifies that VDE should invoke your preferred editor so that
   you can edit your comment file for each queued replacement. If
   such a comment file already exists (due to a previous ACCEPT
   or REJECT REPLACEMENT command for the same replacement), the
   editor modifies that file. Otherwise, the editor creates a new
   file in the replacement's staging directory. Its file name is
   your OpenVMS username and its file type is VDE$COMMENT. The
   comment file typically contains comments for the author of the
   replacement and the other reviewers.

   This qualifier is ignored if you are running in batch mode.
 

/INPUT

      /INPUT=file-spec

   Specifies a comment file for the queued replacement. VDE reads
   the text file given by the file-spec parameter and writes its
   contents into a new file in the replacement's staging directory.
   The file name of the new file is your OpenVMS username and
   its file extension is VDE$COMMENT. The comment file typically
   contains remarks to the author of the replacement or information
   for the other reviewers.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement
   has been marked as accepted. The /LOG qualifier causes such
   messages to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them.
   These messages indicate that the replacement has been accepted
   and that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a one-line remark for the replacement. Typically this
   remark summarizes why the replacement is acceptable. For longer
   comments, you may create a comment file with the /INPUT or /EDIT
   qualifier.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that the replacement be marked as accepted on behalf
   of another user. The username parameter specifies the OpenVMS
   username of the other user. That user must be a reviewer for the
   specified replacement. You must have the USERNAME privilege to
   use this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> ACCEPT REPLACEMENT BROWN-3
     %VDE-I-REPACCEPT, replacement BROWN-3 marked as accepted in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example marks that the current user finds queued
     replacement BROWN-3 acceptable to be replaced into the VDE
     library.

   2.VDE> ACCEPT REPLACEMENT SMITH-1/INPUT=COMMENT_FILE.TXT
     %VDE-I-REPACCEPT, replacement SMITH-1 marked as accepted in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the user marks replacement SMITH-1 as accepted
     and provides a comment file that gives additional information
     to the user who queued the replacement.
 

1  ATTACH
   Transfers control from your current process to the specified
   process.

   Format

     ATTACH  process-name
 

2  Parameter
 

process-name

   Specifies the parent process or a spawned subprocess to which
   control is to be passed. The process must already exist, be
   part of your current job, and share the same input stream as
   your current process. However, the process cannot be the current
   process or a subprocess created with the /NOWAIT qualifier.

   Do not specify the process-name parameter if you use the
   /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.
 

2  Description
   The ATTACH command allows you to quickly transfer control between
   processes. (For information about creating a subprocess, see
   the SPAWN command.) For example, you can transfer control from
   a parent process to a subprocess using the ATTACH command. Then,
   in the subprocess, you can start a build job using VDE and, after
   you finish, you can enter the ATTACH command to move back to the
   parent process. If you later want to display the status of your
   build job, you can enter another ATTACH command at DCL level
   (or from many utilities) to move back to the VDE subprocess you
   created.

   Do not attempt to use the DCL ATTACH command to attach to a VDE
   kept subprocess.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=pid

   Specifies the process identification (PID) of the process to
   which terminal control is transferred. Leading zeros can be
   omitted. Do not specify the process-name parameter when you use
   this qualifier.
 

2  Examples

   1.$ EDIT VACATION.TXT
        .
        .
        .
<CTRL/Y>

     $ SPAWN VDE
     %DCL-S-SPAWNED, process SMITH_1 spawned
     %DCL-S-ATTACHED, terminal now attached to process SMITH_1
     VDE> BUILD GAME_PROG
     VDE> ATTACH SMITH
     %DCL-S-RETURNED, control returned to process SMITH
        .
        .
        .
<CTRL/Y>

     $ ATTACH SMITH_1
     VDE>

     This example shows how to spawn a subprocess (SMITH_1) to
     invoke VDE and use the ATTACH command to move between VDE
     (SMITH_1) and the DCL command level (SMITH). The ATTACH command
     allows you to transfer control between subprocesses.

                                  NOTE

      Use the SPAWN command to create a new process and the ATTACH
      command to connect to a process that already exists.
 

1  BUILD
   Creates and optionally starts a build job to build the specified
   modules. The discrete steps performed during the build are
   derived from VDE scripts.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     BUILD  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

2  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module or build group to be produced by the build
   job.

   If the parameter is a module name, it is typically the name of
   an executable image or another type of derived module that is the
   end result of a build operation. Each such module is a target of
   the build.

   The module name must consist of a module name and a module type
   separated by a period (as in MODNAM.EXE) and may optionally be
   preceded by a facility name enclosed in square brackets (for
   example, [FACIL]MODNAM.EXE). If no facility name is specified,
   the module is assumed to belong to the default facility.

   You can build more than one target module by using wildcard
   characters in any of the three components of the module name.
   The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in
   the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or
   more characters in the position it occupies. VDE builds those
   modules whose names match the wildcard pattern.

   If the mod-name parameter specifies a build group, the BUILD
   command builds all modules that are members of the build group.
   A build-group name is a simple name that has been declared with
   a CREATE GROUP/BUILD command. A build-group name may not contain
   wildcard characters.
 

2  Description
   The BUILD command performs two distinct operations: it creates a
   build job for the default development stream in the VDE database
   and it optionally starts that build job on a set of OpenVMS batch
   queues.

   Creating a Build Job

   To create a build job in the database, the BUILD command does the
   following three things:

   o  First, the BUILD command determines the target modules to
      be built. The target modules are specified by the mod-name
      parameters of the command.

   o  Next, the command determines the build steps that must be
      performed to build those target modules. The needed build
      steps are determined by the build dependencies stored in the
      VDE database, by the modules that have changed since the last
      time the targets were built, and by whether the user requests
      a full or minimal build.

   o  Finally, the BUILD command records information about the new
      build job in the database. The information specifies the build
      steps to be performed, any constraints on the order in which
      the steps are performed, and other attributes. (An example
      of an order constraint is the requirement that a compile step
      must complete before a dependent link step starts.)

   The build job is always created for the default development
   stream. It uses the build dependencies of the default stream
   to determine the build steps to perform and it uses module
   replacement data for the default stream to determine the modules
   that have changed since the last build. The build job is then
   identified by the stream name and a build-job identification
   number. For example, the second build job for stream V1.0 is
   labeled "build job 2 for stream V1.0" in VDE messages.

   You cannot create a new build job for a given stream if a build
   job already exists for that stream and that existing build job
   has not yet completed execution. This restriction ensures that
   two build jobs for the same stream do not execute at the same
   time. If you do not want the existing build job to run, stop it
   with the STOP BUILD_JOB command before creating the new build
   job.

   Starting a Build Job

   To start a build job, the BUILD command submits one or more batch
   jobs to the OpenVMS batch queues that the user specified either
   with the /QUEUE qualifier or by default. Then each batch job runs
   the VDE$BUILD utility that executes the build steps belonging
   to the build job. The steps are executed in a loop until all the
   steps are done. The VDE$BUILD utility does the following for each
   build step:

   o  The program looks in the database for the next available
      build step. (A build step, normally a compile, copy, or link
      step, is available if it is not waiting for another step to
      complete.) If no step is available, the program waits a few
      seconds before looking for another available build step.

   o  When the program finds a build step to run, it looks up the
      VDE script for that step and, from the script, generates the
      DCL commands needed to run the step. The program then sends
      the DCL commands to a subprocess that executes the build step,
      and waits for the step to complete.

   o  After the step completes, the program records the completion
      status of the step in the database. A step completes
      either successfully or with errors. If the step completes
      successfully, the program updates the step's build dependency
      information in the database and then looks for another step to
      perform.

   The BUILD command always creates a new build job in the VDE
   database. It also starts the build job unless you use the
   /NOSTART qualifier or you answer NO to a query asking whether
   to start the build. If the BUILD command does not start the build
   job, you can start it later with the START BUILD_JOB command.
   After the build job is created (whether or not you start it),
   you can use the SHOW BUILD_JOB command to display the attributes
   of the build, including the size of the build job and the exact
   build steps and build-step dependencies that make up the build
   job.

   You can distribute the build job across several processors
   (whether in a single machine or in multiple machines in a
   cluster) by specifying the /QUEUE and /PROCESS_COUNT qualifiers.
   The /QUEUE qualifier specifies the batch queues to run the build
   job. The /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier specifies the total number of
   processes VDE submits to the batch queues performing the build
   job. By specifying the batch queues and the number of processes
   VDE submits to each queue, you can decide how to distribute the
   build job over a cluster with processors of different speeds and
   configurations.

   If you do not specify the /QUEUE or /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier, VDE
   uses the default batch queues and process counts of the default
   development stream. You can establish these defaults using the
   /QUEUE and /PROCESS_COUNT qualifiers with the CREATE STREAM and
   MODIFY STREAM commands. If you have not specified such defaults,
   VDE submits one process to queue SYS$BATCH.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/AFTER

      /AFTER=date-time

   Indicates the date and time at which the build job begins
   execution. Specify the date and time using OpenVMS date-time
   syntax. Use this qualifier only if the BUILD command starts the
   build job: the qualifier specifies the start time for each batch
   job that is submitted to execute the build job.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the build
   job started. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a message
   asking whether you want to start the build job. This message
   is displayed after VDE creates the build job and displays a
   message stating the size of the job. If you answer YES (or Y),
   the build job is started. If you answer NO (or N), the build job
   is not started. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to start the
   build job without asking for confirmation. Neither qualifier
   has any effect if you use the /NOSTART qualifier: /NOSTART
   unconditionally prevents VDE from starting the build job.
 

/FULL

   Directs the BUILD command to perform a full build of your
   software system. In a full build, all source modules that
   contribute to the target modules you specified are compiled or
   otherwise processed. If you do not specify the /FULL qualifier,
   the BUILD command performs a minimal system build, which means
   that only the source modules that have changed since the last
   build of the specified target modules are compiled or processed.
   A minimal build is normally much quicker than a full build
   because it performs only the minimal work needed to propagate
   your source changes to the target modules.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the build job is
   created and submitted to batch queues for execution. The /LOG
   qualifier causes such messages to be printed and the /NOLOG
   qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate that the
   build job has been created, that the database transaction has
   successfully committed, and that batch jobs have been submitted
   to various batch queues to execute the build job.
 

/PROCESS_COUNT

      /PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count

   Specifies the number of processes to execute the build job.
   VDE creates the processes by submitting batch jobs to the
   queues specified by the /QUEUE qualifier or to the default
   queues for the default stream. The number of processes that VDE
   creates (that is, the number of OpenVMS batch jobs it submits)
   is specified by the proc-count parameter. As a result, this
   parameter determines the degree of parallelism for the build
   job.
 

/QUEUE

      /QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])

   Specifies the OpenVMS batch queues to which the build job is
   submitted. Each queue-name parameter specifies the name of one
   batch queue. The queue-name parameter may optionally be followed
   by a process count in parentheses. This count specifies the
   number of processes that are started on the queue to run the
   build job. For example, SYS$BATCH(3) causes three build-job
   processes to be submitted to queue SYS$BATCH. If the process
   count is omitted, one process is submitted to the queue.

   If you only specify one queue-name parameter, the parentheses may
   be omitted.

   If you also use the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier, the /PROCESS_COUNT
   qualifier states the total number of build-job processes to
   create. In that case, the process counts attached to the queue-
   name parameters on the /QUEUE qualifier are used as scaling
   factors to distribute build-job processes among the queues
   proportionally. For example, if you specify queues HI_BATCH, HO_
   BATCH(3) and a total process count of eight, then two processes
   are submitted to queue HI_BATCH and six processes to queue HO_
   BATCH. If the total process count does not divide evenly into the
   sum of the scaling factors, the remaining processes are allocated
   to the queues in the order the queues are listed. If the total
   process count is nine, for example, the one extra process is
   allocated to queue HI_BATCH because HI_BATCH is listed first.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the
   new build job. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   build job that you want to store in the database.
 

/START

      /START (default)
      /NOSTART

   Controls whether the build job is started or not. The /START
   qualifier starts the build job, which means that VDE submits
   batch jobs to the appropriate OpenVMS batch queues. These batch
   jobs run programs that execute all the build steps that make
   up the build job. The /NOSTART qualifier prevents VDE from
   submitting the batch jobs. If you use the /NOSTART qualifier, you
   can start the build job later with the START BUILD_JOB command.
 

/STEP_DELAY

      /STEP_DELAY=time-interval

   Specifies the step-delay time interval used by VDE$BUILD.
   VDE$BUILD is the program that executes the build steps belonging
   to a build job. If VDE$BUILD cannot find an available build step
   in the database, the program waits the amount of time specified
   by the /STEP_DELAY qualifier before it looks in the database
   again.

   When multiple processes run a build job, one process may be idle
   until a second process completes its current build step. In that
   situation, the first process periodically looks in the database
   to see if the second process has finished its step. The step-
   delay interval determines how often the first process looks in
   the database for an available step.

   Use the following syntax to denote the number of hours, minutes,
   and seconds in the interval:

   /STEP_DELAY=hh:mm:ss.ss

   For example, an interval of three and one half seconds is
   specified as follows:

     /STEP_DELAY=00:00:03.50

   Usually the interval is set at a few seconds. If this qualifier
   is not specified, VDE uses the default step-delay interval of the
   stream. If no default has been specified, the delay interval is
   five seconds.
 

/TIMEOUT

      /TIMEOUT=time-interval

   Specifies the timeout interval for the build job. If no build
   steps complete during this interval, the VDE$BUILD utility
   stops the build job and assigns it TIMEOUT status. Therefore,
   the timeout interval must be longer than the time required to
   complete the longest build step.

   Normally, a build job only times out if a node that is running
   one of the build-job processes fails. When a node fails, other
   build-job processes may be unable to proceed because they
   are waiting for a build step that ran on the failed node to
   complete, which will not happen. In that case, after the timeout
   interval expires, one of the waiting processes marks the build
   job as timed out, after which the remaining processes terminate
   themselves. You can later restart the build job using the START
   BUILD_JOB command.

   Use the following syntax to denote the number of hours, minutes,
   and seconds in the interval:

   /TIMEOUT=hh:mm:ss.ss

   For example, an interval of two and one half hours is specified
   as follows:

     /TIMEOUT=02:30:00.00

   The length of the timeout interval should be set based on the
   length of the longest build step in the build job. If this
   qualifier is not specified, VDE uses the default timeout interval
   of the stream. If no default has been specified, the timeout
   interval is one hour.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> BUILD FOO.EXE
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBCRE, build job 1 for stream BL22 has been created
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSIZ, build job 1 for stream BL22 consists of 5 steps
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTING, starting build job 1 for stream BL22
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 308 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue CLUSTER_BATCH, entry 308) started on PHI_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTED, build job 1 for stream BL22 started with 1 processes
     VDE>

     This example performs a minimal system build to build module
     FOO.EXE. The created build job is build job 1 for stream BL22.
     The build job consists of five build steps, such as compile
     and link steps. Because the /NOSTART qualifier is omitted,
     the build job is started on the default queue for the stream,
     SYS$BATCH. The build job runs on only one process.

   2.VDE> BUILD/FULL/NOSTART BLDGRP
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBCRE, build job 2 for stream BL22 has been created
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSIZ, build job 2 for stream BL22 consists of 125 steps
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, build job 2 for the default stream, BL22,
     is created. This is a full build (not a minimal build) that
     builds all modules that are members of build group BLDGRP. This
     build requires 125 build steps. The build job is not started
     because the /NOSTART qualifier is specified. (To start it
     later, use the START BUILD_JOB command.) Although the build job
     is not started, it exists in the database so you can display
     information about it using the SHOW BUILD_JOB command.

   3.VDE> BUILD/PROCESS_COUNT=3 *.EXE
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBCRE, build job 2 for stream V2.0-3 has been created
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSIZ, build job 2 for stream V2.0-3 consists of 25 steps
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTING, starting build job 2 for stream V2.0-3
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 317 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue CLUSTER_BATCH, entry 317) started on PHI_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 318 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue CLUSTER_BATCH, entry 318) started on FOO_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 319 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue CLUSTER_BATCH, entry 319) started on FUM_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTED, build job 2 for stream V2.0-3 started with 3 processes
     VDE>

     This example creates and starts a build job that builds all
     executable images for the default stream. It runs the build
     job with three parallel processes, all submitted to queue
     SYS$BATCH. The batch jobs execute on three separate batch
     queues, in this case on separate nodes in a cluster.

   4.VDE> BUILD/QUEUE=(PHI_BATCH,FOO_BATCH(2),FUM_BATCH) *.EXE
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBCRE, build job 3 for stream V2.0-3 has been created
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSIZ, build job 3 for stream V2.0-3 consists of 25 steps

        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue PHI_BATCH, entry 417) started on PHI_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 418 submitted to queue FOO_BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue FOO_BATCH, entry 418) started on FOO_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 419 submitted to queue FOO_BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue FOO_BATCH, entry 419) started on FOO_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 420 submitted to queue FUM_BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue FUM_BATCH, entry 420) started on FUM_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTED, build job 3 for stream V2.0-3 started with 4 processes
     VDE>

     Like the previous example, this example creates and starts a
     build job that builds all executable images. In this case, the
     /QUEUE qualifier specifies that four batch jobs are submitted:
     one to batch queue PHI_BATCH, two to queue FOO_BATCH, and one
     to queue FUM_BATCH. These queues belong to specific nodes in
     the cluster. As a result, the /QUEUE qualifier determines
     precisely how the build job is distributed across the nodes
     of the cluster.

   5.VDE> BUILD/CONFIRM FOO.EXE
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBCRE, build job 8 for stream BL22 has been created
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSIZ, build job 8 for stream BL22 consists of 2 steps
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     Start build job 8 for stream BL22 ? [No]: YES
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTING, starting build job 8 for stream BL22
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 79 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue CLUSTER_BATCH, entry 79) started on PHI_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTED, build job 8 for stream BL22 started with 1 processes
     VDE>

     The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to ask the user whether to
     start the new build job. VDE asks the question after creating
     the build job and after displaying its size (in this example,
     only two steps). The user answers YES and VDE starts one
     process for the build job on queue SYS$BATCH.
 

1  CANCEL
 

2  DIRECTORY
   Cancels a directory template in the VDE database. Directory
   templates determine what disk directories VDE creates when
   creating new development streams and facilities.

   Requires CRESTRM privilege.

   Format

     CANCEL DIRECTORY
 

3  Description
   The CANCEL DIRECTORY command deletes a "directory template"
   from the VDE database. Directory templates are defined with
   the SET DIRECTORY command and specify the names that VDE should
   assign to disk directories when creating directories for new
   development streams or facilities or for the library's queued-
   replacement staging area. The CANCEL DIRECTORY command can delete
   all templates that the SET DIRECTORY command can create. The
   CANCEL DIRECTORY command does not delete or otherwise affect
   existing disk directories, however.

   Unless the cancelled template is for the library's delta files
   or its staging area, it is only cancelled for the default
   development stream. Because directory templates are inherited
   by a stream's descendants, the CANCEL DIRECTORY command will
   affect the disk directories created for all future descendants
   of the default stream. It may also affect the directories created
   for new facilities in the default stream.

   When you have cancelled a directory template, VDE uses its
   default rules to create directory trees for subsequent streams
   and facilities. VDE always creates stream, facility, and delta-
   file root directories, whether there are templates for such
   directories or not. VDE does not create facility subdirectories
   unless there are templates for them, however, so if you cancel a
   subdirectory template, you prevent that subdirectory from being
   created for new streams or facilities.

   For additional information on directory creation, and on
   directory symbols (dir-symbol) and directory symbol processing,
   see SET DIRECTORY, SHOW DIRECTORY, and Script Functions.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/DELTA_FILES

   Specifies whether a directory template for delta files, the
   staging area, or the default stream is deleted. The /DELTA_
   FILES qualifier specifies that a directory template for the VDE
   library's delta files (CMS libraries) be deleted. The /STAGING
   qualifier specifies that the directory template for the library's
   staging-area root directory be deleted. (Staging areas hold files
   for queued replacements.) The /STREAM qualifier specifies that a
   directory template for the default stream be deleted.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
 

/STAGING

   Specifies whether a directory template for delta files, the
   staging area, or the default stream is deleted. The /DELTA_
   FILES qualifier specifies that a directory template for the VDE
   library's delta files (CMS libraries) be deleted. The /STAGING
   qualifier specifies that the directory template for the library's
   staging-area root directory be deleted. (Staging areas hold files
   for queued replacements.) The /STREAM qualifier specifies that a
   directory template for the default stream be deleted.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
 

/STREAM

   Specifies whether a directory template for delta files, the
   staging area, or the default stream is deleted. The /DELTA_
   FILES qualifier specifies that a directory template for the VDE
   library's delta files (CMS libraries) be deleted. The /STAGING
   qualifier specifies that the directory template for the library's
   staging-area root directory be deleted. (Staging areas hold files
   for queued replacements.) The /STREAM qualifier specifies that a
   directory template for the default stream be deleted.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
 

/FACILITY

      /FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that a directory template for the facility specified
   by the fac-name parameter be deleted. If both this qualifier
   and the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier are specified, VDE deletes the
   directory template for the specified facility subdirectory.
   If the /FACILITY qualifier is specified and the /SUBDIRECTORY
   qualifier is omitted, VDE deletes the directory template for the
   specified facility's root directory.

   If the /FACILITY qualifier is omitted and the /SUBDIRECTORY
   qualifier is specified, VDE deletes the directory template for
   the given facility subdirectory for all facilities that are not
   explicitly specified in other templates. If both the /FACILITY
   qualifier and the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier are omitted, VDE
   deletes the template for the stream or delta-file root directory.

   You can delete more than one directory template at a time by
   using wildcard characters in the fac-name parameter. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. Directory templates for those
   facilities whose names match the wildcard pattern are deleted.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the directory
   template is deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These
   messages indicate that the directory template has been deleted
   from the database and that the database transaction has completed
   successfully.
 

/SUBDIRECTORY

      /SUBDIRECTORY=dir-symbol

   Specifies that a directory template for a facility subdirectory
   be deleted. The dir-symbol parameter specifies the directory
   symbol that identifies the subdirectory. Among other uses, the
   directory symbol is used within VDE scripts; see Script Keywords
   for further details. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE deletes
   the directory template for a facility, stream, or delta-file root
   directory. (The description of the /FACILITY qualifier explains
   how the qualifiers interact to select the template to delete.)
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CANCEL DIRECTORY/FACILITY=RMS
     %VDE-I-DIRDEL, directory specification [MYDIR.RMS] deleted from database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example cancels the directory template for the root
     directory for facility RMS. The log messages show that the
     template was successfully deleted from the database.

   2.VDE> CANCEL DIRECTORY/SUBDIRECTORY=ANASYM
     %VDE-I-DIRDEL, directory specification [.ANA] deleted from database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example cancels the directory template for the
     subdirectory with directory symbol ANASYM. VDE deletes the
     subdirectory template that is used for all facilities that do
     not have explicit subdirectory templates.
 

2  FOLD
   Deletes one or more fold records from the VDE database. A fold
   record is a reminder that a source change should be manually
   "folded" into a given development stream in order to propagate
   the change.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     CANCEL FOLD  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module for which a fold record is to be deleted.
   The module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility
   name is omitted, the module is assumed to belong to the default
   facility. If the type name is omitted, VDE deletes fold records
   for all source modules with the specified module name in the
   given facility.

   You can delete fold records for more than one module by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   VDE deletes fold records for all source modules whose names match
   the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Description
   A fold record is a reminder that a source change should be
   manually folded into a given development stream in order to
   propagate the change into that stream. The CANCEL FOLD command
   deletes each specified fold record from the VDE database. This
   command is a synonym for the DELETE FOLD command.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   fold record deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each fold record asking whether you want that
   record deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that fold record
   is deleted from the database. If you answer NO (or N), the
   fold record is not deleted. If you enter a module name with a
   wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the deletion
   of fold records for each module whose name matches the wildcard
   specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the
   specified fold records without asking for confirmation.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=fold-ident

   Specifies the fold record to be deleted. This qualifier is
   required when you have multiple fold records for the same
   module in the same stream. The fold-ident parameter is the fold
   identifier of the fold record to be deleted. The fold identifier
   is the identifier you specified or VDE assigned when you created
   the fold record, usually a small integer value. Use the SHOW FOLD
   command to determine the fold identifier of each fold record.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each fold record
   has been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the fold record has been deleted and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the development stream for which fold records should be
   deleted. The stream-name parameter gives the name of the stream.
   If this qualifier is omitted, VDE deletes fold records for the
   default development stream only.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that fold records are to be deleted on behalf of
   another user. The username parameter specifies the OpenVMS
   username of the other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege
   to use this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CANCEL FOLD [CODE]X.FOR/IDENT=1
     %VDE-I-FOLDDEL, fold record 1 for module [CODE]X.FOR has been deleted
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example deletes fold record 1 for module [CODE]X.FOR. The
     log messages confirm that the fold record has been successfully
     deleted.
 

2  LOG
   Disables the recording of VDE input and output in a log file.
   Input and output logging is enabled using the SET LOG command.

   Format

     CANCEL LOG
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CANCEL LOG
     VDE> SHOW LOG
     No output logging
     VDE>

     The CANCEL LOG command disables input and output logging. The
     SHOW LOG command confirms that logging is disabled.
 

2  PRIVILEGES
   Disables VDE privileges for the current VDE session.

   Format

     CANCEL PRIVILEGES  priv [, priv...]
 

3  Parameter
 

priv

   The name of a VDE privilege to disable for the current VDE
   session.

   For a list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

3  Description
   The VDE privileges enabled for your current VDE session determine
   the VDE commands (and in some cases command qualifiers) you are
   allowed to use. Use the CANCEL PRIVILEGES command to disable
   privileges for the current VDE session. You may want to use the
   command to prevent accidental changes to the library database,
   for example.

   You can reestablish privileges using the SET PRIVILEGES command
   and you can display your current privileges using the SHOW
   PRIVILEGES command.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CANCEL PRIVILEGES FROZEN, USERNAME
     VDE> SHOW PRIVILEGES
     Currently set privileges:
           BUILD CREFAC CREGRP CREMOD CRESTEP RESREP
     VDE>

     The CANCEL PRIVILEGES command disables the FROZEN and USERNAME
     privileges. THE SHOW PRIVILEGES command confirms that those
     privileges are no longer set.
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   This command is the negation of the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.
   This command allows a project leader or other reviewer to cancel
   one or more accepted, queued replacements, and thus prevent these
   modules from being relocated into the VDE library via a PERFORM
   REPLACEMENT command.

   Requires RESREP privilege to cancel your own queued replacement.
   Requires PERFREP privilege to cancel another user's queued
   replacement.

   Format

     CANCEL REPLACEMENT  rep-name [, rep-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of a queued replacement to be cancelled. You can cancel
   more than one replacement at a time by using wildcard characters
   in the replacement name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches
   any single character in the position it occupies and the asterisk
   (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those queued replacements whose names match the wildcard pattern
   are cancelled.
 

3  Description
   The CANCEL REPLACEMENT command is used after the module(s) in
   the replacement have been replaced by a user and have been
   accepted through the (optional) code review process supported
   by VDE. Cancellation prevents these modules from being moved into
   the VDE library. This operation is the negation of the PERFORM
   REPLACEMENT command.

   The CANCEL REPLACEMENT command cancels each specified queued
   replacement so that the replacement is deleted from the VDE
   library and is no longer eligible to be performed by the PERFORM
   REPLACEMENT command.

   The modules belonging to the cancelled replacement will remain
   reserved to the user that originally reserved and replaced them,
   and that user can later REPLACE updated modules, or can UNRESERVE
   the modules to entirely cancel the outstanding reservation(s). If
   subsequently replaced, the modules will again have to be accepted
   (or rejected) by the reviewers.

   For information on how a queued replacement is accepted or
   rejected, see the ACCEPT REPLACEMENT and REJECT REPLACEMENT
   commands.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   replacement cancelled. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
   print a message for each replacement asking whether you want that
   replacement cancelled. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement
   is cancelled. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement is not
   cancelled. If you enter a replacement name with a wildcard
   specification, VDE asks you to confirm the cancellation of
   each replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification.
   The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to cancel the specified
   replacements without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement
   has been cancelled. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the replacement has been cancelled and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CANCEL REPLACEMENT SMITH-2
     %VDE-I-REPCAN, replacement SMITH-2 cancelled
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example cancels replacement SMITH-2 so that this
     replacement is no longer queued in the VDE database. The
     modules associated with the replacement are still reserved
     after the replacement is cancelled.
 

2  SESSION
   Cancels one or more reservation sessions by deleting them from
   the VDE database.

   Requires RESREP privilege to cancel your own session. Requires
   PERFREP privilege to cancel another user's session.

   Format

     CANCEL SESSION  session-name [, session-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

session-name

   The name of a reservation session to be cancelled. You can cancel
   more than one session at a time by using wildcard characters in
   the session name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any
   single character in the position it occupies and the asterisk
   (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those reservation sessions whose names match the wildcard pattern
   are cancelled.
 

3  Description
   The CANCEL SESSION command cancels each specified reservation
   session so that the session is deleted from the VDE database. The
   reservations that belonged to the session remain in the database,
   but no longer belong to the cancelled session.

   If you want to both delete a session and unreserve all modules
   associated with the session, use the UNRESERVE command with the
   /SESSION qualifier.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   session cancelled. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each session asking whether you want that session
   cancelled. If you answer YES (or Y), that session is cancelled.
   If you answer NO (or N), the session is not cancelled. If you
   enter a session name with a wildcard specification, VDE asks you
   to confirm the cancellation of each session whose name matches
   the wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE
   to cancel the specified sessions without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each session
   has been cancelled. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These
   messages indicate that the session has been cancelled and that
   the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CANCEL SESSION SMITH-3
     %VDE-I-SESCAN, session SMITH-3 cancelled
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example cancels reservation session SMITH-3 so that
     this session is no longer recorded in the VDE database. The
     modules associated with the session are still reserved after
     the session is cancelled.
 

2  VERIFY
   Cancels display of command input to the terminal.

   Format

     CANCEL VERIFY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The CANCEL VERIFY command disables the echoing of command input
   to the terminal. It cancels the effect of the SET VERIFY command.
   The CANCEL VERIFY command normally is used to disable the echoing
   of input commands from command procedures.

   The CANCEL VERIFY and SET NOVERIFY commands are equivalent.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET VERIFY
     VDE> SHOW MODULE MOD1.FOR
     SHOW MODULE MOD1.FOR
     Module [FACIL]MOD1.FOR
     VDE> CANCEL VERIFY
     CANCEL VERIFY
     VDE> SHOW FACILITY FACIL
     Facility FACIL
     VDE>

     The SET VERIFY command allows the terminal to display (echo)
     the command line it receives. The SHOW MODULE command is
     therefore echoed on the terminal before the output of the
     command is displayed. The CANCEL VERIFY command is also echoed
     but it disables the display of subsequent commands. The SHOW
     FACILITY command that follows is not displayed on the terminal
     but the output of the command is.
 

1  COMPILE
   Compiles the specified modules using the appropriate scripts from
   the database.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     COMPILE  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

2  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module to be compiled. The module name consists of
   an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module
   name, and an optional type name preceded by a period, such as
   [FACIL]MOD1.MAR. If no facility name is specified, the default
   facility is assumed. If no type name is specified, all source
   modules of the specified module name in the given facility are
   compiled.

   You can compile more than one module by using wildcard characters
   in any of the three components of the module name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. VDE compiles those modules whose
   names match the wildcard pattern.
 

2  Description
   The COMPILE command compiles a module the same way it is compiled
   in a build job. The COMPILE command retrieves the compile script
   for each specified module and generates a DCL command file from
   the script. The command then executes the command file in a
   subprocess. If the module compiles successfully, VDE updates
   the build dependency information for the compile step in the
   database.

   The COMPILE command can be used to compile a module without
   starting a build job. It is often used to test compile scripts.
   It can also be used to collect the initial dependency information
   for a compile step that does not yet have dependency information
   in the database.

   The COMPILE command only operates on modules that have a
   generation in the current stream (the default stream or the
   stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier). In addition, it
   only operates on source modules unless you specify the type
   name in the mod-name parameter without wildcard characters. In
   other words, unless you explicitly specify a derived-module file
   extension, the command assumes that you only want to compile
   source modules.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the compile step
   executes. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate
   that the compile step has completed, either successfully or with
   errors, and that the dependency information for the step has been
   updated in the VDE database.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the modules be compiled for the stream given by
   the stream-name parameter. If this qualifier is omitted, the
   modules are compiled for the default stream.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> COMPILE B.C
     $ DEFINE/NOLOG SRC$ DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.SRC]
     $ DEFINE/NOLOG OBJ$ DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.OBJ]
     $ VDE FETCH [CODE]B.C/OUTPUT=SRC$:
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]B.C;1(1) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.SRC]B.C;
     $ CC/ANA=OBJ$:/OBJECT=OBJ$:  SRC$:B.C
     $ VDE/DEPEND C OBJ$:B.ANA
     $ !
     $ SET NOVERIFY   ! Successful script completion
     %VDE-I-COMPSUCC, compilation of [CODE]B.C completed successfully
     %VDE-I-DEPUPDATE, dependency information updated for build step
     VDE>

     This example compiles module B.C in the default facility,
     facility CODE. The output from the execution of the compile
     script is displayed on the terminal. The final log messages
     show that the compile step completed successfully and that its
     dependency information was updated in the database.

   2.VDE> COMPILE [RMS]E.B32
     $ VDE FETCH [RMS]E.B32/OUTPUT=DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.RMS.SRC]
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [RMS]E.B32;3(2A1) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.RMS.SRC]E.B32;
     $ DEFINE/NOLOG SRC$ DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.RMS.SRC]
     $ DEFINE/NOLOG OBJ$ DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.RMS.OBJ]
     $ BLISS/OBJECT=OBJ$:/ANA=OBJ$:  SRC$:E.B32
     ;   0067  2         RETRUN;
     % WARN#000      ....1  L1:0067
       Undeclared name:  RETRUN
     %BLS32-W-ENDDIAGS, Compilation completed with 1 diagnostic
     $VDE$ERROR:
     $ SET NOVERIFY   ! Script completed with errors
     %VDE-I-COMPFAIL, compilation of [RMS]E.B32 completed with errors
     VDE>

     This example compiles module [RMS]E.B32 but the compilation
     terminates with errors. The output of the compile step includes
     error messages from the compiler, and the final log message
     shows that the step failed. In this case, VDE does not update
     the database dependency information.
 

1  CONVERT
 

2  LIBRARY
   Converts the current VDE library to the format required by the
   current version of VDE.

   Requires MODLIB privilege if automatic conversion is disabled.

   Format

     CONVERT LIBRARY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   When a new version of VDE is installed on your system, that new
   version frequently requires a different library format than
   the previous version. The new version may require a different
   database schema or new library subdirectories, for example.
   Because your existing VDE libraries are in the old library
   format, you must convert them to the new format. The CONVERT
   LIBRARY command performs this conversion.

   The VDE database in your library contains a "format version
   number" that tells VDE what format your library has. If the
   current version of VDE requires a more recent library format,
   the CONVERT LIBRARY command converts the library and its database
   to that more recent format. It then updates the format version
   number in the database.

   Once you have converted a VDE library to a more recent format,
   you can no longer use older versions of VDE on that library. If
   you want to retain the option of going back to an older version
   of VDE, you should back up your library and its database before
   your convert them.

   If you have specified the /AUTO_CONVERT qualifier with the
   CREATE or MODIFY LIBRARY command, VDE will automatically convert
   your library to the new format the first time a user accesses
   the library database using the new version of VDE. Automatic
   conversion is more convenient than using the CONVERT LIBRARY
   command, but does not give you the option of backing up the
   library before converting it. If you have specified the /NOAUTO_
   CONVERT qualifier with the CREATE or MODIFY LIBRARY command,
   you must convert the library with an explicit CONVERT LIBRARY
   command. See the descriptions of the CREATE LIBRARY and CONVERT
   LIBRARY commands for a full explanation.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CONVERT LIBRARY
     %VDE-I-LIBCONV, library format converted for new version of VDE
     VDE>

     This command converts the current library to the format
     required for the new version of VDE. The log message shows
     that the conversion successfully completed.
 

1  COPY
   Copies the specified modules using the appropriate scripts from
   the database.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     COPY  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

2  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module to be copied using a copy script. The module
   name consist of an optional facility name enclosed in square
   brackets, a module name, and an optional type name preceded by a
   period, such as [FACIL]MOD2.H. If no facility name is specified,
   the default facility is assumed. If no type name is specified,
   all modules of the specified module name in the given facility
   are copied.

   You can copy more than one module by using wildcard characters
   in any of the three components of the module name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. VDE copies those modules whose names
   match the wildcard pattern.
 

2  Description
   The COPY command copies a module the same way it is copied in
   a build job. The COPY command retrieves the copy script for
   each specified module and generates a DCL command file from
   the script. The command then executes the command file in a
   subprocess.

   A copy step moves a module into the directory or other location
   where other build steps later expect to find it. For example,
   copy steps move INCLUDE files from delta files into clear-copy
   files in the subdirectories where other build steps will later
   access them. Unlike a compile or link step, a copy step does not
   transform one set of modules into a different set of modules; it
   only copies a single module from one form or location to another.

   The COPY command can be used to perform a copy step without
   starting a build job. It is often used to test copy scripts.

   The COPY command only operates on modules that have a generation
   in the current stream (the default stream or the stream specified
   with the /STREAM qualifier). In addition, it only operates on
   source modules unless you specify the type name in the mod-name
   parameter without wildcard characters. In other words, unless you
   explicitly specify a derived-module file extension, the command
   assumes that you only want to copy source modules.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the copy step
   executes. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate
   that the copy step has completed, either successfully or with
   errors, and that the dependency information for the step has not
   been updated in the VDE database. (Copy steps do not normally
   update dependency information since the only input and output to
   the step is the module being copied.)
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the modules be copied for the stream given by the
   stream-name parameter. If this qualifier is omitted, the modules
   are copied for the default stream.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> COPY [CODE]A.REQ
     $ VDE FETCH [CODE]A.REQ/OUTPUT=DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.SRC]
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]A.REQ;1(1) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.SRC]A.REQ;
     $ !
     $ SET NOVERIFY   ! Successful script completion
     %VDE-I-COPYSUCC, copy of [CODE]A.REQ completed successfully
     %VDE-I-DEPNOTUPDATE, dependency information not updated for build step
     VDE>

     This example performs the copy action for module [CODE]A.REQ.
     The copy script fetches the latest generation for module
     A.REQ from its delta file and leaves it in clear-copy form
     in the [.SRC] subdirectory for facility CODE and the default
     development stream. There it is available to future compile
     steps. The output from the copy script is displayed on the
     terminal as shown. The final log messages show that the copy
     step completed successfully and that its dependency information
     was not updated in the database.
 

1  CREATE
 

2  ARCHITECTURE
   Defines one or more architecture table entries in the VDE
   database. Each architecture table entry...

   Requires the CREARCH privilege.

   ARCHITECTURE support is not fully implemented.

   An architecture is a construct that encompasses one or more
   facilities, and allows modules to exist in a "common" or
   "default" facility, and zero or more architecture specific
   facilities. In must the same fashion as the SYS$SYSROOT: logical
   name allows one to support both system-specific and cluster-
   common files, an architecture allows one to support architecture-
   specific and architecture-common modules.

   Format

     CREATE ARCHITECTURE  arch-name [, arch-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

arch-name

   The name of the architecture to be created. This name may be up
   to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.

/PUBLIC

   Under Construction...

   Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, the former is the default.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new architecture.
   The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters
   long, may contain any explanatory remark about the architecture.
   that you want stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark
   describes the function or purpose of the architecture.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE ARCHITECTURE VAXPDP/REMARK="Version n"
     VDE>

     Under Construction...
 

2  CONTEXT
   Defines one or more contexts in the VDE database. Each context
   can be used to specify the default development stream, default
   architecture and default facility for a VDE session, and one
   context can be used to set the default stream and facility when
   first connecting to a VDE database.

   Requires the CRECTX privilege to create public contexts.

   Format

     CREATE CONTEXT  ctx-name [, ctx-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

ctx-name

   The name of the context to be created. This name may be up to 39
   characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

3  Description
   A "context" specifies defaults for VDE sessions. When you create
   a context using the CREATE CONTEXT command, you specify the
   name of the context, the associated development stream, and the
   associated facility.

   To apply the defaults associated with a context, specify the
   context name as a parameter to the SET CONTEXT command. To set a
   particular context as the default context for use when you issue
   the SET LIBRARY command, use the SET CONTEXT/DEFAULT command to
   mark a particular context as the default context.

   There are two kinds of contexts available:

   o  the private context is available to and only visible to the
      user who created it.

   o  the public context is available to all users of the current
      VDE library.

   You do not need special VDE privileges to create a private
   context, but you must have the VDE CRECTX privilege to create
   a public context. While a private context can have the same name
   as a public context, neither two private contexts nor two public
   contexts can share the same name.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ARCHITECTURE

   Under Construction...
 

/FACILITY

      /FACILITY=facil-name
      /NOFACILITY

   The /FACILITY qualifier specifies the default facility for a
   context established with the SET CONTEXT command. The default
   facility is the facility that is assumed when the facility
   name is omitted from a module name. The /NOFACILITY qualifier
   specifies that the default facility established by the context is
   null. If you omit both qualifiers, the current default facility
   becomes the facility associated with the new context.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after a new context
   is created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that each new context has been created and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/PRIVATE

   Specifies whether a private or a public context is created. The
   /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to create a context that is private
   to you. The /PUBLIC qualifier causes VDE to create a context
   that is available to all users of the library. You must have the
   CRECTX privilege to use the /PUBLIC qualifier.

   Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, the former is the default.
 

/PUBLIC

   Specifies whether a private or a public context is created. The
   /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to create a context that is private
   to you. The /PUBLIC qualifier causes VDE to create a context
   that is available to all users of the library. You must have the
   CRECTX privilege to use the /PUBLIC qualifier.

   Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, the former is the default.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new context. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long,
   may contain any explanatory remark about the new context that you
   want stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark describes
   the function or purpose of the context.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name
      /NOSTREAM

   The /STREAM qualifier specifies that the indicated development
   stream becomes the default stream when the context is established
   with the SET CONTEXT command. The /NOSTREAM qualifier specifies
   that the default stream established by the context is null. If
   you omit both qualifiers, the current default stream becomes the
   stream associated with the new context.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE CONTEXT NEWCTX/STREAM=V2.0/FACILITY=RMS/REMARK="Version 2"
     %VDE-I-CTXADDED, context NEWCTX added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW CONTEXT NEWCTX
     Context NEWCTX (private to user SMITH)
        Default stream is V2.0
        Default facility is RMS

     VDE>

     This example creates a private context NEWCTX in which the
     default stream is V2.0 and the default facility is RMS. The
     SHOW CONTEXT command displays the context settings associated
     with the new context.

   2.VDE> CREATE CONTEXT PUBCTX/PUBLIC/STREAM=V3.3-2FT/FACILITY=RMS
     %VDE-I-CTXADDED, context PUBCTX added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the CREATE CONTEXT command creates a public
     context PUBCTX available to all users. When this context is
     specified on a SET CONTEXT command, the default stream is set
     to V3.3-2FT and the default facility is set to RMS.
 

2  DIRECTORY_TREE
   Creates the disk directory tree for the VDE library's delta
   files, for the default development stream, or for a specified
   facility.

   Requires CRESTRM privilege.

   Format

     CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE
 

3  Description
   The CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command creates the directory tree on
   disk for a VDE library's delta files, for a development stream,
   or for a facility. You use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command only
   if you deferred directory creation by using the /DEFER qualifier
   on a CREATE LIBRARY, CREATE STREAM, or CREATE FACILITY command.
   The /DEFER qualifier prevents these three commands from creating
   the disk directories they normally would create. You then have
   the opportunity to override the normal directory-creation rules
   within the SET DIRECTORY commands. After entering your SET
   DIRECTORY commands, you enter the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command
   to create disk directories according to the rules you specified
   with your SET DIRECTORY commands.

   Directories are created using the protection setting of the
   parent directory for the UIC group and world access, any
   applicable ACE entries from the parent directory, and allowing
   full system and owner access.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Determines how many log messages are displayed when VDE creates
   new disk directories. The /BRIEF qualifier only displays log
   messages for the stream or delta-file root directory and for
   each facility root directory. The /FULL qualifier displays
   a log message for every directory VDE creates, including all
   facility subdirectories. (The facility subdirectories are the
   most numerous directories.) These qualifiers have no effect if
   you use the /NOLOG qualifier.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines how many log messages are displayed when VDE creates
   new disk directories. The /BRIEF qualifier only displays log
   messages for the stream or delta-file root directory and for
   each facility root directory. The /FULL qualifier displays
   a log message for every directory VDE creates, including all
   facility subdirectories. (The facility subdirectories are the
   most numerous directories.) These qualifiers have no effect if
   you use the /NOLOG qualifier.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/DELTA_FILES

   Determines whether directories are created for the VDE library's
   delta files, for its staging areas, or for the default
   development stream. The /DELTA_FILES qualifier specifies that
   disk directories be created for the VDE library's delta files.
   These are the directories that hold CMS libraries. The /STAGING
   qualifier specifies that the root directory be created for the
   library's staging directories. Staging directories are temporary
   holding areas for files that are replaced into the library with
   queued replacements. The /STREAM qualifier specifies that disk
   directories be created for the default development stream.

   If you specify the /DELTA_FILES qualifier but not the /FROM_CMS_
   LIBRARY qualifier, VDE creates the CMS library for each facility
   affected by this command. If you specify the /STREAM qualifier,
   VDE runs the default stream's new-stream script for each facility
   affected by this command, provided such a script is defined.
   Depending on how it is defined, this script may populate the
   stream's facility-specific directories with source modules and
   other files.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
 

/STAGING

   Determines whether directories are created for the VDE library's
   delta files, for its staging areas, or for the default
   development stream. The /DELTA_FILES qualifier specifies that
   disk directories be created for the VDE library's delta files.
   These are the directories that hold CMS libraries. The /STAGING
   qualifier specifies that the root directory be created for the
   library's staging directories. Staging directories are temporary
   holding areas for files that are replaced into the library with
   queued replacements. The /STREAM qualifier specifies that disk
   directories be created for the default development stream.

   If you specify the /DELTA_FILES qualifier but not the /FROM_CMS_
   LIBRARY qualifier, VDE creates the CMS library for each facility
   affected by this command. If you specify the /STREAM qualifier,
   VDE runs the default stream's new-stream script for each facility
   affected by this command, provided such a script is defined.
   Depending on how it is defined, this script may populate the
   stream's facility-specific directories with source modules and
   other files.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
 

/STREAM

   Determines whether directories are created for the VDE library's
   delta files, for its staging areas, or for the default
   development stream. The /DELTA_FILES qualifier specifies that
   disk directories be created for the VDE library's delta files.
   These are the directories that hold CMS libraries. The /STAGING
   qualifier specifies that the root directory be created for the
   library's staging directories. Staging directories are temporary
   holding areas for files that are replaced into the library with
   queued replacements. The /STREAM qualifier specifies that disk
   directories be created for the default development stream.

   If you specify the /DELTA_FILES qualifier but not the /FROM_CMS_
   LIBRARY qualifier, VDE creates the CMS library for each facility
   affected by this command. If you specify the /STREAM qualifier,
   VDE runs the default stream's new-stream script for each facility
   affected by this command, provided such a script is defined.
   Depending on how it is defined, this script may populate the
   stream's facility-specific directories with source modules and
   other files.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, the latter is the default.
 

/FACILITY

      /FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that disk directories be created only for the facility
   specified by the fac-name parameter. If this qualifier is
   omitted, directories are created for all facilities, either for
   delta files or for the default stream.

   You can create directory trees for multiple facilities by using
   wildcard characters in the fac-name parameter. The percent sign
   (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position it
   occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in
   the position it occupies. VDE creates directory trees for those
   facilities whose names match the wildcard pattern.
 

/FROM_CMS_LIBRARY

      /FROM_CMS_LIBRARY[=date-time]

   Specifies that the delta-file root directory for each facility
   covered by the current CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command already
   contains a CMS library and that VDE should enter all modules
   and module generations present in that CMS library into the
   current VDE database. This qualifier, which VDE also accepts
   on the CREATE FACILITY command, gives you a way to automatically
   populate a VDE library with modules from an existing CMS library.

   If you specify the optional date-time parameter, VDE additionally
   retrieves all reservations from the CMS library that were created
   since the date and time given by that parameter. VDE prints
   warning messages for any reservations created earlier than this
   time and for any reservations whose stream (CMS class) cannot
   be ascertained. If you omit the date-time parameter, VDE does
   not retrieve reservations from the CMS library, only modules and
   generations.

   If this qualifier is omitted, VDE creates a new CMS library
   in each delta-file facility root directory it creates. This
   qualifier has no effect unless you also use the /DELTA_FILES
   qualifier.

   If this qualifer is specified, all VDE streams must be created
   prior to issuing this command, and these stream names must match
   (a subset of) the CMS class names in use in the CMS libraries;
   these stream names must match the CMS classes to be uploaded
   from within the CMS library. In order to correctly establish the
   main and variant lines of descent and the correct CMS generation
   number sequence, all streams involved must be created with the
   appropriate /MAIN, /NOMAIN, /PARENT and /SUCCESSOR settings.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed when disk directories
   are created. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate the names of the disk directories that VDE creates. The
   /BRIEF and /FULL qualifiers control how many log messages are
   printed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE LIBRARY/DEFER
     Enter the name you want for the new library: LIBNAME
     Enter directory specification for the new library: [PROJDIR]
     Enter your full name (first and last names): Zrebhasha Fulkutznodoy
     Enter the remark for new library: Library for the mumble project
     Library LIBNAME to be created in root directory [PROJDIR]
        Library root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR] has been created.
        Logical name VDE$LIBRARY now points to the new library.
        Creating library database; please wait...
        Library database has been created.

     Library creation completed.

     VDE> SHOW LOCATION
     Directory locations for stream MAIN:
        Stream root directory is not recorded in database

     VDE> SHOW LOCATION/DELTA_FILES
     Directory locations for delta files:
        Delta-file root directory is not recorded in database

     In this example, the /DEFER qualifier to the CREATE LIBRARY
     command prevents disk directories from being created for
     the library's delta files and its default stream MAIN. The
     CREATE LIBRARY command only creates the library root directory
     DEV$:[PROJDIR], where it also creates the VDE database. The
     SHOW LOCATION commands confirm that no other directories are
     recorded in the VDE database.

   2.VDE> SET DIRECTORY/DELTA_FILES [PROJDIR]
     %VDE-I-DIRADDED, directory specification [PROJDIR] added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SET DIRECTORY/STREAM DISK2:[MAIN_DIR]
     %VDE-I-DIRADDED, directory specification DISK2:[MAIN_DIR] added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>


     A SET DIRECTORY command then specifies that the root directory
     for the library's delta files (its CMS libraries) should be
     directory [PROJDIR]. The normal rule used within VDE is to make
     directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.VDE$CMS] the delta-file root directory
     and to make subdirectories within that directory contain the
     CMS libraries for individual facilities. A second SET DIRECTORY
     command specifies that the root directory for stream MAIN is
     directory DISK2:[MAIN_DIR]. VDE typically makes the directory
     DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN] the root directory for stream MAIN. In this
     case, the user wants stream MAIN's whole directory tree on a
     separate disk.

     This sequence sets up the library for the following commands:

   3.VDE> CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE/DELTA_FILES
     Creating directory tree for delta files:
        Root directory WORK4:[PROJDIR] already exists

     VDE> SHOW LOCATION/STREAM
     Directory locations for stream MAIN:
        Stream root directory: DISK2:[MAIN_DIR]
           Subdirectory:   DISK2:[MAIN_DIR.VDE$BLD] (symbol VDE$BLD)

        Directory locations for facility CODE:
           Root directory: DISK2:[MAIN_DIR.CODE]
           Subdirectory:   DISK2:[MAIN_DIR.CODE.OBJ] (symbol OBJ)
           Subdirectory:   DISK2:[MAIN_DIR.CODE.SRC] (symbol SRC)
           Subdirectory:   DISK2:[MAIN_DIR.CODE.VDE$COM] (symbol VDE$COM)
           Subdirectory:   DISK2:[MAIN_DIR.CODE.VDE$LOG] (symbol VDE$LOG)

     VDE>

     This section shows the results of two CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE
     commands. The first one creates the directory tree for the
     library's delta files and create the CMS library for facility
     CODE in that directory tree. The second command creates the
     directory tree for stream MAIN. As the log messages show, the
     directory tree begins with root directory DISK2:[MAIN_DIR]
     as requested. The subsequent SHOW LOCATION commands confirm
     that all disk directories have been created in the desired
     locations.

   4.VDE> CREATE FACILITY/DEFER NEWFACIL
     Please supply required information for facility NEWFACIL:
     Enter a remark for the new facility: New facility

        All directories for stream MAIN now exist

     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the CREATE FACILITY command creates a new
     facility NEWFACIL, but defers the creation of disk directories
     for that facility. A SET DIRECTORY command then specifies that
     directory [PROJDIR.NEW] should be the facility root directory
     for the default stream MAIN. Two CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE commands
     follow. The first one creates the delta-file root directory
     and CMS library for the facility. The second one creates
     the default stream's directory tree for the facility. This
     directory tree consists of a facility root directory and four
     facility subdirectories. The /FULL qualifier causes VDE to
     prints log messages for all directories it creates for the
     facility; without this qualifier, VDE omits the subdirectory
     log messages.

   5.VDE> CREATE STREAM V2.0/DEFER

     VDE> SET DIRECTORY/STREAM [PROJDIR.VER_2]
     %VDE-I-DIRADDED, directory specification [PROJDIR.VER_2] added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE/STREAM
     Creating directory tree for stream V2.0:
        Root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.VER_2] has been created
        Facility CODE root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.VER_2.CODE] has been created
        Facility SPEC root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.VER_2.SPEC] has been created
        Facility TOOL root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.VER_2.TOOL] has been created
        All directories for stream V2.0 now exist

     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     The CREATE STREAM command creates a new stream called V2.0,
     but defers creating the disk directory tree for that stream.
     The SET STREAM command makes V2.0 the default stream, and the
     SHOW LOCATION command shows that no directories are recorded
     in the VDE database for that stream. The SET DIRECTORY command
     specifies that directory [PROJDIR.VER_2] should be the root
     directory for the stream. The CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command
     creates the full directory tree for stream V2.0. This directory
     tree includes the stream root directory specified by the SET
     DIRECTORY command, a facility root directory for each facility
     in the system, and several facility subdirectories for each
     facility. Because the /FULL qualifier is not specified, VDE
     only prints log messages for the stream and facility root
     directories, and not for the facility subdirectories.
 

2  FACILITY
   Creates a new facility definition and its associated disk
   directories in the current VDE library.

   Requires CREFAC privilege.

   Format

     CREATE FACILITY  facil-name [, facil-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

facil-name

   The name of the new facility to be created. This name can be up
   to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.

   VDE prohibits the creation of any facilities with names that
   begin with the character sequences "VDE$", "VSC$", and "VTSC$",
   as these prefixes are used within VDE.
 

3  Description
   A facility is the highest level of organization in a VDE library
   and identifies a set of related modules. For example, the RMS
   facility is composed of all the modules needed to build the
   Record Management Services portion of the OpenVMS operating
   system.

   All modules within a given facility must have unique names; no
   two modules in the same facility can have the same module name
   and module type. If, however, two modules belong to different
   facilities, they can have the same module name and type.

   The VDE library stores modules from separate facilities in
   separate disk directories. Therefore, you may want to create a
   separate facility for each component of your software system that
   is developed independently.

   When you create a facility, the CREATE FACILITY command first
   creates an entry for the new facility in the VDE database. It
   then creates a disk directory to hold the delta files of the
   facility's source modules. VDE uses callable CMS to create a CMS
   library in that directory. When you later create source modules
   in the facility, VDE uses callable CMS to create delta files
   for those modules. A delta file (which is identical to a CMS
   "element") contains all past and present versions of your source
   file in a compressed form.

   The CREATE FACILITY command also creates a disk directory
   structure (directory tree) for the new facility for the default
   stream. This directory structure is repeated for all streams that
   are successors of the default stream. These directories will hold
   all files associated with the facility that are stream-specific.
   Such files include clear-copy source files, object files, object
   libraries, executable images, and other derived files. For each
   stream, this structure consists of the following directories:

   o  a facility root directory, which is a subdirectory of the
      stream root directory

   o  several facility subdirectories that will contain source
      files, derived files, build log files, and certain other kinds
      of files. The subdirectories that are created depend on the
      SET DIRECTORY commands you have used as well as VDE defaults.

   If the default disk directory structure is not suitable for the
   new facility, you can defer its creation until you have defined
   the structure you want. To defer creation of the directory
   structure, use the /DEFER qualifier. Then use the SET DIRECTORY
   command to define the directory structure you want. Finally, use
   the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create the desired directory
   structure.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/DEFER

      /DEFER
      /NODEFER (default)

   Specifies whether the creation of the disk directory structure
   for the new facility should be postponed. The /DEFER qualifier
   postpones creation of the disk directory structure and the
   /NODEFER qualifier causes the directory structure to be created
   immediately. Use the /DEFER qualifier when the default directory
   structure is inappropriate for the new facility.

   If the /NODEFER qualifier is specified (or /DEFER is omitted),
   the CREATE FACILITY command first creates the delta-file
   directory for the facility and creates a CMS library within
   that directory. It then creates the facility root directory for
   the default stream. Next it creates the facility subdirectories
   within that root directory. The subdirectories that are created
   are determined by the SET DIRECTORY commands entered for the
   stream and by the default rules of the VDE utility. Once the
   directory structure exists, source modules and other files can
   be added to the new facility. The directory-creation sequence is
   repeated for all successors of the default stream.

   If the /DEFER qualifier is specified, the CREATE FACILITY command
   does not create the delta-file directory, nor the stream-specific
   root directories, nor the associated subdirectories. You can
   therefore enter SET DIRECTORY commands to specify the disk
   directories you want created for the facility. You then use the
   CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create the directory structure
   on disk according to the rules specified by the SET DIRECTORY
   commands and VDE defaults.
 

/DELETE

      /DELETE
      /NODELETE

   Controls whether the delete attribute is set for the new
   facility. This attribute allows the facility to be deleted with
   the DELETE FACILITY command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the
   delete attribute so that the new facility can be deleted. The
   /NODELETE qualifier clears the delete attribute so that the new
   facility cannot be deleted unless you first reset this attribute
   with a MODIFY FACILITY command. Marking a facility as /NODELETE
   makes it harder to accidentally delete the facility.

   If this qualifier is not specified, VDE uses the value of the
   allow-deletion library attribute. The library allow-deletion
   default attribute can be set or reset by using the /ALLOW_DELETE
   qualifier on the CREATE LIBRARY or on the MODIFY LIBRARY command.
 

/FROM_CMS_LIBRARY

      /FROM_CMS_LIBRARY[=date-time]

   Specifies that the delta-file root directory for the new facility
   already contains a CMS library and that VDE should enter all
   modules and module generations present in that CMS library
   into the current VDE database. This qualifier gives you a way
   to automatically populate a VDE library with modules from an
   existing CMS library. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE creates a
   new CMS library in the facility's delta-file root directory.

   If you specify the optional date-time parameter, VDE additionally
   retrieves all reservations from the CMS library that were created
   since the date and time given by that parameter. VDE prints
   warning messages for any reservations created earlier than this
   time and for any reservations whose stream (CMS class) cannot
   be ascertained. If you omit the date-time parameter, VDE does
   not retrieve reservations from the CMS library, only modules and
   generations.

   This qualifier has no effect if you also specify the /DEFER
   qualifier. If you defer directory creation, you must use the
   /FROM_CMS_LIBRARY qualifier on the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command
   that actually creates the delta-file directories for the new
   facility.

   If this qualifer is specified, all VDE streams must be created
   prior to issuing this command, and these stream names must match
   (a subset of) the CMS class names in use in the CMS libraries;
   these stream names must match the CMS classes to be uploaded
   from within the CMS library. In order to correctly establish the
   main and variant lines of descent and the correct CMS generation
   number sequence, all streams involved must be created with the
   appropriate /MAIN, /NOMAIN, /PARENT and /SUCCESSOR settings.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the new
   facilities are created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The
   messages indicate that each new facility has been created, that
   its CMS library has been created, that its disk directories have
   been created, and that the database transaction has successfully
   committed.
 

/PROPAGATE

      /PROPAGATE (default)
      /NOPROPAGATE

   Specifies whether automatic change propagation is allowed by
   default for new modules created in this facility. /PROPAGATE
   causes new modules added to the facility to be marked as
   allowing automatic change propagation when reserved and
   replaced. /NOPROPAGATE marks such modules as not allowing change
   propagation. When you create new modules, you can override these
   defaults with qualifiers to the CREATE MODULE command.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new facility. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the new facility that you
   want stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark describes
   the function or contents of the facility.

   Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE FACILITY ACCTNG /REMARK="Accounting function"
     Creating directory tree for delta files:
        Facility ACCTNG root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.VDE$CMS.ACCTNG] has been created
           CMS library for facility ACCTNG has been created
        All directories for delta files now exist

     Creating directory tree for stream MAIN:
        Facility ACCTNG root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.ACCTNG] has been created
           Subdirectory DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.ACCTNG.OBJ] has been created
           Subdirectory DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.ACCTNG.SRC] has been created
           Subdirectory DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.ACCTNG.VDE$COM] has been created
           Subdirectory DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.ACCTNG.VDE$LOG] has been created
        All directories for stream MAIN now exist

     %VDE-I-FACADDED, facility ACCTNG added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example creates a new facility called ACCTNG. The remark
     string indicates that this facility performs an accounting
     function in the user's software system. The log messages
     indicate that the delta-file disk directory has been created,
     that a CMS library has been established in that directory, that
     a facility root directory and various facility subdirectories
     have been created for stream MAIN, and that the facility was
     successfully added to the database.
 

2  FOLD
   Creates a new fold record in the VDE database. A fold record is a
   reminder that a source change should be manually "folded" into a
   given development stream in order to propagate the change.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     CREATE FOLD  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module for which a fold record is to be created.
   The module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility
   name is omitted, the module is assumed to belong to the default
   facility. If the type name is omitted, VDE creates fold records
   for all source modules with the specified module name in the
   given facility.

   You can create fold records for more than one module by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   VDE creates fold records for the source modules whose names match
   the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Description
   A fold record is a record in the VDE database that reminds a
   user to manually "fold" a source change from one development
   stream into another. A fold record is created when the REPLACE or
   PERFORM REPLACEMENT command attempts to propagate a source change
   from a given development stream to one of its successors, but
   finds that it cannot automatically propagate the change because
   the source module has already diverged between the two streams.
   The user must then reserve the module in the successor stream,
   manually edit the change into that generation of the module,
   and then replace it. This operation is known as "folding" the
   change into the successor stream. Once the fold operation has
   been performed, its fold record should be deleted from the VDE
   database with the /FOLD qualifier to the REPLACE command or with
   the CANCEL FOLD command.

   The CREATE FOLD command lets you manually enter a fold record
   into the VDE database. This fold record and its remark string can
   serve as a reminder to perform some action on a specified module
   in a specified stream. Once you have performed this action, you
   can delete the fold record with the CANCEL FOLD command. The new
   fold record records that some change should be propagated from
   the latest generation of the specified module in the default
   development stream into another development stream that you
   specify.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want a fold
   record created for each module. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes
   VDE to print a message for each module asking whether you want
   to create a fold record for that module. If you answer YES (or
   Y), VDE creates a fold record for it. If you answer NO (or N),
   VDE does not create a fold record for it. If you enter a module
   name with a wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the
   creation of a fold record for each module whose name matches the
   wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
   create the fold records without asking for confirmation.
 

/FROM_STREAM

      /FROM_STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the development stream from which the source change
   should be folded. The stream-name parameter gives the name of
   the stream. If you omit this qualifier, VDE determines what
   generation you want to fold by looking up the latest generation
   for the current default stream. VDE then records that you want
   to fold the change from the stream in which that generation was
   created.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=fold-ident

   Specifies a fold identifier for the new fold record. Each fold
   record has a unique fold identifier so that you can distinguish
   between multiple fold records for the same module and user in
   the same stream. By default, the CREATE FOLD command assigns a
   unique numeric identifier to each fold record, such as "1", "2",
   and so on. The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier overrides this default
   and allows you to select a fold identifier of your choice, such
   as a mnemonic name. The fold-ident parameter specifies the fold
   identifier. It can be up to 39 characters long and must follow
   VDE name syntax.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed when the new fold
   records are created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to
   be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages
   indicate that a fold record has been created for each specified
   module and that the database transaction has successfully
   committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for each new fold record.
   The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long,
   may contain any explanatory remark about the fold to be performed
   that you want stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark
   describes the function or contents of the source change to be
   folded into the new stream.

   Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the development stream into which the source change
   should be folded. The stream-name parameter gives the name of the
   stream. This qualifier is required; if you do not specify it, VDE
   prompts you for the stream name.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that the fold record be created on behalf of another
   user. The username parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of
   the other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege to use this
   qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE FOLD X.FOR/STREAM=V1.0/REMARK="Fix access violation in sort routine"
     %VDE-I-FOLDADDED, fold record 1 for module [CODE]X.FOR added to database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> SHOW FOLD
     Fold 1 of [CODE]X.FOR;2(2) into stream V1.0            26-JUN-1990 JONES
     VDE>

     This example creates a new fold record for module [CODE]X.FOR.
     The remark indicates that a sort routine access violation
     should be fixed in that module. The change should be made in
     stream V1.0. The log message shows that VDE assigned the unique
     fold identifier 1 to the new fold record. The SHOW FOLD command
     shows that the fold record is now in the VDE database.
 

2  GROUP
   Creates a new group definition in the VDE database. A group is
   either a source group or a build group. A source group consists
   of a set of source modules to be acted upon when the group name
   is specified with various source control commands. A build group
   consists of a set of modules to be built when the group name is
   specified with a BUILD command.

   Requires CREGRP privilege.

   Format

     CREATE GROUP  group-name = mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameters
 

group-name

   The name of the new group to be created. This name may be up to
   39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

mod-name

   The name of a module to be included in the group. The module
   name consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square
   brackets, a module name, and an optional type name preceded by
   a period. An example is [FACIL]MOD1.PAS. If no facility name is
   specified, the current default facility is assumed. If no type
   name is specified, all source modules (for a source group) or
   all module (for a build group) with the given module name in the
   given facility are included in the group.

   You can add many modules to the group with one mod-name parameter
   by specifying wildcard characters in any of the three components
   of the module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any
   single character in the position it occupies and the asterisk
   (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those source modules (for a source group) or modules (for a build
   group) whose names match the wildcard pattern become members of
   the new group.
 

3  Description
   A group consists of the set of modules that are members of the
   group. A source group only consists of source modules. When the
   name of a source group is specified with the RESERVE, REPLACE,
   FETCH, UNRESERVE, or SHOW RESERVATION command, that command acts
   on all modules that are members of the group. A build group can
   consists of both source modules and derived modules, although it
   normally only consists of executable images and other derived
   modules that can be the outputs of a system build. When the
   name of a build group is specified with the BUILD command, that
   command builds all modules that are members of the group.

   When a new group is created, it is only defined in the default
   development stream. You can refer to the new group only from
   within the stream to which it belongs.

   When you want to create the same group for more than one
   development stream, you must use the CREATE GROUP command for
   each stream. For each stream, first enter the SET STREAM command
   to set the development stream, then enter the CREATE GROUP
   command to create the desired group within the stream.

   When a new development stream is created, all group definitions
   from the parent stream are copied to the child stream. If
   modified, the group definitions then evolve independently in
   the two development streams.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BUILD

   Specifies whether a source group or build group is created. The
   /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to create a source group and the
   /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to create a build group. If neither
   qualifier is specified, VDE creates a source group.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/SOURCE

   Specifies whether a source group or build group is created. The
   /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to create a source group and the
   /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to create a build group. If neither
   qualifier is specified, VDE creates a source group.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   module matching the mod-name parameters added to the group.
   The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a message for each
   matching module asking whether you want that module added. If
   you answer YES (or Y), the module is added to the group. If
   you answer NO (or N), the module is not added to the group. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to add all modules matching the
   mod-name parameters to the group without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the new group
   has been created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to
   be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The
   messages indicate that the new group has been created, that the
   requested modules are members of the group, and that the database
   transaction has committed successfully.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new group. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the new group that you want
   stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark describes the
   purpose or contents of the group.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE GROUP/REMARK="Two modules" GRP1 = A.PAS, B.MAR
     %VDE-I-GRPADDED, group GRP1 added to the database
     %VDE-I-GRPADD, module [CODE]A.PAS is added to group GRP1
     %VDE-I-GRPADD, module [CODE]B.MAR is added to group GRP1
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command creates a new source group called GRP1. The new
     group contains two members, source modules A.PAS and B.MAR.
     These modules are reserved if the group name is specified with
     the RESERVE command, for example. Both modules are assumed
     to belong to the current default facility, facility CODE in
     this example. The remark string "Two modules" is stored in
     the database with the rest of the group definition and can
     be retrieved later with the SHOW GROUP command. The example
     shows the informational messages created by the /LOG qualifier,
     specified by default in this example.

   2.VDE> CREATE GROUP/BUILD SYSGRP = X.EXE, Y.EXE, Z.HLB
     %VDE-I-GRPADDED, group SYSGRP added to the database
     %VDE-I-GRPADD, module [BUILD_TEST]X.EXE is added to group SYSGRP
     %VDE-I-GRPADD, module [BUILD_TEST]Y.EXE is added to group SYSGRP
     %VDE-I-GRPADD, module [BUILD_TEST]Z.HLB is added to group SYSGRP
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command creates a new build group called SYSGRP. The build
     group contains three members, executable images X.EXE and Y.EXE
     and the help library Z.HLB. If group name SYSGRP is specified
     as a parameter to a BUILD command, VDE will build these three
     modules.
 

2  LIBRARY
   Creates a new VDE library, including its database and disk
   directory structure.

   Format

     CREATE LIBRARY  dir-spec
 

3  Parameter
 

dir-spec

   Specifies the name of the root directory of the library. The root
   directory is the disk directory that contains the database of the
   library. It normally also contains subdirectories that hold the
   contents of the library. Use the OpenVMS directory specification
   format to specify the dir-spec parameter.

   This parameter is required. If not specified, VDE prompts you for
   the name of the root directory.
 

3  Description
   A VDE library is the repository for all the modules in your
   software system. A library consists of a top-level disk directory
   called the root directory, an Rdb database which resides in the
   root directory, and a number of directories (or subdirectories)
   which contain all the source modules, derived modules, and other
   components of your software system.

   The CREATE LIBRARY command first creates a root directory for
   the new library and defines logical name VDE$LIBRARY to contain
   the name of this directory. It then creates and initializes a
   VDE database in the root directory. The CREATE LIBRARY command
   normally also creates the disk directory structure that will hold
   all sources and other files that make up your software system.
   However, if the default directory structure is not appropriate
   for you, you can use the /DEFER qualifier to postpone directory
   creation until you have specified the directory structure that
   you want.

   The VDE database is a multifile Rdb database. This database
   consists of three separate files: an Rdb root file (the .RDB
   file), a storage area file (the .RDA file), and a snapshot
   file (the .SNP file). The .RDB file is always stored in the VDE
   library's root directory. This file is relatively small. The .RDA
   file stores the bulk of the database contents and the .SNP file
   allows multiple users to use the database concurrently. The .RDA
   and .SNP files are stored in the VDE library's root directory
   by default, but you can specify different directory locations
   for these files with the /DATABASE and /SNAPSHOT qualifiers, or
   by defining the logical names VDE$DB_AREA and VDE$SNAPSHOT. By
   placing these files on different disks, you can distribute your
   VDE library's space and I/O requirements across multiple disks.

   You may also want to establish an Rdb after-image journal file
   for the VDE database. If used with the RMU database backup
   facility, such a journal file allows Rdb to recover all database
   data as of the last completed transaction after a disk failure.
   To establish journalling, use the /JOURNAL qualifier to specify
   the directory location of the journal file. This directory should
   always be on a different physical disk than the rest of your VDE
   database.

   Once you have created a new VDE library, that library becomes the
   current VDE library for your present process so that subsequent
   VDE commands act upon that library. To change the current VDE
   library, you must use the SET LIBRARY command or redefine logical
   name VDE$LIBRARY to point to the root directory of the VDE
   library you want to work with.

   Most steps in creating a new VDE library are reasonably fast. For
   example, each directory in your directory structure is created
   in a fraction of a second unless your system is heavily loaded.
   However, VDE requires several minutes to create and initialize
   the library database. The database can usually be created in
   about six to eight minutes but more time may be required on a
   heavily loaded system. A log message tells you when database
   creation starts.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALLOW_DELETE

      /ALLOW_DELETE (default)
      /NOALLOW_DELETE

   Specifies the default value for the delete attribute for new
   modules, facilities, and streams. The /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier
   causes VDE to set the delete attribute by default when users
   create new such entities. As a result, users can delete these
   entities without first having to set the delete attribute with
   a separate MODIFY command. The /NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier causes
   VDE to clear the delete attribute by default for new modules,
   facilities, and streams. As a result, it is harder for a user
   to delete an entity by mistake; the entity's delete attribute
   must be set with a separate MODIFY command before the entity
   can be deleted with a DELETE command. When creating new modules,
   facilities, and streams, you can override this default setting
   with an explicit /DELETE or /NODELETE qualifier to the CREATE
   command.

   Use the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you expect to make frequent
   changes to your library, often deleting modules, facilities,
   and streams. Use the /NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you are more
   concerned about preventing accidental deletion of such entities.
 

/ASK_INFO_FILE

      /ASK_INFO_FILE
      /NOASK_INFO_FILE (default)

   Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the
   user whether he or she wants to edit an information file when
   creating a queued replacement. The /ASK_INFO_FILE qualifier
   sets a library attribute that causes the REPLACE command to
   ask for an information file by default. The /NOASK_INFO_FILE
   qualifier clears this library attribute so that the REPLACE
   command does not ask for an information file by default. This
   library attribute only affects queued replacements (not immediate
   replacements), and it only affects the REPLACE command's default
   behavior; users can always use the command's /INFORMATION or
   /NOINFORMATION qualifier to explicitly request either behavior.
 

/ASK_REPL_CAUSE

      /ASK_REPL_CAUSE
      /NOASK_REPL_CAUSE (default)

   Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the
   user for the "cause" of the replacement. The cause may be a fold
   operation, a Source Control Tracking (SCT) entry in a Notes
   conference, or some other cause. The /ASK_REPL_CAUSE qualifier
   sets a library attribute that causes the REPLACE command to
   query the user for the cause of the replacement. The /NOASK_
   REPL_CAUSE qualifier clears this library attribute so that the
   REPLACE command does not ask for this information.
 

/AUTH_PRIVILEGES

      /AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies the standard authorized privileges for the library.
   These are the authorized privileges that a new user gets when
   added to the library unless a different set of authorized
   privileges is explicitly specified for that user. Authorized
   privileges are those VDE privileges the user is allowed to set
   with the SET PRIVILEGE command.

   If only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be
   omitted. If this qualifier is omitted entirely, VDE provides
   default values for the standard authorized privileges of the
   library.

   Each priv parameter specifies the name of one privilege. For a
   list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

/AUTO_ADD_USER

      /AUTO_ADD_USER[=rights-ident]
      /NOAUTO_ADD_USER (default)

   Specifies whether new users should be added to the library
   database automatically when they first access the library. The
   /AUTO_ADD_USER qualifier specifies that new users should be added
   to the library database automatically when they first access the
   library. If the rights-ident parameter is specified, new users
   are only added to the library if they hold the OpenVMS rights
   identifier specified by the parameter. The /NOAUTO_ADD_USER
   qualifier specifies that new users not be added to the library
   database automatically. In this case, new users can only be added
   with explicit CREATE USER commands.

   The owner information specified in the OpenVMS SYSUAF database
   will be used as the owner of any new VDE username created. VDE
   will ignore any leading numerics, leading hyphens, leading space
   characters, and leading tilde characters, listed in the SYSUAF
   owner field.
 

/AUTO_CONVERT

      /AUTO_CONVERT
      /NOAUTO_CONVERT (default)

   Specifies whether the library and its database are automatically
   converted to the new library format when a new version of VDE
   is used on the library. A new version of VDE will frequently
   require a different database schema and possibly other changes to
   a library than the previous version. Each new version of VDE can
   convert a VDE library from an older format to the current format.
   This is either done automatically the first time someone accesses
   the library database, or it is done with an explicity CONVERT
   LIBRARY command. These qualifiers determine the behaviour.

   The /AUTO_CONVERT qualifier specifies that the library should be
   converted automatically the first time a user uses a new version
   of VDE on the present library and its database. /NOAUTO_CONVERT
   specifies that the library should not be converted automatically;
   instead a privileged user must explicitly convert the library
   with the CONVERT LIBRARY command.

   The advantage of automatic conversion is that it is automatic and
   requires no special steps on the part of the user. However, once
   a library has been converted, it is not possible to use an older
   version of VDE on that library.

   The advantage of disabling automatic conversion is that you get
   a chance to back up the database (or the whole library) before
   you explicitly convert the library. You then have the option of
   restoring the backed up copy of the library if you need to go
   back to using the old version of VDE. However, once you install a
   new version of VDE, nobody can use the existing library until
   it is converted. Also, all accessors must use the same or a
   compatible version of VDE.

   In general, automatic conversion is best for small VDE libraries
   whose databases are relatively easy to rebuild if necessary.
   Explicit conversion may be more suitable for large libraries
   where the difficulty of rebuilding the library justifies more
   stringent backup and recovery procedures.

   /NOAUTO_CONVERT is the default.
 

/AUTO_MAIL

      /AUTO_MAIL (default)
      /NOAUTO_MAIL

   Specifies whether VDE should automatically send mail notification
   to the user who has queued a replacement when that replacement
   is later performed. The /AUTO_MAIL qualifier sets a library
   attribute that causes the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to send
   such mail notification. The /NOAUTO_MAIL qualifier clears this
   library attribute so that the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command does
   not send such notification.
 

/CMS_ELEM_HIST

      /CMS_ELEM_HIST (default)
      /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST

   Specifies whether VDE creates the CMS elements for new modules
   with default CMS history and notes strings. The /CMS_ELEM_HIST
   qualifier causes VDE to create the CMS elements for new modules
   with default history and notes strings and the /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST
   qualifier causes VDE to create CMS elements with no default
   history or notes strings. /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST is normally only used
   if you regularly fetch VDE modules using the CMS FETCH command
   and you want to make sure you do not get CMS history or notes
   by default. If you always fetch through VDE, use /CMS_ELEM_HIST
   because it allows VDE to avoid a deficiency in CMS and always
   give and remove history information correctly.
 

/CREATOR_NAME

      /CREATOR_NAME="string"

   Specifies the full name of the user who created the library.
   The quoted name string, which may be up to 40 characters long,
   should contain your first name, middle initial, and last name.
   The CREATE LIBRARY command automatically creates a user record
   in the new library for the library's creator. This name string
   becomes part of that user record.

   This qualifier is required. An empty name string may be specified
   but this is not recommended. If the /CREATOR_NAME qualifier for a
   library is not specified, VDE prompts you for the name string.
 

/DATABASE

      /DATABASE=dir-spec

   Specifies that the database storage area (.RDA) file and the
   snapshot (.SNP) file be created in the directory location given
   by the dir-spec parameter. This qualifier lets you put the
   largest part of the VDE database on a different disk than the
   rest of the VDE library. If you omit this qualifier, VDE creates
   the .RDA and .SNP files in the VDE library's root directory.
 

/DEFER

      /DEFER
      /NODEFER (default)

   Specifies whether the creation of the directory structure for the
   new library should be postponed. The /DEFER qualifier postpones
   creation of the disk directory structure for the library and the
   /NODEFER qualifier causes the directory structure to be created
   immediately. Use the /DEFER qualifier when the default directory
   structure is inappropriate for the new library.

   If the /NODEFER qualifier is specified (or /DEFER is omitted),
   the CREATE LIBRARY command first creates the root directory and
   the VDE database for the library. Then it creates the remaining
   disk directory structure for the library. This structure, which
   includes directories to hold delta-files for one facility
   and directories to hold files for one development stream,
   is determined by the default rules of the utility. Once the
   directory structure exists, source modules and other files can
   be added to the new library.

   If the /DEFER qualifier is specified, the CREATE LIBRARY command
   creates only the library's root directory and its database; it
   does not create the remaining directory structure for the new
   library. If you use the /DEFER qualifier, you can enter SET
   DIRECTORY commands to specify the disk directories you want
   for the library. Then use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to
   create that directory structure on disk. The CREATE DIRECTORY_
   TREE command uses VDE defaults combined with the rules you
   specified with SET DIRECTORY commands to create the new directory
   structure.
 

/DEF_PRIVILEGES

      /DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies the standard default privileges for the library. These
   are the default privileges that a new user gets when added to
   the library unless a different set of default privileges is
   explicitly specified for that user. Default privileges are those
   VDE privileges that are enabled each time the user starts a VDE
   session.

   If only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be
   omitted. If this qualifier is omitted entirely, VDE provides
   default values for the standard default privileges of the
   library.

   Each priv parameter specifies the name of one privilege. For a
   list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.

   Each privilege specified becomes a standard authorized privilege
   as well as a standard default privilege. This rule ensures that
   users are authorized to have all their default privileges.
 

/HISTORY_NOTES

      /HISTORY_NOTES (default)
      /NOHISTORY_NOTES

   Specifies whether VDE's RESERVE command can produce CMS history
   or notes information in its output files. The /HISTORY_NOTES
   qualifier allows the RESERVE command to produce history and notes
   information and to accept the /HISTORY, /NOTES, and /POSITION
   qualifiers. The /NOHISTORY_NOTES qualifier causes the RESERVE
   command to never produce history and notes information (even when
   such information is the default for a module being reserved) and
   to not accept the /HISTORY, /NOTES, and /POSITION qualifiers. In
   this case, you must use the VDE FETCH command to get CMS history
   or notes information for a module. Disabling history and notes
   information in reserved files makes certain mistakes less likely
   where such information gets replaced into the VDE library as part
   of the module text.
 

/JOURNAL

      /JOURNAL=dir-spec

   Enables after-image journalling and specifies that a database
   after-image journal (.AIJ) file be created in the directory
   location given by the dir-spec parameter. When used with the
   RMU backup and restore facilities, after-image journalling allows
   you to recover the up-to-date contents of your database after a
   disk failure. The specified directory should always reside on a
   different physical disk than any of your other database files so
   that the journal file cannot be damaged by the same disk failure
   as the database itself. If you omit this qualifier, VDE disables
   after-image journalling. Digital recommends that you always use
   journalling.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed when the new library is
   created. The /LOG qualifier causes messages to be printed and the
   /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that the
   library and its many components have been created.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=lib-name

   Specifies a name for the new library to be created. This name
   may be up to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
   VDE stores this name in the database and displays it back to you
   when you enter the SHOW LIBRARY or SHOW DEFAULTS command. This
   qualifier is required; if you do not specify it, VDE prompts you
   for the library name.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string. The quoted remark string, which can be
   up to 132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark
   about the new library that you want stored in the library's
   database. Typically the remark describes the purpose or contents
   of the new library.

   Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

/REPL_HISTORY

      /REPL_HISTORY (default)
      /NOREPL_HISTORY

   Specifies whether VDE should maintain a history of all past
   source code replacements into the VDE library. The /REPL_HISTORY
   qualifier specifies that such history information be maintained
   in the VDE database. The /NOREPL_HISTORY qualifier specifies that
   such information not be maintained. When you maintain replacement
   history, you can display past replacements using the /HISTORY
   qualifier to the SHOW REPLACEMENT command.

   For documentation on the SHOW REPLACEMENT command in SHOW
   REPLACEMENT.
 

/SEND_MAIL

      /SEND_MAIL (default)
      /NOSEND_MAIL

   Specifies whether VDE should send mail notification messages
   for those VDE operations that normally send such messages. The
   /SEND_MAIL qualifier enables VDE to send such mail messages and
   the /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier suppresses all VDE mail messages. The
   /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier is useful when you want to test or play
   with a private VDE library without sending notification messages
   to other people. However, for normal production use, you should
   always leave the mail notification feature enabled. The CREATE
   LIBRARY command enables mail notification by default.
 

/SHOW_ARCH_NAME

      /SHOW_ARCH_NAME
      /NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME (default)

   Specifies whether the architecture name is displayed as part of
   every module name in VDE output. The /SHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier
   sets a library attribute that causes VDE to always include
   the architecture name in every module name it displays. This
   attribute also causes the SHOW DEFAULTS command to display the
   default architecture. The /NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier clears
   this library attribute so that VDE omits the architecture names
   when displaying module names. You normally only want to see the
   architecture name if you have defined multiple architectures for
   your VDE library.

   This qualifier is not yet implemented.
 

/SHOW_GEN_EXPR

      /SHOW_GEN_EXPR
      /NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR (default)

   Specifies whether the expected replace-time CMS generation
   expression for each module is displayed by the RESERVE command.
   The /SHOW_GEN_EXPR qualifier sets a library attribute that causes
   the RESERVE command to compute and display the CMS generation
   expression that the corresponding REPLACE command is most likely
   to use for the new module generation. You can use this value
   as an "audit trail identifier" in your code if your project
   uses this convention. This library attribute also causes the
   SHOW RESERVATION command to display the expected CMS generation
   expression and it causes the REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT
   command to print an informational message if the actual CMS
   generation expression for the replaced generation turns out to be
   different than the expected one. The /NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR qualifier
   disables this library attribute.

   Please note that VDE cannot guarantee that the expected CMS
   generation expression will actually be used. It is not possible
   to determine at RESERVE time whether a CMS variant letter should
   be used when the module is eventually replaced; that decision can
   only be made at REPLACE time and depends on propagation decisions
   and stream successor relationships at that time. However, the
   expected CMS generation expression is generally the one that is
   actually used.
 

/SNAPSHOT

      /SNAPSHOT=dir-spec

   Specifies that the database snapshot (.SNP) file be created in
   the directory location given by the dir-spec parameter. This
   qualifier lets you put the snapshot file on a separate disk to
   better use disk space or to improve database performance. If you
   omit this qualifier, VDE creates the .SNP file in the directory
   given by the /DATABASE qualifier if that qualifier is specified.
   If neither qualifier is specified, VDE creates the snapshot file
   in the VDE library's root directory.
 

/LOCK

   The /LOCK and /UNLOCK qualifiers provide a method by which
   RESERVE, REPLACE, UNRESERVE, and other similar commands can
   be disabled on a copy of a VDE library. This mechanism is not
   intended to completely lock-out all access to a VDE library.

   Specification of /LOCK write-locks the library, and the
   corresponding /UNLOCK qualifier reverses the lock. The write-
   lock status is read only when the user initially accesses the
   library-once a user has connected to the library, the lock status
   is not updated.

   A write-locked library can be used to prevent various user
   modifications to the contents of the library during library
   maintenance, or to maintain a shadow copy of a library.

   Users holding the MODLIB privilege are allowed to override the
   library write-lock. An informational message will be displayed
   when the lock is overridden.
 

/STATISTICS

   Enables statistics collection on the specified library. This
   will cause various extra questions to be asked during replacement
   and related operations. This includes the addition of questions
   around the reason for the change, the number of defects fixed,
   and the particular project a change is associated with.
 

/UNLOCK

   The /LOCK and /UNLOCK qualifiers provide a method by which
   RESERVE, REPLACE, UNRESERVE, and other similar commands can
   be disabled on a copy of a VDE library. This mechanism is not
   intended to completely lock-out all access to a VDE library.

   Specification of /LOCK write-locks the library, and the
   corresponding /UNLOCK qualifier reverses the lock. The write-
   lock status is read only when the user initially accesses the
   library-once a user has connected to the library, the lock status
   is not updated.

   A write-locked library can be used to prevent various user
   modifications to the contents of the library during library
   maintenance, or to maintain a shadow copy of a library.

   Users holding the MODLIB privilege are allowed to override the
   library write-lock. An informational message will be displayed
   when the lock is overridden.
 

/WILD_INS_GEN

      /WILD_INS_GEN
      /NOWILD_INS_GEN (default)

   Specifies whether wildcard characters are allowed in the
   parameters to the INSERT GENERATION command when the /GENERATION
   qualifier is specified. The /WILD_INS_GEN qualifier causes
   VDE to allow wildcard characters in such parameters while the
   /NOWILD_INS_GEN qualifier causes VDE to not allow such wildcard
   characters. When the /GENERATION qualifier to INSERT GENERATION
   specifies a specific CMS generation expression, it is unlikely
   that this generation expression could apply to more than one
   module. As a result, it is unlikely that the use of wildcard
   characters in the module-name parameters will give the result
   the user intended. To prevent mistakes, VDE therefore does not
   allow such wildcard usage by default. However, there are some
   situations when such usage might be correct (for example, if the
   specified CMS generation expression is 1). For such situations,
   you can enable the use of wildcard characters with the /WILD_INS_
   GEN qualifier.

     VDE>

     This command creates a new library called NEWLIB. The root
     directory for the new library is DEV$:[PROJDIR] and the name
     of the creator is John Doe. The log messages indicate when
     the various steps are completed. First VDE indicates the
     root directory of the library currently exists and binds the
     logical name VDE$LIBRARY to that directory. Then VDE creates
     the database of the library, which may take several minutes.
     Next, VDE creates the directory structure for the delta files
     of the project. Finally, it creates the directory structure for
     stream MAIN, the only stream in the library.

2  MODULE
   Creates a new module in the current VDE library.

   Requires CREMOD privilege.

   Format

     CREATE MODULE  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of the module being created. The module name must
   consist of a module name and a module type separated by a period
   (as in MODNAM.FOR). It may optionally be preceded by a facility
   name enclosed in square brackets (as in [ACCTNG]MODNAM.FOR where
   ACCTNG is the facility name). If no facility name is specified,
   the module is assumed to belong to the current default facility.
   The facility name, module name, and type name may each be up to
   39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

3  Description
   The CREATE MODULE command creates a new module in the current VDE
   library. It records the new module in the VDE database, including
   its facility, name, type, remark string, and other attributes.
   Every module belongs to some facility, either the facility you
   explicitly specify or the current default facility.

   Modules are classified as source modules or derived modules. A
   source module is a text file (normally) which you create and
   modify manually with an editor. A source module can be reserved
   from and replaced into the VDE library with the RESERVE and
   REPLACE commands. The text of each source module is stored in
   a delta file within a CMS library in the form of a CMS "element."

   By default, the CREATE MODULE command does not create the initial
   generation of a source module. Instead it records the module
   in the VDE database and reserves it for you in your default
   development stream. You must then use the REPLACE command to
   actually create the initial generation of the module. This
   should be the normal way of creating new modules once the VDE
   library is established. However, if you use the /INPUT or /FROM_
   DIRECTORY qualifier, the CREATE MODULE command creates the
   initial generations of the new modules; these qualifiers are
   useful when you initially establish your VDE library. (Note
   that /INPUT may not be available, depending on the setting of
   the queued-replacement option on the stream. If /INPUT is not
   accepted, you must use a subsequent REPLACE command to specify
   the contents of the module under creation.)

   A derived module is a file or other entity that is produced by an
   automated build step, such as an object module or an executable
   image. A derived module cannot be reserved or replaced. In most
   cases, VDE automatically enters derived modules into the VDE
   database when the modules are produced; you seldom need to enter
   them with the CREATE MODULE command. However, when a derived
   module needs to be entered into the database manually, you can do
   so with the /DERIVED qualifier to the CREATE MODULE command.

   If a module is mistakenly created, one can use the DELETE MODULE
   command to reverse the action and delete it-the UNRESERVE command
   will refuse to delete modules that lack a first generation.

   The DELETE MODULE command allows the creator of an errant
   module to correct simple mistakes-such as a misnamed module-
   without requiring unusual privileges. With the DELETE MODULE
   command, the creator can delete the module prior to the initial
   module replacement. DELETE MODULE will cancel the outstanding
   reservation on the module, will remove the module from any
   reservation session that it might be included in, and will
   prevent the module from ever appearing in the VDE library. For
   further information on the DELETE MODULE command, see DELETE
   MODULE. (The DELETE MODULE command normally requires DELMOD
   privilege. In this particular situation, CREMOD privilege is
   sufficient to permit module deletion.)
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BINARY

      /BINARY
      /NOBINARY (default)

   Specifies whether the source module is a binary file or not.
   The /BINARY qualifier specifies that the source module is a
   binary (non-text) file. Binary source files cannot be reviewed
   or differenced with the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command because they
   do not consist of ordinary ASCII text. The /NOBINARY qualifier
   specifies that the source module is an ordinary ASCII text file.
   These qualifiers are only meaningful for source modules.

   Large files that undergo extensive changes at frequent intervals,
   or are the output of a language or application, may not be suited
   for storage as standard delta files as the file delta is never
   used, occupies a considerable amount of disk space, and grows
   rapidly. See the /MARKER qualifier. Examples of files well-suited
   for storage as marker files include most executable images,
   object files, Postscript files, and BACKUP savesets.
 

/CONCURRENT

      /CONCURRENT(default)
      /NOCONCURRENT

   Specifies whether the module can be reserved concurrently by more
   than one user. The /CONCURRENT qualifier allows the module to be
   reserved concurrently unless a user overrides this default with
   for a specific reservation. The /NOCONCURRENT qualifier specifies
   that the module cannot be reserved concurrently.
 

/DELETE

      /DELETE
      /NODELETE

   Controls whether the delete attribute is set for the new
   facility. This attribute allows the facility to be deleted with
   the DELETE FACILITY command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the
   delete attribute so that the new facility can be deleted. The
   /NODELETE qualifier clears the delete attribute so that the new
   facility cannot be deleted unless you first reset this attribute
   with a MODIFY FACILITY command. Marking a facility as /NODELETE
   makes it harder to accidentally delete the facility.

   If this qualifier is not specified, VDE uses the value of the
   allow-deletion library attribute. The library allow-deletion
   default attribute can be set or reset by using the /ALLOW_DELETE
   qualifier on the CREATE LIBRARY or on the MODIFY LIBRARY command.
 

/DERIVED

      /DERIVED
      /SOURCE (default)

   Specifies whether the new module is a source module or a derived
   module. By definition, a source module is a module that can be
   reserved from and replaced into the library. The generations of
   each such module is stored in a "delta file" (a CMS element).
   Most source modules are text files that you modify with an
   editor, but VDE also supports binary (non-text) source modules.

   A derived module is a module that is produced from source modules
   or other derived modules by an automated build step. It cannot
   be reserved or replaced, and is often ignored during command
   wildcard processing. Derived modules are automatically recorded
   in the VDE database when they are produced; they are seldom
   entered into a library with the CREATE MODULE command. However,
   new source modules are not automatically recorded in the VDE
   database and must be entered into a library with the CREATE
   MODULE command. For this reason, the /SOURCE qualifier is the
   default.
 

/FROM_DIRECTORY

      /FROM_DIRECTORY=dir-spec

   Specifies that modules be created for all files in a specified
   disk directory. The dir-spec parameter gives the OpenVMS
   directory specification of the disk directory. When this
   qualifier is specified, the mod-name parameters are omitted,
   and the CREATE MODULE command creates a new module in the current
   default facility for each file in the specified directory. Each
   file becomes the initial generation of the corresponding module.
   The dir-spec parameter may also consist of a wildcarded file
   specification, in which case VDE creates a module for each file
   that matches the specification. (This feature can be used to
   create modules for only those files in a directory that have
   a certain file extension, for example.) This qualifier lets
   you enter a large number of new modules into the VDE library
   with a single command, provided that the initial versions of
   those modules are stored in a single disk directory and that all
   modules belong to the same facility.

   The initial generation of each module created with this qualifier
   is inserted into (becomes the latest generation of) the stream
   you specify with the /STREAM qualifier or into the default stream
   if you omit the /STREAM qualifier. It is also inserted into all
   successors of that stream.

   This qualifier requires the PERFREP privilege.
 

/HISTORY

      /HISTORY[="string"]
      /NOHISTORY[="string"] (default)

   Specifies the CMS history string to be associated with the
   module and whether history information should be included
   in source files when modules are retrieved with the FETCH or
   RESERVE command. History information gives a historical record of
   previous changes to the module.

   The /HISTORY qualifier specifies that history information should
   be included in source files by default when such files are
   retrieved with the FETCH or RESERVE command. The /NOHISTORY
   qualifier specifies that history information should be omitted.
   The string parameter to either qualifier specifies the default
   history string if the user specifies that history information
   should be included in a retrieved file. (If you specify the
   /NOHISTORY qualifier on the CREATE MODULE command, you must
   use the /HISTORY qualifier on the FETCH or RESERVE command to
   use the default history string.) If you do not specify a string
   parameter, VDE supplies a default history string that depends on
   the module type.

   See the CMS documentation for a description of the CMS history
   string and its format.
 

/INPUT

      /INPUT[=file-spec]

   The /INPUT qualifier causes the CREATE MODULE command to create
   the initial generation of the new module. This qualifier is only
   applicable to source modules. The file-spec parameter gives the
   OpenVMS file specification of a file that contains the initial
   generation of the module. If the file-name part of the file
   specification is omitted, the file name is assumed to be the
   same as the module name. If the directory specification part
   is omitted, the file is assumed to be in your current default
   directory. If you omit the whole file-spec parameter, VDE creates
   the initial generation from the file in your default directory
   with the same name as the new module.

   The initial generation of each module created with the /INPUT
   qualifier is inserted into (becomes the latest generation of) the
   stream you specify with the /STREAM qualifier or into the default
   stream if you omit the /STREAM qualifier. It is also inserted
   into all successors of that stream.

   If neither /INPUT nor /FROM_DIRECTORY is specified, the CREATE
   MODULE command records the module in the VDE database and marks
   it as reserved to you. You must then use the REPLACE command to
   actually create the initial generation of the module. This is the
   preferred way of creating new modules once a VDE library has been
   established.

   The /INPUT qualifier is rejected on any streams marked for queued
   replacement. To create and insert a module on a stream marked for
   queued replacement, omit the /INPUT qualifier, and specify the
   file to load into the new module via a REPLACE command.

   This qualifier require the PERFREP privilege.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the new modules
   have been created. The /LOG qualifier prints the messages and
   /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the new
   modules have been added to the VDE library and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/MARKER

      /MARKER
      /NOMARKER (default)

   Specifies whether the source module uses a marker file or not.
   The /MARKER qualifier specifies that the source module uses
   a marker file. When a source module uses a marker file, the
   module is stored as an ordinary file in one of the delta-file
   directories. A small text file, called the marker file, contains
   the full file name of that source file, and this marker file is
   stored in the module's delta file (CMS element). In short, the
   delta file contains a small text file that points to the module's
   actual source file. The marker-file mechanism is normally only
   used for large or frequently changed binary source modules,
   for which the delta-file mechanism may give poor performance
   or use excessive disk space. Executable images, object modules,
   Postscript files, and BACKUP savesets are all example of "source"
   modules for which the marker-file mechanism may be appropriate.

   The actual source files for modules that use marker files are
   stored in a subdirectory for the module's facility within the VDE
   library's delta-file directory tree. This subdirectory must have
   the special directory symbol VDE$MARKER. See the description of
   the SET DIRECTORY command for an explanation of how to establish
   subdirectories and assign them directory symbols. See the
   description of the command SHOW DIRECTORY/DELTA for information
   on displaying the current marker file directory (or directories)
   setting.

   The /NOMARKER qualifier specifies that the source module does
   not use a marker file and that its text is stored directly in
   the delta file (CMS element) for the module. Ordinary ASCII text
   modules should not use marker files.

   Also see the /[NO]BINARY qualifier.
 

/NOTES

      /NOTES[="string"]
      /NONOTES[="string"] (default)

   Specifies the CMS notes string to be associated with the module
   and whether CMS notes should be included in source files when
   modules are retrieved with the FETCH or RESERVE command. CMS
   notes indicate in what module generation each source line was
   created.

   The /NOTES qualifier specifies that notes information should be
   included in source files by default when such files are retrieved
   with the FETCH or RESERVE command. The /NONOTES qualifier
   specifies that notes information should be omitted. The string
   parameter to either qualifier specifies the default notes string
   if the user specifies that notes information should be included
   in a retrieved file. (If you specify the /NONOTES qualifier on
   the CREATE MODULE command, you must use the /NOTES qualifier on
   the FETCH or RESERVE command to use the default notes string.)
   If you do not specify a string parameter, VDE supplies a default
   notes string that depends on the module type.

   See the CMS documentation for a description of the CMS notes
   string and its format.
 

/NOTIFY

      /NOTIFY=(username [,username...])

   Specifies users to notify of all changes to the new module. Each
   username parameter specifies the OpenVMS username or mail address
   of a user who should be notified by mail message each time the
   specified module is replaced into the VDE library.

   Each username parameter can specify the username of a user
   already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS mail address
   with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), or a mail
   forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of
   users to notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind
   that the logical name must be defined when it is later used to
   send notification messages. It should thus be a group or system
   logical name or a logical name that is in some other way defined
   for all users of the VDE library.

   If you specify only one username parameter, you may omit the
   surrounding parentheses.
 

/POSITION

      /POSITION=column-number

   Specifies the default column number in which CMS notes are to
   be placed when this source module is retrieved with a FETCH or
   RESERVE command. The column number must be an integer in the
   range 1 to 511. If this qualifier is omitted, the default column
   number is 81. This qualifier has no effect unless notes are
   enabled with the /NOTES qualifier on the CREATE MODULE command
   or on the FETCH or RESERVE command.

   See the CMS documentation for a description of CMS notes and how
   notes are formatted at the ends of source lines.
 

/PROPAGATE

      /PROPAGATE
      /NOPROPAGATE

   Specifies whether automatic change propagation is allowed
   for this module when it is reserved and replaced into the
   library. /PROPAGATE allows automatic change propagation and
   /NOPROPAGATE disallows change propagation. If change propagation
   is disallowed, VDE automatically inhibits change propagation
   when the module is reserved or replaced as if the /NOPROPAGATE
   qualifier had been specified for the RESERVE or REPLACE command.
   If you omit both qualifiers, the value of the facility's
   nopopulate attribute is used to set the new module's propogate
   attribute.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new module. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the new module that you want
   stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark describes the
   purpose or content of the module.

   Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])

   Specifies reviewers for all changes to the new module. Each
   username parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of a user who
   should review all changes to the specified module. The user must
   already be recorded in the VDE database. When a change to the
   module is replaced into the VDE library, VDE notifies the user
   of the change by mail message. If the replacement is queued,
   the user should then review the queued replacement before it is
   performed. If the replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the user
   of the new module generation that was created, and the user may
   then inspect that generation.

   If you specify only one username parameter, you may omit the
   surrounding parentheses.
 

/SESSION

      /SESSION[=session-name]

   Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations
   together, typically to group all modules related to a particular
   source code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all
   component modules reserved to be treated as a single entity
   for subsequent replacement operations. A session also allows
   additional modules to be reserved and incorporated into an
   existing session at a later time.

   If the new module is being created such that the initial
   generation will be created by a subsequent replacement, /SESSION
   specifies that VDE should add the new module reservation to the
   reservation session given by the session-name parameter.

   If no session with the specified session-name session name
   currently exists, VDE will create a new reservation session
   under the specified session name and will incorporate the module
   reservation(s) into it.

   If the session-name parameter is omitted, VDE generates a unique
   session name, creates a new session by that name, and adds the
   module reservation to it.

   If the /SESSION qualifier is omitted on the CREATE MODULE
   command, VDE will reserve the module (as expected), and will
   not add the new module reservation to any session.

   Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE,
   MODIFY SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL
   SESSION commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on
   a queued-replacement stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be
   combined into the same session.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the module be reserved for the stream given by
   the stream-name parameter or that the initial generation of the
   module be inserted into that stream. If neither /INPUT nor /FROM_
   DIRECTORY is specified, the /STREAM qualifier causes VDE to mark
   the module as reserved for the specified stream. If the /INPUT
   or /FROM_DIRECTORY qualifier is specified, /STREAM causes the
   the initial generation of the new module to become the latest
   generation of the module for the specified stream and all its
   successor streams.

   If the /STREAM qualifier is omitted, the module is reserved for
   or inserted into your current default stream.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE MODULE STGCVT.FOR /STREAM=FOO /REMARK="String conversion routines"

     %VDE-I-RESERVED, generation [CODE]STGCVT.FOR reserved from stream FOO
     %VDE-I-MUSTREPL, you must replace the new module to create its first generation
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [CODE]STGCVT.FOR added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example creates a new source module called STGCVT.FOR. The
     module is created in the current default facility, facility
     CODE, and is reserved from the specified stream FOO. A
     subsequent REPLACE command (not shown) is needed to create
     the first generation of the module.

   2.VDE> CREATE MODULE/NOLOG STGCVT.FOR /STREAM=FOO /REMARK="String conversion routines"

     VDE>

     Here the same module is created as in the previous example, but
     the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses the log messages.

   3.VDE> CREATE MODULE STGCVT.FOR /NOLOG /INPUT=[MYDIR]FOO.FOR -

     VDE>                          /REMARK="String conversion routines"
     VDE>

     In this example, the /INPUT qualifier causes the command
     to create the initial generation of the module from file
     [MYDIR]FOO.FOR. In this case, the module is not marked as
     reserved.

   4.VDE> CREATE MODULE [CODE]STGCVT.FOR /REMARK="String routines", -

     _VDE>              [ACCTNG]SALES.COB /REMARK="Sales accounting"
     %VDE-I-RESERVED, generation [CODE]STGCVT.FOR reserved from stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-MUSTREPL, you must replace the new module to create its first generation
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [CODE]STGCVT.FOR added to the database
     %VDE-I-RESERVED, generation [ACCTNG]SALES.COB reserved from stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-MUSTREPL, you must replace the new module to create its first generation
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [ACCTNG]SALES.COB added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example creates two new source modules, one in facility
     CODE and one in facility ACCTNG. Each module has its own remark
     string. The modules are reserved in the user's default stream,
     stream MAIN.

   5.VDE> SET STREAM MAIN

     VDE> SET FACILITY CODE
     VDE> CREATE MODULE/FROM_DIRECTORY=[MYDIR.SOURCES]/REMARK=""
     %VDE-I-GENINSERT, generation [CODE]A.REQ;1(1) inserted into stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [CODE]A.REQ added to the database
     %VDE-I-GENINSERT, generation [CODE]B.REQ;1(1) inserted into stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [CODE]B.REQ added to the database
     %VDE-I-GENINSERT, generation [CODE]C.B32;1(1) inserted into stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [CODE]C.B32 added to the database
     %VDE-I-GENINSERT, generation [CODE]D.B32;1(1) inserted into stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [CODE]D.B32 added to the database
     %VDE-I-GENINSERT, generation [CODE]E.B32;1(1) inserted into stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-MODADDED, module [CODE]E.B32 added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example uses the /FROM_DIRECTORY qualifier to create
     modules for all files in a given directory. The SET STREAM
     command makes stream MAIN the default stream and the SET
     FACILITY command makes facility CODE the default facility.
     The CREATE MODULE command reads all files in directory
     [MYDIR.SOURCES] and creates a module in facility CODE for each
     such file. VDE creates the initial generation of each module
     and inserts that generation into the default stream (stream
     MAIN) and all successor streams. (No successor streams are
     defined in this example.) The log messages confirm that the
     initial generations have been inserted into the appropriate
     streams and that the modules have been added to the database.
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   Creates a new queued replacement in the VDE database.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     CREATE REPLACEMENT  rep-name [, rep-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of the new replacement to be created. This name can be
   up to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

3  Description
   When a user has reserved and modified one or more modules and
   then uses the REPLACE command to replace the modules into the VDE
   libary, VDE either replaces the modules immediately or creates a
   queued replacement for them. A queued replacement is a record
   in the VDE database that records that the modules should be
   replaced into the library at a future time, after the modules
   have been reviewed and when an authorized user enters a PERFORM
   REPLACEMENT command for the replacement. Whether the REPLACE
   command replaces the modules immediately or creates a queued
   replacement is determined by a qualifier to that command or by an
   attribute on the streams affected by the replacement.

   Although queued replacements are normally created by the REPLACE
   command when you replace modules, you can create a queued
   replacement directly with the CREATE REPLACEMENT command. After
   you have created a queued replacement with this command, you
   can add module reservations to the replacement with the REPLACE
   command by using the /REPLACEMENT qualifier to specify the
   replacement name.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the new
   replacements are created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The
   messages indicate that each new replacement has been created
   and that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new replacement.
   The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long,
   may contain any explanatory remark about the new replacement that
   you want stored in the VDE database.

   Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE REPLACEMENT NEWREP/REMARK="Replacement remark"
     %VDE-I-REPADDED, replacement NEWREP added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> REPLACE/QUEUE/REPLACEMENT=NEWREP A.REQ "Fix access violation"
     %VDE-I-FILCOPSTAG, file DEV$:[MYDIR]A.REQ;13 copied to staging area
     %VDE-I-REPLQUE, module [CODE]A.REQ queued for replacement NEWREP
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> PERFORM REPLACEMENT NEWREP
     %VDE-I-REPLACED, generation [CODE]A.REQ;8(6A2) replaced into stream V2.0
     %VDE-I-REPPERF, replacement NEWREP performed
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example creates a new replacement called NEWREP and
     specifies a remark string for it. The REPLACE command then
     adds a reservation for module [CODE]A.REQ to the replacement.
     The subsequent PERFORM REPLACEMENT command replaces that module
     into the VDE library.
 

2  SCRIPT
   Creates a VDE script in the VDE database.

   Requires CRESCRP privilege.

   Format

     CREATE SCRIPT  file-spec
 

3  Parameter
 

file-spec

   Specifies the OpenVMS file specification for a file that
   contains the text of the new script. If you omit the directory
   specification from the file-spec parameter, your current default
   directory is assumed. If you omit the file extension from the
   file-spec parameter, file extension VDESCRIPT is assumed.
 

3  Description
   The CREATE SCRIPT command reads a VDE script from a file and
   records the script and its type in the VDE database. A script
   is a sequence of commands in the VDE script language that VDE
   can execute to create a DCL command file. VDE can then invoke
   that DCL command file in a subprocess to perform the action of
   the script. VDE uses scripts to perform many different kinds
   of actions. For example, VDE uses "compile scripts" to compile
   modules in a build job. Similarly, it uses "new-stream scripts"
   to populate the directories of a new stream with files when it
   performs the CREATE STREAM command. There are many other kinds of
   scripts, all distinguished by the commands or circumstances that
   cause them to be invoked.

   The primary purpose of VDE scripts is to insert names and
   directory specifications from the VDE database into text you
   specify to generate DCL command files that perform various
   actions. A VDE script is thus a mixture of plain text and
   invocations of functions that retrieve names (such as module
   names, type names, and facility names) and directory strings
   (such as the names of facility subdirectories) from the VDE
   database.

   Since you define scripts, you define how VDE should perform
   the corresponding actions. For example, you decide how a Pascal
   module is compiled because you define the Pascal compile script.
   Similarly, you can define a script that defines auxiliary
   actions of the REPLACE command. Scripts thus let you make policy
   decisions for your own project, while VDE provides the mechanisms
   that implement your policies.

   The CREATE SCRIPT command only defines the new script for the
   current default development stream. You can reference the new
   script only from within the stream to which it belongs. When you
   want to create the same script for more than one stream, you must
   use the CREATE SCRIPT command for each stream. For each stream,
   first enter the SET STREAM command to set the development stream,
   then enter the CREATE SCRIPT command to create the desired script
   within the stream.

   When a new development stream is created, all script definitions
   from the parent stream are copied to the child stream. If
   modified, the script definitions then evolve independently in
   the two development streams.

   Keywords used within scripts are documented in Script Keywords,
   while script functions are in Script Functions, and script types
   are in Script Types. For other script-related commands, also see
   DELETE SCRIPT, EXTRACT SCRIPT, INVOKE SCRIPT, MODIFY SCRIPT, and
   SHOW SCRIPT.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BUILD

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE starts each process
   that executes a build job. The VDE$BUILD utility, which executes
   build jobs, invokes the script once for each process that
   executes a given build job. This script runs before the process
   executes any build steps. The script can be used to generate
   DCL that defines commands or logical names that are needed by
   subsequent build steps. BUILD scripts are optional and are not
   needed for build jobs to work.
 

/COMPILE

      /COMPILE=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE compiles a module
   that matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script when
   you enter a COMPILE command for a matching module or run a build
   job that contains compile steps for matching modules. The script
   must generate the DCL commands that actually perform the compile
   step.
 

/COPY

      /COPY=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE copies a module
   that matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script when
   you enter a COPY command for a matching module or run a build job
   that contains copy steps for matching modules. The script must
   generate the DCL commands that actually perform the copy step.
 

/CREATE_FACILITY

   Specifies the script that VDE should invoke when a new facility
   is created. This script is optional.
 

/DELETE_GENERATION

      /DELETE_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE deletes a
   stream's latest generation of a module that matches the mod-
   name parameter. VDE invokes the script when you enter a DELETE
   GENERATION command for a matching module. The script should
   perform auxiliary processing that you want for the DELETE
   GENERATION command, such as updating source files in a clear-
   copy directory. This type of script is optional and is not needed
   for the DELETE GENERATION command to work.
 

/FETCH

      /FETCH=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE fetches a module
   that matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script
   when you enter a FETCH command for a matching module. The script
   should generate DCL commands that perform auxiliary processing
   that you want for the FETCH command, such as sending notification
   to interested individuals. FETCH scripts are optional and are not
   needed for the FETCH command to work.
 

/INSERT_GENERATION

      /INSERT_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE inserts a
   generation of a module that matches the mod-name parameter into
   a development stream. VDE invokes the script when you enter
   an INSERT GENERATION command for a matching module. The script
   should perform auxiliary processing that you want for the INSERT
   GENERATION command, such as updating source files in a clear-copy
   directory. This type of script is optional and is not needed for
   the INSERT GENERATION command to work.
 

/LINK

      /LINK=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE links a module that
   matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script when you
   enter a LINK command for a matching module or run a build job
   that contains link steps for matching modules. The script must
   generate the DCL commands that actually perform the link step.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the script
   is created. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the script has been created and that the database
   transaction has committed successfully.
 

/NEW_STREAM

      /NEW_STREAM=fac-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked for each facility that
   matches the fac-name parameter when VDE creates a new development
   stream. VDE invokes the script for each matching facility when
   you enter a CREATE STREAM command. The script must generate
   DCL commands that copy all stream-specific files for a given
   facility from the parent stream's directories to the new stream's
   directories. The role of NEW_STREAM scripts is to populate the
   new stream's directory tree with all relevant files from the
   parent stream.

   NEW_STREAM scripts are optional and are not needed for the CREATE
   STREAM command to work, but they are strongly recommended because
   minimal system builds for the new stream cannot work unless all
   result files (such as object libraries and executable images) are
   copied from the parent stream to the new child stream.
 

/NOKEEP

      /NOKEEP=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE replaces a module
   that matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script when
   you enter a REPLACE command with the /NOKEEP qualifier for a
   matching module. The script should generate DCL commands that
   perform the action of the /NOKEEP qualifier, such as deleting
   the replaced source module and perhaps also the associated
   object and listing files from the user's default directory. The
   script is run after the REPLACE command's database transaction
   has committed; it thus performs "clean-up" operations for the
   command. NOKEEP scripts are optional and are not needed for the
   REPLACE command to work. (If a NOKEEP script is not defined when
   a module is replaced with the /NOKEEP qualifier, VDE does not
   delete any files.)
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the
   new script. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   script that you want to store in the database.
 

/REPLACE

      /REPLACE=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE replaces a module
   that matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script when
   you enter a REPLACE command for a matching module. The script
   should generate DCL commands that perform auxiliary processing
   that you want for the REPLACE or (on a queued-replacement stream)
   PERFORM REPLACEMENT command, such as sending notification to
   interested individuals or copying object modules to object
   libraries. REPLACE scripts are optional and are not needed for
   the REPLACE command to work.
 

/RESERVE

      /RESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE reserves a module
   that matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script
   when you enter a RESERVE command for a matching module. The
   script should generate DCL commands that perform auxiliary
   processing that you want for the RESERVE command, such as sending
   notification to interested individuals. RESERVE scripts are
   optional and are not needed for the RESERVE command to work.
 

/SEGMENT

      /SEGMENT=seg-num

   Specifies the segment number of the new script. The seg-num
   parameter, which specifies the script's segment number, must
   be an integer value in the range from 1 to 20. If you omit this
   qualifier, VDE uses segment number 10 by default. When VDE later
   invokes scripts to perform some action, it generates the segments
   of the DCL command file from scripts ordered by their segment
   numbers.
 

/SET_FACILITY

      /SET_FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE sets a new default
   facility that matches the fac-name parameter. VDE invokes the
   script when you enter a SET FACILITY or SET CONTEXT command for a
   matching facility. The script should generate DCL commands that
   perform auxiliary processing that you want for the SET FACILITY
   or SET CONTEXT command, such as defining logical names. SET_
   FACILITY scripts are optional and are not needed for the SET
   FACILITY or SET CONTEXT command to work.

   This qualifier is not yet implemented.
 

/SET_STREAM

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE sets a new default
   stream. VDE invokes the script when you enter a SET STREAM or
   SET CONTEXT command. The script should generate DCL commands that
   perform auxiliary processing that you want for the SET STREAM or
   SET CONTEXT command, such as defining logical names. SET_STREAM
   scripts are optional and are not needed for the SET STREAM or SET
   CONTEXT command to work.

   This qualifier is not yet implemented.
 

/STAGING

      /STAGING=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE copies a source
   module that matches the mod-name parameter into a "staging"
   area. VDE invokes the script when you enter a REPLACE command
   for a matching module and the replacement is queued. For a queued
   replacement, VDE copies each replaced file to a staging area,
   from where it is actually replaced into the VDE library when
   another user later enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT command. The
   script must generate DCL commands that copy the module into the
   staging area.
 

/UNRESERVE

      /UNRESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the script be invoked when VDE unreserves a module
   that matches the mod-name parameter. VDE invokes the script
   when you enter an UNRESERVE command for a matching module.
   The script should generate DCL commands that perform auxiliary
   processing that you want for the UNRESERVE command, such as
   sending notification to interested individuals. UNRESERVE scripts
   are optional and are not needed for the UNRESERVE command to
   work.
 

3  Examples

   1.$ TYPE [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT
     ! Script to compile a C module.
     !
     EMIT "$ SET VERIFY"

      script to compile module [RMS]*.C (segment 10)
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the user first types the script file
     [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT on the terminal. The script contains
     five EMIT commands followed by an EXIT command. The user then
     enters VDE and uses the CREATE SCRIPT command to enter that
     script file into the VDE database as the compile script for all
     C modules in facility RMS. The log messages confirm that the
     script was successfully entered into the database.

   2.$ TYPE [MYDIR]SCRIPT_LINK_X.VDESCRIPT

          7: EMIT "$ DEASSIGN OBJLIB"

     VDE>

     This example displays the script file SCRIPT_LINK_X.VDESCRIPT
     to show the text of the script. The script consists of two
     comment lines and five EMIT commands. The EXIT command is
     omitted in this case. The user then enters VDE and uses
     the CREATE SCRIPT command to enter the script into the VDE
     database. The /LINK qualifier specifies that the script links
     module X.EXE in the current default facility, facility CODE.
     By default, the script's segment number is 10. Finally, the
     SHOW SCRIPT command shows that the script can now be displayed
     directly from the database.

   3.VDE> CREATE SCRIPT/NEW_STREAM=* SCRIPT_NEW_STRM.VDESCRIPT
     %VDE-I-SCRPADDED, script from file DEV$:[MYDIR]SCRIPT_NEW_STRM.VDESCRIPT;3

          8: EMIT "       ",$DIR(SRC,%CURRENT,%CURRENT)
          9: EXIT

     VDE>

     This example creates a NEW_STREAM script that will be executed
     for all facilities when a new development stream is created.
     The CREATE SCRIPT command creates the script, and the SHOW
     SCRIPT command fetchs and displays the contents of the script
     from the database. The script generates DCL commands to copy
     all object libraries from the parent stream's object directory
     to the current stream's object directory. (The "current" stream
     is the new stream being created in this case.) The script also
     copies all .H files from the parent stream's source directory
     for the facility to the new stream's source directory for the
     facility.

   4.VDE> CREATE SCRIPT/INSERT_GENERATION=[*]*.* [MYDIR]SCRIPT_INS_GEN
     %VDE-I-SCRPADDED, script from file DEV$:[MYDIR]SCRIPT_INS_GEN.VDESCRIPT;4 added

      script to insert generation for module [*]*.* (segment 10)
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/TEXT/INSERT_GENERATION=[*]*.*
     Script to insert generation for module [*]*.* (segment 10)
        Text of script:
          1: ! Script for the INSERT GENERATION command.  This script fetches
          2: ! out a clear copy of the generation just inserted into a stream
          3: ! in order to keep the stream's source directory up-to-date.
          4: !
          5: FETCH $FACMODTYP, "/LOG/OUTPUT=", $DIR(SRC)
          6: EMIT "$ PURGE ", $DIR(SRC),$MODTYP

     VDE>

     This example defines a script to be executed each time the
     INSERT GENERATION command is performed for any module.
     The SHOW SCRIPT command displays the text of the script.
     The script contains a FETCH command that fetches the just
     inserted generation into the SRC subdirectory for the affected
     stream and facility. This operation maintains an up-to-date
     copy of the source file in that directory. Because the /LOG
     qualifier is generated for the FETCH command, VDE will print
     an informational log message as the module is fetched during
     script execution. The script also contains an EMIT command
     that generates a PURGE command to be performed on the file just
     fetched out.
 

2  SESSION
   Creates a new reservation session in the VDE database. Sessions
   are used to group reservations in the VDE database. Attributes
   of a session include the session name name and the session remark
   string.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     CREATE SESSION  session-name [, session-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

session-name

   The name of the new session to be created. This name can be up to
   39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

3  Description
   When a user reserves one or more modules with the /SESSION
   qualifier to the RESERVE command, VDE creates a reservation
   session and makes the module reservations members of that
   session. A reservation session is thus a set of module
   reservations that belong together. Additional module reservations
   can be added to the session with additional RESERVE commands.
   When the modules are later replaced into the VDE library, the
   user can specify the session to be replaced (using the /SESSION
   qualifier to the REPLACE command) instead of listing all the
   modules individually. A session thus makes it easy to replace a
   set of related module reservations as a single unit.

   Although reservation sessions are normally created by the RESERVE
   command, you can create a session directly with the CREATE
   SESSION command. This session initially contains no module
   reservations. You can later add module reservations to the
   session with the RESERVE command, using the /SESSION qualifier
   to specify the session name. To remove an existing non-empty
   session, use the UNRESERVE/SESSION command. To remove an existing
   empty session, use the CANCEL SESSION command.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the new sessions
   are created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that each new reservation session has been created and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new reservation
   session. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   new session that you want stored in the VDE database.

   Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE SESSION FIX-SORT-BUG /REMARK="Fix bug in sort routine"
     %VDE-I-SESADDED, session FIX-SORT-BUG added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> RESERVE [SYS]SORT.PAS /SESSION=FIX-SORT-BUG "Fix sort bug"
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, generation [SYS]SORT.PAS;4(2A2) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]SORT.PAS;
     %VDE-I-RESERVED, module generation [SYS]SORT.PAS;4(2A2) reserved from stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example creates a new session called FIX-SORT-BUG and
     specifies a remark string for it. The RESERVE command then adds
     a reservation for module [SYS]SORT.PAS to the session.
 

2  STEP
   Defines a new build step in the VDE database. This command lets
   you define a copy step or specify the input and output modules of
   a compile or link step.

   Requires CRESTEP privilege.

   Format

     CREATE STEP  step-mod-name = mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameters
 

step-mod-name

   The name of the module that is compiled, copied, or linked
   by the build step. This name consists of a module name and
   a type name separated by a period (such as MOD1.PAS) and may
   include a facility name enclosed in square brackets (such as
   [FACNAM]MOD1.PAS). The module name may not contain wildcard
   characters. If no facility name is specified, the current default
   facility is assumed.

   If the step is a compile step, this module is recorded as an
   input to the step. If the step is a link step, this module is
   recorded as an output of the step. If the step is a copy step,
   this module is recorded as the module that is copied (fetched
   out) by the step.
 

mod-name

   The name of a module that you declare to be an input to or output
   from the build step. This name consists of a module name and a
   type name (for example, MOD1.OBJ) and may include a facility name
   enclosed in square brackets (for example, [FACNAM]MOD1.OBJ). If
   no facility name is specified, the current default facility is
   assumed.

   You can declare many modules to be inputs to or outputs from the
   build step by specifying wildcard characters in any of the three
   components of the module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name
   matches any single character in the position it occupies and the
   asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it
   occupies. Those modules whose names match the wildcard pattern
   are recorded as inputs to or outputs from the build step.

   If an output module you specify does not already exist in the
   database, the CREATE STEP command adds it to the database. Input
   modules must already be defined in the database, however. Also,
   you cannot specify a source module as an output of a build step.

   If you specify the /COPY qualifier to create a copy step, you
   must omit the mod-name parameters and the preceding equal sign
   (=).  A copy step fetches a module from its CMS library, but has
   no inputs or outputs other than the module given by the step-mod-
   name parameter.
 

3  Description
   To be able to perform minimal system builds, VDE records all
   inputs and outputs for each build step. This information is
   known as "build dependency information." The build dependency
   information from all build steps is known collectively as the
   "build dependency graph." Normally, VDE collects build dependency
   information automatically when you perform system builds.
   However, for some build steps it is not possible to collect this
   information automatically; some compilers and other tools do not
   make this information available to VDE. For such build steps, you
   must use the CREATE STEP command to enter the build dependency
   information into the VDE database.

   You can define three kinds of build steps with the CREATE STEP
   command: compile steps, link steps, and copy steps. A compile
   step processes the step-mod-name module and possibly other input
   modules to produce one or more output modules. Typically, a
   compile step runs a compiler of some sort on a source module,
   but the exact semantics of the step are determined by the VDE
   script that generates the DCL commands that perform the step.

   A link step produces the step-mod-name module and possibly other
   output modules from one or more input modules. Typically, a link
   step runs the linker to produce a shareable or executable image,
   but again the exact semantics are determined by the VDE script
   associated with the step. Since a script can perform any action
   you want, a compile step need not run a compiler and a link step
   need not run the linker. To VDE, the only real difference between
   a compile step and a link step is that a compile step is named
   for one of the input modules while a link step is named for one
   of the output modules.

   A copy step copies the step-mod-name module from one place to
   another. Normally, a copy step is used to fetch out a source
   module from its delta file (CMS element) into a clear-copy file
   that can be used directly by subsequent build steps. For example,
   C programs generally include various .H files in their compile
   steps. A copy step is needed for each .H file to fetch it from
   its CMS library into a text file that subsequent compile steps
   can use. Likewise, linker options files (.OPT files) must be
   fetched out before you can use them for subsequent link steps.
   You must create a copy step for any module that must be fetched
   into the VDE library's directory tree during builds but which
   does not need any separate processing to produce other output
   modules. For a copy step, the specified module can be seen as
   both the input and the output of the step.

   The CREATE STEP command deletes all dependency information
   for the build step before recording the inputs and outputs you
   specify. Thus, you can use the CREATE STEP command to completely
   replace the dependency information for a build step. To change
   only some of the dependency information for a step, use the
   MODIFY STEP command.

   Build dependency information is always specific to the default
   development stream. Different development streams in a software
   system contain different versions of the code and generally have
   different build dependency graphs.

   To define the same build step for more than one development
   stream, you must use the CREATE STEP command for each stream.
   For each stream, first enter the SET STREAM command to set the
   development stream, then enter the CREATE STEP command to enter
   the desired build-step dependencies into the database.

   When a new development stream is created, the build dependency
   graph from the parent stream is copied to the child stream. The
   build dependency graph then evolves independently in the two
   streams.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/COMPILE

   Specifies whether the build step is a compile step, copy step,
   or link step. The /COMPILE qualifier causes VDE to mark the step
   as a compile step and to record the step-mod-name parameter as
   an input module to the compile step. The /COPY qualifier causes
   VDE to mark the step as a copy step and to record the step-mod-
   name parameter as the module that is copied by the step. The
   /LINK qualifier causes VDE to mark the step as a link step and
   to record the step-mod-name parameter as an output module of the
   link step.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/COPY

   Specifies whether the build step is a compile step, copy step,
   or link step. The /COMPILE qualifier causes VDE to mark the step
   as a compile step and to record the step-mod-name parameter as
   an input module to the compile step. The /COPY qualifier causes
   VDE to mark the step as a copy step and to record the step-mod-
   name parameter as the module that is copied by the step. The
   /LINK qualifier causes VDE to mark the step as a link step and
   to record the step-mod-name parameter as an output module of the
   link step.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/LINK

   Specifies whether the build step is a compile step, copy step,
   or link step. The /COMPILE qualifier causes VDE to mark the step
   as a compile step and to record the step-mod-name parameter as
   an input module to the compile step. The /COPY qualifier causes
   VDE to mark the step as a copy step and to record the step-mod-
   name parameter as the module that is copied by the step. The
   /LINK qualifier causes VDE to mark the step as a link step and
   to record the step-mod-name parameter as an output module of the
   link step.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/INPUT

   Specifies whether the mod-name parameters are recorded as
   inputs to or outputs from the build step. The /INPUT qualifier
   records modules as inputs to the build step and the /OUTPUT
   qualifier records them as outputs of the step. If no qualifier
   is specified, all modules are assumed to be inputs.

   To set the default for the command as a whole, specify the
   qualifier after the CREATE STEP keywords. To override that
   default for a single module, specify the qualifier after the
   mod-name parameter you choose to mark as an input or output.

   Of /INPUT and /OUTPUT, /INPUT is the default.
 

/OUTPUT

   Specifies whether the mod-name parameters are recorded as
   inputs to or outputs from the build step. The /INPUT qualifier
   records modules as inputs to the build step and the /OUTPUT
   qualifier records them as outputs of the step. If no qualifier
   is specified, all modules are assumed to be inputs.

   To set the default for the command as a whole, specify the
   qualifier after the CREATE STEP keywords. To override that
   default for a single module, specify the qualifier after the
   mod-name parameter you choose to mark as an input or output.

   Of /INPUT and /OUTPUT, /INPUT is the default.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the build step is
   recorded in the database. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The
   messages indicate that the build step has been created, that
   the specified modules are inputs or outputs for the step, and
   that the database transaction has committed successfully.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE STEP FOO.MAR = FOO.$OBJ/OUTPUT
     %VDE-I-COMSTEPADDED, compile step for [CODE]FOO.BAR added to database
     %VDE-I-MODINSTEP, module [CODE]FOO.MAR is an input to the build step
     %VDE-I-MODOUTSTEP, module [CODE]FOO.$OBJ is an output from the build step
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command creates a build step definition for the
     compilation of module FOO.MAR. The step is a compile step
     because the /COMPILE qualifier is the default. FOO.MAR is
     recorded as an input to the step and module FOO.$OBJ is
     recorded as an output from the step, as the log messages show.

   2.VDE> CREATE STEP/LINK MOD1.EXE = MOD1.$OBJ, MOD2.$OBJ, FOO.$OBJ
     %VDE-I-LNKSTEPADDED, link step for [CODE]MOD1.EXE added to database
     %VDE-I-MODOUTSTEP, module [CODE]MOD1.EXE is an output from the build step
     %VDE-I-MODINSTEP, module [CODE]MOD1.$OBJ is an input to the build step
     %VDE-I-MODINSTEP, module [CODE]MOD2.$OBJ is an input to the build step
     %VDE-I-MODINSTEP, module [CODE]FOO.$OBJ is an input to the build step
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command creates the build dependency information for the
     build step that links module MOD1.EXE. Module MOD1.EXE is
     the output of the step and modules MOD1.$OBJ, MOD2.$OBJ, and
     FOO.$OBJ are the inputs.

   3.VDE> CREATE STEP/COMPILE/OUTPUT [CODE]MOD4.FOR = MOD4.$OBJ, [CODE]MOD4.LIS
     %VDE-I-COMSTEPADDED, compile step for [CODE]MOD4.FOR added to database
     %VDE-I-MODINSTEP, module [CODE]MOD4.FOR is an input to the build step
     %VDE-I-MODOUTSTEP, module [CODE]MOD4.$OBJ is an output from the build step
     %VDE-I-MODOUTSTEP, module [CODE]MOD4.LIS is an output from the build step
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW STEP/FULL MOD4.FOR
     Compile Step for module [CODE]MOD4.FOR
        Dependency links for stream V2.1 follow
        Inputs to the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD4.FOR
        Outputs from the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD4.$OBJ
           Module [CODE]MOD4.LIS
        Build step has 1 inputs and 2 outputs

     VDE>

     The CREATE STEP command defines the compile step for module
     MOD4.FOR in facility CODE as having one input module (MOD4.FOR)
     and two output modules (MOD4.$OBJ and MOD4.LIS). The SHOW
     STEP command confirms that these build dependencies have been
     entered into the VDE database.

   4.VDE> CREATE STEP/COPY [CODE]MOD5.H
     %VDE-I-COPSTEPADDED, copy step for [CODE]MOD5.H added to database
     %VDE-I-MODINSTEP, module [CODE]MOD5.H is an input to the build step
     %VDE-I-MODOUTSTEP, module [CODE]MOD5.H is an output from the build step
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example creates a copy step for module MOD5.H in facility
     CODE. VDE records the specified module as both the input and
     the output of the step since a copy step simply copies the
     specified module from one form to another (normally from its
     delta-file form to text-file form).
 

2  STREAM
   Creates a development stream in the current VDE library.

   Requires CRESTRM privilege.

   Format

     CREATE STREAM  stream-name [, stream-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a stream to be created. This name can be up to 39
   characters long. It must follow VDE name syntax. Unlike other VDE
   names, the stream name can contain periods (.).  The use of the
   facility prefix VDE$ is expressly prohibited.
 

3  Description
   A development stream (or simply, a "stream") is any separately
   evolving version of your software system. A stream may correspond
   to a previous or future version of your system or to a base-level
   of the system. It may correspond to any instance of the system
   that evolves separately from the rest of the system. Each stream
   of your software system captures a different state of the system,
   and that state may evolve independently for each stream.

   Each stream of your software system contains its own versions
   of all modules in the system, and you may change these modules
   independently in each stream. Each stream also contains its own
   versions of various database tables, such as group definitions
   and module dependency information. This information may also
   evolve independently for each stream.

   When you create a stream, the CREATE STREAM command first
   creates an entry for the new stream in the VDE database. It then
   copies all stream-specific information from the parent stream
   (by default, the default stream) to the new stream (the child
   stream). This information includes directory-creation rules,
   group definitions, the build dependency graph, and information
   about what module generations belong to the parent stream. In
   addition, the CREATE STREAM command executes scripts which may
   copy files from the parent stream's disk directories to the child
   stream's directories.

   There are several key attributes to VDE module propogation
   controlled by the CREATE STREAM command, including the sequence
   of streams on the various lines of descent, and the presence
   of the particular stream on the main line of development or
   on a variant line of descent. The former is controlled by the
   parentage and successor settings, and the latter is controlled by
   the mainline setting.

                                  NOTE

      The CREATE STREAM command can and does perform specific and
      potentially non-reversable modifications to the internal
      VDE data associated with other streams present in the
      VDE database, particularly around the /MAIN and /NOMAIN
      settings, and around the /PARENT and /SUCCESSOR settings.
      The CREATE STREAM command should be used with caution.

      The explicit specification of the appropriate value for the
      /[NO]MAIN qualifier (/MAIN or /NOMAIN) on a CREATE STREAM
      command is strongly recommended.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CMS_CLASS

      /CMS_CLASS
      /NOCMS_CLASS(default)

   Specifies whether a CMS class with the same name as the stream
   should be maintained in each facility's CMS library. The /CMS_
   CLASS qualifier causes VDE to create a CMS class for the stream
   in each facility's CMS library and to then maintain that class
   when the REPLACE command and certain other commands change
   what module generations belong to the stream. The /NOCMS_CLASS
   qualifier causes VDE to not maintain a CMS class for the stream.

   The /CMS_CLASS qualifier interacts with the /INIT_CMS_CLASS
   and /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS qualifiers; see the descriptions of these
   qualifiers for details.
 

/CONFERENCE

      /CONFERENCE=file-spec
      /NOCONFERENCE(default)

   Specifies whether a OpenVMS Notes conference for replacement
   information should be associated with the new stream. The
   /CONFERENCE qualifier specifies that the notes conference file
   specification given by the file-spec parameter should be used to
   record all replacements into the stream. VDE then enters a new
   note into the conference for each queued or immediate replacement
   and a reply to that note when a queued replacement is actually
   performed. The /NOCONFERENCE qualifier specifies that no such
   notes conference should be used.

   Under normal circumstances, just the file name should be
   specified in the file-spec parameter. VDE applies defaults to
   the notes conference file specification based on the translation
   of the logical name VDE$NOTES_LIBRARY. If this logical name is
   not defined, the default file specification "NOTES$LIBRARY:.NOTE"
   is applied to the file-spec parameter.
 

/DEFER

      /DEFER
      /NODEFER (default)

   Specifies whether the creation of the disk directory structure
   for the stream should be postponed. The /DEFER qualifier
   postpones creation of the disk directory structure and the
   /NODEFER qualifier causes the disk directory structure to be
   created immediately. Use the /DEFER qualifier when the default
   directory structure is inappropriate for the new stream.

   If the /NODEFER qualifier is specified (or /DEFER is omitted),
   the CREATE STREAM command creates the disk directory structure
   for the stream. This structure includes a stream root directory,
   a root directory for each facility, and facility subdirectories
   that hold the files that are the contents of the facility in
   the new stream. The directory structure is determined by the SET
   DIRECTORY commands entered for the new stream (or inherited from
   the parent stream) or by VDE default rules. Once VDE has created
   the new stream's directory structure for a given facility, VDE
   runs the stream's new-stream script for that facility, provided
   such a script is defined. Depending on how it is defined, this
   script may populate the directories for that facility with source
   modules and other files.

   If the /DEFER qualifier is specified, the CREATE STREAM command
   does not create a directory structure for the new stream. If you
   use the /DEFER qualifier, you can enter SET DIRECTORY commands
   to specify the structure of the disk directories. Then use the
   CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create the directory structure
   on disk. The CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command uses VDE defaults and
   the rules you specified with the SET DIRECTORY commands to create
   the new directory structure.
 

/DELETE

      /DELETE
      /NODELETE

   Controls whether the delete attribute is set for the new stream.
   This attribute allows the stream to be deleted with the DELETE
   STREAM command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete attribute
   so that the new stream can be deleted. The /NODELETE qualifier
   clears the delete attribute so that the new stream cannot be
   deleted unless you first reset this attribute with a MODIFY
   STREAM command. This makes it harder to accidentally delete a
   stream. If you specify neither qualifier, VDE uses the value of
   the allow-deletion library attribute as the initial value of the
   stream's delete attribute. This library attribute is set with
   the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier to the CREATE and MODIFY LIBRARY
   commands.
 

/DIRECTORY

      /DIRECTORY=dir-spec

   Specifies the name of the root directory of the stream. The root
   directory normally contains a subdirectory for each facility.
   Each subdirectory has additional subdirectories for the sources
   and derived files of the facility and stream. (To modify the
   default directory structure, first use the CREATE STREAM command
   with the /DEFER qualifier then use the SET DIRECTORY and CREATE
   DIRECTORY_TREE commands to create the directory structure you
   want.) Use the OpenVMS directory specification format to specify
   the dir-spec parameter.
 

/INIT_CMS_CLASS

      /INIT_CMS_CLASS
      /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS

   Specifies whether VDE initializes the CMS class for the stream
   in each facility's CMS library when the /CMS_CLASS qualifier
   specifies that such a class should be maintained. /INIT_CMS_
   CLASS causes the CREATE STREAM or MODIFY STREAM command with
   the /CMS_CLASS qualifier to create and populate a CMS class
   with the same name as the stream in each facility. /NOINIT_CMS_
   CLASS causes these commands to not create or populate such CMS
   classes. /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS is useful for very large VDE libraries
   where the initialization of CMS classes take an excessively long
   time. For such libraries, it is better to use a separate command
   procedure to initialize the desired CMS classes; such a procedure
   can process the facilities of your library in parallel for faster
   completion.

   If you specify neither of these qualifiers, VDE uses the
   initialization attribute of the new stream's parent stream. By
   default, the initial stream for the VDE library (stream MAIN)
   is created with initialization enabled (in effect, /INIT_CMS_
   CLASS is the default). All other streams will inherit this
   attribute unless you change it with an explicit /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS
   qualifier.

   Unless you have existing command procedures or programs that
   depend on the presence of CMS classes, Digital recommends that
   you not maintain CMS classes for the streams in your VDE library.
   Maintaining CMS classes is quite slow, especially when creating
   new streams, and VDE does not need CMS classes for any of its
   functions.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after new streams are
   created. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that each new stream has been created, that its disk directory
   structure has been created, and that the database transaction has
   successfully committed.
 

/MAIN

      /MAIN
      /NOMAIN (default)

   Specifies whether the new stream is part of the main development
   thread for your project. The /MAIN qualifier says that the new
   stream is part of the main development thread for the project
   and is expected to be in use for a relatively long time, and is
   expected to be in use after the parent stream has been closed.
   VDE assigns the shortest possible CMS "generation expressions"
   to new generations in a main stream. The /NOMAIN qualifier says
   that the new stream is not part of the project's main development
   thread and is expected to have a shorter future lifetime than
   the parent stream. In this case, VDE may assign longer CMS
   generation expressions (using CMS "variant letters") to future
   module generations in the stream.

   You normally use the /MAIN qualifier when you create a stream for
   your project that will be the future continuation of the parent
   stream. Creating stream V2.0 from stream V1.0 is an example since
   development of Version 1.0 of your project will cease as Version
   2.0 carries the project into the future. You use the /NOMAIN
   qualifier when you create base levels or other streams that are
   expected to have short lifetimes compared to the parent stream.

   If you specify the /MAIN qualifier, the new stream automatically
   becomes a successor of the parent stream so that changes are
   propagated from the parent to the new stream. If you specify
   the /MAIN qualifier but you do not specify the /SUCCESSOR or
   /NOSUCCESSOR qualifier, the main streams that are successors of
   the parent stream are removed as successors of the parent stream
   and instead become successors of the new stream. The effect is
   that the new stream is inserted into the successor chain after
   the parent stream. If you specify the /NOMAIN qualifier, no such
   insertion takes place.

   For information on changing the main line of descent attribute
   specific to a particular module generation, see the documentation
   on the MODIFY GENERATION/MAIN_STREAM command in MODIFY
   GENERATION.

                             SPECIFICATION

      Explicit specification of /[NO]MAIN is not currently
      required, but explicit specification of this qualifier
      may be required in a future release of VDE. Explicit
      specification of this qualifier-either as /MAIN or as
      /NOMAIN-is highly recommended.
 

/NOGENERATIONS

   Specifies that the new stream should not be populated with
   the latest generations of the parent stream. If you use this
   qualifier, you get a new stream containing no generations. If you
   omit this qualifier, VDE populates the new stream with the latest
   generations of the parent stream.
 

/NOTIFY

      /NOTIFY=(username [,username...])

   Specifies users to notify of all changes replaced into the new
   stream. Each username parameter specifies the OpenVMS username
   or mail address of a user who should be notified by mail message
   each time a module is replaced into the stream, and each time a
   new facility is created in the stream.

   Each username parameter can specify the username of a user
   already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS mail address
   with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail
   forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of
   users to notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind
   that the logical name must be defined when it is later used to
   send notification messages. It should thus be a group or system
   logical name or a logical name that is in some other way defined
   for all users of the VDE library.

   If you specify only one username parameter, you may omit the
   surrounding parentheses.
 

/OPEN

   Determines the status of the new stream: open, frozen, or
   permanently closed. If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all
   users can reserve and replace source modules from the stream
   and thereby modify the contents of the stream.

   If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve
   modules from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN
   privilege to replace modules into the stream; non-privileged
   users cannot change the contents of the stream. You can later
   change the status to open with the MODIFY STREAM command, so the
   stream is not permanently frozen.

   If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved
   from or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed
   with a subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the
   UNCLOSE privilege. Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want
   the contents of the stream to change again, for example, when
   capturing a base-level of your software system or when capturing
   the final state of a released version of your software.

   Of /OPEN, /FROZEN and /CLOSED, /OPEN is the default.
 

/FROZEN

   Determines the status of the new stream: open, frozen, or
   permanently closed. If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all
   users can reserve and replace source modules from the stream
   and thereby modify the contents of the stream.

   If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve
   modules from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN
   privilege to replace modules into the stream; non-privileged
   users cannot change the contents of the stream. You can later
   change the status to open with the MODIFY STREAM command, so the
   stream is not permanently frozen.

   If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved
   from or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed
   with a subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the
   UNCLOSE privilege. Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want
   the contents of the stream to change again, for example, when
   capturing a base-level of your software system or when capturing
   the final state of a released version of your software.

   Of /OPEN, /FROZEN and /CLOSED, /OPEN is the default.
 

/CLOSED

   Determines the status of the new stream: open, frozen, or
   permanently closed. If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all
   users can reserve and replace source modules from the stream
   and thereby modify the contents of the stream.

   If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve
   modules from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN
   privilege to replace modules into the stream; non-privileged
   users cannot change the contents of the stream. You can later
   change the status to open with the MODIFY STREAM command, so the
   stream is not permanently frozen.

   If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved
   from or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed
   with a subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the
   UNCLOSE privilege. Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want
   the contents of the stream to change again, for example, when
   capturing a base-level of your software system or when capturing
   the final state of a released version of your software.

   Of /OPEN, /FROZEN and /CLOSED, /OPEN is the default.
 

/OWNER

      /OWNER=username

   Specifies the owner of the new stream. The username parameter
   specifies the OpenVMS username of a user who should be considered
   to be the "owner" of the stream. VDE assigns no special meaning
   to the owner of a stream, but the SHOW STREAM command displays
   the owner. The owner could thus be the person to contact with
   questions about the stream.

   If you omit this qualifier, VDE records no owner for the stream.
 

/PARENT

      /PARENT=stream-name

   Specifies the parent of the new stream. If this qualifier is
   specified, the stream-name parameter gives the name of the
   development stream that should be the parent of the new stream
   being created. If this qualifier is omitted, the default stream
   becomes the parent of the new stream.

   Correct specification of this qualifier is of central importance
   when uploading facilities and streams from an existing set of CMS
   libraries. See the CREATE FACILITY/FROM_CMS_LIBRARY command.

   Specification of /PARENT is required.
 

/POPULATE

      /POPULATE (default)
      /NOPOPULATE

   Specifies whether the stream is allowed to be populated with
   generations from another stream using the POPULATE STREAM
   command. /POPULATE allows subsequent use of the POPULATE STREAM
   command to populate the stream and /NOPOPULATE disallows such
   use.
 

/PROCESS_COUNT

      /PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count

   Specifies the default number of processes to execute build jobs
   for the new stream. This parameter determines the degree of
   parallelism for the stream's build jobs. See the description of
   the BUILD command for a detailed description of this qualifier.
 

/QUEUE

      /QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])

   Specifies the default batch queues to which build jobs for the
   new stream are submitted. See the description of the BUILD
   command for a detailed description of this qualifier and for a
   description of its interaction with the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new stream. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the new stream that you want
   stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark indicates the
   version or base-level of your system.

   Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

/REPLACEMENT

      /REPLACEMENT=keyword

   Controls whether the REPLACE command permits immediate
   replacements into the new stream or requires queued replacements.
   If the keyword parameter is IMMEDIATE, the REPLACE command will
   immediately replace modules into the stream by default. If
   the parameter is QUEUE, the REPLACE command will always queue
   replacements for the stream so that modules are not replaced into
   the stream until a privileged user enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT
   command. If you omit this qualifier, VDE permits immediate
   replacements into the new stream. (See the descriptions of the
   /IMMEDIATE and /QUEUE qualifiers to the REPLACE command for more
   information.)
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])

   Specifies reviewers for all changes replaced into the new stream.
   Each username parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of a
   user who should review all changes to the specified stream.
   The user must already be recorded in the VDE database. When a
   module is replaced into the stream, VDE notifies the user of
   the replacement by mail message. If the replacement is queued,
   the user should then review the queued replacement before it is
   performed. If the replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the user
   of the new module generation that was created, and the user may
   then inspect that generation.

   If you specify only one username parameter, you may omit the
   surrounding parentheses.
 

/STEP_DELAY

      /STEP_DELAY=time-interval

   Specifies the default step-delay time interval used by build jobs
   for the new stream. See the description of the BUILD command for
   a detailed description of this qualifier.
 

/SUCCESSOR

      /SUCCESSOR=(succ-name [, succ-name...])
      /NOSUCCESSOR (default)

   The /SUCCESSOR qualifier specifies successors to the stream
   being created. A successor to a stream is another stream to which
   source changes are propagated by the REPLACE command. Each succ-
   name parameter specifies the name of a stream that should be a
   successor to the new stream given by the stream-name parameter.

   The /NOSUCCESSOR qualifier specifies that the new stream does not
   have any successors.

   If both the /SUCCESSOR and /NOSUCCESSOR qualifiers are omitted,
   the new stream has no successors unless you specify the /MAIN
   qualifier. See the description of the /MAIN qualifier for the
   special rules that apply in this case.
 

/TIMEOUT

      /TIMEOUT=time-interval

   Specifies the default timeout interval used by build jobs for
   the new stream. See the description of the BUILD command for a
   detailed description of this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE STREAM V5.2-BL3/REMARK="Base Level 3 of V5.2"/NOLOG
     VDE>

     This example creates a new stream called V5.2-BL3. The remark
     string indicates that this is base level 3 of version 5.2 of
     the user's software system. The /NOLOG qualifier suppresses all
     log messages.

   2.VDE> CREATE STREAM V5.3 /REMARK="Version 5.3"
     Creating directory tree for stream V5.3:
        Root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR.V5_3] has been created

     %VDE-I-STRMADDED, stream V5.3 added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example creates a new stream called V5.3, representing
     version 5.3 of the user software system. The log messages
     indicate that the directories for the new stream have been
     created, that the stream has been added to the database, and
     that the database transaction has successfully completed.
 

2  USER
   Creates a database record for a new user of the current VDE
   library.

   Requires CREUSR privilege.

   Format

     CREATE USER  username [, username...]
 

3  Parameter
 

username

   The OpenVMS username of the user to be added to the VDE database.
   This name can be up to 12 characters long and must follow VDE
   name syntax.
 

3  Description
   The CREATE USER command creates the database record for a new
   user of the current VDE library.

   Each user of a VDE library must have a record in the database of
   that library. This record contains the user's OpenVMS username,
   full name string, authorized and default privileges, and remark
   string. After the record has been created, the user has access
   to the VDE library as constrained by the specified privileges.
   A user who does not have a record in a given VDE database
   cannot use the VDE Utility to gain access to the database or
   the corresponding library.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/AUTH_PRIVILEGES

      /AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies the new user's authorized privileges, which are the
   privileges the user is allowed to set with the VDE command
   SET PRIVILEGE. Each parameter to this qualifier names a single
   privilege. If only one privilege is specified, the parentheses
   may be omitted. If this qualifier is not specified, VDE assigns
   the standard authorized privileges of the library to the new
   user.

   For a list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

/DEF_PRIVILEGES

      /DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies the new user's default privileges, which are the
   privileges enabled each time the user starts a new VDE session.
   Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. Each
   privilege specified becomes an authorized privilege as well as a
   default privilege, even if it has not been listed with the /AUTH_
   PRIVILEGES qualifier. If only one privilege is specified, the
   parentheses may be omitted. If the /DEF_PRIVILEGES qualifier is
   not specified, VDE assigns the standard default privileges of the
   library to the new user.

   For a list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after users have been
   added to the database. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages
   to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that users have been added and that the database transaction has
   successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME="string"

   Specifies the full name of the new user. The quoted name string,
   which can be up to 40 characters long, should contain the full
   name (first name, middle initials, and last name) of the new
   user.

   This qualifier is required. You can specify an empty name string
   but this is not recommended. If you do not specify the /NAME
   qualifier, VDE prompts you for a name string.
 

/NOTIFY

      /NOTIFY=(username [,username...])

   Specifies users to notify of all code changes replaced into the
   VDE library by the new user. Each username parameter specifies
   the OpenVMS username or mail address of a user who should be
   notified by mail message each time the new user created by this
   command replaces a module into the VDE library.

   Each username parameter can specify the username of a user
   already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS mail address
   with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail
   forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of
   users to notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind
   that the logical name must be defined when it is later used to
   send notification messages. It should thus be a group or system
   logical name or a logical name that is in some other way defined
   for all users of the VDE library.

   If you specify only one username parameter, you may omit the
   surrounding parentheses.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new user. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the new user that you want
   stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark describes the
   user's affiliation or function within the organization.

   This qualifier is required although you can specify an empty
   remark string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])

   Specifies reviewers for all code changes replaced into the VDE
   library by the new user. Each username parameter specifies the
   OpenVMS username of a user who should review all changes created
   by the new user. The reviewer must already be recorded in the VDE
   database. When the new user created by this command replaces
   a module into the VDE library, VDE notifies the reviewer of
   the change by mail message. If the replacement is queued, the
   reviewer should then review the queued replacement before it
   is performed. If the replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the
   reviewer of the new module generation that was created, and he
   or she may then inspect that generation. This qualifier can be
   used to set up "buddy systems" where two users always review each
   other's code.

   If you specify only one username parameter, you may omit the
   surrounding parentheses.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> CREATE USER SMITH NAME="Jane Smith"/REMARK="OpenVMS Developer"
     %VDE-I-USERADDED, user SMITH added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command creates a database record for user SMITH. The
     /NAME qualifier specifies Jane Smith's full name and the
     /REMARK qualifier identifies her job. The example shows the
     informational log messages that the /LOG qualifier produces by
     default.

   2.VDE> CREATE USER DOE /NAME="John X. Doe"/REMARK="OpenVMS Writer" -

     _VDE>       /AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(BUILD,CREGRP,CREMOD) -
     _VDE>       /DEF_PRIVILEGES=(BUILD,CREFAC) /NOLOG
     VDE>

     In this example, user DOE is added to the database. In addition
     to specifying the full name and a remark for John Doe, this
     command gives his authorized and default VDE privileges. Note
     that the CREFAC privilege becomes an authorized privilege as
     well as a default privilege even though it is not listed by the
     /AUTH_PRIVILEGES qualifier. In this case, the /NOLOG qualifier
     suppresses the log messages.

   3.VDE> CREATE USER/REMARK="OpenVMS Developer" -

     _VDE>       SMITH /NAME="Jane Smith", -
     _VDE>       JONES /NAME="Frank Jones"
     %VDE-I-USERADDED, user SMITH added to the database
     %VDE-I-USERADDED, user JONES added to the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the creation of database records for
     multiple users with a single CREATE USER command. This command
     adds users SMITH and JONES to the database. Both get the same
     remark string because the remark is specified immediately after
     the CREATE USER command. They get separate full name strings
     and both get the standard authorized and default privileges of
     the current library.
 

1  DEFINE
 

2  /COMMAND
   Defines a command abbreviation by associating a symbol name with
   a list of one or more VDE commands.

   Format

     DEFINE/COMMAND  symbol-name="command-string"
 

3  Parameters
 

symbol-name

   Specifies the symbol name that you want associated with a list of
   VDE commands. The symbol can be up to 255 characters long and can
   include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. It cannot
   start with a digit. If symbol-name is already defined, the new
   definition replaces the old definition.
 

command-string

   Specifies the string of VDE commands to associate with the symbol
   name. The command string must be enclosed in quotation marks and
   consists of the first part of a VDE command, a whole command, or
   a list of commands separated by semicolons.
 

3  Description
   The DEFINE/COMMAND command associates a symbol name with a VDE
   command string. The command string consists of zero or more VDE
   commands separated by semicolons and must end with a partial or
   full VDE command.

   When the symbol name appears at the beginning of a VDE command,
   the symbol name is replaced by its associated command string. The
   resulting string is then parsed and executed as a normal command
   line by VDE. DEFINE/COMMAND thus gives you the same command
   abbreviation capability as the symbol assignment statement
   (symbol-name := command-string) in DCL. Symbol substitution
   only happens once at the beginning of each command. A symbol's
   associated command string can therefore not begin with another
   command symbol.

   To display the current symbol definitions created by
   DEFINE/COMMAND, use the SHOW SYMBOL command.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DEFINE/COMMAND SM = "SHOW MODULE"
     VDE> SM MOD1
     Module [FACIL]MOD1.MAR
     VDE>

     This DEFINE/COMMAND command associates the symbol SM with the
     VDE command "SHOW MODULE". When the SM command is used, SM is
     expanded to the equivalent command string. The module name MOD1
     is then concatenated to that string to form the full command
     SHOW MODULE MOD1, which VDE then executes.

   2.VDE> DEFINE/COMMAND STRMFAC = "SET STREAM V5.3; SET FACILITY RMS"
     VDE> STRMFAC
     VDE> SHOW DEFAULTS
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     Default directory is DEV$:[SMITH]
     Current session context:
        Default stream is V5.3
        Default facility is RMS
     VDE>
     VDE>

     This example shows that a symbol can be associated with
     multiple commands. Here symbol STRMFAC is associated with both
     a SET STREAM command and a SET FACILITY command, where the two
     commands are separated by a semicolon. When the STRMFAC command
     is entered, the command string is substituted for the symbol
     name and the SET STREAM and SET FACILITY commands are executed.
     The output from a subsequent SHOW DEFAULTS command shows that
     the default stream and the default facility have been set by
     the STRMFAC command.
 

2  /KEY
   Defines a key to execute a VDE command. A key definition lets
   you to enter a command by pressing a key rather than typing the
   command. The /KEY qualifier is required and must precede any
   other qualifiers.

   Format

     DEFINE/KEY  key-name string
 

3  Parameters
 

key-name

   Specifies the name of the key you are defining. Key Names
   contains a list of common keys on common keyboards.

   Table 1-1 Key Names

   Key-name     VT100        LK201,LK401  Default VDE Usage

   DO           -            Do/F16       None
   F17-F20      -            F17-F20      Sets defaults to libraries

                                  NOTE

      You cannot redefine the arrow keys or function keys F1
      through F14.
 

string

   Specifies the string that is entered when you press the defined
   key. String can be any VDE command, such as SHOW DEFAULTS or SET
   CONTEXT. To preserve spaces and lowercase characters, enclose the
   string in quotation marks.
 

3  Description
   The DEFINE/KEY command, on certain terminals, enables you to
   assign definitions to keys other than those on the main keyboard.
   The command can be used on a variety of terminals including the
   VT340, VT510 and the DECterm terminal emulator.

   The string parameter to the DEFINE/KEY command can contain
   different types of information and usually consists of an entire
   VDE command. For example, you can assign the SHOW DEFAULTS
   command to KP0. Then, when you press zero on the keypad, VDE
   displays your current default settings. Other definitions can
   consist of text strings to be appended to command lines. When
   you define a key to insert a text string, use the /NOTERMINATE
   qualifier so you can continue typing more data after the string
   has been inserted.

   In most instances you will want to use the echo feature. The
   /ECHO qualifier displays the key definition on the screen each
   time you press the key. The default setting is /ECHO.

   You can create as many definitions for a key as you want as
   long as you specify a new context for each definition. This new
   context is called a state. To create additional key definitions
   you must use two steps. First, using the /SET_STATE qualifier,
   you must define a key that establishes a state for the definition
   you want to create. Then you must create the new definition for
   your key and specify its state using the /IF_STATE qualifier.

   State names can include letters, digits, dollar signs, and
   underscores. Create state names that are easy to remember and
   type and that remind you of the types of definitions you created.
   For example, you can create a state called SETSHOW. The key
   definitions for this state might refer to various VDE SET and
   SHOW commands.

   Like various other utilities on OpenVMS, VDE supplies three
   built-in states called DEFAULT, GOLD, and BLUE. You can assign
   different definitions to keys used in combination with the GOLD
   and BLUE keys by using the /IF_STATE qualifier.

   By convention, the GOLD state is selected by pressing the PF1
   key, and the BLUE state is seected by pressing the PF4 key.

   The SET KEY command changes the keypad state. Use the SHOW KEY
   command to display key definitions and states.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ECHO

      /ECHO (default)
      /NOECHO

   Specifies whether the command line is displayed on your screen
   after you press the defined key. You cannot define a key
   specifying both /NOECHO and /NOTERMINATE.
 

/IF_STATE

      /IF_STATE=(state-name,...)
      /NOIF_STATE (default)

   Specifies a list of states, any one of which must be set to
   enable the specified key definition. (By including several state
   names, you can define a key to have the same function in all the
   specified states.) If you use the /NOIF_STATE qualifier or omit
   the /IF_STATE qualifier, the current state at the time you define
   the key must be set when you use the key definition. The state
   name can include letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscores.
   States are established with the /SET_STATE qualifier on another
   key definition or with the SET KEY command. If you specify only
   one state name, you can omit the parentheses.
 

/LOCK_STATE

      /LOCK_STATE
      /NOLOCK_STATE (default)

   Specifies that the state set by the /SET_STATE qualifier remain
   in effect until explicitly changed. (By default, the /SET_STATE
   qualifier is in effect only for the next definable key you press
   or the next read-terminating character that you type.) Can only
   be specified with the /SET_STATE qualifier.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Specifies whether a log message is displayed after a key is
   defined. The message indicates a key definition has been created
   successfully. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   displayed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them.
 

/SET_STATE

      /SET_STATE=state
      /NOSET_STATE (default)

   Causes the specified state to be set when the key is pressed.
   (By default, the current locked state is reset when the key
   is pressed.) A state name can include letters, digits, dollar
   signs, and underscores. If you omit or negate this qualifier,
   the current state remains unchanged. You cannot define a key
   specifying both /SET_STATE and /TERMINATE.
 

/TERMINATE

      /TERMINATE
      /NOTERMINATE (default)

   Determines whether the specified command string executes when
   you press the key. When you use /NOTERMINATE, you must press
   RETURN to execute the command string. When you use /TERMINATE,
   VDE executes the command string immediately when you press the
   key. You cannot define a key specifying both /SET_STATE and
   /TERMINATE.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DEFINE/KEY KP1 "SHOW DEFAULTS"

     This example shows how to define the keypad key KP1 as the
     VDE command SHOW DEFAULTS. To enter the SHOW DEFAULTS command,
     press KP1 followed by the RETURN key.

   2.VDE> DEFINE/KEY KP6 "SET CONTEXT BUGFIX" /TERMINATE

     This example shows how to define the keypad key 6 as the SET
     CONTEXT BUGFIX command. The /TERMINATE qualifier causes the SET
     CONTEXT BUGFIX command to execute when you press keypad key 6
     without having to press RETURN.

   3.VDE> DEFINE/KEY MINUS "SHOW DEFAULTS" /TERMINATE /NOECHO

     This example shows how to define the minus key on the keypad as
     the SHOW DEFAULTS command. The /TERMINATE qualifier causes the
     SHOW DEFAULTS command to execute when you press the minus key.
     The /NOECHO qualifier prevents the display of the command line
     on the screen. You see the output of the command, but not the
     command line itself.

   4.VDE> DEFINE/KEY/TERMINATE KP7 "SHOW MODULE"

     VDE> DEFINE/KEY/SET_STATE=TEXAS PF3 ""
     VDE> DEFINE/KEY/IF_STATE=TEXAS/TERMINATE KP7 "SHOW FACILITY"

     This example shows how to create two definitions for the KP7
     key using the /SET_STATE and /IF_STATE qualifiers. The first
     command defines KP7 as the SHOW MODULE command and executes
     the command when the key is pressed. This is the default key
     definition for KP7. The second command establishes a new state
     for the key: when you press PF3, the state is set to TEXAS.
     The third command creates a new definition for KP7: when you
     press KP7, VDE executes the SHOW FACILITY command if the state
     has been set to TEXAS. You can thus execute the SHOW MODULE
     command by pressing KP7 by itself, and you can execute the SHOW
     FACILITY command by pressing the PF3 key followed by the KP7
     key.

   5.VDE> DEFINE/KEY PF3 "SET " /SET_STATE=ALTERED
     VDE> DEFINE/KEY KP7 "CONTEXT BUGFIX" /TERMINATE /IF_STATE=ALTERED
     VDE> DEFINE/KEY KP8 "CONTEXT FEATURE_1" /TERMINATE /IF_STATE=ALTERED
     VDE> DEFINE/KEY KP9 "VERIFY" /TERMINATE /IF_STATE=ALTERED

     This example shows how to define four different keys and
     associate them with a state named ALTERED:

     1. The first definition defines the key PF3 as the SET command
        and associates this key with a state named ALTERED.

     2. The second definition defines the keypad key 7 as "CONTEXT
        BUGFIX" and makes it dependent on a state named ALTERED.
        When you press PF3 followed by keypad key 7, VDE executes
        the SET CONTEXT BUGFIX command.

     3. The third definition defines keypad key 8 as "CONTEXT
        FEATURE_1" and also makes it dependent on the ALTERED state.
        When you press PF3 followed by keypad key 8, VDE executes
        the SET CONTEXT FEATURE_1 command.

     4. The fourth definition defines keypad key 9 as "VERIFY" and
        also makes it dependent on the ALTERED state. When you press
        PF3 followed by keypad key 9, VDE executes the SET VERIFY
        command.

symbol-name

   Specifies the name of a command symbol whose definition is to
   be deleted. This symbol must have been defined with a previous
   DEFINE/COMMAND command.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE/COMMAND FOO, FEE

     This example shows how to delete the command definitions for
     symbols FOO and FEE.
 

2  /KEY
   Deletes key definitions that have been established by the
   DEFINE/KEY command. The /KEY qualifier is required and must
   precede any other qualifiers.

   Format

     DELETE/KEY  [key-name]
 

3  Parameter
 

key-name

   Specifies the name of the key to be deleted. If you specify this
   parameter, do not use the /ALL qualifier.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Deletes all key definitions in the specified state; the default
   is the current state. (Use the /STATE qualifier to specify
   states.) If you use the /ALL qualifier, do not specify a key
   name.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether messages are displayed indicating that the
   specified key definitions have been deleted. /LOG causes such
   messages to be displayed and /NOLOG suppresses them.
 

/STATE

      /STATE=(state-name[,...])
      /NOSTATE (default)

   Specifies the name of the state for which the specified key
   definition is to be deleted. The default state is the current
   state. If you specify only one state name, you can omit the
   parentheses. State names can be any appropriate alphanumeric
   string.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DEFINE/KEY PF3 "SHOW LIBRARY" /TERMINATE
     %VDE-I-DEFKEY, DEFAULT key PF3 has been defined
     VDE> <PF3>
     VDE> SHOW LIBRARY
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     VDE> DELETE/KEY PF3
     %VDE-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF3 has been deleted
     VDE> <PF3>
     VDE>

     In this example, the DEFINE/KEY command defines the PF3 key
     on the keypad as SHOW LIBRARY. Later the DELETE/KEY command
     undefines the PF3 key. When the user presses PF3 thereafter,
     only the VDE prompt is displayed.

   2.VDE> DELETE/KEY/ALL
     %VDE-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF1 has been deleted
     %VDE-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF2 has been deleted
     %VDE-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF3 has been deleted
     %VDE-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF4 has been deleted
     VDE>

     Keys PF1 through PF4 had been defined for state DEFAULT.
     In this example, the DELETE/KEY command deletes all key
     definitions in the current state, that is, state DEFAULT. The
     log messages show what key definitions have been deleted.
 

2  ARCHITECTURE
   Deletes one or more architecture table entries in the VDE
   database. Each architecture table entry...

   Requires the DELARCH privilege.

   ARCHITECTURE support is not fully implemented.

   Format

     DELETE ARCHITECTURE  arch-name [, arch-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

arch-name

   The name of the architecture to be deleted. This name may be up
   to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

3  Description
   Under Construction...
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM (default)
      /NOCONFIRM

   Under Construction...
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Under Construction...
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the deleted
   architecture. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   architecture. that you want stored in the VDE database. Typically
   the remark describes the function or purpose of the architecture.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE ARCHITECTURE VAXPDP/REMARK="Version n"
     VDE>

     Under Construction...
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Deletes one or more build jobs from the current VDE database.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     DELETE BUILD_JOB  stream-name [, stream-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream. One or more build jobs in this
   stream are deleted from the database. Use the /IDENTIFICATION
   qualifier to specify the build jobs to delete. If you do not
   specify this qualifier, the most recent build job in the stream
   is deleted.

   You can delete build jobs for more than one stream by using
   wildcard characters in the stream name. The percent sign (%)  in
   a name matches any single character in the position it occupies
   and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the
   position it occupies. Build jobs are deleted for those streams
   whose names match the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE BUILD_JOB command deletes each build job that matches
   the specified stream name and build job identification numbers.
   When a build job is deleted, all information about that build
   job is deleted from the database of the current VDE library. You
   cannot delete a build job that is queued for execution or that is
   currently running. To delete such a build job, stop it using the
   STOP BUILD_JOB command before you delete it.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   build job deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each build job asking whether you want that build
   job deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), the build job is deleted
   from the database. If you answer NO (or N), the build job is
   not deleted. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the
   specified build jobs without asking for confirmation.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=id-range

   Specifies the job identification numbers of the build jobs to
   be deleted from the specified stream. The id-range parameter can
   be a single integer value, a range of integers, or a wildcard
   character. If the parameter is a single integer (for example,
   /IDENT=5), VDE deletes the build job with that identification
   number. If the parameter is a range of integers (specified as
   two build job identification numbers separated by a colon as
   in /IDENT=3:5), VDE deletes all build jobs with identification
   numbers in that range. Finally, if the id-range parameter is the
   asterisk wildcard (as in /IDENT=*), VDE deletes all build jobs
   for the specified stream.

   If you specify a zero or negative build job identification
   number in the id-range parameter, that number is relative to
   the identification number of the most recent build job in the
   stream. For example, if the most recent build job is job 5, then
   /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=5 and /IDENT=-1 is equivalent to
   /IDENT=4.

   If you do not use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, VDE deletes the
   most recent build job for the specified stream.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each build job
   is deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the build job has been deleted from the database and that
   the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a deletion remark string to be stored in the database
   for the deleted build job. The quoted remark string, which can
   be up to 132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark
   that you want to store in the database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE BUILD_JOB V2.0-3/IDENTIFICATION=7
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBDEL, build job 7 for stream V2.0-3 deleted from database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, build job 7 for stream V2.0-3 is deleted from
     the VDE database. The log messages confirm that the build job
     was deleted and that the database transaction successfully
     completed.
 

2  CONTEXT
   Deletes one or more contexts from the current VDE library. Each
   context can be used to specify the default development stream,
   default architecture and default facility for a VDE session.

   Requires CRECTX privilege to delete public contexts.

   Format

     DELETE CONTEXT  ctx-name [, ctx-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

ctx-name

   The name of a context to be deleted from the current VDE library.
   You can delete more than one context at a time by using wildcard
   characters in the context name. The percent sign (%)  in a name
   matches any single character in the position it occupies and the
   asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it
   occupies. Those contexts whose names match the wildcard pattern
   are deleted.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE CONTEXT command deletes each specified context from
   the current VDE database. The command deletes either public
   contexts or your private contexts, depending on whether you
   specify the /PUBLIC or the /PRIVATE qualifier.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   context deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each context asking whether you want that context
   deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that context is deleted
   from the database. If you answer NO (or N), the context is
   not deleted. If you enter a context name with a wildcard
   specification, VDE asks you to confirm the deletion of each
   context whose name matches the wildcard specification. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified contexts
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each context
   has been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the context has been deleted from the database and
   that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/PRIVATE

      /PRIVATE (default)
      /PUBLIC

   Controls whether a private or public context is deleted. The
   /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to delete a context that is private
   to you. The /PUBLIC qualifier causes VDE to delete a context
   that is available to all users of the library. You must have the
   CRECTX privilege to use the /PUBLIC qualifier.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a deletion remark string to be stored in the database
   for the deleted context. The quoted remark string, which can be
   up to 132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark
   that you want stored in the database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE CONTEXT V2RMS
     %VDE-I-CTXDEL, context V2RMS deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example deletes the context V2RMS from the database.
     Because the /PUBLIC qualifier is not specified, VDE deletes
     the private context by this name.
 

2  FACILITY
   Deletes one or more delete-enabled facilities from the current
   VDE library.

   Requires DELFAC privilege.

   Format

     DELETE FACILITY  facil-name [, facil-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

facil-name

   The name of a facility to be deleted from the current VDE
   library. You can delete more than one facility at a time by
   using wildcard characters in the facility name. The percent sign
   (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position it
   occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in
   the position it occupies. Those facilities whose names match the
   wildcard pattern are deleted.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE FACILITY command deletes each specified facility from
   the current VDE database and commits the transaction. It then
   deletes all disk directories associated with each facility.
   When the deletion command completes, the files and CMS library
   associated with the facility will have been vaporized. Should
   protection violations or other errors occur, VDE can be prevented
   from deleting all associated files and directories, and VDE will
   generate one or more informational messages that will provide
   additional details.

   You can only delete a facility if the delete attribute is enabled
   on the facility. If this attribute is disabled, you must enable
   this attribute, using the MODIFY FACILITY /DELETE command, before
   you will be able to delete the facility.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   facility deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each facility asking whether you want that
   facility deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that facility
   is deleted from the library. If you answer NO (or N), the
   facility is not deleted. If you enter a facility name with a
   wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the deletion of
   each facility whose name matches the wildcard specification.
   The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified
   facilities without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each facility
   has been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the facility has been deleted from the library and
   that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the
   deleted facility. The quoted remark string, which can be up to
   132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark that you
   want to store in the database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE FACILITY ACCTNG
     %VDE-I-FACDEL, facility ACCTNG deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, facility ACCTNG is deleted from the current
     VDE library. The log messages confirm that the facility
     was deleted and that the database transaction successfully
     completed.

   2.VDE> DELETE FACILITY FAC1, FAC2, FAC3
     %VDE-I-FACDEL, facility FAC1 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-FACDEL, facility FAC2 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-FACDEL, facility FAC3 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example shows how you can delete multiple facilities
     from a library. The log messages list the facilities that are
     deleted.
 

2  FOLD
   Deletes one or more fold records from the VDE database. A fold
   record is a reminder that a source change should be manually
   "folded" into a given development stream in order to propagate
   the change.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     DELETE FOLD  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module for which a fold record is to be deleted.
   The module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility
   name is omitted, the module is assumed to belong to the default
   facility. If the type name is omitted, VDE deletes fold records
   for all source modules with the specified module name in the
   given facility.

   You can delete fold records for more than one module by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   VDE deletes fold records for all source modules whose names match
   the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Description
   A fold record is a reminder that a source change should be
   manually folded into a given development stream in order to
   propagate the change into that stream. The DELETE FOLD command
   deletes each specified fold record from the VDE database. This
   command is a synonym for the CANCEL FOLD command.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   fold record deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each fold record asking whether you want that
   record deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that fold record
   is deleted from the database. If you answer NO (or N), the
   fold record is not deleted. If you enter a module name with a
   wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the deletion
   of fold records for each module whose name matches the wildcard
   specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the
   specified fold records without asking for confirmation.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=fold-ident

   Specifies the fold record to be deleted. This qualifier is
   required when you have multiple fold records for the same
   module in the same stream. The fold-ident parameter is the fold
   identifier of the fold record to be deleted. The fold identifier
   is the identifier you specified or VDE assigned when you created
   the fold record, usually a small integer value. Use the SHOW FOLD
   command to determine the fold identifier of each fold record.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each fold record
   has been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the fold record has been deleted and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the development stream for which fold records should be
   deleted. The stream-name parameter gives the name of the stream.
   If this qualifier is omitted, VDE deletes fold records for the
   default development stream only.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that fold records are to be deleted on behalf of
   another user. The username parameter specifies the OpenVMS
   username of the other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege
   to use this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE FOLD [CODE]X.FOR/IDENT=1
     %VDE-I-FOLDDEL, fold record 1 for module [CODE]X.FOR has been deleted
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example deletes fold record 1 for module [CODE]X.FOR. The
     log messages confirm that the fold record has been successfully
     deleted.
 

2  GENERATION
   Deletes the most recent generation of a specified module from a
   specified development stream.

   Requires PERFREP privilege.

   Format

     DELETE GENERATION  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of a module whose latest generation in the specified
   development stream is to be deleted. The module name consists of
   an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module
   name, and an optional type name preceded by a period, such as
   [FACIL]MOD1.MAR. If no facility name is specified, the default
   facility is assumed. If no type name is specified, the latest
   generations of all source modules of the specified module name in
   the given facility are deleted.

   You can delete the latest generations of more than one module
   by using wildcard characters in any of the three components of
   the module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any
   single character in the position it occupies and the asterisk
   (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   VDE deletes the latest generation in the specified stream of each
   module whose name matches the wildcard pattern.

   Using the /GENERATION qualifier, you can also delete a generation
   that does not belong to any stream.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE GENERATION command removes the latest generation of
   a specified module from a specified development stream and makes
   the previous generation (the next most recent generation) into
   the latest generation for the stream. The result is that the
   most recent generation is discarded from the stream, so that the
   effect of the REPLACE operation that created that generation is
   undone.

   The removed generation remains in the VDE database as long as
   it remains reachable from at least one development stream or
   has at least one successor generation. However, once a removed
   generation becomes unreachable from all streams and has no
   successors, the DELETE GENERATION command deletes it completely
   from the VDE database and library.

   You cannot delete the first generation of a module (generation 1)
   using this command. The only way to delete the first generation
   is to delete the whole module with the DELETE MODULE command.

   If the specified module is currently reserved in the specified
   stream, VDE terminates that reservation since it is based on a
   module generation that no longer is the latest generation for
   the stream. VDE sends a mail message to notify the owner of the
   reservation that the reservation is lost.

   If you want to delete a module generation that does not belong
   to any development stream, use the /GENERATION qualifier. Do not
   use the /GENERATION qualifier for a generation that belongs to
   a stream; VDE will not delete any generation that belongs to a
   stream or that is not a leaf node in the generation tree.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   generation deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for the latest generation of each module giving the
   name of the generation and asking whether you want to delete the
   generation. If you answer YES (or Y), the generation is deleted.
   If you answer NO (or N), the generation is not deleted. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete each generation without
   asking for confirmation.
 

/GENERATION

      /GENERATION=gen-expr

   Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression
   given by the gen-expr parameter be deleted. If you specify this
   qualifier, do not specify the /STREAM qualifier.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after generations are
   deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that the
   generations have been deleted from the specified development
   stream and that the database transaction has successfully
   committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string that explains why you deleted the
   generation. The quoted remark string can be up to 132 characters
   long.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the latest generation in the development stream
   given by the stream-name parameter be deleted. If both this
   qualifier and the /GENERATION qualifier are omitted, VDE prompts
   you for the stream name.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE GENERATION [FACIL]MODNAM.C /STREAM=V2.0

     %VDE-I-GENDEL, generation [FACIL]MODNAM.C;5(5) deleted from stream V2.0
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> SHOW GENERATION [FACIL]MODNAM.C
     Generation [FACIL]MODNAM.C;4(4)       by user SMITH        on  9-MAY-1990 19:43
     VDE>

     This example deletes the latest generation of module
     [FACIL]MODNAM.C from stream V2.0. The log message shows that
     generation 5 was deleted. The subsequent SHOW GENERATION
     command shows that generation 4 is now the latest generation
     of the module in the stream.
 

2  GROUP
   Deletes one or more groups from the current VDE database.

   Requires CREGRP privilege.

   Format

     DELETE GROUP  group-name [,group-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

group-name

   The name of a source group or build group defined in the default
   development stream that is to be deleted from the database.

   You can delete more than one group at a time by using wildcard
   characters in the group name. The percent sign (%)  in a group
   name matches any single character in the position it occupies and
   the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position
   it occupies. Those groups whose names match the wildcard pattern
   are deleted.
 

3  Description
   This command deletes the database definition of each source group
   or build group listed as a parameter. The /SOURCE or /BUILD
   qualifier determines whether source groups or build groups
   are deleted. Group definitions are deleted only in the default
   development stream. This command does not affect the modules that
   are members of the deleted groups, only the definitions of the
   groups.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BUILD

   Specifies whether source groups or build groups are deleted. The
   /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to delete the source groups with the
   specified names. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to delete the
   build groups with the specified names. If neither qualifier is
   specified, VDE deletes source groups.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/SOURCE

   Specifies whether source groups or build groups are deleted. The
   /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to delete the source groups with the
   specified names. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to delete the
   build groups with the specified names. If neither qualifier is
   specified, VDE deletes source groups.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   group deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message giving the name of the group and asking if you want
   it deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), the group definition is
   deleted from the database. If you answer NO (or N), the group
   is not deleted. If you use a group specification that contains
   wildcard characters, VDE asks you to confirm the deletion of each
   group that matches the wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM
   qualifier causes VDE to delete all specified groups without
   asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each group has
   been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the group has been deleted and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the
   deleted group. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   group or its deletion that you want to store in the database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE GROUP GRPNAM
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRPNAM deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the source group called GRPNAM is deleted
     from the VDE database in the default stream. The log messages
     confirm that the group was deleted and that the corresponding
     database transaction completed successfully.

   2.VDE> DELETE GROUP/BUILD GRP1, GRP2, GRP33
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP1 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP2 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP33 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example shows how to specify a list of group names with
     the DELETE GROUP command. The log messages list the groups that
     were deleted. Because the /BUILD qualifier is specified, this
     command only deletes build groups.

   3.VDE> DELETE GROUP/CONFIRM GROUP_1, GROUP_2
     Delete group GROUP_1 ? [No]: Y
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GROUP_1 deleted from the database
     Delete group GROUP_2 ? [No]: N
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the /CONFIRM qualifier. This qualifier
     causes VDE to ask the user whether each specified group should
     be deleted. For group GROUP_1, the user answers Y (for YES)
     and that group is deleted from the database, as the log message
     shows. For group GROUP_2, the user answers N (for NO), that
     group is not deleted, and no log message is displayed. The
     final log message indicates that the database transaction for
     the whole command has successfully committed.

   4.VDE> DELETE GROUP GRP*
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP1 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP2 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP22 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP33 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the group specification (GRP*) contains
     a wildcard character. The asterisk matches zero or more
     characters. Source groups GRP1, GRP2, GRP22, and GRP33 match
     the group specification and are deleted as the log messages
     show.

   5.VDE> DELETE GROUP GRP%
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP1 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-GRPDEL, group GRP2 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example is identical to the previous example except
     that the percent sign is used as a wildcard character. The
     percent sign matches exactly one character. As a result, source
     groups GRP1 and GRP2 (but not GRP22 or GRP33) match the group
     specification (GRP%) and are deleted.
 

2  MODULE
   Deletes one or more modules from the current VDE library.

   Requires DELMOD privilege or, in some cases, CREMOD privilege.

   Format

     DELETE MODULE  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of a module to be deleted from the current VDE library.
   This name consists of a module name and a type name separated
   by a period (such as MOD1.PAS) and can be preceded by an
   optional facility name enclosed in square brackets (as in
   [FACIL]MOD1.PAS). If no facility name is specified, the current
   default facility is assumed.

   You can delete more than one module at a time by using wildcard
   characters in any of the three components of the module name. The
   percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the
   position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more
   characters in the position it occupies. Those modules whose names
   match the wildcard pattern are deleted.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE MODULE command deletes each specified module from the
   current VDE library. When a module is deleted, VDE deletes its
   database record and removes the module from the build dependency
   graph and from any group definitions. After committing the
   database transaction, VDE also deletes each specified module's
   delta file (CMS element). However, VDE does not remove the module
   from any stream-specific disk directories such as clear-copy
   areas or object directories.

   Normally, you must have the DELMOD privilege to delete a module.
   However, if you have created a particular module and you have
   not yet created the first generation of the module (normally
   done by replacing the first generation into the VDE library), you
   are allowed to delete the module without the DELMOD privilege.
   In this particular case, you must have the CREMOD privilege,
   which was required for the initial module creation. The creator
   of a module can thus correct simple mistakes, such as misnaming
   the module, by simply deleting the module before the initial
   replacement is performed. The outstanding reservation on the
   module is canceled, the module is removed from any reservation
   session that it might be included in, and the module never
   appears in the VDE library. For further information on the CREATE
   MODULE command, see CREATE MODULE.

   If you are not the creator of a module or if the module already
   has at least one generation, you must have the DELMOD privilege
   to delete it and you can only delete a module if the delete
   attribute is set for the module. If this attribute is not set,
   you must set it with the MODIFY MODULE /DELETE command before you
   can delete the module.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   module deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each module asking whether you want that module
   deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that module is deleted from
   the library. If you answer NO (or N), the module is not deleted.
   If you enter a module name with a wildcard specification, VDE
   asks you to confirm the deletion of each module that matches the
   wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
   delete the specified modules without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each module
   has been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the module has been deleted from the library and
   that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the
   deleted module. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark that you want
   to store in the database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE MODULE MOD1.PAS
     %VDE-I-MODDEL, module [CODE]MOD1.PAS deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, module MOD1.PAS is deleted from the current
     VDE library. Since no facility name is specified, the module
     is assumed to belong to the current default facility, facility
     CODE. The log messages confirm that the module was deleted and
     that the database transaction successfully completed.

   2.VDE> DELETE MODULE [FACIL]FOO.MAR, FOO.OBJ, [RMS]MOD2.FOR
     %VDE-I-MODDEL, module [FACIL]FOO.MAR deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-MODDEL, module [FACIL]FOO.OBJ deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-MODDEL, module [RMS]MOD2.FOR deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example shows how to delete multiple modules from the
     library. The log messages list the deleted modules.
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   Deletes one or more queued replacements from the VDE database to
   free up database space. Most users should use CANCEL REPLACEMENT
   instead.

   Requires DELREP privilege.

   Format

     DELETE REPLACEMENT  rep-name [, rep-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of a queued replacement to be deleted from the current
   VDE library. You can delete more than one replacement at a time
   by using wildcard characters in the replacement name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. Those queued replacements whose
   names match the wildcard pattern are deleted.

   Do not specify the rep-name parameter if you use the
   /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE REPLACEMENT command deletes each specified queued
   replacement from the current VDE database. This command is
   used to remove replacement records from the database to free up
   database space. It can be used to delete both current replacement
   records and historical replacement data. For this reason, it
   requires the DELREP privilege.

   Users who simply want to cancel a current replacement should use
   the CANCEL REPLACEMENT command. This command requires the RESREP
   privilege to cancel your own replacement or the PERFREP privilege
   to cancel another user's replacement.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   replacement deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each replacement asking whether you want that
   replacement deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement
   is deleted from the database. If you answer NO (or N), the
   replacement is not deleted. If you enter a replacement name with
   a wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the deletion of
   each replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification.
   The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified
   replacements without asking for confirmation.
 

/HISTORY

   Specifies that replacement history be deleted. Replacement
   history consists of database records for past replacements that
   have already been performed; it does not include currently queued
   replacements. When used with the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, the
   /HISTORY qualifier deletes information for chronological ranges
   of past replacements.

   If you omit the /HISTORY qualifier, VDE deletes currently queued
   replacements only.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=id-range

   Specifies that the replacements with the unique Replacement Ids
   given by the id-range parameter be deleted. Do not specify the
   rep-name parameter when you use this qualifier.

   VDE assigns a unique Replacement Id to each immediate or queued
   replacement into the VDE library. VDE assigns Replacement Ids
   in chronological order so that the first replacement into the
   library has Id value 1, the next has Id value 2, and so on. When
   you use this qualifier, all replacements that have Id values in
   the range given by the id-range parameter are deleted.

   The id-range parameter can be a single integer value, a range of
   integers, or a wildcard character. If the parameter is a single
   integer (for example, /IDENT=5), VDE deletes the replacement
   with that Replacement Id. If the parameter is a range of
   integers (specified as two integers separated by a colon as in
   /IDENT=3:5), VDE deletes the replacements with Ids in that range.
   Finally, if the id-range parameter is the asterisk wildcard
   character (as in /IDENT=*), VDE deletes all replacements.

   If you specify a zero or negative number in the id-range
   parameter, that number is relative to the largest Replacement
   Id value for the VDE library (the latest replacement). For
   example, if the latest replacement has Replacement Id 250, then
   /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=250 and /IDENT=-1 is equivalent
   to /IDENT=249.

   The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier can be used with the /HISTORY
   qualifier to delete historical replacement information from the
   VDE database. Deleting such information allows database space to
   be reused.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement
   has been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the replacement has been deleted from the database
   and that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE REPLACEMENT ANDERSON-1
     %VDE-I-REPDEL, replacement ANDERSON-1 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, replacement ANDERSON-1 is deleted from the
     VDE database. The log messages confirm that the replacement
     was deleted and that the database transaction successfully
     completed.
 

2  SCRIPT
   Deletes a VDE script from the VDE database.

   Requires CRESCRP privilege.

   Format

     DELETE SCRIPT
 

3  Description
   The DELETE SCRIPT command deletes a specified VDE script from
   the VDE database. VDE only deletes the script of the specified
   type and segment number that belongs to the default development
   stream.

   You must specify a script-type qualifier to select the script you
   want deleted. See the description of the CREATE SCRIPT command
   for an explanation of the different types of scripts and how
   scripts are selected using script-type qualifiers. You must
   also specify the script segment number unless the default value
   applies.

   Keywords used within scripts are documented in Script Keywords,
   while script functions are in Script Functions, and script types
   are in Script Types. For other script-related commands, also see
   CREATE SCRIPT, EXTRACT SCRIPT, INVOKE SCRIPT, MODIFY SCRIPT, and
   SHOW SCRIPT.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BUILD

   Specifies that the default stream's BUILD script be deleted.
 

/COMPILE

      /COMPILE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's COMPILE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   script deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each script asking whether you want that script
   deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), the script is deleted from the
   database. If you answer NO (or N), the script is not deleted. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete the specified scripts
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/COPY

      /COPY=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's COPY script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/CREATE_FACILITY

   Specifies that the script that VDE invokes when a new facility is
   created should be deleted.
 

/DELETE_GENERATION

      /DELETE_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's DELETE_GENERATION script with
   the specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/DIFFERENCES

      /DIFFERENCES=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's DIFFERENCES script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/FETCH

      /FETCH=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's FETCH script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/INSERT_GENERATION

      /INSERT_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's INSERT_GENERATION script with
   the specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/LINK

      /LINK=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's LINK script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the script
   is deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the script has been deleted and that the database
   transaction has committed successfully.
 

/NEW_STREAM

      /NEW_STREAM=fac-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NEW_STREAM script with the
   specified fac-name specification be deleted.
 

/NOKEEP

      /NOKEEP=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NOKEEP script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/REPLACE

      /REPLACE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's REPLACE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/RESERVE

      /RESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's RESERVE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/SEGMENT

      /SEGMENT=seg-num

   Specifies the segment number of the script to delete. The seg-num
   parameter specifies the integer segment number. If you omit this
   qualifier, VDE deletes the script with segment number 10.
 

/SET_FACILITY

      /SET_FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that the default stream's SET_FACILITY script with the
   specified fac-name specification be deleted.
 

/SET_STREAM

   Specifies that the default stream's SET_STREAM script be deleted.
 

/STAGING

      /STAGING=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's STAGING script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

/UNRESERVE

      /UNRESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's UNRESERVE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be deleted.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE SCRIPT/COMPILE=[CODE]*.C
     %VDE-I-SCRPDEL, script deleted from the database
      script to compile module [CODE]*.C (segment 10)
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example deletes the script to compile all C modules in
     facility CODE. The log messages identify the script and show
     that it was successfully deleted. The script is only deleted
     for the default development stream.
 

2  STEP
   Deletes build-step dependency information from the VDE database.
   This information specifies the input and output modules of a
   given compile, copy, or link step.

   Requires CRESTEP privilege.

   Format

     DELETE STEP  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of the module that is compiled, copied, or linked by the
   build step to be deleted from the database. This name consists
   of an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, a
   module name, and an optional type name preceded by a period (for
   example, [FACNAM]MOD1.PAS). If no facility name is specified,
   the current default facility is assumed. If no type name is
   specified, all build steps for modules with the given facility
   name and module name are deleted.

   You can delete more than one build step at a time by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those build steps whose module names match the wildcard pattern
   are deleted.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE STEP command deletes all dependency information for a
   given build step so that the database no longer records the input
   and output modules for the step. The modules themselves remain
   in the database; only their relationships to the build step are
   lost.

   The command deletes build-step dependency information from only
   the default development stream. To delete build steps in more
   than one stream, you must repeat the DELETE STEP command for each
   stream. For each stream, first enter the SET STREAM command to
   set the development stream, then enter the DELETE STEP command to
   delete the desired build-step dependencies from the database.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/COMPILE

   Specifies the kind of build step to be deleted. /COMPILE deletes
   the compile step, /COPY deletes the copy step, and /LINK deletes
   the link step for the specified module.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/COPY

   Specifies the kind of build step to be deleted. /COMPILE deletes
   the compile step, /COPY deletes the copy step, and /LINK deletes
   the link step for the specified module.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/LINK

   Specifies the kind of build step to be deleted. /COMPILE deletes
   the compile step, /COPY deletes the copy step, and /LINK deletes
   the link step for the specified module.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM (default)
      /NOCONFIRM

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the build-
   step definition deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
   print a message for each build step asking whether you want that
   step deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), the build-step definition
   is deleted. If you answer NO (or N), the build-step definition
   is not deleted. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to delete all
   specified build-step definitions without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed when build-step
   definitions are deleted from the database. The /LOG qualifier
   causes the messages to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier
   suppresses them. The messages indicate that each build step has
   been deleted and that the database transaction has committed
   successfully.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE STEP [RMS]FOO.MAR
     %VDE-I-COMSTEPDEL, compile step for module [RMS]FOO.MAR deleted from database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example deletes all build dependency information for the
     compilation of module FOO.MAR in facility RMS.

   2.VDE> DELETE STEP/LINK FOO.EXE, MOD1.EXE
     %VDE-I-LNKSTEPDEL, link step for module [CODE]FOO.EXE deleted from database
     %VDE-I-LNKSTEPDEL, link step for module [CODE]MOD1.EXE deleted from database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command deletes the dependency information for the link
     steps for modules FOO.EXE and MOD1.EXE in the current default
     facility, facility CODE.
 

2  STREAM
   Deletes one or more development streams from the current VDE
   library.

   Requires DELSTRM privilege.

   Format

     DELETE STREAM  stream-name [, stream-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a stream to be deleted from the current VDE library.
   You can delete more than one stream at a time by using wildcard
   characters. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those streams whose names match the wildcard pattern are deleted.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE STREAM command deletes each specified development
   stream from the current VDE library. When a stream is deleted,
   all database information associated with the stream is deleted.
   The deleted database information includes the stream's group
   definitions, scripts, and build dependency graph. The stream is
   also removed from any stream successor chains it belongs to. The
   stream's disk directories remain unchanged, however; they are not
   deleted.

   You can only delete a stream if the delete attribute is set for
   the stream. If this attribute is not set, you must set it with
   the MODIFY STREAM /DELETE command before you can delete the
   stream. Unless the library's allow-deletion attribute is set,
   the stream must also be closed before it can be deleted. (Use
   MODIFY STREAM /CLOSED to close a stream.)
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   stream deleted. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each stream asking whether you want that stream
   deleted. If you answer YES (or Y), that stream is deleted from
   the library. If you answer NO (or N), the stream is not deleted.
   If you enter a stream name with a wildcard specification, VDE
   asks you to confirm the deletion of each stream whose name
   matches the wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier
   causes VDE to delete the specified streams without asking for
   confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each stream
   has been deleted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the stream has been deleted from the library and
   that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the
   deleted stream. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark that you want
   to store in the database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE STREAM V3.1-1
     %VDE-I-STRMDEL, stream V3.1-1 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, development stream V3.1-1 is deleted from the
     current VDE library. The log messages confirm that the stream
     was deleted and that the database transaction successfully
     completed.

   2.VDE> DELETE STREAM V2.0-BL1, V2.0-BL2, V2.0-BL3
     %VDE-I-STRMDEL, stream V2.0-BL1 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-STRMDEL, stream V2.0-BL2 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-STRMDEL, stream V2.0-BL3 deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example shows how to specify a list of stream names to
     delete multiple streams from the library. The log messages list
     the deleted streams.
 

2  USER
   Deletes user records from the database in the current VDE
   library. This command deletes the database record for each user
   whose OpenVMS username is listed as a parameter and denies that
   user access to the current VDE library.

   Requires CREUSR privilege.

   Format

     DELETE USER  username [, username...]
 

3  Parameter
 

username

   The OpenVMS username of the VDE user whose record is deleted
   from the database of the current VDE library. You can delete more
   than one username at a time by using wildcard characters. The
   percent sign (%)  in a username matches any single character in
   the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or
   more characters in the position it occupies. Those users whose
   usernames match the wildcard pattern are deleted.
 

3  Description
   The DELETE USER command disables access by, and disallows any
   command specification of, the specified user. It also cancels all
   review and notification entries for the specified user.

   The command marks the specified user records in the database
   as deleted, though the user records are not physically deleted
   from the database. As a result of this behaviour, records in the
   VDE database can continue to refer to the user records marked
   as deleted. For example, the record for each module indicates
   who created the module, and the SHOW MODULE command shows the
   creator's username and full name string. That information is
   found in the creator's user record, even if the creator has
   since left the project and a DELETE USER command has marked the
   associated user record as deleted.

   A user that lacks a matching user entry, or has a deleted
   user entry, will be unable to access the VDE utility Further,
   usernames that have been deleted will not be accepted on VDE
   commands. However, the username record does remain within the
   database, should manual recovery be required at a later date.

   Lists of valid VDE users can also be automatically maintained
   using the VDE/READ_UAF command. VDE/READ_UAF compares the current
   list of users stored in the VDE database with those stored in the
   OpenVMS system authorization database (SYSUAF).

   As an alternative to the DELETE USER command, one could clear all
   bits in the associated privilege mask, and/or one could use the
   MODIFY USER/USER command to rename the user. These steps prevent
   the user from performing operations on the VDE database, but
   these options preserve the ability to specify the username in VDE
   commands.

      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each user
   record deleted from the database. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes
   VDE to print a message for each user record giving the username
   and asking whether you want that record deleted. If you answer
   YES (or Y), that user record is deleted from the database.
   If you answer NO (or N), the user record is not deleted. If
   you enter a username with a wildcard specification, VDE asks
   you to confirm the deletion of each username that matches the
   wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
   delete the specified users from the database without asking for
   confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each user record
   has been deleted. These messages indicate that the user has been
   deleted from the database and that the database transaction has
   successfully committed. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for the
   deleted user record. The quoted remark string, which can be up to
   132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark that you
   want to store in the database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DELETE USER SMITH
     %VDE-I-USERDEL, user SMITH deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the record for user SMITH is deleted from
     the database of the current VDE library. The log messages
     confirm that the user record was deleted and that the database
     transaction successfully completed.

   2.VDE> DELETE USER SMITH, DOE, JONES
     %VDE-I-USERDEL, user SMITH deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-USERDEL, user DOE deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-USERDEL, user JONES deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example shows how to delete multiple users from the
     database. The log messages list the users who have been
     deleted.

   3.VDE> DELETE USER/CONFIRM SMITH, DOE
     Delete user SMITH ? [No]: Y
     %VDE-I-USERDEL, user SMITH deleted from the database
     Delete user DOE ? [No]: N
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the /CONFIRM qualifier. This qualifier
     causes VDE to ask the user whether each specified user record
     should be deleted from the database. For user SMITH, the
     answer is Y (for YES) and that user record is deleted from
     the database. For user DOE, the answer is N (for NO) and that
     user record is not deleted. Hence there is no log message for
     user DOE. The final log message indicates that the database
     transaction for the whole command has successfully committed.

   4.VDE> DELETE USER %O*
     %VDE-I-USERDEL, user DOE deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-USERDEL, user JONES deleted from the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the username specification (%O*) contains
     wildcard characters. All usernames with an "O" in the second
     position match the specification. Hence users DOE and JONES are
     deleted from the database.
 

1  DIFFERENCES
   Displays the differences between any two module generations.

   Format

     DIFFERENCES  gen-spec-1 [gen-spec-2]
 

2  Parameter
 

gen-spec-1

   Specifies the first module generation to be compared. The
   generation specification consists of the following in order:

   o  an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets

   o  a module name

   o  a type name

   o  an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon

   An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

   If you omit the facility name, a module generation from the
   default facility is compared. If you omit the generation number,
   the most recent generation of the module in the specified (or
   default) stream is compared.

   If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number
   is relative to the most recent generation of the module in the
   stream specified by the /STREAM qualifier (or the default stream
   if that qualifier is omitted). For example, if the most recent
   generation is generation 5, then generation 0 is the same as
   generation 5 and generation -1 is the same as generation 4.

   If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE compares the
   generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores
   the generation number on the gen-spec-1 parameter.
 

gen-spec-2

   Specifies the second module generation to be compared. This
   parameter can have the same form as the first parameter (gen-
   spec-1) to fully specify a VDE generation. If the facility,
   module, and type names are the same as for the first parameter,
   this second parameter can be abbreviated to just the generation
   number, optionally preceded by a semicolon. For example, ";5" or
   just "5" is enough to specify generation 5 of the module given by
   the gen-spec-1 parameter.

   If the gen-spec-2 parameter is omitted, VDE compares the
   generation given by the gen-spec-1 parameter with the immediately
   preceding generation. You can also use the /GENERATION and
   /STREAM qualifiers to compare other generations of the same
   module.
 

2  Description
   The DIFFERENCES command determines the differences between any
   two module generations in the VDE library. It fetches the two
   specified generations into a scratch directory and runs the DCL
   DIFFERENCES command in a subprocess to compare the texts of the
   two generations and to display the differences between them on
   your terminal.

   The command fetches the specified generations into a scratch
   directory determined as follows. If logical name VDE$SCRATCH
   is defined, VDE fetches the files into the directory that
   this logical name is bound to. If this logical name is not
   defined, VDE fetches the files into a VDE-created subdirectory
   [.VDE$SCRATCH] under the current SYS$SCRATCH directory. (By
   default, SYS$SCRATCH is defined as your SYS$LOGIN login
   directory. This logical name can be redefined by a user to
   reference a user-created subdirectory; all scratch files can
   thus be corraled in a particular subdirectory.) VDE creates
   the [.VDE$SCRATCH] subdirectory if it does not already exist,
   and defines the logical name VDE$SCRATCH to reference it. VDE
   then spawns a subprocess to run the DCL DIFFERENCES command and
   display the differences. VDE deletes the fetched files at the
   end of the command unless you specify the /KEEP qualifier. The
   difference output goes to your terminal by default, but you can
   direct it to a file using the /OUTPUT qualifier.

   Although the DIFFERENCES command can compute the differences
   between any two generations in the VDE library, it is almost
   always used to compare two generations of the same module. For
   this reason, you can reduce the second generation specification
   parameter so it consists of only a generation number. The
   following example compares generations 5 and 2 of module
   [FACIL]MOD.TYP for your default stream:

   VDE> DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP;5 ;2

   You can also omit the second generation specification parameter
   entirely. In this case, the specified generation is compared to
   its immediate predecessor. The following command thus compares
   generation 5 with generation 4:

   VDE> DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP;5

   When you omit the second parameter, you can use the /GENERATION
   qualifier to specify the CMS generation expressions of the two
   generations to compare. For example, the following command
   compares the generations with CMS generation expressions 10A2
   and 11B1:

   VDE> DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP/GENERATION=(10A2,11B1)

   You can also use the /STREAM qualifier to specify that the latest
   generations from two streams be compared. The following example
   illustrates this use of the /STREAM qualifier:

   VDE> DIFFERENCES [FACIL]MOD.TYP/STREAM=(V2.0,V2.2)

   This example compares the latest generations of the given module
   in streams V2.0 and V2.2.

   In addition to accepting certain VDE-specific qualifiers,
   the DIFFERENCES command accepts all qualifiers that the DCL
   DIFFERENCES command accepts. These qualifiers are simply passed
   through to the subprocess that runs the OpenVMS DIFFERENCES
   program.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/GENERATION

      /GENERATION=gen-expr

   Specifies that the module generation that has the CMS generation
   expression given by the gen-expr parameter be compared. If this
   qualifier is omitted, VDE uses the generation given by the
   generation number on the module-name parameter. If both this
   qualifier and the generation number are omitted, the command uses
   the latest generation of the module for the specified development
   stream.
 

/KEEP

   Specifies that one or both of the fetched and compared module
   generations be retained in the scratch directory after the
   command completes. If this qualifier is omitted, the files
   containing those generations are deleted after the differences
   are computed. If you specify the /KEEP qualifier after the gen-
   spec-1 parameter, the file containing that generation is kept.
   Likewise, if you specify the /KEEP qualifier after the gen-spec-2
   parameter, the file containing that generation is kept. If you
   specify the qualifier after the DIFFERENCES keyword or after both
   parameters, the files containing both generations are kept.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the generation to be compared should be taken
   from the development stream given by the stream-name parameter.
   If this qualifier is omitted, the generation is taken from your
   default stream unless you use the /GENERATION qualifier.
 

/DIFFERENCES-Qualifiers

   The /CHANGE_BAR, /COMMENT_DELIMITER, /IGNORE, /MAXIMUM_
   DIFFERENCES, /MATCH, /MERGED, /MODE, /NUMBER, /NONUMBER, /OUTPUT,
   /PARALLEL, /SEPARATED, /SLP, /WIDTH and /WINDOW qualifiers are
   passed through to the spawned DCL DIFFERENCES command without
   change. See the description of the DIFFERENCES command in
   the OpenVMS DCL Dictionary manual for a description of these
   qualifiers and their parameters.

     This example compares the default stream's two most recent
     generations of module [FACIL]A.B32 and displays their
     differences on the terminal.
 

1  EXIT
   Ends the VDE session or ends execution of commands in a command
   procedure.

   Format

     EXIT
 

2  Parameters
   None.
 

2  Description
   When you enter the EXIT command at the terminal, you end the
   current VDE session. (Pressing Ctrl/Z also ends a VDE session.)
   When VDE executes an EXIT command in a command procedure, it
   returns control to the command stream that invoked the command
   procedure. That command stream may be the terminal or another
   command procedure.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/KEPT_PROCESS

   If you enter the EXIT/KEPT_PROCESS command at the terminal (not
   in a VDE command procedure) and the VDE utility is running in
   a kept subprocess, this qualifier causes VDE to terminate that
   subprocess before it returns you to DCL level. The advantage of
   terminating the kept subprocess is that it no longer consumes
   resources. The disadvantage is that your next VDE command will
   require more time to reactivate the VDE image and reconnect to
   the VDE database.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> EXIT
     $

     This example shows how the EXIT command returns control to DCL.
 

1  EXTRACT
 

2  SCRIPT
   Extracts a VDE script from the VDE database and writes it to a
   file.

   Format

     EXTRACT SCRIPT  file-spec
 

3  Parameter
 

file-spec

   Specifies the OpenVMS file specification for the output file
   that will contains the text of the extracted script. If you
   omit the directory specification from the file-spec parameter,
   your current default directory is assumed. If you omit the file
   extension from the file-spec parameter, file extension VDESCRIPT
   is assumed.
 

3  Description
   The EXTRACT SCRIPT command reads a specified VDE script from
   the VDE database and writes it to an ASCII text file. VDE only
   extracts the script of the specified type and segment number
   that belongs to the default development stream. You can use the
   EXTRACT SCRIPT command when you want to get a script into a file
   so that you can edit it and then reinsert it into the database
   with a subsequent CREATE SCRIPT command.

   You must specify a script-type qualifier to select the script you
   want extracted. See the description of the CREATE SCRIPT command
   for an explanation of the format of scripts, the different
   types of scripts, and how scripts are selected using script-
   type qualifiers. You must also specify the script segment number
   unless the default value applies.

   Keywords used within scripts are documented in Script Keywords,
   while script functions are in Script Functions, and script types
   are in Script Types. For other script-related commands, also see
   CREATE SCRIPT, DELETE SCRIPT, INVOKE SCRIPT, MODIFY SCRIPT, and
   SHOW SCRIPT.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BUILD

   Specifies that the default stream's BUILD script be extracted.
 

/COMPILE

      /COMPILE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's COMPILE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/COPY

      /COPY=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's COPY script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/CREATE_FACILITY

   Specifies that the script that VDE invokes when a new facility is
   created should be extracted.
 

/DELETE_GENERATION

      /DELETE_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's DELETE_GENERATION script with
   the specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/DIFFERENCES

      /DIFFERENCES=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's DIFFERENCES script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/FETCH

      /FETCH=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's FETCH script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/INSERT_GENERATION

      /INSERT_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's INSERT_GENERATION script with
   the specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/LINK

      /LINK=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's LINK script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the script is
   extracted. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate
   that the script has been extracted and identify the output file.
 

/NEW_STREAM

      /NEW_STREAM=fac-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NEW_STREAM script with the
   specified fac-name specification be extracted.
 

/NOKEEP

      /NOKEEP=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NOKEEP script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/REPLACE

      /REPLACE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's REPLACE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/RESERVE

      /RESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's RESERVE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/SEGMENT

      /SEGMENT=seg-num

   Specifies the segment number of the script to extract. The seg-
   num parameter specifies the integer segment number. If you omit
   this qualifier, VDE extracts the script with segment number 10.
 

/SET_FACILITY

      /SET_FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that the default stream's SET_FACILITY script with the
   specified fac-name specification be extracted.
 

/SET_STREAM

   Specifies that the default stream's SET_STREAM script be
   extracted.
 

/STAGING

      /STAGING=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's STAGING script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

/UNRESERVE

      /UNRESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's UNRESERVE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be extracted.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> EXTRACT SCRIPT/COMPILE=[CODE]*.C [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C
     %VDE-I-SCRPEXTR, script extracted to file DEV$:[MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT;1
      script to compile module [CODE]*.C (segment 10)
     VDE> EXIT
     $ TYPE [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT
     ! Script to compile a C module.
     !
     EMIT "$ SET VERIFY"
     EMIT "$ DEFINE/NOLOG SRC$ ", $DIR(SRC)
     EMIT "$ DEFINE/NOLOG OBJ$ ", $DIR(OBJ)
     EMIT "$ CC/DEBUG/OBJ=OBJ$:/ANA=OBJ$: SRC$:",$MODTYP
     EMIT "$ VDE/DEPEND C OBJ$:",$MOD,".ANA"
     EXIT
     $

     This example extracts the script to compile C modules
     in facility CODE. VDE writes the script into file
     DEV$:[MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT. The subsequent TYPE command
     shows that the file contains the text of the script.
 

1  FETCH
   Retrieves a generation of one or more source modules from the
   current VDE library.

   Format

     FETCH  gen-spec [, gen-spec...] ["remark"]
 

2  Parameter
 

gen-spec

   Specifies a generation of a source module in the default stream
   to be retrieved from the library. A generation specification
   consists of the following in order:

   o  an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets

   o  a module name

   o  an optional type name preceded by a period

   o  an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon

   An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

   If you omit the facility name, modules from the default facility
   are fetched. If you omit the type name, all source modules with
   the specified module name in the specified facility are fetched.
   If you omit the generation number, the most recent generation of
   the module in the requested development stream is fetched. This
   is either the stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier or the
   default development stream.

   If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number
   is relative to the most recent generation of the module in the
   requested development stream. For example, if the most recent
   generation is generation 5, then generation 0 is the same as
   generation 5 and generation -1 is the same as generation 4.

   If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE fetches the
   generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores
   the generation number on the gen-spec parameter.

   You can fetch more than one module by using wildcard characters
   in the facility name, module name, or type name. (Wildcard
   characters are not allowed in the generation number.) The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. Those source modules whose names
   match the wildcard pattern are fetched.

   You can also fetch multiple modules by specifying the name of a
   source group instead of a generation expression. Source groups
   are created with the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group
   name, the latest generation of each module that is a member of
   the group is copied to your directory.
 

"remark"

   Specifies a remark string to be logged in the history file with
   this command, usually to explain why the command was entered.
   Specifying the remark parameter is equivalent to specifying the
   /REMARK qualifier after the FETCH keyword.
 

2  Description
   The FETCH command copies the specified generation of a module
   from the VDE library to a file in your default directory or the
   directory specified with the /OUTPUT qualifier. The module is
   not reserved from the library nor can it be replaced into the VDE
   library. You can fetch a module whether or not it is reserved.

   The presence or absence of a remark determines whether the
   FETCH transaction is recorded in the CMS history file for the
   facility. If you enter a remark, VDE records the transaction in
   the history file. If you enter a null remark, VDE does not record
   the transaction in the history file.

   When you fetch a generation of a module from a VDE library, VDE
   restores the file's creation time, revision time, record format,
   and record attributes. The file that is placed in your directory
   has the same creation and revision times as the file that created
   the generation that you are fetching.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   module fetched. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each module generation that you have specified asking
   whether you want to fetch that generation. If you answer YES (or
   Y), the module is fetched. If you answer NO (or N), the module
   is not fetched. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to fetch each
   specified module generation without asking for confirmation.
 

/GENERATION

      /GENERATION=gen-expr

   Specifies that the module generation with the CMS generation
   expression given by the gen-expr parameter be fetched from the
   VDE library. When this qualifier is specified, the generation
   number specified on the gen-spec parameter is ignored.
 

/HISTORY

      /HISTORY[="string"]

   Specifies that history information is to be included in the file
   placed in your directory. The history of the module lists the
   generations that preceded the current generation of the module.
   Each generation produces one line of history information in the
   output file. This line gives the CMS generation number, user
   name, date, time, and remark associated with the generation.

   The quoted string specifies the format of the history line. The
   quoted string must contain the characters #H or #B (lower case
   is allowed) and can contain other printing characters (such as
   comment delimiters). Each history line is formed by inserting
   the history information where you specify #H or #B in the history
   string. If you specify #H, the history information is inserted
   at the end of the file and if you specify #B it is inserted at
   the beginning of the file. To include a quotation mark in the
   output history string, type it twice ("").  To include a number
   sign (#)  in the output history string, type it twice (##). If
   the string parameter is omitted, VDE uses the module's default
   history string.

   If the /HISTORY and /NOHISTORY qualifiers are both omitted, the
   FETCH command generates history information only if the history
   attribute is enabled for the module. This attribute is set with
   the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command.
 

/NOHISTORY

   Specifies that history information is not to be appended to the
   output file placed in your directory.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each module
   generation is fetched. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to
   be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that
   the modules have been fetched and that the database transaction
   has successfully committed.
 

/MERGE

      /MERGE=stream-name
      /MERGE=(gen-expr)

   Controls whether another generation of the module (called the
   merge generation) is to be merged with the generation that
   is being fetched (called the retrieved generation). If you
   specify the /MERGE qualifier with the stream-name parameter, the
   merge generation is the latest generation of the module in the
   specified stream. If you specify the /MERGE qualifier with the
   gen-expr parameter enclosed in parentheses, the merge generation
   is the generation with the specified generation expression (for
   example, "2A3").

   When you specify the /MERGE qualifier, VDE merges the lines of
   the retrieved generation with the lines of the merge generation
   and delivers the merged text as a single file to your output
   directory. The file that is placed in your directory has the
   current creation and revision times. The merge generation cannot
   be on the same line of descent as the retrieved generation. When
   there is a conflict between blocks of one or more lines, VDE
   includes the conflicting lines and flags the conflict.

   VDE uses the callable interface to CMS to provide the merge
   capability. For a detailed explanation of how two generations are
   merged and how CMS (and therefore VDE) treats conflicts between
   the generations, see the CMS documentation.
 

/NOTES

      /NOTES[="string"]

   Specifies that CMS notes are to be appended to the lines of the
   output file. CMS notes indicate in what module generation each
   source line was created.

   The quoted string specifies the format of the note. The quoted
   string can contain text (including the appropriate comment
   delimiter) and the characters #G or #g. The CMS generation
   expression of the generation in which the line first appeared
   in inserted where you specify #G or #g. The resulting string is
   appended to the end of the output line. To include a quotation
   mark in the output notes string, type it twice ("").  To include
   a number sign (#)  in the output notes string, type it twice
   (##).  If the string parameter is omitted, VDE uses the module's
   default notes string. (You set the default notes string with the
   CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command.)

   If the /NOTES and /NONOTES qualifiers are both omitted, the
   FETCH command generates CMS notes only if the notes attribute
   is enabled for the module. This attribute is set with the CREATE
   MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command.
 

/NONOTES

   Specifies that CMS notes are not to be appended to the lines of
   the file placed in your directory.
 

/NOOUTPUT

   Specifies that the fetch operation is to be performed along with
   any history processing and error checking but that no output file
   is to be created.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-specification

   Directs VDE to write the fetched module to the specified file.
   If you omit the directory from the file specification, VDE writes
   the file to your default directory. If you omit the file name or
   file type, VDE uses the module name and type by default. If you
   omit the /OUTPUT and /NOOUTPUT qualifiers entirely, VDE creates a
   file in your current default directory with the same name as the
   module.

   If you fetch more than one module with the same /OUTPUT qualifier
   (by using either wildcards or a group name in the module-name
   parameter) and you do not specify wildcards in the output file
   specification, VDE creates successive versions of the file
   indicated by the /OUTPUT qualifier.
 

/POSITION

      /POSITION=column-number

   Specifies the column in which CMS notes are to be placed. The
   column number must be an integer in the range 1 to 511. If
   the length of an output line is less than the specified column
   number, the note appears at the specified column number. If
   the length of the line is greater than or equal to the column
   number, the note is placed at the next tab stop after the end
   of the line. (Tab stops are at position 9 and every 8 characters
   thereafter.)

   If the /POSITION qualifier is omitted, the default notes position
   for the module is used. The default notes position is set
   with the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command. The /POSITION
   qualifier has no effect unless the /NOTES qualifier is specified
   or the notes attribute is set for the module.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be logged in the CMS history file by
   this command, usually to explain why the command was entered. The
   remark is enclosed in quotation marks. If no remark is entered,
   the fetch operation is not logged.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the modules be fetched from the development stream
   given by the stream-name parameter. If this qualifier is omitted,
   the modules are fetched from the default development stream. If
   this qualifier is omitted and no default stream is defined, VDE
   prompts you for the stream name.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> FETCH [FACIL]MODNAM.MAR/REMARK="Just curious"
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [FACIL]MODNAM.MAR;17(15A2) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MODNAM.MAR;
     VDE>

     This FETCH command retrieves the most recent generation of
     module [FACIL]MODNAM.MAR in the default development stream. The
     log message shows that the most recent generation is generation
     17. Its CMS generation expression is 15A2. The file MODNAM.MAR
     is created in the user's default directory.

   2.VDE> FETCH FOO.BAR;5
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]FOO.BAR;5(5) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]FOO.BAR;
     VDE>

     This example fetches generation 5 of module FOO.BAR in the
     default stream. Generation 5 is not necessarily the most
     recent generation of the module in the default stream. Since
     no facility name is specified, the module is assumed to be in
     the default facility, facility CODE.

   3.VDE> FETCH FOO.BAR;-1
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]FOO.BAR;5(5) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]FOO.BAR;
     VDE>

     This example is the same as the previous example except that
     the user specifies a relative generation number, -1. This
     generation number causes VDE to fetch the generation before the
     most recent generation. In this case, generation 6 is the most
     recent generation. As a result, the FETCH command retrieves
     generation 5, as the log message shows.

   4.VDE> FETCH MOD1, MOD2, MOD3, X*
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]MOD1.C;4(4) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MOD1.C;
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]MOD2.C;8(7C1) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MOD2.C;
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]MOD3.C;1(1) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MOD3.C;
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]MOD3.PLI;1(1) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MOD3.PLI;
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]XAVIER.PAS;25(5A2B8) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]XAVIER.PAS;
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, module generation [CODE]XERXES.FOR;5(5) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]XERXES.FOR;
     VDE>

     In this example, the FETCH command retrieves the latest
     generations of modules MOD1.C, MOD2.C, MOD3.C, and MOD3.PLI,
     along with all source modules whose names begin with the letter
     X. The module type defaults to the wildcard string that matches
     all module types (*).  Hence the command fetches both MOD3.C
     and MOD3.PLI.

1  INSERT
 

2  GENERATION
   Inserts a module generation into a specified development stream,
   making it the latest generation of the module in that stream.

   Requires PERFREP privilege.

   Format

     INSERT GENERATION  gen-spec [, gen-spec...] targ-stream-name

                        ["remark"]
 

3  Parameter
 

gen-spec

   Specifies a module generation in a specified development stream
   that should be inserted into the stream given by the stream-name
   parameter. A generation specification consists of the following
   in order:

   o  an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets

   o  a module name

   o  an optional type name preceded by a period

   o  an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon

   An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

   If you omit the facility name, the default facility is assumed.
   If you omit the type name, generations for all source modules
   with the specified module name in the specified facility are
   inserted into the given stream. If you omit the generation
   number, the most recent generation of the module in the stream
   specified with the /STREAM qualifier is inserted into the given
   stream.

   If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number
   is relative to the most recent generation of the module in the
   stream given by the /STREAM qualifier. For example, if the most
   recent generation is generation 5, then generation 0 is the same
   as generation 5 and generation -1 is the same as generation 4.

   If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE inserts the
   generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores
   the generation number on the gen-spec parameter.

   You can insert more than one generation by using wildcard
   characters in the facility name, module name, or type name. The
   percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the
   position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more
   characters in the position it occupies. Wildcard characters are
   not allowed in the generation number. Those module generations
   whose names match the wildcard pattern are inserted into the
   stream-name stream.

   Unless the WILD_INS_GEN library attribute is enabled, VDE does
   not allow wildcard characters in the generation specification
   when you use the /GENERATION qualifier. It seldom makes sense to
   select generations with the same CMS generation expression from
   different modules. For the same reason, VDE does not allow you to
   use wildcard characters and a non-zero generation number in the
   same generation specification (as in *.*;-2), again unless the
   WILD_INS_GEN library attribute is set.
 

targ-stream-name

   Specifies the development stream into which the generations given
   by the gen-spec parameters should be inserted.

   One can specify the source generation for the operation in
   several ways, one of which is based on the generation in a
   specified source stream-see the /STREAM qualifier.
 

"remark"

   Specifies a remark string that explains why you inserted the
   generation into the specified stream. The quoted remark string
   can be up to 132 characters long. Specifying the remark parameter
   is equivalent to specifying the /REMARK qualifier after the
   INSERT GENERATION keywords.
 

3  Description
   The INSERT GENERATION command inserts the module generations you
   specify with the gen-spec parameters into the development stream
   you specify with the stream-name parameter. Each such generation
   becomes the latest generation of the corresponding module in
   the stream-name stream. The command thus lets you move module
   generations from one stream to another stream.

   If the specified module is currently reserved in the specified
   stream, VDE terminates that reservation since it is based on a
   module generation that no longer is the latest generation for
   the stream. VDE sends a mail message to notify the owner of the
   reservation that the reservation is lost.

   Note that there are two stream specifications possible on this
   command. The destination stream-specified by the target stream
   name parameter-and the optional source stream qualifier.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   generation inserted into the specified stream. The /CONFIRM
   qualifier causes VDE to print a message for each generation
   giving the name of the generation and asking whether you want
   to insert the generation into the stream. If you answer YES (or
   Y), the generation is inserted into the stream. If you answer
   NO (or N), the generation is not inserted into the stream. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to insert each generation into
   the specified stream without asking for confirmation.
 

/NOCMS_CLASS

   Prevents the inserted generations from being inserted into
   the CMS class for the specified stream, even if a CMS class is
   normally maintained for the stream. The INSERT GENERATION command
   executes faster than otherwise if CMS class memberships are not
   updated.
 

/GENERATION

      /GENERATION=gen-expr

   Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression
   given by the gen-expr parameter be inserted into the specified
   stream. When this qualifier is specified, the generation number
   specified on the gen-spec parameter is ignored.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the generations
   are inserted into the stream. The /LOG qualifier causes
   such messages to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The
   messages indicate that the generations have been inserted into
   the specified stream and that the database transaction has
   successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string that explains why you inserted the
   generation into the specified stream. The quoted remark string
   can be up to 132 characters long.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the stream in which the generation should be looked
   up if you omit the /GENERATION qualifier. This qualifier thus
   affects the interpretation of the generation number in the
   command-level gen-spec parameter when the /GENERATION qualifier
   is omitted. If you omit both the /STREAM qualifier and the
   /GENERATION qualifier, VDE prompts you for the name of the stream
   in which to look up the generation number.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> INSERT GENERATION [FACIL]MODNAM.C;4/STREAM=V2.0 BL-22

     %VDE-I-GENINSERT, generation [FACIL]MODNAM.C;4(4) inserted into stream BL-22
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> SET STREAM BL-22
     VDE> SHOW GENERATION [FACIL]MODNAM.C
     Generation [FACIL]MODNAM.C;4(4)       by user JONES        on  9-MAY-1990 19:43
     VDE>

     This example inserts generation 4 of module [FACIL]MODNAM.C
     from stream V2.0 into stream BL-22, making that generation the
     latest generation in stream BL-22.
 

1  INVOKE
 

2  SCRIPT
   Invokes a VDE script from the VDE database and writes the
   resulting DCL command file to a directory in the current VDE
   library or to a VDE scratch directory.

   Format

     INVOKE SCRIPT
 

3  Description
   The INVOKE SCRIPT command reads a specified VDE script from
   the VDE database, executes the script language in the script
   to produce a DCL command file, and writes that DCL command file
   to the appropriate directory. The INVOKE SCRIPT command does not
   execute the resulting DCL command file.

   The directory that receives the DCL command file is the directory
   that would receive it if the script were executed normally as
   part of a VDE command. This directory depends on the script type,
   and is displayed in a log message. You can use the INVOKE SCRIPT
   command to examine the DCL code generated by VDE in response to
   your scripts.

   You must specify a script-type qualifier to select the script you
   want invoked. See the description of the CREATE SCRIPT command
   for an explanation of the format of scripts and the different
   types of scripts. Also see the description of the CREATE SCRIPT
   command for an explanation of how VDE selects scripts for
   specific modules or facilities. If the scripts you select have
   multiple segment numbers, VDE selects one script for each segment
   number and generates the DCL command file from those scripts in
   order by their segment numbers.

   The INVOKE SCRIPT command always selects and invokes the desired
   script in the context of the default development stream.

   Keywords used within scripts are documented in Script Keywords,
   while script functions are in Script Functions, and script types
   are in Script Types. For other script-related commands, also see
   CREATE SCRIPT, DELETE SCRIPT, EXTRACT SCRIPT, MODIFY SCRIPT, and
   SHOW SCRIPT.

     $
     $ TYPE [PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.VDE$COM]MODNAM.C

     $ ON WARNING THEN GOTO VDE$ERROR
     $ !
     $ SET VERIFY
     $ DEFINE/NOLOG SRC$ DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.SRC]

     $ SET NOVERIFY   ! Successful script completion
     $ VDE/STATUS SUCCESS
     $ EXIT
     $VDE$ERROR:
     $ SET NOVERIFY   ! Script completed with errors
     $ VDE/STATUS FAILURE
     $ EXIT
     $

     In this example, the user invokes the script that compiles
     module MODNAM.C in facility CODE. VDE selects the appropriate
     script using its normal script selection rules and applies the
     script to that module. VDE writes the resulting DCL command
     file to a file called MODNAM.C in the VDE$COM subdirectory for
     the given stream and facility. (The COMPILE and BUILD commands
     use this directory when they generate and execute build-step
     command files.) The subsequent DCL TYPE command shows the
     text of the DCL command file. This text includes some standard
     "boiler-plate" at the beginning and end of the file. In the
     middle of the file are the DCL commands that come from the
     script itself. These commands enable command-line verification,
     define two logical names, compile the module MODNAM.C, and
     use the VDE/DEPEND command to record the compile step's build
     dependencies. The surrounding boiler-plate traps errors and
     records the build step's status (success or failure).
 

1  LINK
   Links the specified modules using the appropriate scripts from
   the database.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     LINK  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

2  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module to be linked. The module name consists of
   an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module
   name, and an optional type name preceded by a period, such as
   [FACIL]MOD1.EXE. If no facility name is specified, the default
   facility is assumed. If no type name is specified, module type
   EXE is assumed.

   You can link more than one module by using wildcard characters in
   any of the three components of the module name. The percent sign
   (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position it
   occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in
   the position it occupies. VDE links modules whose names match the
   wildcard pattern.
 

2  Description
   The LINK command links a module the same way it is linked in
   a build job. The LINK command retrieves the link script for
   each specified module and generates a DCL command file from
   the script. The command then executes the command file in a
   subprocess. If the module links successfully, VDE updates the
   build dependency information for the link step in the database.

   The LINK command can be used to link a module without starting a
   build job. It is often used to test link scripts. It can also
   be used to collect the initial dependency information for a
   link step that does not yet have dependency information in the
   database.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the link step
   executes. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate
   that the link step has completed, either successfully or with
   errors, and that the dependency information for the step has been
   updated in the VDE database.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the modules be linked for the stream given by the
   stream-name parameter. If this qualifier is omitted, the modules
   are linked for the default stream.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> LINK [CODE]X.EXE
     $ DEFINE/NOLOG OBJ$ DEV$:[PROJDIR.MAIN.CODE.OBJ]
     $ LINK /EXE=OBJ$:X.EXE /MAP=OBJ$:X.MAP -
             OBJ$:OBJLIB.OLB/INCLUDE=C,OBJ$:OBJLIB.OLB/LIBRARY
     $ !
     $ SET NOVERIFY   ! Successful script completion
     %VDE-I-LINKSUCC, link of [CODE]X.EXE completed successfully
     %VDE-I-DEPUPDATE, dependency information updated for build step
     VDE>

     This example links module X.EXE in facility CODE. The output
     from the execution of the link script is displayed on the
     terminal. The final log messages show that the link step
     completed successfully and that its dependency information
     was updated in the database.
 

1  MODIFY
 

2  ARCHITECTURE
   Modifies one or more architecture table entries in the VDE
   database. Each architecture table entry...

   Requires the CREARCH privilege.

   ARCHITECTURE support is not fully implemented.

   An architecture is a construct that encompasses one or more
   facilities, and allows modules to exist in a "common" or
   "default" facility, and zero or more architecture specific
   facilities. In must the same fashion as the SYS$SYSROOT: logical
   name allows one to support both system-specific and cluster-
   common files, an architecture allows one to support architecture-
   specific and architecture-common modules.

   Format

     MODIFY ARCHITECTURE  arch-name [, arch-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

arch-name

   The name of the architecture to be modified. This name may be up
   to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the modified

   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   architecture. that you want stored in the VDE database. Typically
   the remark describes the function or purpose of the architecture.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY ARCHITECTURE VAXPDP/REMARK="Version n"
     VDE>

     Under Construction...
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Modifies the batch queues, process count, remark string, and
   other attributes of existing build jobs in the VDE database.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY BUILD_JOB  [stream-name [, stream-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream containing the build jobs to
   be modified. To specify the build jobs, use the /IDENTIFICATION
   qualifier. If you do not use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, the
   most recent build job for the stream is modified.

   You can modify build jobs in more than one stream by using
   wildcard characters in the stream name. The percent sign (%)  in
   a name matches any single character in the position it occupies
   and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the
   position it occupies. Build jobs in those streams whose names
   match the wildcard pattern are modified.

   If you omit the stream-name parameter, VDE modifies the
   attributes of one or more build jobs for the default development
   stream.
 

3  Description
   The MODIFY BUILD_JOB command modifies the attributes of
   build jobs having the specified stream names and build job
   identification numbers. You can modify the following attributes:
   the batch queues to which the job is submitted for execution, the
   total number of batch processes submitted, the remark string, the
   step-delay interval, and the timeout interval. VDE modifies these
   attributes by updating the database with the information you
   specify. You cannot modify the queues or process count of a build
   job that has started running or that has completed execution.
   You can, however, suspend a running build job, modify those
   attributes, and restart the job.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   build job modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each build job asking whether you want that build
   job modified. If you answer YES (or Y), the attributes of the
   build job are modified in the database. If you answer NO (or N),
   the attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes
   VDE to modify the attributes of the specified build jobs without
   asking for confirmation.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=id-range

   Specifies the build job identification numbers of the build jobs
   to be modified for the specified development stream. The id-range
   parameter can be a single integer value, a range of integers, or
   a wildcard character. If the parameter is a single integer value
   (for example, /IDENT=5), VDE modifies the build job with that
   identification number. If the parameter is a range of integers
   (specified as two build job identification numbers separated
   by a colon as in /IDENT=3:5), VDE modifies all build jobs with
   identification numbers in that range. Finally, if the id-range
   parameter is the asterisk wildcard (as in /IDENT=*), VDE modifies
   all build jobs for the specified stream.

   If you specify a zero or negative build job identification
   number in the id-range parameter, that number is relative to
   the identification number of the most recent build job for the
   stream. For example, if the most recent build job is job 5, then
   /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=5 and /IDENT=-1 is equivalent to
   /IDENT=4.

   If you do not use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, VDE modifies the
   attributes of the most recent build job for the specified stream.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each build job is
   modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate
   that the build job has been modified in the database and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/PROCESS_COUNT

      /PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count

   Specifies the number of processes to execute the build job.
   When the build job is started with a START BUILD_JOB command,
   VDE creates the processes by submitting batch jobs to the
   queues specified by the /QUEUE qualifier or to the default
   queues for the default stream. The number of processes that VDE
   creates (that is, the number of OpenVMS batch jobs it submits)
   is specified by the proc-count parameter. As a result, this
   parameter determines the degree of parallelism for the build
   job.
 

/QUEUE

      /QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])

   Specifies the OpenVMS batch queues to which the build job is
   submitted by a subsequent START BUILD_JOB command. Each queue-
   name parameter specifies the name of one batch queue. The queue-
   name parameter may optionally be followed by a process count
   in parentheses. This count specifies the number of processes
   that are started on the queue to run the build job. For example,
   SYS$BATCH(3) causes three build-job processes to be submitted to
   queue SYS$BATCH. If the process count is omitted, one process is
   submitted to the queue.

   If you only specify one queue-name parameter, the parentheses may
   be omitted.

   If you also use the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier, that qualifier
   states the total number of build-job processes to create. The
   process counts attached to the queue-name parameters on the
   /QUEUE qualifier are then used as scaling factors to distribute
   build-job processes among the queues proportionally. For example,
   if you specify queues HI_BATCH, HO_BATCH(3), and a total process
   count of eight, then two processes are submitted to queue HI_
   BATCH and six processes to queue HO_BATCH. If the total process
   count does not divide evenly into the sum of the scaling factors,
   the remaining processes are allocated to the queues in the order
   the queues are listed. If the total process count is nine, for
   example, the one extra process is allocated to queue HI_BATCH
   because HI_BATCH is listed first.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored in the database for each
   specified build job. The quoted remark string, which can be up to
   132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark that you
   want to store in the database. This string replaces the remark
   string from the original BUILD command or from any previous
   MODIFY BUILD_JOB command.
 

/STEP_DELAY

      /STEP_DELAY=time-interval

   Specifies the step-delay time interval used by VDE$BUILD.
   VDE$BUILD is the program that executes the build steps belonging
   to the build job. If VDE$BUILD cannot find an available build
   step in the database, the program waits the amount of time
   specified by the /STEP_DELAY qualifier before it looks in the
   database again. See the description of the BUILD command for a
   more detailed description of this qualifier.
 

/TIMEOUT

      /TIMEOUT=time-interval

   Specifies the timeout interval for the build job. If no build
   steps complete during this interval, the VDE$BUILD utility
   stops the build job and assigns it TIMEOUT status. Therefore,
   the timeout interval must be longer than the time required to
   complete the longest build step. See the description of the BUILD
   command for a more detailed description of this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY BUILD_JOB V2.0-3/IDENT=15/REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBMOD, build job 15 for stream V2.0-3 modified in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example modifies the remark string of build job 15 for
     stream V2.0-3.

   2.VDE> MODIFY BUILD_JOB/QUEUE=(PHI_BATCH, FOO_BATCH(3))/PROCESS_COUNT=10
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBMOD, build job 12 for stream V5.2 modified in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command modifies the batch queues and process count
     associated with the most recent build job for the default
     stream, build job 12 of stream V5.2.
 

2  CONTEXT
   Modifies the attributes of one or more contexts in the VDE
   database. The attributes of a context that you can modify
   include its name, remark, default development stream, and default
   facility. One context can be used to set the default stream and
   facility when first connecting to a VDE database.

   Requires the CRECTX privilege to modify public contexts.

   Format

     MODIFY CONTEXT  ctx-name [, ctx-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

ctx-name

   The name of an existing context whose attributes are to be
   modified. You can modify more than one context at a time by using
   wildcard characters in the context name. The percent sign (%)  in
   a context name matches any single character in the position it
   occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in
   the position it occupies. Those contexts whose names match the
   wildcard pattern are modified.
 

3  Description
   A "context" specifies defaults for VDE sessions. When you modify
   a context using the MODFY CONTEXT command, you specify the
   name of the context, the associated development stream, and the
   associated facility.

   To apply the defaults associated with a context, specify the
   context name as a parameter to the SET CONTEXT command. To set a
   particular context as the default context for use when you issue
   the SET LIBRARY command, use the SET CONTEXT/DEFAULT command to
   mark a particular context as the default context.

   There are two kinds of contexts available:

   o  the private context is available to and only visible to the
      user who created it.

   o  the public context is available to all users of the current
      VDE library.

   You do not need special VDE privileges to create or modify a
   private context, but you must have the VDE CRECTX privilege
   to create or modify a public context. While a private context
   can have the same name as a public context, neither two private
   contexts nor two public contexts can share the same name.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ARCHITECTURE

   Under Construction...
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   context definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE
   to print a message for the specified context giving the name of
   the context and asking whether you want to modify that context.
   If you answer YES (or Y), the attributes are modified. If you
   answer NO (or N), the attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM
   qualifier causes VDE to modify the attributes of the context
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/FACILITY

      /FACILITY=facil-name
      /NOFACILITY

   The /FACILITY qualifier specifies that the indicated facility
   becomes the default facility when the context is established with
   the SET CONTEXT command. The default facility is the facility
   that is assumed when the facility name is omitted from a module
   name. The /NOFACILITY qualifier specifies that the default
   facility established by the context is null.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the context
   definitions are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the context definitions have been modified and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=ctx-name

   Specifies a new name for the context. The new context name can be
   up to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax. After
   the context name is changed, you must refer to the context by
   its new name in all subsequent VDE commands. The old name is lost
   from the database.
 

/PRIVATE

   Specifies whether the context that is modified is private or
   public. The /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to modify your private
   context by that name. The /PUBLIC qualifier causes VDE to
   modify the public context by that name. You must have the CRECTX
   privilege to use the /PUBLIC qualifier.

   Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /PRIVATE is the default.
 

/PUBLIC

   Specifies whether the context that is modified is private or
   public. The /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to modify your private
   context by that name. The /PUBLIC qualifier causes VDE to
   modify the public context by that name. You must have the CRECTX
   privilege to use the /PUBLIC qualifier.

   Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /PRIVATE is the default.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string for the context. This string replaces
   the remark string from the original CREATE CONTEXT command or
   from any previous MODIFY CONTEXT command. The quoted remark
   string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any
   explanatory remark about the context that you want stored in
   the VDE database. Typically the remark describes the function or
   purpose of the context.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name
      /NOSTREAM

   The /STREAM qualifier specifies that the indicated development
   stream becomes the default stream when the context is established
   with the SET CONTEXT command. The /NOSTREAM qualifier specifies
   that the default stream established by the context is null.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY CONTEXT DEFAULT/STREAM=V2.2-BL1/FACILITY=COPY
     %VDE-I-CTXMOD, information for context DEFAULT modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> DEFINE/KEY KP6 "SET CONTEXT DEFAULTS" /TERMINATE
     VDE> <KP6>
     VDE> SHOW DEFAULTS
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     Default directory is DEV$:[SMITH]
     Context DEFAULT (private to user SMITH)
        Default stream is V2.2-BL1
        Default facility is COPY

     VDE>

     The MODIFY CONTEXT command specifies stream V2.2-BL1 as the
     default stream and facility COPY as the default facility
     for private context DEFAULT. This context is the default
     at the start of each VDE session. The SET CONTEXT command
     establishes these defaults for the current VDE session, as
     the SHOW DEFAULTS command confirms.

   2.VDE> MODIFY CONTEXT/PUBLIC/FACILITY=EXEC PUBCTX
     %VDE-I-CTXMOD, information for context PUBCTX modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW CONTEXT PUBCTX
     Context PUBCTX (public to all users)
        Default stream is V2.0
        Default facility is EXEC

     VDE>

     The MODIFY CONTEXT command establishes facility EXEC as the
     default facility for public context PUBCTX. The SHOW CONTEXT
     command shows that the change has taken effect.
 

2  FACILITY
   Modifies the attributes of one or more facilities in the VDE
   database. The attributes of a facility you can modify are its
   name and remark string.

   Requires CREFAC privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY FACILITY  facil-name [, facil-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

facil-name

   The name of a facility in the current VDE library whose
   attributes are to be modified. You can modify more than one
   facility at a time by using wildcard characters in the facility
   name. The percent sign (%)  in a facility name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   VDE modifies the attributes of those facilities whose names match
   the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   facility modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for the specified facility giving the name of the
   facility and ask whether you want to modify that facility.
   If you answer YES (or Y), the attributes are modified. If you
   answer NO (or N), the attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM
   qualifier causes VDE to modify the attributes of the facility
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/DELETE

      /DELETE
      /NODELETE (default)

   Sets or clears the delete attribute for the facility. This
   attribute allows the facility to be deleted with the DELETE
   FACILITY command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete attribute
   so that the facility can be deleted. The /NODELETE qualifier
   clears the delete attribute so that the facility cannot be
   deleted without first resetting the attribute.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the facility
   definitions are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the facility definitions have been modified and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=facil-name

   Specifies a new name for the facility. The new facility name
   can be up to 39 characters long and must follow normal VDE name
   syntax. After the facility name has been changed, you must refer
   to the facility by its new name in all subsequent VDE commands.
   The old name is lost from the database.
 

/PROPAGATE

      /PROPAGATE
      /NOPROPAGATE

   Specifies whether automatic change propagation is allowed by
   default for new modules created in this facility. /PROPAGATE
   causes new modules added to the facility to be marked as
   allowing automatic change propagation when reserved and
   replaced. /NOPROPAGATE marks such modules as not allowing change
   propagation. When you create new modules, you can override these
   defaults with qualifiers to the CREATE MODULE command.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string for the facility. This string replaces
   the remark string from the original CREATE FACILITY command or
   from any previous MODIFY FACILITY command. The quoted remark
   string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any
   explanatory remark about the facility that you want stored in
   the VDE database. Typically the remark describes the function or
   contents of the facility.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY FACILITY ACCTNG /REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-FACMOD, information for facility ACCTNG modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     In this example, the user specifies a new remark string for
     facility ACCTNG. This remark string can be retrieved with a
     subsequent SHOW FACILITY command.

   2.VDE> MODIFY FACILITY/NAME=ACCOUNTING ACCTNG
     %VDE-I-FACMOD, information for facility ACCOUNTING modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     In this example, the name of facility ACCTNG is changed to
     ACCOUNTING. You must refer to the facility by this new name in
     all subsequent VDE commands.

   3.VDE> MODIFY FACILITY/CONFIRM ACCTNG/REMARK="New remark string", -
     _VDE>                             FUMBLE/REMARK="New remark string"
     Modify facility ACCTNG ? [No]: Y
     %VDE-I-FACMOD, facility ACCTNG modified in the database
     Modify facility FUMBLE ? [No]: N
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the /CONFIRM qualifier. This qualifier
     causes VDE to ask the user whether each specified facility
     should be modified. For facility ACCTNG, the user answers Y
     (for YES) and the remark string for that facility is modified
     in the database, as the log message shows. For facility FUMBLE,
     the user answers N (for NO) and that facility is not modified.
     Hence there is no log message for that facility. The final log
     message indicates that the database transaction for the whole
     command has successfully committed.
 

2  FOLD
   Modifies the remark string of one or more fold records in the VDE
   database.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY FOLD  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module for which a fold record is to be modified.
   The module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility
   name is omitted, the module is assumed to belong to the default
   facility. If the type name is omitted, VDE modifies fold records
   for all source modules with the specified module name in the
   given facility.

   You can modify fold records for more than one module by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies. VDE
   modifies fold records for all source modules whose names match
   the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Description
   The MODIFY FOLD command modifies the remark string of each
   specified fold record in the VDE database.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each fold
   record modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each fold record asking whether you want that
   record modified. If you answer YES (or Y), that fold record
   is modified in the database. If you answer NO (or N), the
   fold record is not modified. If you enter a module name with a
   wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the modification
   of fold records for each module whose name matches the wildcard
   specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify the
   specified fold records without asking for confirmation.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=fold-ident

   Specifies the fold record to be modified. This qualifier is
   required when you have multiple fold records for the same
   module in the same stream. The fold-ident parameter is the fold
   identifier of the fold record to be modified. The fold identifier
   is the identifier you specified or VDE assigned when you created
   the fold record, usually a small integer value. Use the SHOW FOLD
   command to determine the fold identifier of each fold record.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each fold record
   has been modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the fold record has been modified and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a new remark string for the fold record. This string
   replaces the remark string from the original REPLACE or CREATE
   FOLD command or from any previous MODIFY FOLD command. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long,
   may contain any explanatory remark about the fold record that you
   want stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark describes
   the purpose or contents of a source change to be folded into a
   development stream.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the development stream for which fold records should be
   modified. The stream-name parameter gives the name of the stream.
   If this qualifier is omitted, VDE modifies fold records for the
   default development stream only.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that fold records are to be modified on behalf of
   another user. The username parameter specifies the OpenVMS
   username of the other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege
   to use this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY FOLD [CODE]X.FOR/IDENT=1/REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-FOLDMOD, fold record 1 for module [CODE]X.FOR modified in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example specifies a new remark string for fold record 1
     for module [CODE]X.FOR. The log messages show that the fold
     record was successfully modified.
 

2  GENERATION
   Modifies the attributes associated with specific module
   generations in the VDE database.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY GENERATION  gen-spec [, gen-spec...]
 

3  Parameter
 

gen-spec

   Specifies a module generation in a specified (or the default)
   development stream whose attributes are to be modified. A
   generation specification consists of the following in order:

   o  an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets

   o  a module name

   o  an optional type name preceded by a period

   o  an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon

   An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

   If you omit the facility name, module generations from the
   default facility are modified. If you omit the type name,
   generations for all modules with the specified module name in
   the specified facility are modified. If you omit the generation
   number, the most recent generation of the module in the specified
   stream is modified.

   If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number
   is relative to the most recent generation of the module in the
   stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier (or the default
   stream if that qualifier is omitted). For example, if the most
   recent generation is generation 5, then generation 0 is the same
   as generation 5 and generation -1 is the same as generation 4.

   If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE modifies the
   generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores
   the generation number on the gen-spec parameter.

   You can modify more than one generation by using wildcard
   characters in the facility name, module name, or type name. The
   percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the
   position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more
   characters in the position it occupies. An asterisk (*)  in place
   of the generation number matches all generations of a module.
   Those module generations whose names match the wildcard pattern
   are modified.
 

3  Description
   The MODIFY GENERATION command allows you to modify the attributes
   associated with a specific module generation in the VDE library.

   Attributes that can be altered via the MODIFY GENERATION command
   include:

   o  The generation's remark string. This string is originally
      created by the CREATE MODULE or REPLACE command.

   o  The module's status in the specified development stream. This
      command can be used to mark a specific generation of the
      module as as obsolete in the specified development stream.
      An obsolete module remains in the VDE database since it may
      not be obsolete for old streams, only for new ones. Once a
      module is marked as obsolete for a given stream, that module
      is not carried over to any future stream that has the given
      stream as its parent.

   o  The module's status as the main line of descent in the the
      specified development stream.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the
   attributes of each generation modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier
   causes VDE to print a message for each generation giving the
   name of the generation and asking whether you want to modify the
   generation. If you answer YES (or Y), the generation's attributes
   are modified. If you answer NO (or N), the attributes are not
   modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify the
   attributes of each generation without asking for confirmation.
 

/GENERATION

      /GENERATION=gen-expr

   Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression
   given by the gen-expr parameter be modified. When this qualifier
   is specified, the generation number specified on the gen-spec
   parameter is ignored.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the attributes of
   generations are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the generations have been modified and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/MAIN_STREAM

      /MAIN_STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the stream that "owns" the main development thread for
   the specified generation. If the generation is later reserved and
   its successor is replaced into the stream given by the stream-
   name parameter (directly or through change propagation), the
   successor generation will get a "whole-number" CMS generation
   expression. If the current generation has generation expression
   10, for example, the generation created by replacing into the
   specified stream gets generation expression 11. A replacement
   into any other stream gets a generation expression such as 10A1
   or 10B1. Similarly, if the current generation has generation
   expression 5A2, the specified stream gets the "whole-number"
   successor 5A3 instead of a generation expression such as 5A2A1.

   VDE automatically maintains information about what stream owns
   the whole-number successor for each generation in the library.
   This information is determined by your use of the /MAIN qualifier
   to the CREATE STREAM command. For this reason, you will seldom
   need the /MAIN_STREAM qualifier to the MODIFY GENERATION command.
   However, there are exceptional cases where you may need to
   change what stream owns the whole-number successor for a given
   generation, and then this qualifier lets you set that attribute.
 

/NOTE

      /NOTE=note-number

   The note-number parameter specifies the note number for the
   (previously-entered) SCT note associated with this replacement.

   VDE can also enter the note into the conference directly, see the
   /SCT qualifier for information.
 

/OBSOLETE

      /OBSOLETE
      /NOOBSOLETE

   Specifies whether the module is marked as obsolete in the
   specified development stream. The /OBSOLETE qualifier specifies
   that the module is obsolete in that stream. An obsolete module
   is not propagated to future streams created from that stream. The
   /NOOBSOLETE qualifier specifies that the module is not obsolete.
   If neither qualifier is specified, the current status of the
   module is not changed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a new remark string to be stored for the generation.
   This string replaces the generation's current remark string. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the generation that you want
   stored in the VDE database.

   The remark string is used as the title of the SCT note, if VDE
   was asked to enter the SCT note by the specification of the /SCT
   qualifier.
 

/SCT

      /SCT=filename

   The filename parameter specifies the name of a file to be loaded
   into the SCT notes conference. This file contains the previously-
   edited text of an SCT entry for the SCT note associated with this
   replacement.

   If this qualifier is used, the default notes conference for the
   stream-SCT-stream-name-is assumed.

   If this qualifier is specified, the /REMARK string is used as the
   title of the SCT note.

   For information on the proper creation and protection of an SCT
   notes conference, see the Guide to Using VDE.

   Also see /FOLD and /OTHER.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that generations for the development stream given
   by the stream-name parameter be modified. This qualifier thus
   affects the interpretation of generation numbers on the command's
   gen-spec parameter. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE modifies
   generations for the default development stream.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY GENERATION [FACIL]MODNAM.C;5/REMARK="New remark string"

     %VDE-I-GENMOD, information for generation [FACIL]MODNAM.C;5 modified in the
      database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example changes the remark string associated with
     generation 5 of module MODNAM.C in facility FACIL. The log
     messages confirm that the attributes of the module were
     modified and that the database transaction successfully
     completed.

   2.VDE> MODIFY GENERATION MODNAM.MAR /OBSOLETE

     %VDE-I-GENMOD, information for generation [RMS]MODNAM.MAR;6 modified in the
      database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example illustrates how to mark a module as obsolete in
     the default stream. The module will be dropped from all future
     streams descended from the default stream, but will remain
     accessible in the default stream.
 

2  GROUP
   Modifies the attributes and membership of a source group or build
   group in the VDE database. The attributes of a group that you can
   modify are the group's name and remark string. The membership of
   a group is the list of modules that are members of the group.

   Requires CREGRP privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY GROUP  group-name [= mod-name [, mod-name...]]
 

3  Parameters
 

group-name

   The name of a group whose definition is to be modified. This
   group must be defined in the default development stream. The
   group name may not contain wildcard characters.
 

mod-name

   The name of a module that should be added to or removed from
   the specified group. If the group is a source group, this module
   must be a source module. The module name consists of an optional
   facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module name,
   and an optional type name preceded by a period (for example,
   [FACNAM]MODNAM.MAR). If no facility name is specified, the
   default facility is assumed. If no type name is specified, all
   source modules (for a source group) or all modules (for a build
   group) with the given module name in the given facility are added
   to or removed from the group.

   You can add or remove more than one module at a time by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those source modules (for a source group) or those modules (for a
   build group) whose names match the wildcard pattern are added to
   or deleted from the group.

   If no module-name parameters are specified, the membership of the
   group is not changed.
 

3  Description
   A group is always defined in a specific development stream. You
   can only refer to the group from within that stream. As a result,
   the MODIFY GROUP command only modifies the group definition in
   the default development stream.

   To modify group definitions for more than one development stream,
   you must use the MODIFY GROUP command for each stream. For each
   stream, first enter the SET STREAM command to set the development
   stream then enter the MODIFY GROUP command to change the group in
   that stream.

   To apply a qualifier to the command as a whole, place the
   qualifier immediately after the MODIFY GROUP keywords and before
   the group-name parameter. With this placement, qualifiers such as
   the /REMARK qualifier apply to the entire specified group or, as
   with such qualifiers as /ADD or /REMOVE, to all modules specified
   after the equal sign.

   Only the /ADD and /REMOVE qualifiers can modify an individual
   module-name parameter. To add or remove an individual module,
   place the /ADD or /REMOVE qualifier immediately after the module-
   name parameter. The /ADD or /REMOVE qualifier placed after an
   individual module-name parameter overrides the command-level
   qualifier for that one parameter.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ADD

   Controls whether the modules specified in the parameter list are
   added to or removed from the group. The /ADD qualifier adds the
   specified modules to the group and the /REMOVE qualifier deletes
   them from the group. To set the default for the command as a
   whole, specify the qualifier after the MODIFY GROUP keywords. To
   override that default for a single module, specify the qualifier
   after the mod-name parameter you choose to add or delete. If you
   do not specify one of these qualifiers, modules are added to the
   group.

   Of /ADD and /REMOVE, /ADD is the default.
 

/REMOVE

   Controls whether the modules specified in the parameter list are
   added to or removed from the group. The /ADD qualifier adds the
   specified modules to the group and the /REMOVE qualifier deletes
   them from the group. To set the default for the command as a
   whole, specify the qualifier after the MODIFY GROUP keywords. To
   override that default for a single module, specify the qualifier
   after the mod-name parameter you choose to add or delete. If you
   do not specify one of these qualifiers, modules are added to the
   group.

   Of /ADD and /REMOVE, /ADD is the default.
 

/BUILD

   Specifies whether a source group or build group is modified.
   The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to modify the source group with
   the specified name. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to modify
   the build group with the specified name. If neither qualifier is
   specified, VDE modifies a source group.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/SOURCE

   Specifies whether a source group or build group is modified.
   The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to modify the source group with
   the specified name. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to modify
   the build group with the specified name. If neither qualifier is
   specified, VDE modifies a source group.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the group
   definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for the group it is about to modify giving the name
   of the group and asking whether you want that group modified.
   If you answer YES (or Y), the group definition is modified. If
   you answer NO (or N), the group definition is not modified. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify the group definition
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the group
   definition is modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The
   messages indicate that the group has been modified and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=group-name

   Specifies a new name for the indicated group. After the group
   name is changed, the group must be referred to by the new name
   in all subsequent VDE commands. The old name is lost from the
   database. The new name can be up to 39 characters long and must
   follow normal VDE name syntax.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the specified group.
   This remark string replaces the remark specified with the
   CREATE GROUP command that created the group. The quoted remark
   string can be up to 132 characters long and may contain any
   explanatory remark about the group that you want to store in
   the VDE database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY GROUP/REMARK="New remark string" GRPNAM
     %VDE-I-GRPMOD, information for group GRPNAM modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command modifies the remark string associated with
     source group GRPNAM. The log messages confirm that the group
     definition was modified and that the database transaction
     successfully committed.

   2.VDE> MODIFY GROUP/BUILD/NOLOG/NAME=NEWNAM OLDNAM
     VDE> SHOW GROUP/BUILD
     Build group NEWNAM
     VDE>

     In this example, the name of build group OLDNAM is changed to
     NEWNAM. The /NOLOG qualifier suppresses the log messages. A
     subsequent SHOW GROUP command shows the new name of the group.

   3.VDE> MODIFY GROUP/SOURCE GRP1 = A, B.MAR/REMOVE
     %VDE-I-GRPMOD, information for group GRP1 modified in the database
     %VDE-I-GRPADD, module [CODE]A.PAS is added to group GRP1
     %VDE-I-GRPREM, module [CODE]B.MAR is removed from group GRP1
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command adds module A.PAS to the source group named GRP1
     and removes module B.MAR from GRP1. No type name is specified
     for module A; hence all source modules named A in the default
     facility are added. As the log messages indicate, there is only
     one such module, A.PAS, in this example.

   4.VDE> MODIFY GROUP/REMOVE GRP1 = A.PAS/ADD, B.MAR
     %VDE-I-GRPMOD, information for group GRP1 modified in the database
     %VDE-I-GRPADD, module [CODE]A.PAS is added to group GRP1
     %VDE-I-GRPREM, module [CODE]B.MAR is removed from group GRP1
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command also adds module A.PAS to group GRP1 and removes
     module B.MAR. Because the /REMOVE qualifier immediately
     follows the MODIFY GROUP keywords, all modules specified in
     the parameters are removed by default. This default applies to
     module B.MAR because it is not overridden. However, the /ADD
     qualifier specified for module A.PAS overrides the default for
     that module and A.PAS becomes a member of the group.
 

2  LIBRARY
   Modifies information in the database header record for the
   current VDE library. This command can modify the library name,
   the library remark string, the standard authorized and default
   privileges for new users of the library, and various other
   library attributes. It can also enable or disable after-image
   journalling for the library's VDE database.

   Requires MODLIB privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY LIBRARY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALLOW_DELETE

      /ALLOW_DELETE
      /NOALLOW_DELETE

   Specifies the default value for the delete attribute for new
   modules, facilities, and streams. The /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier
   sets a library attribute that causes VDE to set the delete
   attribute by default when users create new such entities. As a
   result, users can delete these entities without first having
   to set the delete attribute with a separate MODIFY command.
   The /NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier clears this library attribute so
   that VDE clears the delete attribute by default for new modules,
   facilities, and streams. As a result, it is harder for a user
   to delete an entity by mistake; the entity's delete attribute
   must be set with a separate MODIFY command before the entity
   can be deleted with a DELETE command. When creating new modules,
   facilities, and streams, you can override this default setting
   with an explicit /DELETE or /NODELETE qualifier to the CREATE
   command.

   Use the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you expect to make frequent
   changes to your library, often deleting modules, facilities,
   and streams. Use the /NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you are more
   concerned about preventing accidental deletion of such entities.
 

/ASK_INFO_FILE

      /ASK_INFO_FILE
      /NOASK_INFO_FILE

   Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the
   user whether he or she wants to edit an information file when
   creating a queued replacement. The /ASK_INFO_FILE qualifier
   sets a library attribute that causes the REPLACE command to
   ask for an information file by default. The /NOASK_INFO_FILE
   qualifier clears this library attribute so that the REPLACE
   command does not ask for an information file by default. This
   library attribute only affects queued replacements (not immediate
   replacements), and it only affects the REPLACE command's default
   behavior; users can always use the command's /INFORMATION or
   /NOINFORMATION qualifier to explicitly request either behavior.
 

/ASK_REPL_CAUSE

      /ASK_REPL_CAUSE
      /NOASK_REPL_CAUSE

   Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the
   user for the "cause" of the replacement. The cause may be a fold
   operation, a Source Control Tracking (SCT) entry in a Notes
   conference, or some other cause. The /ASK_REPL_CAUSE qualifier
   sets a library attribute that causes the REPLACE command to
   query the user for the cause of the replacement. The /NOASK_
   REPL_CAUSE qualifier clears this library attribute so that the
   REPLACE command does not ask for this information.
 

/AUTH_PRIVILEGES

      /AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies the standard authorized privileges of new users of
   the current library. However, any privileges specified with
   the CREATE USER command override these privileges. Because the
   privilege list you create replaces the authorized privilege
   list of the current library, you must specify all authorized
   privileges that you want new users of the library to have.

   Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If
   only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted.

   For a list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

/AUTO_ADD_USER

      /AUTO_ADD_USER[=rights-ident]
      /NOAUTO_ADD_USER

   Specifies whether new users should be added to the library
   database automatically when they first access the library. The
   /AUTO_ADD_USER qualifier specifies that new users should be added
   to the library database automatically when they first access the
   library. If the rights-ident parameter is specified, new users
   are only added to the library if they hold the OpenVMS rights
   identifier specified by the parameter. The /NOAUTO_ADD_USER
   qualifier specifies that new users not be added to the library
   database automatically. In this case, new users can only be added
   with explicit CREATE USER commands.

   The owner information specified in the OpenVMS SYSUAF database
   will be used as the owner of any new VDE username created. VDE
   will ignore any leading numerics, leading hyphens, leading space
   characters, and leading tilde characters, listed in the SYSUAF
   owner field.
 

/AUTO_CONVERT

      /AUTO_CONVERT
      /NOAUTO_CONVERT

   Specifies whether the library and its database are automatically
   converted to the new library format when a new version of VDE
   is used on the library. The /AUTO_CONVERT qualifier specifies
   that the library should be converted automatically the first
   time a user uses a new version of VDE on the present library and
   its database. /NOAUTO_CONVERT specifies that the library should
   not be converted automatically; instead a privileged user must
   explicitly convert the library with the CONVERT LIBRARY command.
   See the CREATE LIBRARY and the CONVERT LIBRARY commands.
 

/AUTO_MAIL

      /AUTO_MAIL
      /NOAUTO_MAIL

   Specifies whether VDE should automatically send mail notification
   to the user who has queued a replacement when that replacement
   is later performed. The /AUTO_MAIL qualifier sets a library
   attribute that causes the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to send
   such mail notification. The /NOAUTO_MAIL qualifier clears this
   library attribute so that the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command does
   not send such notification.
 

/CMS_ELEM_HIST

      /CMS_ELEM_HIST
      /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST

   Specifies whether VDE creates the CMS elements for new modules
   with default CMS history and notes strings. The /CMS_ELEM_HIST
   qualifier causes VDE to create the CMS elements for new modules
   with default history and notes strings and the /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST
   qualifier causes VDE to create CMS elements with no default
   history or notes strings. /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST is normally only used
   if you regularly fetch VDE modules using the CMS FETCH command
   and you want to make sure you do not get CMS history or notes by
   default.
 

/DEF_PRIVILEGES

      /DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies the standard default privileges of new users of the
   current library. However, any privileges specified with the
   CREATE USER command override these privileges. Because the
   privilege list you create replaces the default privilege list of
   the current library, you must specify all default privileges that
   you want new users of the library to have. Each default privilege
   specified also becomes a standard authorized privilege for the
   library.

   Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If
   only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted.
   For a list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

/HISTORY_NOTES

      /HISTORY_NOTES
      /NOHISTORY_NOTES

   Specifies whether VDE's RESERVE command can produce CMS history
   or notes information in its output files. The /HISTORY_NOTES
   qualifier allows the RESERVE command to produce history and notes
   information and to accept the /HISTORY, /NOTES, and /POSITION
   qualifiers. The /NOHISTORY_NOTES qualifier causes the RESERVE
   command to never produce history and notes information (even when
   such information is the default for a module being reserved) and
   to not accept the /HISTORY, /NOTES, and /POSITION qualifiers. In
   this case, you must use the VDE FETCH command to get CMS history
   or notes information for a module. Disabling history and notes
   information in reserved files makes certain mistakes less likely
   where such information gets replaced into the VDE library as part
   of the module text.
 

/JOURNAL

      /JOURNAL=dir-spec
      /NOJOURNAL

   Enables or disables after-image journalling for the VDE database.
   The /JOURNAL qualifier enables after-image journalling and
   specifies that a database after-image journal (.AIJ) file
   be created in the directory location given by the dir-spec
   parameter. When used with the RMU backup and restore facilities,
   after-image journalling allows you to recover the up-to-date
   contents of your database after a disk failure. The specified
   directory should always reside on a different physical disk than
   any of your other database files so that the journal file cannot
   be damaged by the same disk failure as the database itself.

   The /NOJOURNAL qualifier disables after-image journalling for
   the VDE database. However, Digital recommends that you always use
   journalling.
 

/LOCK

   The /LOCK and /UNLOCK qualifiers provide a method by which
   RESERVE, REPLACE, UNRESERVE, and other similar commands can
   be disabled on a copy of a VDE library. This mechanism is not
   intended to completely lock-out all access to a VDE library.

   Specification of /LOCK write-locks the library, and the
   corresponding /UNLOCK qualifier reverses the lock. The write-
   lock status is read only when the user initially accesses the
   library-once a user has connected to the library, the lock status
   is not updated.

   A write-locked library can be used to prevent various user
   modifications to the contents of the library during library
   maintenance, or to maintain a shadow copy of a library.

   Users holding the MODLIB privilege are allowed to override the
   library write-lock. An informational message will be displayed
   when the lock is overridden.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the database
   header record of the library is modified. The /LOG qualifier
   causes such messages to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them.
   The messages indicate that library attributes have been modified
   and that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=lib-name

   Specifies a new name for the current library. The new library
   name can be up to 39 characters long and must follow normal VDE
   name syntax.

   This value is available to procedures calling VDE via the
   VDE$LIBRARY_MNEMONIC name, and the database manager should set
   this value to match the values associated with this library that
   are specified in the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS logical name.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a new remark string for the library. The quoted remark
   string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any
   explanatory remark about the library that you want stored in the
   library database. This string replaces the remark string from
   the original CREATE LIBRARY command or from any previous MODIFY
   LIBRARY command.

   This value is available to procedures calling VDE via the
   VDE$LIBRARY_LABEL name, and the database manager should set this
   value to match any values associated with this library that are
   specified in the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS logical name.
 

/REPL_HISTORY

      /REPL_HISTORY
      /NOREPL_HISTORY

   Specifies whether VDE should maintain a history of all past
   source code replacements into the VDE library. The /REPL_HISTORY
   qualifier specifies that such history information be maintained
   in the VDE database. The /NOREPL_HISTORY qualifier specifies that
   such information not be maintained. When you maintain replacement
   history, you can display past replacements using the /HISTORY
   qualifier to the SHOW REPLACEMENT command.
 

/SEND_MAIL

      /SEND_MAIL
      /NOSEND_MAIL

   Specifies whether VDE should send mail notification messages
   for those VDE operations that normally send such messages. The
   /SEND_MAIL qualifier sets a library attribute that enables VDE to
   send such mail messages. The /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier clears that
   attribute, thus suppressing all VDE mail messages. The /NOSEND_
   MAIL qualifier is useful when you want to test or play with a
   private VDE library without sending notification messages to
   other people. However, for normal production use, you should
   always enable mail messages.
 

/SHOW_ARCH_NAME

      /SHOW_ARCH_NAME
      /NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME

   Specifies whether the architecture name is displayed as part of
   every module name in VDE output. The /SHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier
   sets a library attribute that causes VDE to always include
   the architecture name in every module name it displays. This
   attribute also causes the SHOW DEFAULTS command to display the
   default architecture. The /NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier clears
   this library attribute so that VDE omits the architecture names
   when displaying module names. You normally only want to see the
   architecture name if you have defined multiple architectures for
   your VDE library.

   This qualifier is not yet implemented.
 

/SHOW_GEN_EXPR

      /SHOW_GEN_EXPR
      /NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR

   Specifies whether the expected replace-time CMS generation
   expression for each module is displayed by the RESERVE command.
   The /SHOW_GEN_EXPR qualifier sets a library attribute that causes
   the RESERVE command to compute and display the CMS generation
   expression that the corresponding REPLACE command is most likely
   to use for the new module generation. You can use this value
   as an "audit trail identifier" in your code if your project
   uses this convention. This library attribute also causes the
   SHOW RESERVATION command to display the expected CMS generation
   expression and it causes the REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT
   command to print an informational message if the actual CMS
   generation expression for the replaced generation turns out to be
   different than the expected one. The /NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR qualifier
   disables this library attribute.

   Please note that VDE cannot guarantee that the expected CMS
   generation expression will actually be used. It is not possible
   to determine at RESERVE time whether a CMS variant letter should
   be used when the module is eventually replaced; that decision can
   only be made at REPLACE time and depends on propagation decisions
   and stream successor relationships at that time. However, the
   expected CMS generation expression is generally the one that is
   actually used.
 

/STATISTICS

   Enables statistics collection on the specified library. This
   will cause various extra questions to be asked during replacement
   and related operations. This includes the addition of questions
   around the reason for the change, the number of defects fixed,
   and the particular project a change is associated with.
 

/UNLOCK

   The /LOCK and /UNLOCK qualifiers provide a method by which
   RESERVE, REPLACE, UNRESERVE, and other similar commands can
   be disabled on a copy of a VDE library. This mechanism is not
   intended to completely lock-out all access to a VDE library.

   Specification of /LOCK write-locks the library, and the
   corresponding /UNLOCK qualifier reverses the lock. The write-
   lock status is read only when the user initially accesses the
   library-once a user has connected to the library, the lock status
   is not updated.

   A write-locked library can be used to prevent various user
   modifications to the contents of the library during library
   maintenance, or to maintain a shadow copy of a library.

   Users holding the MODLIB privilege are allowed to override the
   library write-lock. An informational message will be displayed
   when the lock is overridden.
 

/WILD_INS_GEN

      /WILD_INS_GEN
      /NOWILD_INS_GEN

   Specifies whether wildcard characters are allowed in the
   parameters to the INSERT GENERATION command when the /GENERATION
   qualifier is specified. The /WILD_INS_GEN qualifier sets a
   library attribute that causes VDE to allow wildcard characters in
   such parameters while the /NOWILD_INS_GEN qualifier clears this
   attribute. When the /GENERATION qualifier to INSERT GENERATION
   specifies a specific CMS generation expression, it is unlikely
   that this generation expression could apply to more than one
   module. As a result, it is unlikely that the use of wildcard
   characters in the module-name parameters will give the result
   the user intended. To prevent mistakes, VDE therefore does not
   allow such wildcard usage by default. However, there are some
   situations when such usage might be correct (for example, if the
   specified CMS generation expression is 1). For such situations,
   you can enable the use of wildcard characters with the /WILD_INS_
   GEN qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY LIBRARY/DEF_PRIVILEGES=(BUILD,CREMOD)
     %VDE-I-LIBMOD, library attributes modified in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     In this example, the standard default privileges for new users
     of the library are modified to consist of the BUILD and CREMOD
     privileges. The log messages confirm that the library has
     been modified and that the database transaction successfully
     completed.

   2.VDE> MODIFY LIBRARY/REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-LIBMOD, library attributes modified in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     This example modifies the remark string for the current
     library.
 

2  MODULE
   Modifies the attributes of modules in the VDE database.

   Requires CREMOD privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY MODULE  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of an existing module in the current VDE library whose
   attributes are to be modified. The module name must consist of
   a module name and a module type separated by a period (as in
   MODNAM.FOR) and may optionally be preceded by a facility name
   enclosed in square brackets (as in [ACCTNG]MODNAM.FOR where
   ACCTNG is the facility name). If no facility name is specified,
   the module is assumed to belong to the current default facility.

   You can modify more than one module by using wildcard characters
   in any of the three components of the module name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. VDE modifies the attributes of those
   modules whose names match the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Description
   The MODIFY MODULE command allows you to modify various attributes
   associated with a module. The MODIFY MODULE commands apply to
   attributes that span a number of module generations.

   For information on changing the attributes specific to a
   particular module generation, see MODIFY GENERATION. The MODIFY
   GENERATION/MAIN_STREAM, /OBSOLETE, and /REMARK qualifiers allow
   you to mark a module as the main line of descent, to mark a
   module as obsolete, or to change the remark associated with a
   particular module generation.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BINARY

      /BINARY
      /NOBINARY

   Specifies whether the source module is a binary file or not.
   The /BINARY qualifier specifies that the source module is a
   binary (non-text) file. Binary source files cannot be reviewed
   or differenced with the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command because they
   do not consist of ordinary ASCII text. The /NOBINARY qualifier
   specifies that the source module is an ordinary ASCII text file.
   These qualifiers are only meaningful for source modules.

   Large files that undergo extensive changes at frequent intervals,
   or are the output of a language or application, may not be suited
   for storage as standard delta files as the file delta is never
   used, occupies a considerable amount of disk space, and grows
   rapidly. See the /MARKER qualifier. Executable images, object
   modules, Postscript files, and BACKUP savesets are all example
   of "source" modules for which the marker-file mechanism may be
   appropriate.
 

/CONCURRENT

      /CONCURRENT
      /NOCONCURRENT

   Specifies whether the module can be reserved concurrently by more
   than one user. The /CONCURRENT qualifier allows the module to be
   reserved concurrently unless a user overrides this default with
   for a specific reservation. The /NOCONCURRENT qualifier specifies
   that the module cannot be reserved concurrently.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the
   attributes of each module modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes
   VDE to print a message for each module giving the name of the
   module and asking whether you want to modify the module. If you
   answer YES (or Y), the module's attributes are modified. If you
   answer NO (or N), the attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM
   qualifier causes VDE to modify the attributes of each module
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/DELETE

      /DELETE
      /NODELETE (default)

   Sets or clears the delete attribute for the module. This
   attribute allows the module to be deleted with the DELETE MODULE
   command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete attribute so that
   the module can be deleted. The /NODELETE qualifier clears the
   delete attribute so that the module cannot be deleted without
   first resetting the attribute.
 

/HISTORY

      /HISTORY[="string"]
      /NOHISTORY[="string"]

   Specifies the CMS history string to be associated with the
   module and whether history information should be included
   in source files when modules are retrieved with the FETCH or
   RESERVE command. History information gives a historical record of
   previous changes to the module.

   The /HISTORY qualifier specifies that history information should
   be included in source files by default when such files are
   retrieved with the FETCH or RESERVE command. The /NOHISTORY
   qualifier specifies that history information should be omitted.
   The string parameter to either qualifier specifies the default
   history string if the user specifies that history information
   should be included in a retrieved file. (If you specify the
   /NOHISTORY qualifier on the MODIFY MODULE command, you must
   use the /HISTORY qualifier on the FETCH or RESERVE command to
   use the default history string.) If you do not specify a string
   parameter, VDE supplies a default history string that depends on
   the module type.

   See the CMS documentation for a description of the CMS history
   string and its format.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the attributes of
   modules are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to
   be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that
   the modules have been modified and that the database transaction
   has successfully committed.
 

/MARKER

      /MARKER
      /NOMARKER

   Specifies whether the source module uses a marker file or not.
   The /MARKER qualifier specifies that the source module uses
   a marker file. When a source module uses a marker file, the
   module is stored as an ordinary file in one of the delta-file
   directories. A small text file, called the marker file, contains
   the full file name of that source file, and this marker file is
   stored in the module's delta file (CMS element). In short, the
   delta file contains a small text file that points to the module's
   actual source file. The marker-file mechanism is normally only
   used for large or frequently changed binary source modules, for
   which the delta-file mechanism may give poor performance or use
   excessive disk space.

   The /NOMARKER qualifier specifies that the source module does
   not use a marker file and that its text is stored directly in
   the delta file (CMS element) for the module. Ordinary ASCII text
   modules should not use marker files.

   Also see the /[NO]BINARY qualifier.
 

/NOTES

      /NOTES[="string"]
      /NONOTES[="string"]

   Specifies the CMS notes string to be associated with the module
   and whether CMS notes should be included in source files when
   modules are retrieved with the FETCH or RESERVE command. CMS
   notes indicate in what module generation each source line was
   created.

   The /NOTES qualifier specifies that notes information should be
   included in source files by default when such files are retrieved
   with the FETCH or RESERVE command. The /NONOTES qualifier
   specifies that notes information should be omitted. The string
   parameter to either qualifier specifies the default notes string
   if the user specifies that notes information should be included
   in a retrieved file. (If you specify the /NONOTES qualifier on
   the MODIFY MODULE command, you must use the /NOTES qualifier on
   the FETCH or RESERVE command to use the default notes string.)
   If you do not specify a string parameter, VDE supplies a default
   notes string that depends on the module type.

   See the CMS documentation for a description of the CMS notes
   string and its format.
 

/NOTIFY

      /NOTIFY=(username [,username...])
      /NONOTIFY[=(username [,username...])]

   The /NOTIFY qualifier specifies a list of users to notify of
   all changes to the specified module. VDE appends these users to
   the module's existing notification list. Each username parameter
   gives the OpenVMS username or mail address of a user who should
   be notified by mail message each time the specified module is
   replaced into the VDE library.

   Each username parameter can specify the username of a user
   already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS mail address
   with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail
   forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of
   users to notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind
   that the logical name must be defined when it is later used to
   send notification messages. It should thus be a group or system
   logical name or a logical name that is in some other way defined
   for all users of the VDE library.

   The /NONOTIFY qualifier specifies that a list of users already on
   the module's notification list be removed from that notification
   list. Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS username or mail
   address of a user to remove from the notification list. If you
   omit the username parameters, VDE removes the entire notification
   list for the module.

   If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users specified
   with the /NONOTIFY qualifier from the notification list before
   adding the users specified with the /NOTIFY qualifier.

   If you specify only one username parameter with either qualifier,
   you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
 

/POSITION

      /POSITION=column-number

   Specifies the default column number in which CMS notes are to
   be placed when this source module is retrieved with a FETCH
   or RESERVE command. The column number must be an integer in
   the range 1 to 511. If this qualifier is omitted, the default
   column number is 81. This qualifier has no effect unless notes
   are enabled with the /NOTES qualifier on the CREATE or MODIFY
   MODULE command or on the FETCH or RESERVE command.

   See the CMS documentation for a description of CMS notes and how
   notes are formatted at the ends of source lines.
 

/PROPAGATE

      /PROPAGATE
      /NOPROPAGATE

   Specifies whether automatic change propagation is allowed
   for this module when it is reserved and replaced into the
   library. /PROPAGATE allows automatic change propagation and
   /NOPROPAGATE disallows change propagation. If change propagation
   is disallowed, VDE automatically inhibits change propagation
   when the module is reserved or replaced as if the /NOPROPAGATE
   qualifier had been specified for the RESERVE or REPLACE command.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the module. This
   string replaces the remark string from the original CREATE
   MODULE command or from any previous MODIFY MODULE command. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long,
   may contain any explanatory remark about the module that you want
   stored in the VDE database. Typically the remark describes the
   function or contents of the module.

   This qualifier alters the module-level remark string. To
   change the remark on a particular module generation, see the
   documentation on the MODIFY GENERATION/REMARK command in MODIFY
   GENERATION.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])
      /NOREVIEWER[=(username [,username...])]

   The /REVIEWER qualifier specifies a list of reviewers for all
   changes to the specified module. VDE appends these reviewers to
   the module's existing reviewer list. Each username parameter
   gives the OpenVMS username of a user who should review all
   changes to the module. The user must already be recorded in
   the VDE database. When the module is replaced into the VDE
   library, VDE notifies the user of the change by mail message.
   If the replacement is queued, the user should then review the
   queued replacement before it is performed. If the replacement
   is immediate, VDE notifies the user of the new module generation
   that was created, and the user may then inspect that generation.

   The /NOREVIEWER qualifier specifies that a list of existing
   reviewers for the specified module be removed from the reviewer
   list. Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS username of a
   user who should be removed from the reviewer list. If you omit
   the username parameters, VDE removes the entire reviewer list for
   the module.

   If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users specified
   with the /NOREVIEWER qualifier from the reviewer list before
   adding the users specified with the /REVIEWER qualifier.

   If you specify only one username parameter with either qualifier,
   you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY MODULE MODNAM.C/REMARK="New Comment"
     %VDE-I-MODMOD, information for module [CODE]NEWNAM.C modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example changes the remark present on the module MODNAM.C.
     Since no facility is specified, the module is assumed to
     belong to the default facility, facility CODE in this case.
     The log messages confirm that the attributes of the module
     were modified and that the database transaction successfully
     completed.

   2.VDE> MODIFY MODULE/NOLOG [TAPE]DEVDRV.MAR -

     _VDE>                    /REMARK="Old tape device driver"
     VDE> MODIFY GENERATION [TAPE]DEVDRV.MAR -
     _VDE>                  /NOLOG /OBSOLETE
     VDE>

     In this example, the user changes the remark string for
     module DEVDRV.MAR in facility TAPE, and then uses the MODIFY
     GENERATION command to mark the module as obsolete. The
     /NOLOG qualifier is specified on both commands; the qualifier
     suppresses the display of messages from either.
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   Modifies the attributes of one or more queued replacements in the
   VDE database. The attributes of a replacement you can modify are
   its name, remark string, and reviewer list.

   Requires RESREP privilege to modify your own replacement.
   Requires PERFREP privilege to modify another user's replacement.

   Format

     MODIFY REPLACEMENT  rep-name [, rep-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of a queued replacement whose attributes are to be
   modified. You can modify more than one replacement at a time
   by using wildcard characters in the replacement name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a replacement name matches any single character in
   the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or
   more characters in the position it occupies. VDE modifies the
   attributes of those replacements whose names match the wildcard
   pattern.

   Do not specify the rep-name parameter if you use the
   /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   queued replacement modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes
   VDE to print a message for each replacement asking whether you
   want that replacement modified. If you answer YES (or Y), the
   replacement is modified. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement
   is not modified. If you enter a replacement name with a wildcard
   specification, VDE asks you to confirm the modification of each
   replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification.
   The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify the specified
   replacements without asking for confirmation.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=id-range

   Specifies that the replacements with the unique Replacement Ids
   given by the id-range parameter be modified. Do not specify the
   rep-name parameter when you use this qualifier.

   VDE assigns a unique Replacement Id to each immediate or queued
   replacement into the VDE library. VDE assigns Replacement Ids
   in chronological order so that the first replacement into the
   library has Id value 1, the next has Id value 2, and so on. When
   you use this qualifier, all replacements that have Id values in
   the range given by the id-range parameter are modified.

   The id-range parameter can be a single integer value, a range
   of integers, or a wildcard character. If the parameter is
   a single integer (for example, /IDENT=5), VDE modifies the
   replacement with that Replacement Id. If the parameter is a
   range of integers (specified as two integers separated by a
   colon as in /IDENT=3:5), VDE modifies the replacements with
   Ids in that range. Finally, if the id-range parameter is the
   asterisk wildcard character (as in /IDENT=*), VDE modifies all
   replacements.

   If you specify a zero or negative number in the id-range
   parameter, that number is relative to the largest Replacement
   Id value for the VDE library (the latest replacement). For
   example, if the latest replacement has Replacement Id 250, then
   /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=250 and /IDENT=-1 is equivalent
   to /IDENT=249.
 

/INFORMATION

      /INFORMATION[=file-spec]

   Specifies that a new information file should be attached to
   the queued replacement or that the existing information file
   should be edited. The file-spec parameter gives the OpenVMS file
   specification of a new information file for the replacement.
   If specified, this file is copied to the replacement's staging
   area and then supercedes any previous information file for
   the replacement. If this parameter is omitted, VDE asks you
   whether you want to edit the information file. If you answer
   YES, VDE invokes your preferred editor to edit the replacement's
   information file. If an information file already exists, the
   editor edits that file; otherwise it creates a new information
   file. The information file is used to pass information about the
   replacement to reviewers and others.

   To edit an information file through VDE, you should first declare
   your preferred editor with the SET EDITOR command. If you do not
   declare an editor, VDE invoked the system default text editor.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the replacements
   are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the replacements have been modified and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=rep-name

   Specifies a new name for the queued replacement. The new
   replacement name can be up to 39 characters long and must follow
   normal VDE name syntax. After the replacement name has been
   changed, you must refer to the replacement by its new name in all
   subsequent VDE commands. The old name is lost from the database.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a new remark string for the replacement. This string
   replaces the remark string from the original REPLACE or CREATE
   REPLACEMENT command or from any previous MODIFY REPLACEMENT
   command. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   replacement that you want stored in the VDE database.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])
      /NOREVIEWER[=(username [,username...])]

   The /REVIEWER qualifier specifies a list of reviewers for the
   replacement. VDE appends these reviewers to the replacement's
   existing reviewer list. Each username parameter gives the
   OpenVMS username of a user who should review all code included
   in the replacement. The user must already be recorded in the VDE
   database. VDE notifies the user by mail message that he or she
   should review the replacement.

   The /NOREVIEWER qualifier specifies that a list of existing
   reviewers for the replacement be removed from the reviewer list.
   Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS username of a user
   who should be removed from the reviewer list. If you omit the
   username parameters, VDE removes the entire reviewer list for the
   replacement.

   If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users specified
   with the /NOREVIEWER qualifier from the reviewer list before
   adding the users specified with the /REVIEWER qualifier.

   If you specify only one username parameter with either qualifier,
   you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY REPLACEMENT SMITH-2/REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-REPMOD, information for replacement SMITH-2 modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example modifies replacement SMITH-2 to give it a new
     remark string. The log messages show that the replacement has
     successfully been modified.
 

2  RESERVATION
   Modifies the attributes of module reservations in the VDE
   database.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY RESERVATION  mod-name [,mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a reserved source module whose reservation attributes
   are to be modified. The module name consists of an optional
   facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module name,
   and an optional type name preceded by a period (such as
   [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility name is omitted, the module
   is assumed to belong to the default facility. If the type name
   is omitted, the reservation attributes of all source modules with
   the given module name in the given facility are modified.

   You can modify the reservation attributes of more than one module
   using wildcard characters in any component of the module name.
   The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in
   the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or
   more characters in the position it occupies. The reservation
   attributes of the source modules whose names match the wildcard
   pattern are modified.

   If you use the /SESSION qualifier, those reservations that are
   members of the specified reservation session are modified.
   In this case, you must omit the mod-name parameters from the
   command.
 

3  Description
   When you reserve a module from the VDE library, the RESERVE
   command records the reservation in the VDE database. The MODIFY
   RESERVATION command lets you modify various attributes of one or
   more such reservations. The command modifies only reservations
   that cover the default development stream or the stream specified
   with the /STREAM qualifier.

   If you have more than one reservation of a module, you must
   specify the exact reservation to be modified using the
   /IDENTIFICATION qualifier. Use the SHOW RESERVATION command to
   determine the identification of each reservation.

   To modify another user's reservation, use the /USERNAME qualifier
   to specify the OpenVMS username of that other user. You must have
   the USERNAME privilege to use the /USERNAME qualifier.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONCURRENT

   Specifies that the module can be reserved by another user while
   you have it reserved. This qualifier changes the concurrent-
   reservation attribute of the reservation.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   reservation modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each module that you specify asking whether you
   want to modify its reservation. If you answer YES (or Y), the
   reservation is modified. If you answer NO (or N), it is not
   modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify each
   specified reservation without asking for confirmation.
 

/FOLD

      /FOLD[=fold-ident]
      /NOFOLD

   The /FOLD qualifier specifies a fold record to be cancelled when
   this module reservation is eventually replaced into the library.
   The fold-ident parameter gives the fold identifier of a fold
   record for the module being reserved and for the stream in which
   the reservation is done. When you later replace the module and
   VDE performs the replacement, VDE will cancel this fold record
   from the VDE database. You can omit the fold-ident parameter
   if there is only one fold record for the specified module and
   stream. You can use the /FOLD qualifier if you are modifying the
   module to satisfy an existing fold record. You can also specify
   the /FOLD qualifier with the REPLACE command to achieve the same
   effect.

   The /NOFOLD qualifier specifies that no fold record be cancelled
   when this module reservation is replaced into the library. This
   qualifier cancels the effect of a /FOLD qualifier on a previous
   MODIFY RESERVATION command or on the original RESERVE command.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=res-ident

   Specifies the reservation to be modified. This qualifier is
   required when you have multiple reservations of the same module
   in the default development stream. The res-ident parameter is
   the reservation identifier of the reservation to be modified. The
   reservation identifier is the identifier you specified when you
   reserved the module, usually a small integer value. Use the SHOW
   RESERVATIONS command to display the reservation identifier of
   each reservation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each reservation
   is modified. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that each reservation has been modified and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NEW_SESSION

      /NEW_SESSION=session-name

   Specifies that VDE should add the module reservation to the
   reservation session given by the session-name parameter. If
   no session by that name exists, VDE creates a new reservation
   session by that name and adds the reservation to it. If the
   reservation already belongs to an existing session, it is removed
   from that session and added to the new session.
 

/NOCONCURRENT

   Specifies that the module cannot be reserved by another user
   while you have it reserved. You must replace or unreserve the
   module before others can reserve it. This qualifier changes the
   concurrent-reservation attribute of the reservation.
 

/PROPAGATE

      /PROPAGATE=stream-name
      /NOPROPAGATE

   This qualifier controls the default module propogation
   behaviour of the subsequent REPLACE command, and it controls
   the reservation "shadow" for this particular reservation.

   When specified, the /PROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to propagate
   the changed module(s) to the stream specified by the stream-
   name parameter, but not to any successors of that stream-change
   propagation thus stops at the specified stream.

   The /NOPROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to disable all propagate of
   the change beyond the current stream (the default stream or the
   stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier).

   If you omit both qualifiers, the REPLACE command will propagate
   the changed modules to all successors of the current stream.

   Because these qualifiers determine what streams a subsequent
   REPLACE command will affect, they also determine what streams-
   the "shadow"-the new module reservations cover. A reservation
   that covers fewer streams allows other users to reserve the same
   module in other streams with less likelihood of conflict.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a new remark string to be associated with the module
   reservation. This qualifier changes the remark attribute and the
   previous reservation remark is lost from the database. The remark
   is enclosed in quotation marks.
 

/SESSION

      /SESSION=session-name

   Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations
   together, typically to group all modules related to a particular
   source code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all
   component modules reserved to be treated as a single entity
   for subsequent replacement operations. A session also allows
   additional modules to be reserved and incorporated into an
   existing session at a later time.

   If this qualifier is specified, the modules referenced by the
   session-name session are the target; do not specify the mod-name
   module name parameters.

   Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE,
   MODIFY SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL
   SESSION commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on
   a queued-replacement stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be
   combined into the same session.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that reservations for the development stream given
   by the stream-name parameter be modified. If this qualifier is
   omitted, reservations for the default development stream are
   modified.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that reservations made by another user are to be
   modified. The username parameter is the OpenVMS username of the
   other user. You must have the USERNAME privilege to use this
   qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY RESERVATION FOO /REMARK="Fix QARS 32 and 33"
     %VDE-I-RESMOD, reservation for module [FACIL]FOO.MAR modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW RESERVATION FOO/FULL
     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]FOO.MAR
        Reservation created on 29-DEC-1989 13:09:47.27
        Reservation created by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Generation 29 (27B2) reserved from stream V5.4
        Expected generation expression at replacement is 27B3
        Concurrent reservations are allowed
        Remark: Fix QARS 32 and 33

     VDE>

     This example modifies the reservation remarks of all source
     modules in the default facility with the name FOO. In this
     case, only module [FACIL]FOO.MAR matches the module name, and
     its reservation remark is changed. The SHOW RESERVATION command
     confirms that the reservation now has the new remark.

   2.VDE> MODIFY RESERVATION/NOCONCURRENT [FACIL]MOD1.FOR
     %VDE-I-RESMOD, reservation for module [FACIL]MOD1.FOR modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW RESERVATION/FULL MOD1.FOR
     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]MOD1.FOR
        Reservation created on 29-DEC-1989 13:18:34.75
        Reservation created by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Generation 3 (3) reserved from stream MAIN
        Expected generation expression at replacement is 4
        No concurrent reservations are allowed
        Remark: Add new look-up algorithm

     VDE>

     The MODIFY RESERVATION command specifies that concurrent
     reservations are not allowed for module MOD1.FOR in facility
     FACIL. The output from the subsequent SHOW RESERVATION command
     shows that no concurrent reservations are allowed.

   3.VDE> MODIFY RESERVATION MOD1.FOR/IDENT=2/REMARK="Fix uninitialized pointer"
     %VDE-I-RESMOD, reservation for module [FACIL]MOD1.FOR modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW RESERVATION MOD1.FOR /FULL
     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]MOD1.FOR
        Reservation created on 24-MAR-1989 11:24:48.77
        Reservation created by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Generation 1 (1) reserved from stream MAIN
        Expected generation expression at replacement is 2
        Concurrent reservations are allowed
        Remark: Fix access violation

     Reservation 2 of [FACIL]MOD1.FOR
        Reservation created on 24-MAR-1989 11:25:36.85
        Reservation created by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Generation 1 (1) reserved from stream MAIN
        Expected generation expression at replacement is 2
        Concurrent reservations are allowed
        Remark: Fix uninitialized pointer

     VDE>

     This example modifies one of two concurrent reservations of
     the same module. Because there are concurrent reservations,
     the MODIFY RESERVATION command must have the /IDENTIFICATION
     qualifier to specify which reservation to modify. In this
     case, the command modifies the remark for reservation 2 of
     [FACIL]MOD1.FOR. The SHOW RESERVATION command confirms that
     reservation 2 now has the new remark.
 

2  SCRIPT
   Modifies the remark string associated with a VDE script in the
   VDE database.

   Requires CRESCRP privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY SCRIPT
 

3  Description
   The MODIFY SCRIPT command modifies the remark string for a
   specified VDE script in the VDE database. VDE only modifies
   the script of the specified type that belongs to the default
   development stream.

   You must specify a script-type qualifier to select the script
   you want modified. See the description of the CREATE SCRIPT
   command for an explanation of the different types of scripts
   and how scripts are selected using script-type qualifiers. You
   must also specify the script segment number unless the default
   value applies.

   Keywords used within scripts are documented in Script Keywords,
   while script functions are in Script Functions, and script types
   are in Script Types. For other script-related commands, also see
   CREATE SCRIPT, DELETE SCRIPT, EXTRACT SCRIPT, INVOKE SCRIPT, and
   SHOW SCRIPT.
 

3  Qualifiers

   Specifies that the default stream's COMPILE script with the
   specified mod-name specification be modified.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   script modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each script asking whether you want that script
   modified. If you answer YES (or Y), the script's attributes are
   modified in the database. If you answer NO (or N), the script is
   not modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify the
   specified scripts without asking for confirmation.
 

/COPY

      /COPY=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's COPY script with the
   specified mod-name specification be modified.

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the script
   is modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the script has been modified and that the database
   transaction has committed successfully.
 

/NEW_STREAM

      /NEW_STREAM=fac-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NEW_STREAM script with the
   specified fac-name specification be modified.
 

/NOKEEP

      /NOKEEP=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NOKEEP script with the
   specified mod-name specification be modified.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a new remark string for the script. This string
   replaces the remark string from the original CREATE SCRIPT
   command or from a previous MODIFY SCRIPT command. The quoted
   remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the script that you want
   stored in the VDE database.

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY SCRIPT/COMPILE=*.C/REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-SCRPMOD, script information modified in the database
      script to compile module [CODE]*.C (segment 10)
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/FULL/COMPILE=[CODE]*.C
     Script to compile module [CODE]*.C (segment 10)
        Script added to database on  9-DEC-1989 20:34:25.44
        Script added to database by user JONES (John Jones)
        Remark: New remark string

     VDE>

     This example modifies the script to compile all C modules in
     facility CODE to have a new remark string. The log messages
     show that the script was successfully modified. The SHOW
     SCRIPT/FULL command shows that the database contains the new
     remark string.
 

2  SESSION
   Modifies the attributes of one or more reservation sessions in
   the VDE database. The attributes of a session you can modify are
   its name and remark string.

   Requires RESREP privilege to modify your own session. Requires
   PERFREP privilege to modify another user's session.

   Format

     MODIFY SESSION  session-name [, session-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

session-name

   The name of a reservation session whose attributes are to be
   modified. You can modify more than one session at a time by using
   wildcard characters in the session name. The percent sign (%)  in
   a session name matches any single character in the position it
   occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in
   the position it occupies. VDE modifies the attributes of those
   sessions whose names match the wildcard pattern.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   reservation session modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes
   VDE to print a message for each session asking whether you want
   that session modified. If you answer YES (or Y), the session is
   modified. If you answer NO (or N), the session is not modified.
   If you enter a session name with a wildcard specification, VDE
   asks you to confirm the modification of each session whose name
   matches the wildcard specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier
   causes VDE to modify the specified sessions without asking for
   confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the sessions
   are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that
   the sessions have been modified and that the database transaction
   has successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=session-name

   Specifies a new name for the reservation session. The new session
   name can be up to 39 characters long and must follow normal
   VDE name syntax. After the session name has been changed, you
   must refer to the session by its new name in all subsequent VDE
   commands. The old name is lost from the database.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a new remark string for the session. This string
   replaces the remark string from the original RESERVE or CREATE
   SESSION command or from any previous MODIFY SESSION command. The
   quoted remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the session that you want
   stored in the VDE database.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY SESSION SMITH-2/REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-SESMOD, information for session SMITH-2 modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example modifies session SMITH-2 to give it a new remark
     string. The log messages show that the session has successfully
     been modified.
 

2  STEP
   Modifies a build-step definition in the VDE database. This
   command lets you add or remove individual input and output
   modules to the build-dependency information of a compile or link
   step.

   Requires CRESTEP privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY STEP  step-mod-name = mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameters
 

step-mod-name

   The name of the module that is compiled or linked by the build
   step. This name consists of a module name and a type name
   separated by a period (such as MOD1.PAS) and optionally may
   include a facility name enclosed in square brackets (such as
   [FACNAM]MOD1.PAS). The module name may not contain wildcard
   characters. If no facility name is specified, the default
   facility is assumed. This module must already exist in the
   database and it must already have build-dependency information.
 

mod-name

   The name of a module that you want to add or remove as an input
   or output for the build step. This name consists of a module
   name and a type name (for example, MOD1.OBJ) and may include
   a facility name enclosed in square brackets (for example,
   [FACNAM]MOD1.OBJ). If no facility name is specified, the default
   facility is assumed.

   You can add or remove many input or output modules by specifying
   wildcard characters in any component of the module name. The
   percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the
   position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more
   characters in the position it occupies. Those modules whose names
   match the wildcard pattern are added to or removed from the build
   step.

   If the output module you specify does not already exist in the
   database, the MODIFY STEP command adds it to the database. Input
   modules, however, must already be defined in the database. Also,
   you cannot specify a source module as an output from a build
   step.
 

3  Description
   To be able to perform minimal system builds, VDE records all
   inputs and outputs for each build step. This information is known
   as "build dependency information." Normally, VDE collects build
   dependency information automatically when you perform system
   builds. For some build steps, however, this is not possible
   and you must use the CREATE STEP command to enter the build
   dependency information into the VDE database.

   The MODIFY STEP command is normally used to edit build step
   definitions created with the CREATE STEP command. The MODIFY
   STEP command allows you to change build dependency information
   in the VDE database by adding or removing individual input and
   output modules.

   Build dependency information is always created in the default
   development stream. To modify a build step definition for use
   in more than one development stream, you must use the MODIFY
   STEP command for each stream. For each stream, first enter the
   SET STREAM command to set the development stream, then enter the
   MODIFY STEP command to modify the build dependency information in
   the VDE database.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ADD

   Controls whether the modules specified in the parameter list are
   added to or removed from the build-step definition. The /ADD
   qualifier adds the specified modules to the build step. The
   /REMOVE qualifier removes the specified modules from the build
   step. To set the default for the command as a whole, specify
   the qualifier after the MODIFY STEP keywords. To override that
   default for a single module, specify the qualifier after the
   mod-name parameter you choose to add to or remove from the build
   step. If you do not specify one of these qualifiers, modules are
   added to the build step.

   Of /ADD and /REMOVE, /ADD is the default.
 

/REMOVE

   Controls whether the modules specified in the parameter list are
   added to or removed from the build-step definition. The /ADD
   qualifier adds the specified modules to the build step. The
   /REMOVE qualifier removes the specified modules from the build
   step. To set the default for the command as a whole, specify
   the qualifier after the MODIFY STEP keywords. To override that
   default for a single module, specify the qualifier after the
   mod-name parameter you choose to add to or remove from the build
   step. If you do not specify one of these qualifiers, modules are
   added to the build step.

   Of /ADD and /REMOVE, /ADD is the default.
 

/COMPILE

   Specifies whether the build step to be modified is a compile
   step, copy step, or link step. /COMPILE modifies a compile step,
   /COPY modifies a copy step, and /LINK modifies a link step for
   the specified module.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/COPY

   Specifies whether the build step to be modified is a compile
   step, copy step, or link step. /COMPILE modifies a compile step,
   /COPY modifies a copy step, and /LINK modifies a link step for
   the specified module.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/LINK

   Specifies whether the build step to be modified is a compile
   step, copy step, or link step. /COMPILE modifies a compile step,
   /COPY modifies a copy step, and /LINK modifies a link step for
   the specified module.

   Of /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, /COMPILE is the default.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM (default)
      /NOCONFIRM

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want the
   build-step definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes
   VDE to print a message asking whether you want the build step
   modified. If you answer YES (or Y), the build-step definition
   is modified. If you answer NO (or N), the build-step definition
   is not modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier also causes VDE to ask
   you to confirm the addition or removal of each individual input
   or output module for the build step. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier
   causes VDE to modify the build-step definition without asking for
   confirmation.
 

/INPUT

   Specifies whether the mod-name parameters are inputs to or
   outputs from the build step. The /INPUT qualifier designates
   the specified modules as inputs in the build-step definition. The
   /OUTPUT qualifier designates the specified modules as outputs in
   the build-step definition. To set the default for the command as
   a whole, specify the qualifier after the MODIFY STEP keywords. To
   override that default for a single module, specify the qualifier
   after the mod-name parameter you choose to mark as an input or
   output.

   Of /INPUT and /OUTPUT, /INPUT is the default.
 

/OUTPUT

   Specifies whether the mod-name parameters are inputs to or
   outputs from the build step. The /INPUT qualifier designates
   the specified modules as inputs in the build-step definition. The
   /OUTPUT qualifier designates the specified modules as outputs in
   the build-step definition. To set the default for the command as
   a whole, specify the qualifier after the MODIFY STEP keywords. To
   override that default for a single module, specify the qualifier
   after the mod-name parameter you choose to mark as an input or
   output.

   Of /INPUT and /OUTPUT, /INPUT is the default.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the build step
   definition is modified in the database. The /LOG qualifier
   causes the messages to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier
   suppresses them. The messages indicate that the build step has
   been modified, that the specified modules have been added to
   or removed from the step, and that the database transaction has
   committed successfully.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY STEP MOD4.FOR = FOO.FOR/INPUT, MOD4.ANA/OUTPUT
     %VDE-I-COMSTEPMOD, compile step for module [CODE]MOD4.FOR modified in database
     %VDE-I-MODINSTEP, module [CODE]FOO.FOR is an input to the build step
     %VDE-I-MODOUTSTEP, module [CODE]MOD4.ANA is an output from the build step
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW STEP/FULL MOD4.FOR
     Compile Step for module [CODE]MOD4.FOR
        Dependency links for stream V2.1 follow
        Inputs to the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD4.FOR
           Module [CODE]FOO.FOR
        Outputs from the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD4.$OBJ
           Module [CODE]MOD4.LIS
           Module [CODE]MOD4.ANA
        Build step has 2 inputs and 3 outputs

     VDE>

     This example modifies the build dependency information for
     the build step that compiles module MOD4.FOR. The command adds
     module FOO.FOR as an input to the step and adds module MOD4.ANA
     as an output from the step. The SHOW STEP command shows that
     the new input and output modules have been added to the build
     dependency information for the step.

   2.VDE> MODIFY STEP/LINK MOD1.EXE = FOO.$OBJ/REMOVE/INPUT, MOD1.MAP/ADD/OUTPUT
     %VDE-I-LNKSTEPMOD, link step for module [CODE]MOD1.EXE modified in database
     %VDE-I-MODREMINSTEP, module [CODE]FOO.$OBJ removed as an input to build step
     %VDE-I-MODOUTSTEP, module [CODE]MOD1.MAP is an output from the build step
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW STEP/LINK/FULL MOD1.EXE
     Link Step for module [CODE]MOD1.EXE
        Dependency links for stream V2.1 follow
        Inputs to the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD1.$OBJ
           Module [CODE]MOD2.$OBJ
        Outputs from the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD1.EXE
           Module [CODE]MOD1.MAP
        Build step has 2 inputs and 2 outputs

     VDE>

     This MODIFY STEP command modifies the build dependency
     information for the build step that links module MOD1.EXE.
     The command removes FOO.$OBJ as an input to the build step and
     adds MOD1.MAP as an output from the step. The SHOW STEP command
     confirms that the changes have been made to the step's build
     dependency information.
 

2  STREAM
   Modifies the attributes of one or more development streams in the
   VDE database.

   Requires CRESTRM or MODSTRM privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY STREAM  stream-name [, stream-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a stream in the current VDE library whose attributes
   are to be modified. You can modify more than one stream at
   a time by using wildcard characters in the stream name. The
   percent sign (%)  in a stream name matches any single character
   in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero
   or more characters in the position it occupies. VDE modifies
   the attributes of those streams whose names match the wildcard
   pattern.

   The stream name can be up to 39 characters long. It must follow
   VDE name syntax. Unlike other VDE names, the stream name can
   contain periods (.).  The use of the facility prefix VDE$ is
   expressly prohibited.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CMS_CLASS

      /CMS_CLASS
      /NOCMS_CLASS

   Sets or clears the CMS-class attribute of the stream. The /CMS_
   CLASS qualifier causes VDE to create a CMS class with the same
   name as the stream in each facility's CMS library and to then
   maintain that class when the REPLACE command and certain other
   commands change what module generations belong to the stream. The
   /NOCMS_CLASS qualifier causes VDE to not maintain a CMS class for
   the stream.

   The /CMS_CLASS qualifier interacts with the /INIT_CMS_CLASS
   and /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS qualifiers; see the descriptions of these
   qualifiers for details.

   You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use these qualifiers.
 

/CONFERENCE

      /CONFERENCE=file-spec
      /NOCONFERENCE

   Specifies whether a Notes conference for replacement information
   should be associated with the new stream. The /CONFERENCE
   qualifier specifies that the notes conference given by the file-
   spec parameter should be used to record all replacements into the
   stream. VDE then enters a new note into the conference for each
   queued or immediate replacement and a reply to that note when
   a queued replacement is actually performed. The /NOCONFERENCE
   qualifier specifies that no such notes conference should be used.

   Under normal circumstances, just the file name should be
   specified in the file-spec parameter. VDE applies defaults to
   the notes conference file specification based on the translation
   of the logical name VDE$NOTES_LIBRARY. If this logical name is
   not defined, the default file specification "NOTES$LIBRARY:.NOTE"
   is applied to the file-spec parameter.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   stream definition modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
   print a message for the specified stream giving the name of the
   stream and asking whether you want to modify that stream. If you
   answer YES (or Y), its attributes are modified. If you answer NO
   (or N), its attributes are not modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier
   causes VDE to modify the attributes of the stream without asking
   for confirmation.
 

/DELETE

      /DELETE
      /NODELETE (default)

   Sets or clears the delete attribute for the stream. This
   attribute allows the stream to be deleted with the DELETE STREAM
   command. The /DELETE qualifier sets the delete attribute so
   that the stream can be deleted. The /NODELETE qualifier clears
   the delete attribute so that the stream cannot be deleted
   without first resetting the attribute. You must have the CRESTRM
   privilege to use these qualifiers.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the stream
   definitions are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the stream definitions have been modified and that the
   database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/INIT_CMS_CLASS

      /INIT_CMS_CLASS
      /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS

   Specifies whether VDE initializes the CMS class for the stream
   in each facility's CMS library when the /CMS_CLASS qualifier
   specifies that such a class should be maintained. /INIT_CMS_CLASS
   sets an attribute that causes the MODIFY STREAM command with
   the /CMS_CLASS qualifier to create and populate a CMS class with
   the same name as the stream in each facility. /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS
   clears this attribute so that MODIFY STREAM does not create or
   populate such CMS classes. /NOINIT_CMS_CLASS is useful for very
   large VDE libraries where the initialization of CMS classes take
   an excessively long time. For such libraries, it is better to
   use a separate command procedure to initialize the desired CMS
   classes; such a procedure can process the facilities of your
   library in parallel for faster completion.

   You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use these qualifiers.
 

/NAME

      /NAME=stream-name

   Specifies a new name for the stream. The stream name can be up to
   39 characters long and must follow normal VDE name syntax, except
   that a stream name can contain periods (.)  . After the stream
   name has been changed, you must refer to the stream by its new
   name in all subsequent VDE commands. The old name is lost from
   the database.
 

/NOSUCCESSOR

      /NOSUCCESSOR[=(succ-name [, succ-name...])]

   Specifies streams that should no longer be successors to the
   stream being modified. A successor to a stream is another stream
   to which source changes are propagated by the REPLACE command.
   Each succ-name parameter specifies the name of a stream that
   is currently a successor to the stream given by the stream-
   name parameter, but that no longer should be a successor. The
   specified streams are thus removed from the list of successors
   stored in the database.

   If the list of succ-name parameters is omitted, all current
   successors of the stream being modified are removed from that
   stream's successor list.

   You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use this qualifier.
 

/NOTIFY

      /NOTIFY=(username [,username...])
      /NONOTIFY[=(username [,username...])]

   The /NOTIFY qualifier specifies a list of users to notify of
   all replacements into the specified stream, and of all facility
   creation operations. VDE appends these users to the stream's
   existing notification list. Each username parameter gives the
   OpenVMS username or mail address of a user who should be notified
   by mail message each time a module is replaced into the stream.

   Each username parameter can specify the username of a user
   already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS mail address
   with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail
   forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of
   users to notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind
   that the logical name must be defined when it is later used to
   send notification messages. It should thus be a group or system
   logical name or a logical name that is in some other way defined
   for all users of the VDE library.

   The /NONOTIFY qualifier specifies that a list of users already on
   the stream's notification list be removed from that notification
   list. Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS username or mail
   address of a user to remove from the notification list. If you
   omit the username parameters, VDE removes the entire notification
   list for the stream.

   If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users specified
   with the /NONOTIFY qualifier from the notification list before
   adding the users specified with the /NOTIFY qualifier.

   If you specify only one username parameter with either qualifier,
   you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
 

/OPEN

   Sets the status of the stream to open, frozen, or permanently
   closed. If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all users can reserve
   and replace source modules from the stream and thereby modify the
   contents of the stream.

   If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve
   modules from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN
   privilege to replace modules into the stream; non-privileged
   users cannot change the contents of the stream. You can later
   change the status to open with another MODIFY STREAM command, so
   the stream is not permanently frozen.

   If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved
   from or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed
   with a subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the
   UNCLOSE privilege. Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want
   the contents of the stream to change again, for example, when
   capturing a base-level of your software system or when capturing
   the final state of a released version of your software.

   You must have the UNCLOSE privilege to use the /OPEN or /FROZEN
   qualifier for a closed stream.
 

/FROZEN

   Sets the status of the stream to open, frozen, or permanently
   closed. If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all users can reserve
   and replace source modules from the stream and thereby modify the
   contents of the stream.

   If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve
   modules from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN
   privilege to replace modules into the stream; non-privileged
   users cannot change the contents of the stream. You can later
   change the status to open with another MODIFY STREAM command, so
   the stream is not permanently frozen.

   If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved
   from or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed
   with a subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the
   UNCLOSE privilege. Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want
   the contents of the stream to change again, for example, when
   capturing a base-level of your software system or when capturing
   the final state of a released version of your software.

   You must have the UNCLOSE privilege to use the /OPEN or /FROZEN
   qualifier for a closed stream.
 

/CLOSED

   Sets the status of the stream to open, frozen, or permanently
   closed. If you specify the /OPEN qualifier, all users can reserve
   and replace source modules from the stream and thereby modify the
   contents of the stream.

   If you specify the /FROZEN qualifier, all users may reserve
   modules from the stream. However, a user must have the FROZEN
   privilege to replace modules into the stream; non-privileged
   users cannot change the contents of the stream. You can later
   change the status to open with another MODIFY STREAM command, so
   the stream is not permanently frozen.

   If you specify the /CLOSED qualifier, modules cannot be reserved
   from or replaced into the stream. This status cannot be changed
   with a subsequent MODIFY STREAM command unless you have the
   UNCLOSE privilege. Use the /CLOSED qualifier when you never want
   the contents of the stream to change again, for example, when
   capturing a base-level of your software system or when capturing
   the final state of a released version of your software.

   You must have the UNCLOSE privilege to use the /OPEN or /FROZEN
   qualifier for a closed stream.
 

/OWNER

      /OWNER=username
      /NOOWNER

   The /OWNER qualifier specifies the owner of the specified stream.
   The username parameter gives the OpenVMS username of a user who
   should be recorded as the "owner" of the stream. VDE assigns no
   special meaning to the owner of a stream, but the SHOW STREAM
   command displays the owner. The owner could thus be the person to
   contact with questions about the stream.

   The /NOOWNER qualifier specifies that the stream has no owner.
   Both qualifiers remove the previous owner's ownership of the
   stream.
 

/POPULATE

      /POPULATE
      /NOPOPULATE

   Specifies whether the stream is allowed to be populated with
   generations from another stream using the POPULATE STREAM
   command. /POPULATE allows subsequent use of the POPULATE STREAM
   command to populate the stream and /NOPOPULATE disallows such
   use. You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use these qualifiers.
 

/PROCESS_COUNT

      /PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count

   Specifies the default number of processes to execute build
   jobs for the stream. This parameter determines the degree of
   parallelism for the stream's build jobs. See the description of
   the BUILD command for a detailed description of this qualifier.
 

/QUEUE

      /QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])

   Specifies the default batch queues to which build jobs for
   the stream are submitted. See the description of the BUILD
   command for a detailed description of this qualifier and for a
   description of its interaction with the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string for the stream. The quoted remark
   string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may contain any
   explanatory remark about the stream that you want stored in the
   VDE database. Typically the remark describes what version or
   base-level of your system the stream represents. This string
   replaces the remark string from the original CREATE STREAM
   command or from any previous MODIFY STREAM command.
 

/REPLACEMENT

      /REPLACEMENT=keyword

   Sets or clears the queued-replacement attribute for the stream.
   This attribute controls whether the REPLACE command permits
   immediate replacements into the stream or requires queued
   replacements. If the keyword parameter is IMMEDIATE, the REPLACE
   command will immediately replace modules into the stream by
   default. If the parameter is QUEUE, the REPLACE command will
   always queue replacements for the stream so that modules are not
   replaced into the stream until a privileged user enters a PERFORM
   REPLACEMENT command.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])
      /NOREVIEWER[=(username [,username...])]

   The /REVIEWER qualifier specifies a list of reviewers for all
   module replacements into the specified stream. VDE appends these
   reviewers to the stream's existing reviewer list. Each username
   parameter gives the OpenVMS username of a user who should review
   all replacements into the stream. The user must already be
   recorded in the VDE database. When a module is replaced into the
   stream, VDE notifies the user of the replacement by mail message.
   If the replacement is queued, the user should then review the
   queued replacement before it is performed. If the replacement
   is immediate, VDE notifies the user of the new module generation
   that was created, and the user may then inspect that generation.

   The /NOREVIEWER qualifier specifies that a list of existing
   reviewers for the specified stream be removed from the reviewer
   list. Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS username of a
   user who should be removed from the reviewer list. If you omit
   the username parameters, VDE removes the entire reviewer list for
   the stream.

   If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users specified
   with the /NOREVIEWER qualifier from the reviewer list before
   adding the users specified with the /REVIEWER qualifier.

   If you specify only one username parameter with either qualifier,
   you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
 

/STEP_DELAY

      /STEP_DELAY=time-interval

   Specifies the default step-delay time interval used by build jobs
   for the stream. See the description of the BUILD command for a
   detailed description of this qualifier.
 

/SUCCESSOR

      /SUCCESSOR=(succ-name [, succ-name...])

   Specifies new successors to the stream being modified. A
   successor to a stream is another stream to which source changes
   are propagated by the REPLACE command. Each succ-name parameter
   specifies the name of a stream that becomes a successor to
   the stream given by the stream-name parameter. The specified
   successors are added to the list of successors already stored
   in the database. You must have the CRESTRM privilege to use this
   qualifier.
 

/TIMEOUT

      /TIMEOUT=time-interval

   Specifies the default timeout interval used by build jobs for the
   stream. See the description of the BUILD command for a detailed
   description of this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY STREAM V3.3-FT1 /REMARK="New remark string"
     %VDE-I-STRMMOD, information for stream V3.3-FT1 modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     In this example, the user specifies a new remark string for
     stream V3.3-FT1. This remark string can be retrieved with a
     subsequent SHOW STREAM command.

   2.VDE> MODIFY STREAM/NAME=V5.3 HICKORY
     %VDE-I-STRMMOD, information for stream V5.3 modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     In this example, the name of stream HICKORY is changed to V5.3.
     You must refer to the stream by this new name in all subsequent
     VDE commands.

   3.VDE> MODIFY STREAM/CONFIRM BLVL-7/REMARK="New remark string", -
     _VDE>                       BLVL-9/REMARK="New remark string"
     Modify stream BLVL-7 ? [No]: Y
     %VDE-I-STRMMOD, stream BLVL-7 modified in the database
     Modify stream BLVL-9 ? [No]: N
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the /CONFIRM qualifier. This qualifier
     causes VDE to ask the user whether each specified stream should
     be modified. For stream BLVL-7, the user answers Y (for YES)
     and the remark string for that stream is modified in the
     database, as the log message shows. For stream BLVL-9, the
     user answers N (for NO) and that stream is not modified. Hence
     there is no log message for that stream. The final log message
     indicates that the database transaction for the whole command
     has successfully committed.
 

2  USER
   Modifies one or more attributes of the database record of one or
   more users.

   Requires CREUSR privilege.

   Format

     MODIFY USER  username [, username...]
 

3  Parameter
 

username

   The OpenVMS username of the user whose record is to be modified
   in the current VDE library. You can modify more than one user
   record by using wildcard characters in the username. The percent
   sign (%)  in a username matches any single character in the
   position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more
   characters in the position it occupies. The attributes of those
   user records whose usernames match the wildcard pattern are
   modified.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/AUTH_PRIVILEGES

      /AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies a new set of authorized privileges that the user is
   allowed to set with the SET PRIVILEGE command. The privilege list
   you create replaces the user's current privilege list. Therefore,
   you must specify all authorized privileges you want the user to
   have.

   Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If
   only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted.

   For a list of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each user
   record modified. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each user giving the username and asking whether you
   want to modify the user record. If you answer YES (or Y), the
   user record is modified. If you answer NO (or N), the user record
   is not modified. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to modify
   the user record without asking for confirmation.
 

/DEF_PRIVILEGES

      /DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])

   Specifies the default privileges which are enabled each time the
   user starts a new VDE session. Each default privilege specified
   also becomes an authorized privilege for the user. The privilege
   list you create replaces the user's current privilege list.
   Therefore, you must specify all default privileges you want the
   user to have.

   Each parameter to this qualifier names a single privilege. If
   only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted.
   For a list of the privilege names you can specify, see the SET
   PRIVILEGES command.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the user records
   are modified. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the user records have been modified and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NAME

      /NAME="string"

   Specifies a full name for the user. The quoted name string, which
   can be up to 40 characters long, should contain a new full name
   string (first name, middle initial, and last name) for the user.
 

/NOTIFY

      /NOTIFY=(username [,username...])
      /NONOTIFY[=(username [,username...])]

   The /NOTIFY qualifier specifies a list of users to notify
   each time the specified user replaces a module into the VDE
   library. VDE appends these users to the specified user's existing
   notification list. Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS
   username or mail address of a user who should be notified by mail
   message each time the specified user replaces a module into the
   library.

   Each username parameter can specify the username of a user
   already recorded in the VDE database, a OpenVMS mail address
   with one or more node names (such as NODE::SMITH), a mail
   forwarding alias, or a defined logical name bound to a list of
   users to notify. If you specify a logical name, keep in mind
   that the logical name must be defined when it is later used to
   send notification messages. It should thus be a group or system
   logical name or a logical name that is in some other way defined
   for all users of the VDE library.

   The /NONOTIFY qualifier specifies that a list of users already
   on the specified user's notification list be removed from
   that notification list. Each username parameter gives the
   OpenVMS username or mail address of a user to remove from the
   notification list. If you omit the username parameters, VDE
   removes the entire notification list.

   If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users specified
   with the /NONOTIFY qualifier from the notification list before
   adding the users specified with the /NOTIFY qualifier.

   If you specify only one username parameter with either qualifier,
   you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the user. The quoted
   remark string, which can be up to 132 characters long, may
   contain any explanatory remark about the user that you want
   stored in the VDE database. This string replaces the remark
   string from the original CREATE USER command or from any previous
   MODIFY USER command. Typically the remark describes the user's
   affiliation or function within the organization.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])
      /NOREVIEWER[=(username [,username...])]

   The /REVIEWER qualifier specifies a list of reviewers for all
   changes replaced into the VDE library by the specified user. VDE
   appends these reviewers to the user's existing reviewer list.
   Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS username of a user
   who should review all changes created by the specified user.
   The new reviewer must already be recorded in the VDE database.
   When the specified user replaces a module into the VDE library,
   VDE notifies the reviewer of the change by mail message. If
   the replacement is queued, the reviewer should then review the
   queued replacement before it is performed. If the replacement is
   immediate, VDE notifies the reviewer of the new module generation
   that was created, and he or she may then inspect that generation.
   This qualifier can be used to set up "buddy systems" where two
   users always review each other's code.

   The /NOREVIEWER qualifier specifies that a list of existing
   reviewers for the specified user be removed from the reviewer
   list. Each username parameter gives the OpenVMS username of a
   user who should be removed from the reviewer list. If you omit
   the username parameters, VDE removes the entire reviewer list for
   the user.

   If you specify both qualifiers, VDE removes the users specified
   with the /NOREVIEWER qualifier from the reviewer list before
   adding the users specified with the /REVIEWER qualifier.

   If you specify only one username parameter with either qualifier,
   you may omit the surrounding parentheses.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies a new OpenVMS username for the user. The new username
   can be up to 12 characters long and must follow normal VDE name
   syntax. If you change a username in the VDE database you should
   also remember to have your system manager change it in the system
   User Authorization File. After the username is changed, you must
   refer to the user by the new name in all subsequent VDE commands
   and the user must access the database with the new username.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> MODIFY USER SMITH /USERNAME=BROWN /NAME="Jane S. Brown"
     %VDE-I-USERMOD, information for user BROWN modified in the database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     In this example, Jane Smith has changed her name. The MODIFY
     USER command is used to enter her new OpenVMS username and full
     name string into the VDE database. Thereafter, Jane must access
     the VDE library as user BROWN and she must be referred to as
     BROWN on subsequent VDE commands. The log messages confirm that
     her user record was modified and that the database transaction
     successfully completed.

   2.VDE> MODIFY USER DOE /REMARK="OpenVMS Documentation Supervisor" -

     _VDE>       /DEF_PRIVILEGES=BUILD /NOLOG
     VDE>

     Here John Doe has been promoted to Documentation Supervisor.
     The MODIFY USER command changes his remark string to indicate
     his new role and reduces his default privileges to only
     the BUILD privilege. In this example, the /NOLOG qualifier
     suppresses the log messages.
 

1  New_Features
   This section contains descriptions of the various new features
   present in VDE Version 1.5-0.
 

2  Description

   VDE New and Changed Features describes the various new and
   changed features present in the VDE V1.5-0 release.

   Table 1-2 VDE New and Changed Features

   Feature    Description

   New/Changed Features for VDE V1.5-0

   VDE Database Format
              VDE V1.5-0 continues to use VDE library format 25.
              Versions of VDE that also support library format 25
              can coexist with VDE V1.5-0. (Currently, these are
              releases X1.2-n, V1.3-n, V1.4-n, and V1.5-0.) Versions
              of VDE using older or newer formats can not coexist and
              require a database conversion. To determine the format
              of an existing library, use the SHOW LIBRARY/FULL
              command.

              Do not use a newer version of VDE on a library created
              under a previous VDE version-specifically any VDE
              library with the autoconvert option enabled-if an
              automatic library format conversion is not desired.
   Support for Aging
              VDE V1.5-0 includes a tool to notify users that are
              have pending reservations and/or folds, reservations or
              folds that have been outstanding for an extended time.
              See the documentation of VDE/AGE for further details.
   Default SCT Conference Names
              When VDE determines that a user does not have the
              identifier specified on the target VDE library, VDE
              is no longer left in a confused state. Previously,
              one had to exit and restart VDE to recover from this
              situation.



   New/Changed Features for VDE V1.4-n

   VDE Database Format
              VDE V1.5-0 uses library format 25. Versions of VDE
              that also support library format 25 can coexist with
              VDE V1.5-0. (Currently, these are releases X1.2-n,
              V1.3-n and V1.5-0.) Versions of VDE using older or
              newer formats can not coexist and require a database
              conversion. To determine the format of an existing
              library, use the SHOW LIBRARY/FULL command.

              Do not use a newer version of VDE on a library created
              under a previous VDE version-specifically any VDE
              library with the autoconvert option enabled-if an
              automatic library format conversion is not desired.
   Support for DEC CMS V3.7+
              VDE V1.5-0 includes changes that allow VDE to avoid
              a compatibility problem introduced in DEC CMS V3.7.
              Earlier versions of VDE do not function correctly with
              CMS versions 3.7 or greater.
   Default SCT Conference Names
              When determining the default SCT conference name for a
              stream, VDE now translates any character that is not an
              alphanumeric, "$" or "_" character into a "-" (hyphen).

              This change allows an SCT Notes conference to be
              configured for stream names, such as "V3.4", that
              contain a character such as a period. In this case,
              VDE will choose the name "SCT-V3-4" as the default SCT
              conference, which is a legal Notes conference name.
   Notification Performance
              VDE Handling of event notifications (Mail to users
              and/or notes posted to Notes conferences) has been
              improved for reliability and performance. Minor changes
              have also been made to messages displayed during
              notification.
   VDE /WHEREIS
              This is a new qualifier to the DCL-level VDE command
              (not available at the VDE> prompt). This tool allows
              command procedure to locate key components and/or
              obtain a list of available databases. Information is
              returned as local symbols or process logical names, as
              specified by the caller. Example usage:

              $ VDE/WHEREIS /LIBRARY=vde-libname/RETURN=LOGICAL_NAMES
              $ VDE/WHEREIS /INDEX=vde-libindex /RETURN=SYMBOLS


              For further information, see the information on the
              VDE$WHEREIS_* symbols/logical names.
   Quota Checks
              The minimum quota values used for VDE's quota checks
              have been raised for ASTLM, BYTLM, JTQUOTA and TQLM
              for V1.5-0. VDE will display a warning message and
              attempt to continue should one or more insufficient
              quota values be detected.

              See the VDE/READ_UAF command for assistance in updating
              user quotas in the system authorization database
              (SYSUAF) and updating user entries in the VDE database.

   SETCMS/SETVDE
              The SETCMS, SETVSC and SETVDE commands are obsolete
              and all references to these commands have been removed
              from the command tables and the OpenVMS Development
              Environment documentation. These commands provided an
              access control mechanism for the VDE components. More
              flexible access control capabilities are now available
              via standard VDE security features such as subsystem
              identifiers.
   Message Text
              The text of various messages output by VDE has been
              improved for clarity. The associated documented
              recovery steps have been improved as well.


   New/Changed Features from VDE V1.3-n

   Documentation
              The documentation now calls out the similarities and
              the differences between the VSC and the VDE command
              interfaces.
              Several chapters have been added to the Guide to Using
              VDE to detail various common tasks, and information on
              managing a VDE library has been expanded. The format of
              the manual has been improved.
              An Error Messages and Recovery section has been added
              to VDE Reference Manual.
              An installation guide has been added.
              The various indices are now rather larger.
              Various appendicies have been added, including one
              containing various VDE logical names.
              Implicit assumptions on various points of arcane
              process knowledge-and on knowledge of terms such as
              "Master Pack" and "Yellow", etc-have been reduced
              or eliminated from the VDE documentation. Whenever
              possible, terminology has been made consistent across
              both the OpenVMS VAX and the OpenVMS Alpha development
              environments.
   Motif Interface
              VDE V1.3-n and later versions contain a Motif-
              based user interface, and associated hyper-help.
              Invoke the VDE command specifying the qualifier
              /INTERFACE=DECwindows.

              The Motif interface includes support for FETCH,
              RESERVE, REPLACE and UNRESERVE commands, as well as
              HELP and a few other Motif-related commands. VDE target
              library selection is currently via static resource
              file entries (made visible and selected via a cascade
              menu loaded at run-time), but may be made dynamic in an
              upcoming release.
   CREATE LIBRARY/NOAUTO_CONVERT
              Automatic library format conversion is now disabled
              by default as the /NOAUTO_CONVERT qualifier is now the
              default. Previous versions of VDE defaulted to allowing
              automatic conversion. Libraries presently marked for
              automatic conversion are not affected by this change.
              All VDE libraries should be reviewed to determine if an
              automatic conversion should be permitted.
   Architecture Support
              The VDE commands for managing ARCHITECTUREs are
              partially documented. This capability introduced in
              V1.3-n is not fully implemented.
   OpenVMS Alpha Support
              As of V1.3-0, VDE is available for OpenVMS VAX and
              OpenVMS Alpha; Releases V1.3-n and V1.5-0 operate in
              mixed-architecture VMSclusters.
   PCSI Installation
              VDE is now installed via the PCSI utility.
   Quota Check
              VDE V1.3 and later releases check for various minimum
              quota values. VDE displays a warning message and
              attempts to continue should one or more insufficient
              quota values be detected.

              See the VDE/READ_UAF command for assistance in updating
              user quotas in the system authorization database
              (SYSUAF) and updating user entries in the VDE database.

   SET PRIVILEGE/OVERRIDE
              Allows a user that has the OpenVMS BYPASS privilege
              enabled to override the VDE privilege settings and to
              set all VDE privileges. An informational message is
              generated when the privilege is used, and privilege
              auditing is performed.
   SET LIBRARY
              The SET LIBRARY command now allows a user that has
              the OpenVMS BYPASS privilege enabled to override
              a restricted VDE user authorization database,
              and to access the library. This is intended to
              allow privileged VDE users to perform VDE database
              maintenance when necessary. An informational message is
              generated when the privilege override is used, and a
              privilege audit message is generated.
              The SET LIBRARY command now correctly processes library
              specifications incorrectly include the library file
              name, the library file extension, and/or the library
              file version-these components are now ignored. Previous
              versions of VDE permitted only the device and directory
              specifications, and an error was generated when
              additional components were specified.
              The SET LIBRARY command now allows the specification of
              either an explicit library specification, or a mnemonic
              shorthand for the desired library. Mnemonics and the
              associated translations are established via logical
              names, and can be tailored for individual users,
              for groups, or on a system-wide basis. For further
              information, see the information on the VDE$LIBRARY_
              DEFAULTS, VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS, VDE$LIBRARY_
              DEFAULTS_CMS, and VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS
              logical names.
              When no parameter is specified on the SET LIBRARY
              command, an error message is (still) generated, and
              a site-configurable list of the available VDE libraries
              is now displayed.
              When the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS logical name
              is defined, the SET LIBRARY command is available
              via keyboard definitions for the F17 through F20
              keyboard keys. The first four libraries listed in the
              translation(s) of VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS are
              selected by the default key state, the second four by
              the gold state, and the third four by the blue state.
   SHOW DEVELOPER
              This command is now partially documented.
   SHOW REPLACEMENT/ACCEPTED
              This is a new qualifier. This displays all replacement
              component modules that have been marked as accepted.
   SHOW REPLACEMENT/IN_REVIEW
              This is a new qualifier, and displays all replacement
              component that are presently under review.
   SHOW REPLACEMENT/NOT_REVIEWED
              This is a new qualifier and displays all replacement
              component modules that have not yet been reviewed.
   SHOW REPLACEMENT/REJECTED
              This is a new qualifier and displays replacement
              component modules that have been rejected.
   VDE$ENABLE_AUDIT
              A system logical name defined in executive mode that
              enables OpenVMS system-level auditing of various VDE
              operations. Use of this option requires that the VDE
              image be installed with or run with the OpenVMS AUDIT
              privilege enabled.
   CREATE MODULE/INPUT
              This command is no longer accepted on streams marked
              for queued replacements. Any attempt to perform this
              operation on a stream marked for queued replacements
              will be rejected with the error VDE$_INCNOTVAL.
   VDE$MARKER marker-file directories
              VDE now creates the [.VDE$MARKER] marker-file
              subdirectory when initializing a library.
   MODIFY LIBRARY/LOCK
              VDE now supports a limited capability to maintain a
              write-lock on a library. This capability is intended
              primarily for the maintenance and consistency of shadow
              or reference VDE libraries.
   MODIFY MODULE/NAME Obsoleted
              The /NAME qualifier has been removed, as there is no
              reliable way to handle the rename operation at the
              CMS level, nor a reasonable way to handle copying
              the various possible source files, object files and
              similar. Users wishing to perform a rename must delete
              the old module and recreate it under the new name,
              specifying the appropriate generations to create.
   Kept Subprocesses
              Erroneous attempts to directly attach to a kept
              subprocess, via lib$attach or the DCL ATTACH command,
              no longer cause the kept subprocess to exit.
              The kept subprocess now uses a unique process name;
              previous versions used a process name based on the
              username.
   Calling Interface
              VDE now includes a callable interface allowing listings
              of libraries, and fetches. The interface supports
              remote access via an IP network, and is implemented as
              a shareable image. This interface directly supports the
              VDE WWW server. A future release of VDE may add support
              for reservations, unreservations, and replacements.
              Contact VDE support for information before using this
              interface-a few incompatible changes to the interface
              are currently expected.
   VDE$LIBRARY_LABEL
              VDE now defines a process logical name VDE$LIBRARY_
              LABEL whenever a connection is made to a library. This
              logical name contains the remark associated with the
              library, and is intended for use within procedures
              based on the VDE utilities.
   VDE$LIBRARY_MNEMONIC
              VDE now defines a process logical name VDE$LIBRARY_
              MNEMONIC whenever a connection is made to a library.
              This logical name contains the library name or, when
              known, the mnemonic name associated with the current
              library, and is intended for use within procedures
              based on the VDE utilities.
   VDE$NOTES_LIBRARY
              A logical name that allows a user to change the default
              Notes conference file specification for SCT Notes
              conferences accessed by VDE. If this logical name is
              not defined, the default value of "NOTES$LIBRARY:.NOTE"
              is used.
   Script Enhancements
              A new script type, CREATE_FACILITY, has been added.
              This optional script is invoked when a new facility is
              created. See VDE Reference Manual for details.
              The execution context of the script has been changed,
              and scripts now correctly tolerate an EMIT of an
              EXIT DCL command; scripts also recover from various
              abnormal terminations of script. Scripts do not
              correctly recover from the complete deletion of the
              subprocess. This will wedge the current operation, and
              still require the user to enter a <CTRL/Y> to free the
              process.
              The <> and <> characters can now be used to quote
              strings used in the EMIT script command.
              A new script function, $SCRATCH, has been added. When
              invoked, this function returns the device and directory
              specification for the VDE scratch directory. This
              directory is useful for scripts that need temporary
              storage.
   Statistics Collection
              VDE now optionally collects replacement statistics.
              See the MODIFY LIBRARY/STATISTICS, REPLACE/REASONS and
              REPLACE/DEFECTS_CORRECTED commands for details.
   Changes to the REPLACE command
              Existing REPLACE prompts have been changed, new prompts
              have been added, and new qualifiers have been added.
              Changes involve the syntax surrounding the reason for
              the change, how the SCT information is processed, and
              the collection of statistics. Some of this work is
              part of the statistics collection work mentioned above,
              some reduces the number of seperate steps required to
              enter a change, and some is intended to allow for the
              optional automatic generation of the SCT entry in a
              future release of VDE.
              The new REPLACE/DEFECTS_CORRECTED qualifier allows
              direct entry of the number of defects corrected by
              the replacement. This qualifer operates in conjunction
              with the statistics collection process, the MODIFY
              LIBRARY/STATISTICS command, and the /REASONS qualifier.
              The new REPLACE/NOTE qualifer allows direct entry of
              the SCT note number. If this qualifer is specified, the
              default SCT Notes conference name is assumed. If both
              /SCT and /NOTE are specified, /NOTE takes precedence.
              REPLACE/REASONS allows direct entry of the reason for
              the replacement. This qualifer operates in conjunction
              with the statistics collection process, the MODIFY
              LIBRARY/STATISTICS command, and the /DEFECTS_CORRECTED
              qualifier. Part of this change is in support of the
              statistics collection work mentioned above, and part
              is the foundation that will allow for the optional
              automatic generation of the SCT entry in an unspecified
              future release of VDE.
              The new REPLACE/SCT qualifer allows direct entry of
              a filename containing the SCT note text. If this is
              specified, the default SCT Notes conference name is
              assumed, and VDE loads the specified file into the SCT
              Notes conference, using the replacement remark text
              as the title of the note. If both /SCT and /NOTE are
              specified, /NOTE takes precedence.
              The new MODIFY GENERATION/NOTE qualifer allows direct
              entry of the SCT note number. If this qualifer is
              specified, the default SCT Notes conference name is
              assumed. If both /SCT and /NOTE are specified, /NOTE
              takes precedence.
              The new MODIFY GENERATION/SCT qualifer allows direct
              entry of a filename containing the SCT note text. If
              this is specified, the default SCT Notes conference
              name is assumed, and VDE loads the specified file into
              the SCT Notes conference, using the replacement remark
              text as the title of the note. If both /SCT and /NOTE
              are specified, /NOTE takes precedence.
   Changes to the CREATE FACILITY command
              As mentioned above, a new script type, CREATE_FACILITY,
              has been added. This optional script is invoked when a
              new facility is created. See VDE Reference Manual for
              details.
              The CREATE FACILITY command now sends notification
              messages for the newly created facility to the
              individuals that have asked for stream-level
              notifications.
   Longer CLDs accepted
              VDE accepts both nine and ten character CLD numbers:
              both the original XXX-NNNN and the longer XXX-NNNNN CLD
              formats are now accepted.
   New Examples
              VDE includes example command procedures and
              associated files used to upload an existing set of
              CMS libraries into a new VDE library, and an example
              of a menu interface. All examples are located in the
              VDE$EXAMPLES: directory.
 

1  PERFORM
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   Performs one or more queued replacements so that the
   corresponding modules are replaced into the VDE library.

   Requires PERFREP privilege.

   Format

     PERFORM REPLACEMENT  rep-name [, rep-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of a queued replacement to be performed. You can perform
   more than one replacement at a time by using wildcard characters
   in the replacement name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches
   any single character in the position it occupies and the asterisk
   (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those queued replacements whose names match the wildcard pattern
   are performed.
 

3  Description
   The PERFORM REPLACEMENT command replaces the modules that are
   members of a specified queued replacement into the VDE library.
   Once this command has completed, each member module has a new
   generation in the library and is no longer marked as reserved in
   the affected streams. In addition, the replacement is no longer
   queued in the VDE database.

   The PERFORM REPLACEMENT command only performs those replacements
   that match the rep-name parameters and that belong to your
   default stream or to another stream specified with the /STREAM
   qualifier. To perform replacements belonging to more than one
   stream, you can use wildcard characters in the stream name you
   specify with the /STREAM qualifier.

   The PERFORM REPLACEMENT command is normally used by a user
   who is authorized to determine when changed modules should be
   replaced into the VDE library. Other developers reserve source
   modules, make changes to them, and queue them for replacement
   with the REPLACE command. The REPLACE command queues modules
   for replacement (as opposed to replacing them immediately),
   if the user specifies the /QUEUE qualifier or if any affected
   development stream has the queued-replacement attribute. Once
   a replacement is queued, it can optionally be reviewed using
   the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command and its subcommands. When the
   authorized user decides that the modules that are members of the
   queued replacement are ready to be replaced into the VDE library,
   the user enters the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to actually
   perform the replacement. When replacements are queued, it is the
   PERFORM REPLACEMENT command that actually creates new generations
   for the modules and that terminates the module reservations.

   Whether you should use queued replacements or not is a policy
   decision that may be different for different VDE libraries or
   for different development stream within a given library. If
   you decide to always use immediate replacements, the REPLACE
   command will perform the actual replacement and you do not use
   the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   replacement performed. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
   print a message for each replacement asking whether you want that
   replacement performed. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement
   is performed. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement is not
   performed. If you enter a replacement name with a wildcard
   specification, VDE asks you to confirm that VDE should perform
   each replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification.
   The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to perform the specified
   replacements without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement
   has been performed. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the associated modules have been replaced, that the
   replacement has been performed, and that the database transaction
   has successfully committed.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that only those replacements that belong to certain
   streams be performed. The stream-name parameter specifies a
   stream name and can contain wildcard characters. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. VDE performs a given replacement
   only if it belongs to a stream whose name matches the stream-name
   parameter. If you omit this qualifier, VDE performs only those
   replacements that belong to your default stream.

   For each replacement that matches a rep-name parameter but does
   not belong to a stream matching the stream-name parameter, VDE
   prints an informational message saying that the replacement is
   not performed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> PERFORM REPLACEMENT SMITH-2
     %VDE-I-REPLACED, generation [FACNAM]A.REQ;9(9) replaced into stream V2.0
     %VDE-I-REPLACED, generation [FACNAM]B.REQ;6(6) replaced into stream V2.0
     %VDE-I-REPPERF, replacement SMITH-2 performed
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example performs the queued replacement SMITH-2. The
     PERFORM REPLACEMENT command replaces the two modules that are
     members of the replacement, A.REQ and B.REQ in facility FACNAM,
     into the VDE library. Thereafter, these two modules are no
     longer reserved. The command also deletes replacement SMITH-2
     from the VDE database.
 

1  POPULATE
 

2  STREAM
   Populates a development stream with generations from another
   stream.

   Requires PERFREP privilege.

   Format

     POPULATE STREAM  stream-name [, stream-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a target stream to be populated with the module
   generations from another stream. You can populate more than one
   stream at a time by using wildcard characters in the stream name.
   The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in
   the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or
   more characters in the position it occupies. Those streams whose
   names match the wildcard pattern are populated.
 

3  Description
   The POPULATE STREAM command populates a specified development
   stream (the target stream) with the latest generations from
   another stream (the source stream). The target stream is
   specified with a command parameter and the source stream is
   specified with the /FROM_STREAM qualifier. The latest generation
   of each module in the source stream is inserted into the target
   stream and any modules not represented in the source stream are
   removed from the target stream. After the command completes, the
   target stream contains exactly the same generations as the source
   stream.

   Using the CREATE STREAM command to create a new stream with
   the same contents as a parent stream can be a time-consuming
   operation if the VDE library is large. Using the POPULATE STREAM
   command to update an existing stream whose contents are already
   close to the desired source stream is generally a much faster way
   to make a copy of a stream. This command allows you to create new
   base-level streams by reusing old base-level streams that are no
   longer needed, thus saving both time and database space.

   The POPULATE STREAM command updates only the VDE database. It
   does not insert the updated generations into the CMS class for
   the stream, not even if the attribute to maintain the CMS class
   is set for the target stream. Neither does the command update
   the source directories for the stream. If such operations are
   needed, they must be done manually outside of VDE. Alternatively
   you can use the INSERT GENERATION command to insert generations
   into a stream while maintaining CMS classes and stream source
   directories. Because it does more work, the INSERT GENERATION
   command is generally much slower than the POPULATE STREAM
   command.

   VDE populates the target streams in three phases. First, it
   determines what streams to populate using a read-only database
   transaction. Second, it determines the differences between
   the source and target streams for one target stream. This step
   is done using a read-only transaction. Third, VDE loops over
   the differences it found to update the generation membership
   of the target stream. This phase gives the target stream the
   same generation membership as the source stream had during the
   preceding read-only transaction. During this phase, VDE updates
   20 modules at a time (by default), commits the transaction,
   and repeats the process until all modules are updated. VDE uses
   multiple short read-write transactions in order not to lock the
   database against other users more than a few seconds at a time.
   After the target stream is fully populated, VDE loops to populate
   the next stream until none remain.

   You can only populate an open stream if the populate attribute is
   set for the stream. If this attribute is not set, you must set it
   with the MODIFY STREAM /POPULATE command before you can populate
   the stream. You can only populate a frozen stream if the populate
   attribute is set and you have the FROZEN privilege. You cannot
   populate a closed stream.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/COMMIT_LIMIT

      /COMMIT_LIMIT=number

   Specifies the maximum number of modules VDE will update in,
   insert into, or remove from the target stream before committing
   the database transaction and starting a new transaction. The
   number parameter must be an integer value in the range from 1 to
   1,000,000.

   Specification of a smaller value reduces the interval during
   which the database is locked, allowing access to the database
   by other users. Specification of a larger value does reduce the
   overhead involved with recycling locks and repeated commits, but
   restricts the access to the database by other users.

   By default, VDE commits and restarts a read-write transaction for
   every 20 modules.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   target stream populated. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE
   to print a message for each stream asking whether you want
   that stream populated. If you answer YES (or Y), that stream
   is populated from the source stream. If you answer NO (or
   N), the stream is not populated. If you enter a stream name
   with a wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the
   populate action for each stream whose name matches the wildcard
   specification. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to populate
   the specified streams without asking for confirmation.
 

/FROM_STREAM

      /FROM_STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the source stream from which the target stream is to
   be populated. VDE makes the generation membership of the target
   stream identical to that of this source stream. This qualifier
   is required; if you omit it, VDE prompts you for the name of the
   source stream.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each stream has
   been populated. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate the number of modules to update, insert, or remove to
   populate the target stream, that the stream has been populated
   from the source stream, and that the database transaction has
   successfully committed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> POPULATE STREAM BLD_12/FROM_STREAM=BIRCH
     %VDE-I-STRMPOPCOUNT, populate module counts: update 5, insert 2, remove 1
     %VDE-I-STRMPOP, stream BLD_12 populated from stream BIRCH
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, stream BLD_12 is populated from stream BIRCH.
     Five module generations in stream BLD_12 are updated, two are
     inserted, and one is removed to make the generation membership
     of that stream identical to stream BIRCH. The log messages
     confirm that the stream was populated and that the database
     transaction successfully completed.

1  REJECT
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   Marks a queued replacement as rejected in the VDE database. You
   can only mark a replacement as rejected if you are a reviewer for
   that replacement.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     REJECT REPLACEMENT  rep-name [, rep-name...] ["remark"]
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of a queued replacement to be marked as rejected. You
   can reject more than one replacement at a time by using wildcard
   characters in the replacement name. The percent sign (%)  in a
   name matches any single character in the position it occupies and
   the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position
   it occupies. Those queued replacements whose names match the
   wildcard pattern are marked as rejected.
 

"remark"

   Specifies a one-line remark for the replacement. Typically this
   remark summarizes why you reject the replacement. Specifying
   the remark parameter is equivalent to specifying the /REMARK
   qualifier after the REJECT REPLACEMENT keywords. This parameter
   or the /REMARK qualifier is required; if you do not specify
   either, VDE prompts you for a remark string.
 

3  Description
   The REJECT REPLACEMENT command updates the VDE database to record
   that you have reviewed the code changes in a specified queued
   replacement and that you judge those changes not acceptable for
   replacement into the VDE library. You must be a reviewer for a
   replacement in order to mark it as rejected.

   The REJECT REPLACEMENT command allows you to attach a comment
   file to the queued replacement. The comment file typically
   explains why you reject the replacement. If you have already
   created such a file, use the /INPUT qualifier to copy it to the
   replacement's staging area. If you omit the /INPUT qualifier,
   VDE asks you whether you want to edit a comment file for the
   replacement. If you respond YES (the default answer), VDE invokes
   your preferred editor to create the comment file. If you specify
   both the /INPUT and the /EDIT qualifier, VDE copies the input
   file to the replacement's staging area and then invokes your
   editor to further modify that file. If you have already created a
   comment file for the replacement with an earlier ACCEPT or REJECT
   command, VDE lets you edit that file again. This capability is
   useful if you change your mind or want to add more information.

   If you wish to mark a replacement as acceptable, use the ACCEPT
   REPLACEMENT command. If you wish to see the review status of a
   queued replacement, use the SHOW REPLACEMENT command.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   replacement rejected. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each replacement asking whether you want to reject
   that replacement. If you answer YES (or Y), that replacement
   is marked as rejected. If you answer NO (or N), the replacement
   status is not changed. If you enter a replacement name with a
   wildcard specification, VDE asks you to confirm the rejection of
   each replacement whose name matches the wildcard specification.
   The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to mark the specified
   replacements as rejected without asking for confirmation.
 

/EDIT

   Specifies that VDE should invoke your preferred editor so that
   you can edit your comment file for each queued replacement. If
   such a comment file already exists (due to a previous ACCEPT
   or REJECT REPLACEMENT command for the same replacement) or if
   you specify an input file with the /INPUT qualifier, the editor
   modifies that file. Otherwise, the editor creates a new file
   in the replacement's staging directory. Its file name is your
   OpenVMS username and its file extension is VDE$COMMENT. The
   comment file typically contains comments for the author of the
   replacement and the other reviewers.

   This qualifier is ignored if you are running in batch mode.
 

/INPUT

      /INPUT=file-spec

   Specifies a comment file for the queued replacement. VDE reads
   the text file given by the file-spec parameter and writes its
   contents into a new file in the replacement's staging directory.
   The file name of the new file is your OpenVMS username and
   its file extension is VDE$COMMENT. The comment file typically
   contains remarks to the author of the replacement or information
   for the other reviewers.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each replacement
   has been marked as rejected. The /LOG qualifier causes such
   messages to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them.
   These messages indicate that the replacement has been rejected
   and that the database transaction has successfully committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a one-line remark for the replacement. Typically this
   remark summarizes why you reject the replacement. For longer
   comments, you may create a comment file with the /INPUT or /EDIT
   qualifier. The /REMARK qualifier (or the remark parameter at the
   end of the command) is required; if you do not specify it, VDE
   prompts you for a remark string.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that the replacement be marked as rejected on behalf
   of another user. The username parameter specifies the OpenVMS
   username of the other user. That user must be a reviewer for the
   specified replacement. You must have the USERNAME privilege to
   use this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> REJECT REPLACEMENT BROWN-3 "Bug found in sort code"
     %VDE-I-REPREJECT, replacement BROWN-3 marked as rejected in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     Do you wish to edit a comment file for replacement BROWN-3 ? [Yes]: YES

        ...Comment file edited here...

     VDE>

     This command marks that the current user rejects queued
     replacement BROWN-3. The remark string indicates the reason
     for the rejection. Since the /INPUT qualifier is omitted, VDE
     asks the user whether he or she wants to edit a comment file.
     The user answers YES and is placed in an editing session.

   2.VDE> REJECT REPLACEMENT SMITH-1/INPUT=COMMENT_FILE.TXT
     Please supply required information for replacement SMITH-1:
     Enter a remark for the rejection: Code does not conform to coding conventions
     %VDE-I-REPREJECT, replacement SMITH-1 marked as rejected in database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the user marks replacement SMITH-1 as rejected
     and provides a comment file that gives additional information
     to the user who queued the replacement. The comment file may
     explain, for example, what defects in the code caused it to be
     rejected. Since the /REMARK qualifier is omitted, VDE prompts
     for a remark string.
 

1  REMOVE
 

2  GENERATION
   Removes a module from a specified development stream so that the
   module no longer has a latest generation in the stream.

   Requires PERFREP privilege.

   Format

     REMOVE GENERATION  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of a source module whose latest generation is to be
   removed from the specified development stream. The module
   name consists of an optional facility name enclosed in square
   brackets, a module name, and an optional type name preceded
   by a period, such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR. If no facility name is
   specified, the default facility is assumed. If no type name is
   specified, the latest generations of all source modules of the
   specified module name in the given facility are removed.

   You can remove more than one module from the stream by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   VDE removes each module whose name matches the wildcard pattern
   from the stream.
 

3  Description
   The REMOVE GENERATION command removes a specified module from a
   specified development stream so that the module no longer has a
   latest generation in that stream. The result is that the module
   no longer "belongs" to that stream and can no longer be fetched,
   reserved, or built in the stream.

   The removed generation remains in the VDE database and the VDE
   library, and it can still be the latest generation of the module
   for some other stream. The REMOVE GENERATION command thus breaks
   the association between the module generation and the specified
   stream but does not delete the generation.

   If the specified module is currently reserved in the specified
   stream, VDE terminates that reservation since it is based on a
   module generation that no longer is the latest generation for
   the stream. VDE sends a mail message to notify the owner of the
   reservation that the reservation is lost.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   generation removed. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for the latest generation of each module giving the
   name of the generation and asking whether you want to remove the
   generation. If you answer YES (or Y), the generation is removed.
   If you answer NO (or N), the generation is not removed. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to remove each generation without
   asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after generations are
   removed from streams. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to
   be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate that
   the generations have been removed from the specified development
   stream and that the database transaction has successfully
   committed.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string that explains why you removed the
   generation from the specified stream. The quoted remark string
   can be up to 132 characters long.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the generation be removed from the development
   stream given by the stream-name parameter. If this qualifier is
   omitted, VDE prompts you for the stream name.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> REMOVE GENERATION [FACIL]MODNAM.C /STREAM=MANGO

     %VDE-I-GENREM, generation [FACIL]MODNAM.C;4(4) removed from stream MANGO
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example removes the latest generation of module
     [FACIL]MODNAM.C from stream MANGO. The log message shows that
     generation 4 had been the latest generation of the module
     in that stream, and is now removed. After the command has
     completed, no generation of the module belongs to stream MANGO.
 

1  REPLACE
   Returns each specified module to the library and creates a new
   generation of the module. Each module must be a source module
   previously reserved with the RESERVE command.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     REPLACE  mod-name [, mod-name...] ["remark"]
 

2  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a reserved source module to be replaced into the
   library. The module name consists of an optional facility name
   enclosed in square brackets, a module name, and an optional
   type name preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If
   the facility name is omitted, the module is assumed to belong
   to the default facility. If the type name is omitted, all source
   modules with the specified module name in the given facility are
   replaced.

   You can replace more than one module by using wildcard characters
   in any of the three components of the module name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. VDE replaces the source modules
   whose names match the wildcard pattern.

   You can also replace multiple modules by specifying the name of a
   source group instead of a module name. Source groups are created
   with the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group name, each
   module that is a member of the group is replaced.

   If you use the /SESSION qualifier, those reservations that are
   members of the specified reservation session are replaced.
   In this case, you must omit the mod-name parameters from the
   command.
 

"remark"

   Specifies a remark string for the replacement. VDE stores this
   remark string with each module generation that the REPLACE
   command creates. Specifying the remark parameter is equivalent
   to specifying the /REMARK qualifier after the REPLACE keyword.
 

2  Description
   For each module you have specified, the REPLACE command creates
   a new generation of the module by transferring a file from
   your default directory to the current VDE library, possibly
   by way of an intermediate staging area. This new generation
   becomes the most recent generation of the source module in the
   default development stream (or the stream specified with the
   /STREAM qualifier) and receives a new generation number. The
   new generation number is formed by adding 1 to the number of the
   previous generation. After creating the new module generation,
   the REPLACE command terminates the reservation of that module
   unless you specify the /RESERVE qualifier.

   After the reserved module is replaced in the VDE library, VDE may
   delete the file used to create the module (as well as any earlier
   versions of the file in the same directory). The file is only
   deleted if the library administrator has defined a NOKEEP script
   for your VDE library and the specified development stream. If you
   specify either the /KEEP or the /RESERVE qualifier, VDE does not
   delete the file even if a NOKEEP script is defined.

   The file in your default directory normally has the same name as
   the module in the library. However, you can direct VDE to replace
   a file with a different name or a file in another directory than
   your default directory by specifying the /INPUT qualifier.

   VDE stores the following information about the file that creates
   the new generation: the creation date and time, the revision date
   and time, the record format, and other record attributes. When
   you fetch or reserve a generation of a module from a VDE library,
   the file that is placed in your directory has the same creation
   and revision times, record format, and record attributes as the
   file that was used to create the generation that you are fetching
   or reserving.

   If you specify the /QUEUE qualifier or one of the streams that
   you are replacing the module into has the queued-replacement
   attribute, then the REPLACE command does not actually perform
   the replacement of your module. Instead it copies your files to
   a "staging area" on disk and queues the replacement in the VDE
   database. An authorized user must then enter a subsequent PERFORM
   REPLACEMENT command in order to actually perform the replacement.
   In this case, it is the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command the creates
   the new module generation and terminates the module reservation.

   If you have more than one concurrent reservation of a module,
   you must specify the exact reservation to be replaced using the
   /IDENTIFICATION qualifier. Use the SHOW RESERVATION command to
   determine the identification of each reservation.

   If you or another user has a concurrent reservation for the
   module being replaced and that reservation covers at least one
   stream affected by your replacement, then the REPLACE command
   terminates that reservation. VDE sends a mail message to notify
   the owner of that reservation that the reservation is lost.

   To replace another user's reservation, you must have the USERNAME
   privilege and use the /USERNAME qualifier to specify OpenVMS
   username of that user.

   Source Tracking and Statistics Collection

   VDE can collect replacement statistics and associated change-
   related information, including the reason for the change, the
   project the change is associated with, and can also be asked
   to add an entry to the source code tracking (SCT) DEC Notes
   conference describing the change.

   Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a library basis.
   If collection is enabled and the information is not provided via
   REPLACE qualifiers, VDE will prompt the user for the information
   during the replacement operation.

   For further information, see the /FOLD, /OTHER, and /SCT
   qualifiers, as well as the /PROJECT qualifier.

   Change Propagation to other Streams

   Replacing a module makes the new module generation the latest
   generation in the default development stream or the stream
   specified with the /STREAM qualifier. That generation is thus the
   generation you get by default in a subsequent FETCH or RESERVE
   command, and is the generation that is compiled when you build
   your system in that stream.

   If the specified stream has successors, the REPLACE command
   propagates the new module generation to all successor streams.
   For example, if stream V2 is a successor of stream V1, then any
   module that is replaced into stream V1 is also replaced in stream
   V2 automatically. If stream V2 has additional successors (such
   as stream V3), the new module generation is propagated to those
   streams, and so on recursively.

   Propagation works as follows. If the latest generations of the
   module for the original stream and the successor stream are
   the same, then the new module generation created by the REPLACE
   command becomes the latest generation for both streams. Both
   streams are thus equally up-to-date with respect to the changes
   made to that module. However, if the latest generations of the
   module differ for the two streams, which means that the module
   has diverged between those two streams, VDE does not propagate
   the new module generation to the successor stream. Instead, it
   creates a "fold" record in the database to remind the developer
   that the change made to the module for the first stream must be
   manually "folded" into the successor stream. Outstanding folds
   can be displayed with the SHOW FOLD command and a fold record is
   deleted with the CANCEL FOLD command.

   Replacing a Module with History or Notes Information

   If you reserve a generation of a module with an embedded history
   and then replace it, the REPLACE command ignores the history;
   that is, VDE does not copy the history into your VDE library.
   If you add text to the file in or above the history (relative
   to #B), or in or below the history (relative to #H), the REPLACE
   command issues an error message and the command is not executed.

   If you reserve a file with embedded notes and then replace it,
   the REPLACE command does not copy the notes to the VDE library.
   If, while editing the file, you insert text that looks like an
   embedded note, that text is deleted when the file is replaced.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   module replaced. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each specified module asking whether you want to
   replace that module into the library. If you answer YES (or Y),
   it is replaced. If you answer NO (or N), it is not replaced. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to replace each specified module
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/DEFECTS_CORRECTED

      /DEFECTS_CORRECTED=error-count
      /NODEFECTS_CORRECTED

   Specifies the number of defects corrected by this replacement:
   these defects could due to problems with the specification,
   design, logic, implementation and/or testing. The error-count
   parameter is a value indicating the number of defects corrected.

   /NODEFECTS_CORRECTED sets the number of defects corrected to
   zero.

   This qualifier is part of the statistics collection component of
   VDE. Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a library
   basis, using the MODIFY LIBRARY/STATISTICS command. If statistics
   collection is disabled, these qualifiers are ignored and have no
   adverse effects. This command is required when certain keywords
   are specified on the /REASONS qualifier; see Reasons for further
   information.

   If statistics collection is enabled on the current library and
   you do not specify the /REASONS qualifier, you will be prompted
   for the information.
 

/FOLD

      /FOLD[=fold-ident]

   Specifies that a fold record be cancelled when this replacement
   is performed. The fold-ident parameter gives the fold identifier
   of a fold record for the module being replaced and for the
   stream in which the replacement takes place. When VDE performs
   the replacement, it will cancel this fold record from the VDE
   database. You can omit the fold-ident parameter if there is only
   one fold record for the specified module and stream. You should
   use the /FOLD qualifier if the current replacement is done to
   satisfy an existing fold record in the database.

   Also see /OTHER and /SCT.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=res-ident

   Specifies the reservation to be replaced. This qualifier is
   required when you have multiple reservations of the same module
   in the default stream. The res-ident parameter is the reservation
   identifier of the reservation to be replaced. The reservation
   identifier is the identifier you specified or VDE assigned when
   you reserved the module, usually a small integer value. Use the
   SHOW RESERVATION command to determine the reservation identifier
   of each reservation.
 

/INFORMATION

      /INFORMATION[=file-spec]
      /NOINFORMATION

   The /INFORMATION qualifier specifies that an information file
   be attached to the current replacement if it is a queued
   replacement. The file-spec parameter gives the OpenVMS file
   specification of the information file. If this parameter is
   omitted, VDE asks you whether you want to edit an information
   file. If you answer YES, VDE invokes your preferred editor to
   edit the information file. You may use the information file to
   pass information about the replacement to reviewers and others.
   The /NOINFORMATION qualifier specifies that you do not want to
   provide an information file.

   If you omit both qualifiers, VDE's behavior depends on the
   library attribute that is set with the /ASK_INFO_FILE or cleared
   with the /NOASK_INFO_FILE qualifier to the CREATE or MODIFY
   LIBRARY command. If this attribute is set, VDE asks you whether
   you want to edit an information file. If this attribute is not
   set, VDE queues the replacement without an information file.

   For immediate replacements, VDE ignores both qualifiers and does
   not create an information file.

   To edit an information file through VDE, you should first declare
   your preferred editor with the SET EDITOR command. If you do not
   declare an editor, VDE invokes the system default text editor.
 

/INPUT

      /INPUT=file-spec

   Specifies a file to be used as input for the replacement
   operation. If you omit the directory specification from this
   qualifier, the file is taken from your default directory. If you
   omit the file name or file extension, the module name and module
   type specified in the command parameter are used by default.
 

/KEEP

      /KEEP
      /NOKEEP (default)

   If the administrator for your VDE library has established a
   NOKEEP script that deletes files from your directory, this
   qualifier controls whether the file used to create the new module
   generation is deleted from your directory. The /KEEP qualifier
   keeps the file in your directory without deleting it. The /NOKEEP
   qualifier runs the NOKEEP script to delete the file provided you
   did not also specify the /RESERVE qualifier. If your VDE library
   does not have a NOKEEP script, the file is not deleted.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each module
   is replaced. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages
   indicate that each module has been replaced and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/NOTE

      /NOTE=note-number

   The note-number parameter specifies the note number for the
   (previously-entered) SCT note associated with this replacement.

   VDE can also enter the note into the conference directly, see the
   /SCT qualifier for information.
 

/OTHER

      /OTHER="other-reason"

   Specifies the type of check-in. The other-reason parameter
   specifies the reason for this check-in, and should indicate why
   this particular check-in was not classified as a fold check-in
   nor as an SCT check-in.

   Also see /FOLD and /SCT.
 

/PROPAGATE

      /PROPAGATE=stream-name
      /NOPROPAGATE

   This qualifier controls the default module propogation behaviour
   of the replacement operation. The default for this qualifier can
   be altered by the propogation qualifier on the RESERVE command.

   When specified, the /PROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to propagate
   the changed module(s) only as far as the stream specified by
   the stream-name parameter, but not to any successors of that
   stream-change propagation thus stops at the specified stream.

   The /NOPROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to disable all propagate of
   the change beyond the current stream (the default stream or the
   stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier).

   If you omit both qualifiers, the REPLACE command will propagate
   the changed modules to all successors of the current stream.

   By default, neither /NOPROPOGATE nor /PROPOGATE is specified,
   and the module changes will propogate to all subsequent streams.
   The behaviour is affected by the specification of the propogation
   qualifier on the RESERVE command.
 

/QAR

      /QAR
      /NOQAR

   If you have enabled the library attribute that causes the
   REPLACE command to ask for the reason for the replacement, these
   qualifiers control whether VDE also asks for problem reports
   related to the replacement. The /QAR qualifier causes VDE to
   prompt for related QARs and CLDs (Digital problem reports) even
   if you give the reason as FOLD or OTHER. The /NOQAR qualifier
   causes VDE to not prompt for QAR and CLD information even if
   you give an SCT entry as the reason. If you specify neither /QAR
   nor /NOQAR, the REPLACE command prompts for QARs and CLDs only
   if you specify an SCT entry as the reason for the replacement.
   Neither qualifier has any effect if you have disabled the library
   attribute that causes the REPLACE command to ask for the reason
   for the replacement.
 

/QUEUE

   Controls whether each module is replaced into the specified
   stream immediately or is queued for later replacement. The
   /IMMEDIATE qualifier causes the REPLACE command to replace
   each module into the specified stream immediately so that
   the replacement is complete as soon as the command finishes.
   The /QUEUE qualifier causes the REPLACE command to queue the
   replacement in the VDE database so that the module remains
   reserved until an authorized user enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT
   command to cause the actual replacement to occur. If any
   stream into which you are replacing the module has the queued-
   replacement attribute, the module is automatically queued for
   replacement and the /IMMEDIATE is ignored.

   Of /QUEUE and /IMMEDIATE, /IMMEDIATE is the default.
 

/IMMEDIATE

   Controls whether each module is replaced into the specified
   stream immediately or is queued for later replacement. The
   /IMMEDIATE qualifier causes the REPLACE command to replace
   each module into the specified stream immediately so that
   the replacement is complete as soon as the command finishes.
   The /QUEUE qualifier causes the REPLACE command to queue the
   replacement in the VDE database so that the module remains
   reserved until an authorized user enters a PERFORM REPLACEMENT
   command to cause the actual replacement to occur. If any
   stream into which you are replacing the module has the queued-
   replacement attribute, the module is automatically queued for
   replacement and the /IMMEDIATE is ignored.

   Of /QUEUE and /IMMEDIATE, /IMMEDIATE is the default.
 

/PROJECT

      /PROJECT=project-name

   This qualifier allows the user to specify the project name this
   replacement is associated with. The project name can be used to
   track the work and changes related to a particular project.

   This qualifier is part of the statistics collection component of
   VDE. Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a library
   basis, using the MODIFY LIBRARY/STATISTICS command. If statistics
   collection is disabled, the statistics qualifiers are ignored and
   have no adverse effects. Certain keywords on this command require
   the specification of the /DEFECTS_CORRECTED or /NODEFECTS_
   CORRECTED qualifier.
 

/REASONS

      /REASONS=reason-code

   This qualifier allows the user a way to secify the reason the
   replacement is being made: reason-code specifies the particular
   reason code for this replacement, based on the list of reasons
   contained in Reasons.

   Table 1-4 Reasons

            Defect
   Change   Count
   Code     CollectioReason For Replacement

   BF       Yes      The replacement is a Bug Fix
   NF       No       New Feature or Enhancement
   PI       No       Performance Improvement
   CS       No       Common Sources
   CU       Yes      Code Cleanup, Retrofit, or a fix for a
                     Regression
   NH       No       New Hardware Support
   FE       No       Functional Equivalence
   OT       No       Other

   The reason-code is listed in Reasons, as is a brief explaination
   of the code, and an indication as to whether or not the number of
   defects is collected (see /DEFECTS_CORRECTED) for the particular
   reason code.

   This qualifier is part of the statistics collection component of
   VDE. Statistics collection is enabled or disabled on a library
   basis, using the MODIFY LIBRARY/STATISTICS command. If statistics
   collection is disabled, the statistics qualifiers are ignored and
   have no adverse effects. Certain keywords on this command require
   the specification of the /DEFECTS_CORRECTED or /NODEFECTS_
   CORRECTED qualifier.

   If statistics collection is enabled on the current library and
   you do not specify this qualifier, you will be prompted for the
   information.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a character string to be associated with the newly
   created generation in the VDE database. The remark is enclosed
   in quotation marks. If no remark is entered, then the remark from
   the corresponding reservation is used.

   The remark string is used as the title of the SCT note, if VDE
   was asked to enter the SCT note by the specification of the /SCT
   qualifier.
 

/REPLACEMENT

      /REPLACEMENT=rep-name

   Specifies that the reservations for the specified modules be
   added to a queued replacement with the name given by the rep-
   name parameter. If a queued replacement by that name already
   exists, the reservations are added to that replacement. If no
   such replacement exists, a new queued replacement by that name
   is created and the module reservations are added to it. This
   qualifier is ignored for immediate replacements; it is only
   meaningful if you also specify the /QUEUE qualifier or one of
   the streams into which you are replacing the modules have the
   queued-replacement attribute.

   Queued replacements are implicitly and automatically created
   whenever a REPLACE is performed on a stream marked for queued
   replacements. For further information on explicitly creating a
   queued replacement, see the CREATE REPLACEMENT command.
 

/RESERVE

      /RESERVE
      /NORESERVE (default)

   Controls whether the replaced module is kept reserved. If you
   specify the /RESERVE qualifier, the module remains reserved and
   the input file is not deleted from your default directory. If you
   specify /NORESERVE, the module is no longer reserved after being
   replaced.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER=(username [,username...])

   Specifies reviewers for the replacement. Each username parameter
   specifies the OpenVMS username of a user who should review
   all code replaced by the current command. The user must
   already be recorded in the VDE database. VDE notifies the
   user by mail message that the replacement has occurred. If
   the replacement is queued, the user should then review the
   changes in that replacement before it is performed. If the
   replacement is immediate, VDE notifies the user of the new module
   generations that were created, and the user may then inspect
   those generations.

   If you specify only one username parameter, you may omit the
   surrounding parentheses.
 

/SCT

      /SCT=filename

   The filename parameter specifies the name of a file to be loaded
   into the SCT notes conference. This file contains the previously-
   edited text of an SCT entry for the SCT note associated with this
   replacement.

   If this qualifier is used, the default notes conference for the
   stream-SCT-stream-name-is assumed.

   If this qualifier is specified, the /REMARK string is used as the
   title of the SCT note.

   For information on the proper creation and protection of an SCT
   notes conference, see the Guide to Using VDE.

   Also see /FOLD and /OTHER.
 

/SESSION

      /SESSION=session-name

   Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations
   together, typically to group all modules related to a particular
   source code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all
   component modules reserved to be treated as a single entity
   for subsequent replacement operations. A session also allows
   additional modules to be reserved and incorporated into an
   existing session at a later time.

   If you use the /SESSION qualifier, those reservations that are
   members of the specified reservation session are replaced.
   In this case, you must omit the mod-name parameters from the
   command.

   Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE,
   MODIFY SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL
   SESSION commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on
   a queued-replacement stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be
   combined into the same session.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the modules be replaced into the development
   stream given by the stream-name parameter. The changed modules
   are also propagated to any successors of that stream, if
   appropriate. If this qualifier is omitted, the modules are
   replaced into the default development stream. If this qualifier
   is omitted and no default stream is defined, VDE prompts you for
   the stream name.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that modules be replaced on behalf of another user.
   The username parameter specifies the OpenVMS username of the
   other user. That user must have the module reservations that the
   replace operation will end. You must have the USERNAME privilege
   to use this qualifier.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> REPLACE MOD1 /REMARK="Fixed list-update bug"
     %VDE-I-FILCOPLIB, file DEV$:[MYDIR]MOD1.PAS;2 copied to library
     %VDE-I-REPLACED, generation [FACIL]MOD1.PAS;8(7A1) replaced into stream V2.0
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example replaces the module MOD1.PAS into the current VDE
     library. Because no facility is specified with the command,
     the module is assumed to exist in the default facility, FACIL.
     Because no type name is specified, all source modules with
     name MOD1 are replaced; in this case there is only one such
     module, MOD1.PAS. The log messages show that the module was
     successfully replaced into stream V2.0.

   2.VDE> REPLACE [COPY]COPYMAIN.B32
     Please supply required information for module [COPY]COPYMAIN.B32:
     Enter the replacement remark: ADD THE /FUMBLE QUALIFIER
     %VDE-I-FILCOPLIB, file DEV$:[MYDIR]COPYMAIN.B32;3 copied to library
     %VDE-I-REPLACED, generation [COPY]COPYMAIN.B32;23(23) replaced into stream V3.0
     %VDE-I-REPLACED, generation [COPY]COPYMAIN.B32;23(23) replaced into stream V3.1
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command replaces module COPYMAIN.B32 in facility COPY
     into the current library. Because the /REMARK qualifier is
     not specified with the command, VDE prompts for the remark
     before replacing the module. The log messages shows that the
     REPLACE command replaced the module into stream V3.0 and then
     propagated the new generation into stream V3.1.

   3.VDE> REPLACE/QUEUE FEE.MAR, FOO.MAR "Remark string"
     %VDE-I-FILCOPSTAG, file DEV$:[MYDIR]FEE.MAR;3 copied to staging area
     %VDE-I-FILCOPSTAG, file DEV$:[MYDIR]FOO.MAR;3 copied to staging area
     %VDE-I-REPLQUE, module [FACIL]FEE.MAR queued for replacement SMITH-1
     %VDE-I-REPLQUE, module [FACIL]FOO.MAR queued for replacement SMITH-1
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the REPLACE command queues the replacement of
     modules FEE.MAR and FOO.MAR in facility FACIL. The modules are
     copied to a staging area that VDE manages, but they are not
     replaced into the VDE library and they remain reserved. The
     REPLACE command gives the queued replacement the generated name
     SMITH-1. To actually replaces the two modules, an authorized
     user must enter a PERFORM REPLACEMENT command for replacement
     SMITH-1.
 

1  RESERVE
   Retrieves the latest generation of one or more source modules
   from a given development stream and marks those modules as
   reserved by the current user. Related reservations can be grouped
   and manipulated together using sessions.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     RESERVE  mod-name [, mod-name...] ["remark"]
 

2  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a source module in the default stream or the stream
   specified with the /STREAM qualifier to be reserved from the
   library. The module name consists of an optional facility name
   enclosed in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type
   name preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If you omit
   the facility name, source modules from the default facility are
   reserved. If you omit the type name, all source modules with the
   given module name in the given facility are reserved.

   You can reserve more than one module by using wildcard characters
   in any of the three components of the module name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. VDE reserves the source modules
   whose names match the wildcard pattern.

   You can also reserve multiple modules by specifying the name
   of a source group instead of a module name. Source groups are
   created with the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group
   name, each module that is a member of the group is reserved from
   the library.
 

"remark"

   Specifies a remark string for the reservation. Specifying
   the remark parameter is equivalent to specifying the /REMARK
   qualifier after the RESERVE keyword.
 

2  Description
   The RESERVE command copies the latest generation of a module
   in a specified stream to your default directory (or to another
   location if you specified the /OUTPUT qualifier) and marks the
   module as "reserved" in that stream.

   After you have modified the module, you can return your changes
   to the library with the REPLACE command. Alternatively, you can
   cancel the reservation with the UNRESERVE command; no module
   modifications will be entered into the library.

                                  NOTE

      The module reservation will be released with the UNRESERVE
      command, by the REPLACE command (when queued-replacement
      are not enabled on the stream), or by the PERFORM REPLACE
      command (when queued-replacement is enabled on the stream).
      See the REPLACE, UNRESERVE, SHOW REPLACEMENT, and SHOW
      RESERVATION commands.

   By default, VDE does not allow you to reserve a module that
   is already reserved by another user (or yourself) for the same
   development stream. However, you can reserve an already reserved
   module if you specify the /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT qualifier and the
   already existing reservations all allow concurrent reservations.
   If you do not wish to override a reservation, you can use the
   /QUEUE qualifier to request notification when the module becomes
   available for reservation.

   When you reserve a generation of a module from a VDE library, the
   file that is placed in your directory has the same creation and
   revision times, record format, and record attributes as the file
   that was used to create the generation that you are reserving.

   To reserve modules on behalf of another user, use the /USERNAME
   qualifier to specify the OpenVMS username of that other user. The
   modules are then reserved in the specified user's name. You must
   have the USERNAME privilege to use the /USERNAME qualifier.

   For information on creating a new module, see CREATE MODULE.
   Depending on the queued-replacement setting of the target stream,
   you may need to issue a REPLACE command after CREATE MODULE;
   see REPLACE. The behaviour of the CREATE MODULE and the RESERVE
   commands are identical, save for the initial absence of the
   module in the library for the CREATE MODULE, and the initial
   presence of the module in the library for the RESERVE.

   On queued-replacement streams, modules created via a CREATE
   MODULE and modules reserved via a RESERVE can be combined into a
   single replacement, and can be combined into a single reservation
   /SESSION.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   module reserved. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each module that you have specified asking whether
   you want to reserve the corresponding module generation. If you
   answer YES (or Y), it is reserved. If you answer NO (or N), it is
   not reserved. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to reserve each
   specified module without asking for confirmation.
 

/FOLD

      /FOLD[=fold-ident]

   Specifies a fold record to be cancelled when this module
   reservation is eventually replaced into the library. The fold-
   ident parameter gives the fold identifier of a fold record
   for the module being reserved and for the stream in which the
   reservation is done. When you later replace the module and VDE
   performs the replacement, VDE will cancel this fold record from
   the VDE database. You can omit the fold-ident parameter if there
   is only one fold record for the specified module and stream. You
   can use the /FOLD qualifier if you are modifying the module to
   satisfy an existing fold record. You can also specify the /FOLD
   qualifier with the REPLACE command to achieve the same effect.
 

/HISTORY

      /HISTORY[="string"]
      /NOHISTORY

   The /HISTORY qualifier specifies that CMS history information is
   to be included in the file placed in your directory. The history
   of the module lists the generations that preceded the current
   generation of the module. Each generation produces one line of
   history information in the output file. This line gives the CMS
   generation number, user name, date, time, and remark associated
   with the generation.

   The quoted string specifies the format of the history line. The
   quoted string must contain the characters #H or #B (lower case
   is allowed) and can contain other printing characters (such as
   comment delimiters). Each history line is formed by inserting
   the history information where you specify #H or #B in the history
   string. If you specify #H, the history information is inserted
   at the end of the file and if you specify #B it is inserted at
   the beginning of the file. To include a quotation mark in the
   output history string, type it twice ("").  To include a number
   sign (#)  in the output history string, type it twice (##). If
   the string parameter is omitted, VDE uses the module's default
   history string.

   The /NOHISTORY qualifier specifies that history information is
   not to be appended to the output file placed in your directory.

   If the /HISTORY and /NOHISTORY qualifiers are both omitted, the
   RESERVE command generates history information only if the history
   attribute is enabled for the module. This attribute is set with
   the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command.

   If the history-notes attribute for the VDE library is disabled,
   the RESERVE command will not generate CMS history information
   into the output file and will not accept the /HISTORY qualifier.
   See the description of the /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier to CREATE
   LIBRARY for more information.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=res-ident

   Specifies a reservation identifier for the new reservation.
   Each reservation has a unique reservation identifier so that
   you can distinguish between multiple concurrent reservations
   of the same module by the same user. By default, the RESERVE
   command assigns a unique numeric identifier to each reservation,
   such as "1", "2", and so on. The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier
   overrides this default and allows you to select a reservation
   identifier of your choice, such as a mnemonic name. The res-ident
   parameter specifies the reservation identifier. It can be up to
   39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each module
   generation is reserved. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that the modules have been reserved and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/MERGE

      /MERGE=stream-name
      /MERGE=(gen-expr)

   Controls whether another generation of the module (called the
   merge generation) is to be merged with the generation that
   is being reserved (called the retrieved generation). If you
   specify the /MERGE qualifier with the stream-name parameter, the
   merge generation is the latest generation of the module in the
   specified stream. If you specify the /MERGE qualifier with the
   gen-expr parameter enclosed in parentheses, the merge generation
   is the generation with the specified generation expression (for
   example, "2A3").

   When you specify the /MERGE qualifier, VDE merges the lines of
   the retrieved generation with the lines of the merge generation
   and delivers the merged text as a single file to your output
   directory. The file that is placed in your directory has the
   current creation and revision times. The merge generation cannot
   be on the same line of descent as the retrieved generation. When
   there is a conflict between blocks of one or more lines, VDE
   includes the conflicting lines and flags the conflict.

   VDE uses the callable interface to CMS to provide the merge
   capability. For a detailed explanation of how two generations are
   merged and how CMS (and therefore VDE) treats conflicts between
   the generations, see the CMS documentation.
 

/NOCONCURRENT

   Specifies that the module cannot be reserved by another user
   while you have it reserved. You must replace or unreserve the
   module before others can reserve it. By default, VDE allows
   concurrent reservations if the module has the concurrent
   attribute set.
 

/NOTES

      /NOTES[="string"]
      /NONOTES

   The /NOTES qualifier specifies that CMS notes are to be appended
   to the lines of the output file. CMS notes indicate in what
   module generation each source line was created.

   The quoted string specifies the format of the note. The quoted
   string can contain text (including the appropriate comment
   delimiter) and the characters #G or #g. The CMS generation
   expression of the generation in which the line first appeared
   in inserted where you specify #G or #g. The resulting string is
   appended to the end of the output line. To include a quotation
   mark in the output notes string, type it twice ("").  To include
   a number sign (#)  in the output notes string, type it twice
   (##).  If the string parameter is omitted, VDE uses the module's
   default notes string. (You set the default notes string with the
   CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command.)

   The /NONOTES qualifier specifies that CMS notes are not to be
   appended to the lines of the file placed in your directory.

   If the /NOTES and /NONOTES qualifiers are both omitted, the
   RESERVE command generates CMS notes only if the notes attribute
   is enabled for the module. This attribute is set with the CREATE
   MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command.

   If the history-notes attribute for the VDE library is disabled,
   the RESERVE command will not generate CMS notes information into
   the output file and will not accept the /NOTES qualifier. See the
   description of the /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier to CREATE LIBRARY for
   more information.
 

/NOOUTPUT

   Specifies that the reserve operation is to be performed along
   with any history processing and error checking but that no output
   file is to be created.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-specification

   Directs VDE to write the reserved module to the specified file.
   If you omit the directory from the file specification, VDE writes
   the file to your default directory. If you omit the file name or
   file type, VDE uses the module name and type by default. If you
   omit the /OUTPUT and /NOOUTPUT qualifiers entirely, VDE creates a
   file in your current default directory with the same name as the
   module.

   If you reserve more than one module with the same /OUTPUT
   qualifier and you specify the file name and type on that
   qualifier, VDE creates successive versions of the file indicated
   by the /OUTPUT qualifier.
 

/OVERRIDE

      /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT

   Specifies that VDE should create a concurrent reservation if a
   module being reserved is already reserved for the same stream. If
   this qualifier is omitted and a module you are trying to reserve
   is already reserved, VDE displays an error message and does
   not reserve the module for you. To create a second, concurrent
   reservation, you must use this qualifier. Even when you use
   this qualifier, VDE does not allow you to create a concurrent
   reservation if a previous reservation for the module does not
   allow concurrent reservations.
 

/POSITION

      /POSITION=column-number

   Specifies the column in which CMS notes are to be placed. The
   column number must be an integer in the range 1 to 511. If
   the length of an output line is less than the specified column
   number, the note appears at the specified column number. If
   the length of the line is greater than or equal to the column
   number, the note is placed at the next tab stop after the end
   of the line. (Tab stops are at position 9 and every 8 characters
   thereafter.)

   If the /POSITION qualifier is omitted, the default notes position
   for the module is used. The default notes position is set
   with the CREATE MODULE or MODIFY MODULE command. The /POSITION
   qualifier has no effect unless the /NOTES qualifier is specified
   or the notes attribute is set for the module.

   If the history-notes attribute for the VDE library is disabled,
   the RESERVE command will not generate CMS notes information into
   the output file and will not accept the /POSITION qualifier. See
   the description of the /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier to CREATE LIBRARY
   for more information.
 

/PROPAGATE

      /PROPAGATE=stream-name
      /NOPROPAGATE

   This qualifier controls the default module propogation behaviour
   of the subsequent and associated REPLACE command, and it controls
   the reservation "shadow" for this particular reservation.

   When specified, the /PROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to propagate
   the changed module(s) only as far as the stream specified by
   the stream-name parameter, but not to any successors of that
   stream-change propagation thus stops at the specified stream.

   The /NOPROPAGATE qualifier causes VDE to disable all propagate of
   the change beyond the current stream (the default stream or the
   stream specified with the /STREAM qualifier).

   If you omit both qualifiers, the REPLACE command will propagate
   the changed modules to all successors of the current stream.

   Because these qualifiers determine what streams a subsequent
   REPLACE command will affect, they also determine what streams-
   the "shadow"-the new module reservations cover. A reservation
   that covers fewer streams allows other users to reserve the same
   module in other streams with less likelihood of conflict.

   For information on propogation, see REPLACE.
 

/QUEUE

   Specifies that VDE should queue a reservation request for you
   if you cannot reserve a module because it is already reserved by
   another user. If the requested module can be reserved now, the
   module is reserved and this qualifier has no effect. However, if
   the module is not available, VDE queues a reservation request
   for it in its database. When the user who owns the current
   reservation later replaces or unreserves it, VDE sends you a
   mail message saying that the module is now available. To actually
   reserve the module, you must then enter another RESERVE command.
   If multiple users have queued reservation requests for the
   same module, all of them are notified when the module becomes
   available. They must then decide among themselves who should
   reserve the module first.

   To display queued reservation requests, use the SHOW RESERVATION
   command.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a character string to be stored in the database for
   this reservation, usually explaining why the reservation is
   made. The remark is enclosed in quotation marks. If no remark
   is entered, a null remark is stored.
 

/SESSION

      /SESSION[=session-name]

   Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations
   together, typically to group all modules related to a particular
   source code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all
   component modules reserved to be treated as a single entity
   for subsequent replacement operations. A session also allows
   additional modules to be reserved and incorporated into an
   existing session at a later time.

   If no session with the specified session-name session name
   currently exists, VDE will create a new reservation session
   under the specified session name and will incorporate the module
   reservation(s) into it.

   If the session-name parameter is omitted, VDE generates a unique
   session name, creates a new session by that name, and adds the
   module reservation to it.

   If the /SESSION qualifier is omitted on the RESERVE command, VDE
   will reserve the module (as expected), and will not add the new
   module reservation to any session.

   Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE,
   MODIFY SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL
   SESSION commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on
   a queued-replacement stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be
   combined into the same session.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that modules be reserved in the development stream
   given by the stream-name parameter. The RESERVE command fetches
   the latest generation of each specified module in that stream
   and records that each reservation belongs to that stream. If
   this qualifier is omitted, modules are reserved in the default
   development stream. If this qualifier is omitted and no default
   stream is defined, VDE prompts you for the stream name.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Reserves modules in another user's name. The username parameter
   specifies the OpenVMS username of the other user. You must have
   the USERNAME privilege to use this qualifier.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> RESERVE FOO/REMARK="Fix problem reported in QAR 23"
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, generation [FACIL]FOO.MAR;7(5A2) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]FOO.MAR;
     %VDE-I-RESERVED, module generation [FACIL]FOO.MAR;7(5A2) reserved from stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command reserves all source modules named FOO in the
     default facility, FACIL. In this case, there is only one such
     module, FOO.MAR. This module is copied to the user's default
     directory and is marked as reserved in the VDE database.

   2.VDE> RESERVE MOD1 /IDENTIFICATION=BUGFIX
     Please supply required information for module [FACIL]MOD1.*;0:
     Enter the reservation remark: FIX ACCESS VIOLATION
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, generation [FACIL]MOD1.PAS;9(9) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]MOD1.PAS;
     %VDE-I-RESERVED, module generation [FACIL]MOD1.PAS;9(9) reserved from stream V6.0
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW RESERVATION
     Reservation BUGFIX of [FACIL]MOD1.PAS       SMITH        29-DEC-1989 V6.0
     VDE>

     The RESERVE command reserves module MOD1.PAS in facility
     FACIL and assigns the reservation identifier BUGFIX to the
     reservation. (If you do not use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier,
     the RESERVE command assigns a numeric reservation identifier
     to the reservation.) The SHOW RESERVATION command indicates
     that the module is reserved with the BUGFIX identifier. This
     identifier can later be used on a REPLACE or UNRESERVE command
     to identify this particular reservation.

   3.VDE> RESERVE/SESSION=SPEEDUP A.REQ,B.REQ "Remark string"
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, generation [FACIL]A.REQ;11(11) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]A.REQ;
     %VDE-I-FETCHED, generation [FACIL]B.REQ;7(7) fetched from library
     %VDE-I-OUTFILE, output file is DEV$:[MYDIR]B.REQ;
     %VDE-I-RESERVED, module generation [FACIL]A.REQ;11(11) reserved from stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-RESERVED, module generation [FACIL]B.REQ;7(7) reserved from stream MAIN
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example shows how module reservations are made members of
     a reservation session. This command reserves modules A.REQ and
     B.REQ in facility FACIL and makes the resulting reservations
     members of a reservation session called SPEEDUP. These modules
     can later be replaced (or unreserved) as a unit by specifying
     the session name instead of the names of the individual
     modules.
 

1  REVIEW
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Reviews the build-step log files for a specified build job.

   Format

     REVIEW BUILD_JOB  [stream-name]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream. VDE reviews the results of the
   most recent build job for the specified stream. If you omit the
   stream-name parameter, VDE reviews the results of the most recent
   build job for the default stream.
 

3  Description
   The REVIEW BUILD_JOB command allows you to review the log
   files of the individual build steps of a specified build job.
   The command enters you into a subsystem of VDE. Once in the
   subsystem, you are prompted with the string VDEREVBLD> and you
   can then use a restricted set of commands, different from usual
   VDE commands, to display selected log files. After reviewing
   build results, use the EXIT command to exit from the subsystem
   and return to VDE.

   The REVIEW BUILD_JOB command creates a build-step review list
   which is a list of build steps to be reviewed. By default,
   the list includes only those steps that completed with errors.
   Commands in the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem list the steps in
   the review list and display the log files for those steps. The
   subsystem thus gives you a convenient way to determine which
   build steps failed and why they failed. The subsystem can also
   review build steps that completed successfully. Use the /STEP
   qualifier to include successful steps in the build-step review
   list.

   When you are in the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem, you enter
   commands at the VDEREVBLD> prompt. The commands can display
   either the build-step review list or the log files for individual
   build steps on that list.

   The REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem accepts the commands documented in
   Review Build Job Commands.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/STEP

      /STEP [=(status [, status...])]

   Reviews either all build steps or, if you specify the status
   parameter, those steps whose status is specified. Each status
   parameter must be one of the following keywords: NOTSTARTED,
   RUNNING, SUCCESS, or ERRORS.

   If you specify only one status parameter, the parentheses may be
   omitted. If you do not specify a parameter, all build steps of
   specified build job are reviewed.

   If you omit the /STEP qualifier, only those build steps that
   completed with errors are reviewed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> REVIEW BUILD_JOB
     Reviewing steps of build job 38 for stream MAIN
     Number of build steps selected: 1

     VDEREVBLD> DIRECTORY
     Steps being reviewed in build job 38 for stream MAIN:
        Compile step for module [BUILD_TEST]E.B32

     VDEREVBLD> NEXT
     Build job 38 for stream MAIN
     Log file of compile step for module [BUILD_TEST]E.B32:

          1: --->> ERROR: MISSING SCRIPT IN VDE DATABASE <<---
          2: No script found in database to perform build step
     [End of file]

     VDEREVBLD> NEXT
     %VDE-E-NOMORESTEP, no more build steps in review list
     VDEREVBLD> EXIT
     VDE>

     In this example, one step completed with errors in build job 38
     for stream MAIN. The REVIEW BUILD_JOB command displays messages
     that identify the build job and gives the number of steps
     selected for review. By default, the command includes only
     those steps from the build-step review list that completed with
     errors; in this case, there is one such step. At the VDEREVBLD>
     prompt, the user enters the DIRECTORY command to display the
     build steps on the current review list. Then the user enters
     the NEXT command to see the log file for the next build step.
     (Pressing the RETURN key has the same effect.) The log file
     shows that the compile step failed because no script for it
     was found in the VDE database. A second NEXT command shows
     that there are no more build steps on the review list. The
     EXIT command then exits from the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem and
     returns the user to the VDE> prompt.

   2.VDE> REVIEW BUILD_JOB/STEP=SUCCESS
     Reviewing steps of build job 39 for stream MAIN
     Number of build steps selected: 5

     VDEREVBLD> DIRECTORY
     Steps being reviewed in build job 39 for stream MAIN:
        Compile step for module [BUILD_TEST]B.REQ
        Compile step for module [BUILD_TEST]C.B32
        Compile step for module [BUILD_TEST]D.B32
        Compile step for module [BUILD_TEST]E.B32
        Link step for module [BUILD_TEST]X.EXE

     VDEREVBLD> SELECT X
     Build job 39 for stream MAIN
     Log file of link step for module [BUILD_TEST]X.EXE:

          1: $ DEFINE OBJLIB DISK$:[LIBROOT.MAIN.BUILD_TEST.OBJ]
          2: $ LINK/EXE=OBJLIB:X.EXE/MAP=OBJLIB:X.MAP  -
          3:         OBJLIB:OBJLIB.OLB/INCLUDE=C,OBJLIB:OBJLIB.OLB/LIBRARY
          4: $ DEASSIGN OBJLIB
          5: $ !
          6: $ SET NOVERIFY   ! Successful script completion
     [End of file]

     VDEREVBLD> EXIT
     VDE>

     In this example, the /STEP=SUCCESS qualifier causes the REVIEW
     BUILD_JOB command to include only those steps from the build-
     step review list that completed successfully. The subsystem
     DIRECTORY command then lists all such steps. The SELECT command
     displays the log file of the link step for module X.EXE.
     Finally, the EXIT command exits from the REVIEW BUILD_JOB
     subsystem and returns the user to the VDE> prompt.

5  Description
   The review commands allow you to review the log files of the
   individual build steps of a specified build job. The command
   enters you into a subsystem of VDE. Once in the subsystem, you
   are prompted with the string VDEREVBLD> and you can then use a
   restricted set of commands, different from usual VDE commands,
   to display selected log files. After reviewing build results, use
   the EXIT command to exit from the subsystem and return to VDE.

   The REVIEW BUILD_JOB command creates a build-step review list
   which is a list of build steps to be reviewed. By default,
   the list includes only those steps that completed with errors.
   Commands in the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem list the steps in
   the review list and display the log files for those steps. The
   subsystem thus gives you a convenient way to determine which
   build steps failed and why they failed. The subsystem can also
   review build steps that completed successfully. Use the /STEP
   qualifier to include successful steps in the build-step review
   list.

   When you are in the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem, you enter
   commands at the VDEREVBLD> prompt. The commands can display
   either the build-step review list or the log files for individual
   build steps on that list. The subsystem accepts the following
   commands:

   o  DIRECTORY [mod-name [, mod-name...]]

      Displays a list of all build steps on the build-step review
      list, giving the type of each step (compile, link, or copy)
      and the name of the module that is compiled, linked, or
      copied. If you specify one or more mod-name parameters, the
      command displays only those build steps whose module names
      match the parameters. You can use wildcards in the mod-name
      parameter.

   o  SELECT [mod-name]

      Selects the first build step whose module name matches the
      mod-name parameter and displays the log file for that build
      step. You can use wildcards in the mod-name parameter.

      If you omit the mod-name parameter, the command displays
      the log file of the next build step on the review list
      that matches the most recently specified module name from a
      previous SELECT command. Using this feature, you can enter a
      SELECT command with a mod-name parameter containing wildcards
      to display the log file of the first build step that matches
      the parameter. You can then enter SELECT commands without
      parameters to display the log files of all other build steps
      that match the original parameter, one log file per SELECT
      command.

   o  NEXT [STEP]

      Displays the next page of the log file of the current build
      step. If you specify the optional STEP keyword, the first page
      of the log file of the next build-step is displayed.

      Pressing the KP0 key (the 0 key on the numeric keypad) is
      the same as entering the NEXT command. As a result, you can
      review the log files of all build steps on the review list by
      repeatedly pressing the KP0 key.

   o  BACK

      Displays the log file of the previous build step on the build-
      step review list.

   o  CURRENT

      Displays the first page of the log file of the current build
      step.

   o  FIRST

      Displays the log file of the first build step on the build-
      step review list.

   o  LAST

      Displays the log file of the last build step in the build-step
      review list.

   o  SPAWN

      Spawns a subprocess and attaches the terminal to that
      subprocess. See the description of the VDE SPAWN command for
      details.

   o  ATTACH

      Attaches the terminal to a specified process. See the
      description of the VDE ATTACH command for details.

   o  EXIT

      Exits from the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem and returns you to
      the VDE> prompt.
 

2  REPLACEMENT
   Reviews the modules, comment files, information file, and log
   file associated with a specified queued replacement.

   Format

     REVIEW REPLACEMENT  rep-name
 

3  Parameter
 

rep-name

   The name of the queued replacement to review. This parameter is
   required; if you omit it, VDE prompts you for it.
 

3  Description
   The REVIEW REPLACEMENT command allows you to review all files
   associated with a given queued replacement. These files include
   the modules being replaced, the information file that the
   replacing user may have provided, the comment files that other
   reviewers may have written, and possibly a log file for an
   attempt to perform the replacement. The log file is only present
   if an earlier attempt to perform the replacement failed; the
   log file then tells you wnat went wrong. For each module being
   replaced, you may examine the new version queued for replacement,
   the old version in the VDE library, and the differences between
   the two.

   The REVIEW REPLACEMENT command enters you into a subsystem of
   VDE. Once in the subsystem, you are prompted with the string
   VDEREVREP> and you can then use a restricted set of commands,
   different from the usual VDE commands, to display the files
   associated with the replacement. After reviewing these files, you
   must use the EXIT command to exit from the subsystem and return
   to VDE.

   The REVIEW REPLACEMENT command creates a list of files to be
   reviewed called the replacement review list. This list includes
   the replacement's information file (if any), the comment file for
   each reviewer that has provided one, the log file for the last
   attempt to perform replacement (if any), and the modules that
   are queued for replacement. Subsystem commands list, display, and
   navigate among the elements in the review list. One element is
   always designated as the current element. Initially, the first
   element on the list is the current element, but various command
   can change that designation. The SHOW and EDIT subcommands
   display the text of the current element.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/COMMENT

   Specifies that reviewer comment files be included in the
   replacement review list. If this qualifier is omitted, comment
   files are only included if all other qualifiers are omitted as
   well.
 

/INFORMATION

   Specifies that the queuing user's information file be included
   in the replacement review list. If this qualifier is omitted,
   the information file is only included if all other qualifiers are
   omitted as well.
 

/MODULE

   Specifies that all modules that are members of the queued
   replacement be included in the replacement review list. If this
   qualifier is omitted, modules are only included if all other
   qualifiers are omitted as well.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   This qualifier specifies the name of the stream associated with
   the replacement. It is currently ignored.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> REVIEW REPLACEMENT SMITH-1
     Reviewing replacement SMITH-1 queued by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
     Number of modules and files selected: 4

     VDEREVREP> DIRECTORY
     Modules and files being reviewed for replacement SMITH-1:
        Information file by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Comment file by reviewer BROWN (Bill Brown) rejecting replacement
        Module [FACIL]A.REQ
        Module [FACIL]C.B32

     VDEREVREP> CURRENT

     Information file by user SMITH (Jane Smith)

     VDEREVREP>

     In this example, the REVIEW REPLACEMENT command displays some
     information identifying the requested queued replacement
     and enters the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem. The DIRECTORY
     subcommand displays the elements on the review list and the
     CURRENT subcommand prints a line identifying the current
     element of the review list (namely the first element).

   2.VDEREVREP> SHOW

     Text of the queuing user's information file displayed here.
     This file may consist of many lines.

     VDEREVREP> SHOW

     Text of comment file written by reviewer BROWN displayed here.
     This file may consist of many lines.

     VDEREVREP>

     This example continues the previous example. The SHOW command
     displays the text of the current review-list element, user
     SMITH's information file. The NEXT command makes the next
     element the current element and prints its name. The subsequent
     SHOW command then displays the text of that file, the comment
     file by reviewer BROWN.

   3.VDEREVREP> NEXT

     VDEREVREP> NEXT
     %VDE-E-NOMOREMOD, no more modules in review list
     VDEREVREP> EXIT
     VDE>

     Yet another NEXT command makes module [FACIL]A.REQ the current
     element of the review list. The SHOW command displays the
     differences file for that module. To do so, it first fetches
     out the old generation of the module, differences it with
     the new generation queued for replacement, and displays the
     differences file. The EDIT command could have been used just as
     well, and is more suitable for long differences files. Another
     NEXT command make module [FACIL]C.B32 the current element and
     displays its name. A final NEXT command shows that there are no
     more elements in the review list. The user then enters the EXIT
     command to return to the VDE> prompt.

4  Description

   The REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem accepts the following commands
   at the VDEREVREP> prompt:

   o  DIRECTORY [mod-name [, mod-name...]]

      Displays a list of all information files, comment files,
      replacement log files, and modules on the replacement
      review list. For each file, this command displays the type
      (information, comment, log, module, or binary module) and the
      name of user who created the file (for information and comment
      files) or the name of the module. If you specify one or more
      mod-name parameters, the command displays only those modules
      whose names match the parameters. You can use wildcards in
      the mod-name parameter. An information or comment file has the
      author's OpenVMS username as its file name, so these files can
      also be selected with mod-name parameters. The replacement log
      file (if present) has the file name LOG.VDE$LOG.

   o  SELECT [mod-name]

      Selects the first review list element whose module or file
      name matches the mod-name parameter and makes that the current
      review list element. This command prints one line identifying
      the selected module or file. You can select an information
      or comment file by specifying the author's OpenVMS username
      in the mod-name parameter. You can select the log file (if
      present) by specifying LOG in the mod-name parameter.

      If you omit the mod-name parameter, the command displays the
      next element on the review list that matches the most recently
      specified module name from a previous SELECT command. Using
      this feature, you can enter a SELECT command with a mod-name
      parameter containing wildcards to select the first module (or
      other file) that matches the parameter. You can then enter
      SELECT commands without parameters to successively select all
      other modules and files that match the original parameter, one
      module or file per SELECT command.

   o  SHOW [keyword]

      Prints the text of the current review-list element on your
      terminal. If the current element is an information or comment
      file, VDE reads that file and prints it on your terminal. If
      the current element is a module, VDE prints the new version
      of the module (the version about to be replaced into the
      library), the old version of the module (the generation that
      was fetched when the module was reserved), or the differences
      between the two. The keyword parameter determines what is
      displayed for a module; this parameter may be the keyword
      NEW, OLD, or DIFFERENCES. This parameter is ignored for
      information, comment, and log files.

      If you specify the OLD keyword, VDE fetches out the old module
      generation unless a previous reviewer has already fetched it
      into the replacement's staging area. VDE then displays that
      file. If you specify the DIFFERENCES keyword, VDE fetches
      out the old module generation if necessary. VDE then runs
      the OpenVMS DIFFERENCES command to create a differences file
      unless a previous reviewer has already created it. VDE then
      displays that file.

      This command will not display any files for binary source
      modules.

   o  EDIT [keyword]

      Invokes your preferred editor in read-only mode to display
      the text of the current review-list element. If the current
      element is an information or comment file, VDE spawns the
      editor to display that file. If the current element is a
      module, VDE spawns the editor to display the new version
      of the module (the version about to be replaced into the
      library), the old version of the module (the generation that
      was fetched when the module was reserved), or the differences
      between the two. The keyword parameter determines what is
      displayed for a module; this parameter may be the keyword
      NEW, OLD, or DIFFERENCES. This parameter is ignored for
      information, comment, and log files.

      If you specify the OLD keyword, VDE fetches out the old module
      generation unless a previous reviewer has already fetched it
      into the replacement's staging area. VDE then displays that
      file. If you specify the DIFFERENCES keyword, VDE fetches
      out the old module generation if necessary. VDE then runs
      the OpenVMS DIFFERENCES command to create a differences file
      unless a previous reviewer has already created it. VDE then
      displays that file.

      This command will not display any files for binary source
      modules.

      Use the SET EDITOR command at the VDE> prompt to specify your
      preferred editor. If you do not declare an editor, VDE invokes
      the system default editor.

   o  NEXT

      Makes the next element on the review list the current element
      and displays the name of that element.

      Pressing the KP0 key (the 0 key on the numeric keypad) is the
      same as entering the NEXT command. As a result, you can step
      from element to element by repeatedly pressing the KP0 key.
      Similarly, the COMMA (,)  key on the numeric keypad enters
      the NEXT and SHOW commands with a single keystroke and the
      MINUS (-)  key on the numeric keypad enters the NEXT and EDIT
      commands.

   o  BACK

      Makes the previous element on the review list the current
      element and displays the name of that element.

   o  CURRENT

      Displays the name of the current element of the replacement
      review list.

   o  FIRST

      Makes the first element on the review list the current element
      and displays the name of that element.

   o  LAST

      Makes the last element on the review list the current element
      and displays the name of that element.

   o  ACCEPT ["remark-string"]

      Records in the VDE database that you accept the replacement
      currently being reviewed. You must be a reviewer for the
      replacement to use this command. You can specify the optional
      remark string to give a reason for accepting the replacement.
      This command accepts the same qualifiers as the VDE-level
      ACCEPT REPLACEMENT command.

   o  REJECT "remark-string"

      Records in the VDE database that you reject the replacement
      currently being reviewed. You must be a reviewer for the
      replacement to use this command. The remark string should
      specify a reason for rejecting the replacement. If you omit
      the remark parameter, VDE prompts you for a remark. This
      command accepts the same qualifiers as the VDE-level REJECT
      REPLACEMENT command. Like REJECT REPLACEMENT, the REJECT
      command lets you specify a comment file to more fully explain
      your reasons for rejecting the replacement.

   o  SPAWN

      Spawns a subprocess and attaches the terminal to that
      subprocess. See the description of the VDE SPAWN command for
      details.

   o  ATTACH

      Attaches the terminal to a specified process. See the
      description of the VDE ATTACH command for details.

   o  EXIT

      Exits from the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem and returns you to
      the VDE> prompt.

3  Description
   Scripts are used to add various user-defined extensions to
   various VDE functions and commands. VDE invokes various scripts
   at various times during VDE processing-see Script Types for
   further information on this.

   Scripts of various types are recorded in the VDE database. A
   script is a sequence of keywords in the VDE script language that
   VDE can execute to create a DCL command file. VDE can then invoke
   that DCL command file in a subprocess to perform the action of
   the script. VDE uses scripts to perform many different kinds
   of actions. For example, VDE uses "compile scripts" to compile
   modules in a build job. Similarly, it uses "new-stream scripts"
   to populate the directories of a new stream with files when it
   performs the CREATE STREAM command. There are many other kinds of
   scripts, all distinguished by the keywords or circumstances that
   cause them to be invoked.

   The primary purpose of VDE scripts is to insert names and
   directory specifications from the VDE database into text you
   specify to generate DCL command files that perform various
   actions. A VDE script is thus a mixture of plain text and
   invocations of functions that retrieve names (such as module
   names, type names, and facility names) and directory strings
   (such as the names of facility subdirectories) from the VDE
   database.

   Since you define scripts, you define how VDE should perform the
   corresponding actions. For example, you decide how a Pascal
   module is compiled because you define the Pascal compilation
   script. Similarly, you can define a script that defines auxiliary
   actions of the REPLACE command. Scripts thus let you make policy
   decisions for your own project, while VDE provides the mechanisms
   that implement your policies.

   When a new development stream is created, all script definitions
   from the parent stream are copied to the child stream. If
   modified, the script definitions then evolve independently in
   the two development streams.

   A VDE script is a sequence of text lines that contain VDE script
   keywords. There are only three VDE script commands: EMIT, FETCH,
   and EXIT.

   In addition, a script may contain blank lines and comment lines.
   The exclamation point (!)  is the comment character. VDE ignores
   any text on a script line after an exclamation point, provided
   the exclamation point is not within quotes. A script keyword
   command may be continued from one line to the next by ending the
   first line with the sequence space-minus ( -).

   VDE accepts the following keyword commands in a script:

   o  EMIT string [, string...]

      Emits one line into the DCL command file. This keyword command
      evaluates each string parameter, concatenates the resulting
      character strings into a single line of text, and writes
      this line of text to the DCL command file being generated.
      Each string parameter may be a quoted character string, an
      invocation of a script function, or a directory symbol name.

      If the EMIT command parameter contains spaces or other
      characters, the string must be enclosed in a pair of quoting
      characters. (eg: If the command is a typical DCL command and
      contains blanks and various other characters, it must be
      quoted.) Valid quoting character pairs include the double-
      quote pair: (")  and ("), and the double-caret pair: ()
      and ().  Use of the end-quoting character within the string
      is permissible, but requires that the character be doubled.
      (eg: a double-quote character within the string is specified
      by double double-quotes; by two consecutive double-quotes:
      ("").)

      If the parameter is an invocation of a script function,
      you must specify the function name or the function name
      followed by a parenthesized list of function parameters. VDE
      evaluates the function to produce a character string that is
      concatenated to the current DCL command line. (Next section
      lists the available script functions.)

      If the parameter is a directory symbol name, VDE looks up the
      OpenVMS directory specification associated with the directory
      symbol from the VDE database and concatenates that string to
      the current DCL command line. OpenVMS directory symbols are
      defined using the SET DIRECTORY command.

      To exit from the generated DCL in the script, issue one of the
      following script commands:

       EMIT $ GOTO VDE$ERROR
       EMIT $ GOTO VDE$SUCCESS
       EMIT "$ EXIT"

   o  EXIT

      Exits from the script during script execution. Subsequent
      script commands are thus not executed to produce DCL commands.
      (Note that the EXIT keyword does not create an EXIT command in
      the DCL command file; it only stops script execution. See the
      documentation on the EMIT script command for information on
      generating the proper DCL exit sequence from within a script.)

   o  FETCH string [, string...]

      Fetches a module generation from the VDE library. This keyword
      evaluates each string parameter, concatenates the resulting
      character strings into a single line of text, and interprets
      the line as the qualifiers and parameters to a VDE FETCH
      command. Each string parameter may be a quoted character
      string, an invocation of a script function, or a directory
      symbol name.

      Your string parameters should generate the full VDE FETCH
      command you want performed except for the FETCH keyword. The
      string parameters can generate all qualifiers and parameters
      that the VDE FETCH keyword accepts, and can use script
      functions to include strings such as module names, stream
      names, and directory specifications. The resulting command
      string is parsed and executed as if it belonged to a normal
      FETCH keyword entered from the terminal. Use the FETCH keyword
      when you want VDE to fetch a generation directly, without
      using a DCL command file, and you want it performed in the
      same database transaction as the operation performing the
      script.

      By default, VDE fetches the latest generation of the specified
      module in the stream for which the script is invoked. You
      can override this default by generating a /STREAM qualifier,
      /GENERATION qualifier, or a generation number for the FETCH
      keyword. The script FETCH keyword suppresses log messages by
      default, but you can override this default by generating a
      /LOG qualifier. Otherwise, all parameters, qualifiers, and
      defaults are the same as for the regular VDE FETCH keyword
      described elsewhere.

      If a string parameter is a quoted character string, the
      string must be enclosed in double quotes (").  A double-quote
      character within the string is specified by two consecutive
      double quotes ("").  VDE concatenates the quoted string to the
      current FETCH keyword line.

      If the parameter is an invocation of a script function,
      you must specify the function name or the function name
      followed by a parenthesized list of function parameters. VDE
      evaluates the function to produce a character string that is
      concatenated to the current FETCH keyword line. (Next section
      lists the available script functions.)

      If the parameter is a directory symbol name, VDE looks up the
      OpenVMS directory specification associated with the directory
      symbol from the VDE database and concatenates that string to
      the current FETCH keyword line. OpenVMS directory symbols are
      defined using the SET DIRECTORY command.

   When executing a script, VDE executes successive script keywords
   from the script until it encounters an EXIT keyword or the end
   of the script. VDE executes FETCH keywords immediately as they
   are encountered. VDE writes all lines generated by EMIT keywords
   to the output DCL command file. At the end of the script, VDE
   executes that command file in a subprocess to perform the action
   of the script.

   Selection of Scripts

   Many types of scripts are invoked when a certain operation must
   be applied to a specific module, such as compiling or reserving
   the module. For such operations, VDE must select the script
   that is appropriate to the module. The type of the script is
   of course the primary selection criterion, but even for a given
   type, different scripts are needed for different modules. The
   script that compiles a Fortran module is not appropriate for a C
   module, for example, and the script that links one image cannot
   link another. (Script Functions contains the types of scripts
   supported by VDE.)

   To accommodate such situations, VDE lets you specify how scripts
   are selected based on the module name. You can specify that a
   script should be used only for a specific module, for all modules
   of a certain type in a given facility, for all modules of a given
   type regardless of facility, or for all modules regardless of
   type or facility. When you create such a script, you specify the
   script type with a qualifier, such as /COMPILE or /RESERVE. You
   also specify the modules to which the script applies through a
   module-name parameter to the qualifier. A restricted form of
   wildcarding determines what modules the script can be used for.
   The following module-name specifications are allowed:

   o  [FACIL]MOD.TYP

      If you fully specify the module name, the script applies
      only to that specific module. For example, the qualifier
      /LINK=[CODE]X.EXE says that the script can only be used to
      link image X.EXE in facility CODE. If you omit the facility
      name, the current default facility is assumed.

   o  [FACIL]*.TYP

      If you specify the facility name and type name but specify an
      asterisk (*)  in place of the module name, the script applies
      to all modules of that type in that facility. For example, the
      qualifier /COMPILE=[FACIL]*.C says that the script can be used
      to compile all C modules in facility FACIL. If you omit the
      facility name, the current default facility is assumed.

   o  [*]*.TYP

      If you specify the type name but specify an asterisk (*)
      in place of both the facility name and the module name, the
      script applies to all modules of that type in all facilities.
      For example, the qualifier /COMPILE=[*]*.FOR says that the
      script can be used to compile all Fortran modules in all
      facilities.

   o  [*]*.*

      If you specify an asterisk (*)  for each of the three
      components of the module name, the script applies to all
      modules regardless of type and facility. For example, the
      qualifier /RESERVE=[*]*.* says that the script can be used to
      reserve all modules in all facilities.

   No other forms of wildcarding are allowed in the module-name
   parameters to script-type qualifiers.

   When VDE looks for a script to perform some action for a module,
   it always selects the script that is most specific to that
   module. If it can find a script with a fully specified module
   name ([FACIL]MOD.TYP) for the module in question, it uses that
   script. Otherwise, it looks for a script with a matching module-
   name specification of the form [FACIL]*.TYP or [*]*.TYP or
   [*]*.*, in that order. This rule allows you to specify generic
   scripts that apply to all modules or to all modules of a certain
   type, but to override those scripts for specific modules or for
   modules in specific facilities when appropriate.

   Similar rules apply to scripts that are selected by facility.
   A NEW_STREAM script, for example, is invoked for each facility
   in your system when you create a new stream. In this case, VDE
   accepts two forms of facility-name specification on the script-
   type qualifiers:

   o  FACIL

      If you fully specify the facility name, the script applies
      only to that specific facility. For example, the qualifier
      /NEW_STREAM=RMS says that the script can only be used for
      facility RMS when VDE creates new streams.

   o  *

      If you specify an asterisk (*)  for the facility name, the
      script applies to all facilities. For example, the qualifier
      /NEW_STREAM=* says that the script can be invoked for every
      facility in your system when VDE creates new streams.

   No other forms of wildcarding are allowed in the facility-name
   parameters to script-type qualifiers.

   When VDE looks for a script to perform an action for a facility,
   it first looks for a script with a fully specified facility
   name. If no such script exists in the database, VDE selects
   the script with the wildcard in the facility name, provided it
   exists. You can thus specify a generic script that applies to all
   facilities, and then override that script for specific facilities
   when appropriate.

   Generating Command Files in Segments

   Normally, VDE generates the DCL command file to perform some
   action from a single VDE script. In some situations, however, it
   is necessary to generate different "segments" of the DCL command
   file from different scripts. The DCL command file that compiles a
   MACRO module, for example, may need to consist of three segments:

   o  The first segment sets up logical names for the MACRO
      assembler and includes the MACRO command and its qualifiers.
      The MACRO command is ended with the continuation character.
      This segment is the same for all MACRO modules, and the VDE
      script that generates it has the selection template [*]*.MAR.

   o  The second segment contains the name of the module to assemble
      and a plus-list of macro libraries to use with that module.
      This segment of the command file is different for each MACRO
      module, and the VDE script that generates it has a selection
      template of the form [FAC]MOD.TYP.

   o  The third segment inserts the assembled object module into
      an object library and runs VDE/DEPEND to collect dependency
      data. This segment of the DCL command file is the same for all
      MACRO modules, and the VDE script that generates it has the
      selection template [*]*.MAR.

   One VDE script could generate all three segments of the DCL
   command file, but then a separate script is needed for each MACRO
   module in the library. This solution is undesirable because the
   script keywords that generate the first and third segments of
   the DCL command file are the same for all MACRO modules, thus
   wasting space in the VDE database and making it difficult to
   modify the common parts of the scripts. A better solution is to
   have two generic scripts with selection templates [*]*.MAR that
   generate the first and third segments of each MACRO module's
   DCL command file, and to have a small script specific to each
   module to generate the second segment. This solution makes it
   easy to modify the module-independent segments of the keyword
   files because they are derived from just two VDE scripts.

   To allow you to generate different segments of a DCL command file
   from separate scripts, VDE allows you to assign a segment number
   to each script. A segment number is an integer value in the range
   from 1 to 20 that is specified with the /SEGMENT qualifier to the
   CREATE SCRIPT command. When VDE generates a DCL command file from
   scripts, it looks for an appropriate script for each possible
   segment number. VDE selects the script for each segment number
   using the normal script selection rules so that more module-
   specific or facility-specific scripts are favored over more
   generic scripts. After selecting the scripts, VDE interprets
   them in order by segment number to generate the DCL command file.
   If there are no scripts for a given segment, that segment is
   simply omitted from the command file. As a result, you can have
   up to twenty segments in a DCL command file, each generated by a
   separately selected script.

   If you do not specify a segment number for a script, VDE assigns
   segment number 10 to the script. If your DCL command files do
   not need multiple segments, you can thus ignore segment numbers
   and let VDE generate segment 10 (and only that segment) for
   each command file. If you later decide that you need additional
   segments before or after the original segment, you have ample
   segment numbers to choose from in both directions.

   Debugging Scripts

   The INVOKE SCRIPT command is a useful tool for debugging scripts.
   INVOKE SCRIPT allows you to fetch and invoke a specified script,
   and then to examine the DCL command(s) generated by the script.

   For further information on this command, see INVOKE SCRIPT.
 

3  Examples

   1.$ TYPE [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT
     ! Script to compile a C module.
     !
     EMIT "$ SET VERIFY"
     EMIT "$ DEFINE/NOLOG SRC$ ", $DIR(SRC)
     EMIT "$ DEFINE/NOLOG OBJ$ ", $DIR(OBJ)
     EMIT "$ CC/DEBUG/OBJ=OBJ$:/ANA=OBJ$: SRC$:",$MODTYP
     EMIT "$ VDE/DEPEND C OBJ$:",$MOD,".ANA"
     EXIT
     $ VDE
     VDE> CREATE SCRIPT/COMPILE=[RMS]*.C [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT
     %VDE-I-SCRPADDED, script from file DEV$:[MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT;9 added to
      the database
      script to compile module [RMS]*.C (segment 10)
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     In this example, the user first types the script file
     [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C.VDESCRIPT on the terminal. The script contains
     five EMIT keywords followed by an EXIT keyword. The user then
     enters VDE and uses the CREATE SCRIPT keyword to enter that
     script file into the VDE database as the compile script for all
     C modules in facility RMS. The log messages confirm that the
     script was successfully entered into the database.

   2.$ TYPE [MYDIR]SCRIPT_LINK_X.VDESCRIPT
     ! VDE script to generate the DCL commands needed to link module X.EXE.
     !
     EMIT "$ SET VERIFY"
     EMIT "$ DEFINE OBJLIB ", $DIR(OBJ,CODE)
     EMIT "$ LINK/EXE=OBJLIB:X.EXE/MAP=OBJLIB:X.MAP  -"
     EMIT "        OBJLIB:OBJLIB.OLB/INCLUDE=C,OBJLIB:OBJLIB.OLB/LIBRARY"
     EMIT "$ DEASSIGN OBJLIB"
     $ VDE
     VDE> CREATE SCRIPT/LINK=X.EXE [MYDIR]SCRIPT_C
     %VDE-I-SCRPADDED, script from file DEV$:[MYDIR]SCRIPT_LINK_X.VDESCRIPT;2
      added to the database
      script to link module [CODE]X.EXE (segment 10)
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/TEXT/LINK=X.EXE
     Script to link module [CODE]X.EXE (segment 10)
        Text of script:
          1: ! VDE script to generate the DCL commands needed to link module X.EXE.
          2: !
          3: EMIT "$ SET VERIFY"
          4: EMIT "$ DEFINE OBJLIB ", $DIR(OBJ,CODE)
          5: EMIT "$ LINK/EXE=OBJLIB:X.EXE/MAP=OBJLIB:X.MAP  -"
          6: EMIT "        OBJLIB:OBJLIB.OLB/INCLUDE=C,OBJLIB:OBJLIB.OLB/LIBRARY"
          7: EMIT "$ DEASSIGN OBJLIB"

     VDE>

     This example displays the script file SCRIPT_LINK_X.VDESCRIPT
     to show the text of the script. The script consists of two
     comment lines and five EMIT keywords. The EXIT keyword is
     omitted in this case. The user then enters VDE and uses
     the CREATE SCRIPT keyword to enter the script into the VDE
     database. The /LINK qualifier specifies that the script links
     module X.EXE in the current default facility, facility CODE.
     By default, the script's segment number is 10. Finally, the
     SHOW SCRIPT keyword shows that the script can now be displayed
     directly from the database.

   3.VDE> CREATE SCRIPT/NEW_STREAM=* SCRIPT_NEW_STRM.VDESCRIPT
     %VDE-I-SCRPADDED, script from file DEV$:[MYDIR]SCRIPT_NEW_STRM.VDESCRIPT;3
      added to the database
      script to create new stream for facility * (segment 10)
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/TEXT/NEW_STREAM=*
     Script to create new stream for facility * (segment 10)
        Text of script:
          1: ! VDE script to populate the directories for a facility

     This example creates a NEW_STREAM script that will be executed
     for all facilities when a new development stream is created.
     The CREATE SCRIPT keyword creates the script and the SHOW
     SCRIPT keyword displays the script from the database. The
     script generates DCL keywords to copy all object libraries from
     the parent stream's object directory to the current stream's
     object directory. (The "current" stream is the new stream being
     created in this case.) The script also copies all .H files from
     the parent stream's source directory for the facility to the
     new stream's source directory for the facility.

          2: ! out a clear copy of the generation just inserted into a stream

          6: EMIT "$ PURGE ", $DIR(SRC),$MODTYP

     VDE>

     This example defines a script to be executed each time the
     INSERT GENERATION command is performed for any module.
     The SHOW SCRIPT command displays the text of the script.
     The script contains a FETCH keyword that fetches the just
     inserted generation into the SRC subdirectory for the affected
     stream and facility. This operation maintains an up-to-date
     copy of the source file in that directory. Because the /LOG
     qualifier is generated for the FETCH keyword, VDE will print
     an informational log message as the module is fetched during
     script execution. The script also contains an EMIT keyword
     that generates a PURGE keyword to be performed on the file just
     fetched out.

   Requires CRESCRP privilege.
 

3  Description
   Scripts are used to add various user-defined extensions to
   various VDE functions and commands. VDE invokes various scripts
   at various times during VDE processing-see Script Types for
   further information on this.

   Scripts are stored in the VDE database, and specific scripts are
   invoked automatically and transparently at predetermined points.
   When a script is invoked, the commands within the script-see
   Script Keywords for further information on the available script
   keywords-are converted into DCL commands and these DCL commands
   are then executed in a subprocess.

   Within a script, script functions can be used to extract
   information from the VDE database and insert that information
   into the DCL commands generated by by the EMIT script command, or
   into the command line generated by the FETCH command.

   Certain script functions extract names, such as stream, facility,
   module, and type names from the database, while others extract
   the OpenVMS directory specifications of various root directories
   and subdirectories in the VDE library. VDE accepts the following
   script functions:

   o  $FAC

      Returns the facility name of the facility currently being
      processed or of the module currently being processed (for
      example, the module being compiled).

   o  $FACMODTYP

      Returns the full module name of the module currently being
      processed (for example, the module being compiled). This
      module name includes the facility name, module name, and
      type name in the normal VDE module-name syntax, for example
      [FACIL]MOD.TYP.

   o  $FILEDIR

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of the directory
      where the module currently being replaced is located or where
      the module currently being fetched or reserved should go.
      This is either the current default directory or the directory
      specified with the /INPUT qualifier to the REPLACE command or
      the /OUTPUT qualifier to the FETCH or RESERVE command. This
      function is only defined for FETCH, NOKEEP, REPLACE, RESERVE,
      and STAGING scripts.

   o  $FILESPEC

      Returns the OpenVMS file specification of the input file for
      the module currently being replaced or of the output file
      for the module currently being fetched or reserved. This is
      either the default file specification for the command or the
      file specification specified with the /INPUT qualifier to
      the REPLACE command or the /OUTPUT qualifier to the FETCH
      or RESERVE command. This function is only defined for FETCH,
      NOKEEP, REPLACE, RESERVE, and STAGING scripts.

   o  $DIR (dir-symbol [, fac-name [, stream-name]])

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of a specified
      facility subdirectory for a given development stream. The
      dir-symbol parameter specifies the VDE directory symbol
      that identifies the desired subdirectory. Directory symbols
      are defined with the SET DIRECTORY command. The fac-name
      parameter specifies the facility whose subdirectory should be
      retrieved. If this parameter is omitted, the facility of the
      module currently being processed is assumed (for example, the
      module being compiled). The stream-name parameter specifies
      the development stream for which the subdirectory should be
      retrieved. If this parameter is omitted, the default stream is
      assumed.

      You can specify the keyword %CURRENT for the fac-name
      parameter to refer to the facility of the module being
      processed and you can specify %CURRENT for the stream-name
      parameter to refer to the currently set stream. You can also
      specify %PARENT for the stream-name parameter to refer to the
      current stream's parent; this keyword is mainly used in NEW_
      STREAM scripts to refer to the directories of the parent of
      the new stream being created.

      For additional information on directory symbols (dir-symbol),
      see CANCEL DIRECTORY, SET DIRECTORY, and SHOW DIRECTORY.

   o  $FACROOT [(fac-name [, stream-name])]

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of a specified
      facility root directory for a given stream. The fac-name
      parameter specifies the facility whose root directory should
      be retrieved. If this parameter is omitted, the facility
      of the module currently being processed is assumed (for
      example, the module being compiled). The stream-name parameter
      specifies the development stream for which the given facility
      root directory should be retrieved. If this parameter is
      omitted, the default stream is assumed.

      You can specify the keyword %CURRENT for the fac-name
      parameter and you can specify the keyword %CURRENT or %PARENT
      for the stream-name parameter. See the description of the $DIR
      function for the meanings of these keywords.

   o  $LIBROOT

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of the root
      directory of the current VDE library. This is the directory
      that contains the VDE database.

   o  $MOD

      Returns the module name of the module currently being
      processed (for example, the module being compiled). The
      module's facility name and type name are not included.

   o  $MODTYP

      Returns the module name and type name of the module currently
      being processed (for example, the module being compiled).
      The two names are separated by a period, as in MOD.TYP. The
      facility name is not included.

   o  $SCRATCH

      Returns the device and directory for the current process-
      specific scratch directory.

   o  $SESSIONNAME

      Returns the name of the reservation session associated with
      the current RESERVE, REPLACE, or UNRESERVE command. If no
      reservation session is used for the command, this function
      returns the null string. This function is only defined for
      NOKEEP, REPLACE, RESERVE, STAGING, and UNRESERVE scripts.

   o  $SESSIONNUM

      Returns the unique session number of the reservation session
      associated with the current RESERVE, REPLACE, or UNRESERVE
      command. The session number is returned as a decimal integer
      value. If no reservation session is used for the command, this
      function returns the number 0. This function is only defined
      for NOKEEP, REPLACE, RESERVE, STAGING, and UNRESERVE scripts.

   o  $STAGEDEST

      Returns the destination directory or file specification
      for a file being copied to a staging directory while being
      queued for replacement. If the input file to the REPLACE
      command has the same file name and type as the VDE module
      being replaced, the $STAGEDEST function returns the OpenVMS
      directory specification of the staging directory into which
      the file should be copied. If the input file has a different
      file name or type than the VDE module, which can happen if
      a file name is specified with the /INPUT qualifier, then
      the $STAGEDEST function returns the staging area directory
      specification concatenated with the VDE module name and type.

      The $STAGEDEST function is used to specify the destination
      parameter of the staging script COPY command that copies the
      input file into the staging area. By leaving the file name off
      this parameter when the name of the input file is not being
      changed (the typical case), this function ensures that the
      COPY command preserves the file's creation date and time. This
      function is only defined for STAGING scripts.

   o  $STAGEDIR

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of the staging
      directory for the module currently being replaced. Staging
      directories are used to hold files for queued replacements,
      and this function is only defined for STAGING scripts.

   o  $STAGEROOT

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of the staging
      area root directory for the VDE library. (Staging areas hold
      files for queued replacements.)

   o  $STREAM

      Returns the name of the default development stream (for
      example, the stream being created or the stream for which a
      build job is being run.)

   o  $STRMDIR (dir-symbol [, stream-name])

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of a specified
      stream subdirectory for a given development stream. The dir-
      symbol parameter specifies the VDE directory symbol that
      identifies the desired subdirectory. Directory symbols are
      defined with the SET DIRECTORY command. The stream-name
      parameter specifies the stream whose subdirectory should be
      retrieved. If this parameter is omitted, the default stream is
      assumed.

      You can specify the keyword %CURRENT or %PARENT for the
      stream-name parameter. See the description of the $DIR
      function for the meanings of these keywords. For additional
      information on directory symbols (dir-symbol), see CANCEL
      DIRECTORY, SET DIRECTORY, and SHOW DIRECTORY.

   o  $STRMROOT [(stream-name)]

      Returns the OpenVMS directory specification of a specified
      stream's root directory. The stream-name parameter specifies
      the development stream whose root directory should be
      retrieved. If this parameter is omitted, the default stream
      is assumed.

      You can specify the keyword %CURRENT or %PARENT for the
      stream-name parameter. See the description of the $DIR
      function for the meanings of these keywords.

   o  $TYP

      Returns the type name of the module currently being processed
      (for example, the module being compiled).

   For further information on creating scripts, see the CREATE
   SCRIPT command.
 

2  Types
   This section contains the types of scripts supported by VDE.

   Requires CRESCRP privilege.
 

3  Description
   VDE supports many types of scripts. The different types are
   distinguished by the commands or circumstances that cause them
   to be invoked. For example, COMPILE scripts are invoked when
   you enter the COMPILE command or when you run a build job, while
   RESERVE scripts are invoked when you enter RESERVE commands.

   Some types of scripts are optional because the commands that
   invoke them will run correctly without scripts. In such cases,
   the script is there only to allow you to specify optional
   additional processing for the command. The RESERVE command, for
   example, does not need RESERVE scripts to work correctly, but
   if you want the RESERVE command to send mail to selected users
   whenever someone reserves a module, you must use a RESERVE script
   to perform that action. Other types of scripts are mandatory. For
   example, VDE does not know how to compile, copy, or link modules
   unless you specify how with the appropriate scripts. The COMPILE,
   COPY, LINK, and BUILD commands thus require such scripts to be
   defined.

   Most scripts are executed in logical isolation from other
   scripts, and are called in response to a particular command
   or request. If a particular operation results in multiple
   propogations or similar operations, certain scripts are invoked
   once for each propogation.

   A few script types, such as the BUILD, COMPILE and LINK scripts,
   operate as a group. The BUILD script can be used to set up
   DCL global symbols or logical names that are used as input to
   subsequent COMPILE or LINK scripts. As partial builds can invoke
   a subset of all available COMPILE and LINK scripts, DCL global
   symbols and logical names that are used as inputs into any
   COMPILE and LINK scripts should only be equated or defined in
   the BUILD script.

   You specify the type of a script with a qualifier. For the CREATE
   SCRIPT command, you must specify one such qualifier.

   Script Types lists and describes the various script types
   accepted by VDE:

   Table 1-5 Script Types

   Script Type  Description

   BUILD
                The BUILD script sets up optional build-job
                definitions. Any DCL symbols equated in a BUILD
                script must be set up as global symbols if they
                are to remain visible to subsequent COMPILE and
                LINK scripts. DCL symbols required as inputs to
                COMPILE and LINK scripts should be defined only
                in the BUILD script, as any partial builds may not
                execute a particular subset of the COMPILE or LINK
                scripts. This script is executed at the start of
                each build-job process.
   COMPILE
                The COMPILE script contains the command(s) used to
                compile a module. DCL symbols required as inputs
                to compile and link scripts should be defined only
                in the BUILD script, as any partial builds may not
                execute a particular subset of the COMPILE or LINK
                scripts. COMPILE scripts are invoked during builds,
                and by an explicit COMPILE command.
   COPY
                The copy command is used to copy a module. The
                COPY script is called as part of a build job, and
                is called as part of the processing of the COPY
                command.
   CREATE_FACILITY
                The CREATE_FACILITY script contains the command(s)
                to be executed when a facility is created.
   DELETE_GENERATION
                The DELETE_GENERATION script performs optional
                processing for the DELETE GENERATION command.
   FETCH
                The FETCH script performs optional processing for
                the FETCH command.
   INSERT_GENERATION
                The INSERT_GENERATION script performs optional
                processing for the INSERT GENERATION command.
   LINK
                The link script links a module. DCL symbols required
                as inputs to compile and link scripts should be
                defined only in the build script, as any partial
                builds may not execute a particular subset of the
                compile or link scripts. This script is called by
                build jobs and by the LINK command.
   NEW_STREAM
                The new-stream script copies files for a particular
                facility from the parent stream into a new stream.
                This script is called when a new stream is created.
   NOKEEP
                The nokeep script performs optional processing
                for the REPLACE command. Specifically, the nokeep
                script is called when the REPLACE/NOKEEP command is
                specified.
   REPLACE
                The replace script performs optional processing for
                the REPLACE or (on queued-replacement streams) the
                PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.

                If stream-specific reference directories are
                required, this script can be used to update the
                reference directory on each replacement.
   RESERVE
                The reserve script performs optional processing when
                a RESERVE command is entered.

                Should notification of a reservation be required,
                a site-specific reserve script can be coded to send
                mail.
   SET_FACILITY
                The set-facility script performs optional processing
                for the SET FACILITY command.
   SET_STREAM
                The set-stream script performs optional processing
                for the SET STREAM command.
   STAGING
                The staging script copies a source file to a staging
                area for the REPLACE command when the replacement is
                queued.
   UNRESERVE
                The unreserve script performs optional processing
                for the UNRESERVE command.

   For other script-related commands, see CREATE SCRIPT, DELETE
   SCRIPT, EXTRACT SCRIPT, INVOKE SCRIPT, MODIFY SCRIPT, and SHOW
   SCRIPT.
 

1  SET
 

2  ARCHITECTURE
   Sets...

   ARCHITECTURE support is not fully implemented.

   Format

     SET ARCHITECTURE  arch-name
 

3  Parameter
 

arch-name

   The name of the architecture to be set. This name may be up to 39
   characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

3  Description
   Under Construction...
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET ARCHITECTURE VAXPDP
     VDE>

     Under Construction...
 

2  CONTEXT
   Establishes the context of the current VDE session or the default
   context for future VDE sessions. A context can be used to specify
   the default development stream, default architecture and default
   facility for a VDE session.

   Format

     SET CONTEXT  ctx-name
 

3  Parameter
 

ctx-name

   Specifies the context for the current VDE session or the default
   context for future VDE sessions. The parameter must be the name
   of an existing public or private context in the VDE database.
 

3  Description
   This command establishes a context for the current VDE session
   or establishes the default context for future sessions. A context
   sets the following two defaults:

   o  the default development stream for the VDE session

   o  the default facility for the session

   Using a SET CONTEXT command is equivalent to using individual SET
   STREAM and SET FACILITY commands to establish the same settings.

   If you specify the /DEFAULT qualifier, the context becomes the
   default for future VDE sessions and VDE records that setting
   in the database. The context of the current session does not
   change. If you do not specify the /DEFAULT qualifier, the command
   establishes the context for the current VDE session.

   To display contexts, use the SHOW CONTEXT command.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/DEFAULT

   Establishes the specified context as the default context for
   future VDE sessions. The context of the current session is not
   changed.

   If you do not use this qualifier, the specified context becomes
   the context for your current session.
 

/PRIVATE

   Specifies whether the context to set is a private or public
   context. The /PRIVATE qualifier specifies that the context is
   an existing private context. The /PUBLIC qualifier specifies that
   the context is an existing public context.

   Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /PRIVATE is the default.
 

/PUBLIC

   Specifies whether the context to set is a private or public
   context. The /PRIVATE qualifier specifies that the context is
   an existing private context. The /PUBLIC qualifier specifies that
   the context is an existing public context.

   Of /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /PRIVATE is the default.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET CONTEXT BUGFIXES
     VDE> SHOW DEFAULTS
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     Default directory is DEV$:[SMITH]
     Context BUGFIXES (private to user SMITH)
        Default stream is V2.2-BL1
        Default facility is RMS

     VDE>

     The SET CONTEXT command takes the defaults for the current
     VDE session from context BUGFIXES. The SHOW DEFAULTS command
     confirms that those defaults have been established for the
     session.

   2.VDE> SET CONTEXT/DEFAULT FOO
     VDE>

     This command makes context FOO the default context for the
     current user's future VDE sessions.
 

2  DEVELOPER
   Sets or modifies the current settings of the developer flags.

   Use this command only under the explicit direction of, and with
   the assistance of, a VDE developer.

2  DIRECTORY
   Creates a directory template in the VDE database. Directory
   templates determine what disk directories VDE creates when
   creating new streams and facilities and various disk storage
   areas.

   Requires CRESTRM privilege.

   Format

     SET DIRECTORY  dir-spec
 

3  Parameter
 

dir-spec

   Specifies a OpenVMS directory specification for the new directory
   template. This parameter may specify an absolute or a relative
   directory specification. An absolute directory specification
   is a fully specified OpenVMS directory name and follows the
   normal syntax for such names. You use an absolute directory
   specification when you want to decide the exact disk location
   for a directory in the VDE library. For example, you may want
   to locate a new stream's root directory on a specific disk
   before VDE creates the stream's directory tree. The parameter
   DEV:[DIRNAM.FOO] is an example of an absolute directory
   specification.

   A relative directory specification begins with a left bracket
   and a period ([.),  then contains one or more subdirectory
   names separated by periods, and ends with a right bracket
   (]).  This directory specification is concatenated to the name
   of the appropriate root directory to form a full directory
   specification. You use a relative directory specification to
   specify a subdirectory name that VDE should use relative to some
   root directory. The directory specification [.SRC], for example,
   can be used to specify that a facility subdirectory named SRC
   should be created within each facility's root directory.
 

3  Description
   The SET DIRECTORY command creates a new "directory template"
   in the VDE database. A directory template specifies the name
   that VDE should assign to each disk directory of a certain kind
   when creating directories for new streams or facilities. You
   can create directory templates for stream root directories,
   facility root directories, facility subdirectories, the library's
   delta-file root directory, and the library's staging-area root
   directory for queued replacements. (The library root directory
   is created when you create the library and cannot be changed
   thereafter.)

   The SET DIRECTORY command does not itself create new directories;
   it only stores the new directory template in the VDE database.
   VDE does not use the template to create new disk directories
   until a subsequent CREATE STREAM or CREATE FACILITY command
   creates the directory tree for a new stream or facility. The
   CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command uses directory templates to create
   directories for an existing stream or facility.

   Unless the new template is for the library's delta files or its
   staging area, it is only defined for the default development
   stream. However, directory templates are inherited by the
   stream's future descendants and are used to create the disk
   directories for those descendants. They are also used to create
   directory trees for new facilities in the default stream.

   If you want to create directory templates for a new stream,
   you can specify the templates for the parent stream, in which
   case they are automatically applied to all child streams. You
   must then enter the SET DIRECTORY command before you enter the
   CREATE STREAM command for the new stream. Alternatively, you can
   create the new stream with the /DEFER qualifier on the CREATE
   STREAM command. This qualifier suppresses directory-tree creation
   for the new stream. You can then use the SET STREAM command to
   make the new stream the default stream and use the SET DIRECTORY
   command to create the directory templates you want. A subsequent
   CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command uses the new templates (and any
   applicable default rules) to create the directory tree for the
   new stream. The /DEFER qualifier thus defers directory-tree
   creation so that you can enter SET DIRECTORY commands before
   creating the new directory tree.

   You may also want to create directory templates for a new
   facility. If the templates should apply to that facility only,
   you must create the new facility with the /DEFER qualifier on the
   CREATE FACILITY command. This qualifier suppresses directory-tree
   creation for the new facility. You then use the SET DIRECTORY
   command with the /FACILITY qualifier to create the directory
   templates you want for that facility. A subsequent CREATE
   DIRECTORY_TREE command uses the new templates to create the
   directory tree for the facility.

   For additional information on directory creation, and on
   directory symbols (dir-symbol) and directory symbol processing,
   see CANCEL DIRECTORY, SHOW DIRECTORY, and Script Functions.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/DEFER

      /DEFER
      /NODEFER (default)

   The /DEFER qualifier specifies that directory tree creation for
   new streams be deferred when those streams are created. This
   action only applies to new streams for which the default stream
   is the parent. This qualifier should be used when you always want
   an opportunity to alter a new stream's directory templates before
   you actually create its directory tree. The /NODEFER qualifier
   specifies that directory tree creation not be deferred for new
   streams unless the user explicitly uses the /DEFER qualifier with
   the CREATE STREAM command.
 

/DELTA_FILES

   This qualifier specifies the directory template is for the
   location of VDE library's delta files, the location of the CMS
   libraries.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, /STREAM is the default.
 

/STAGING

   This qualifier specifies the directory template is for the
   location of VDE library's staging area directories, where
   queued replacements are stored pending replacement into the CMS
   libraries.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, /STREAM is the default.
 

/STREAM

   Specifies the new directory template is for the default stream
   area. Streams inherit directory templates from their parents, so
   the /STREAM qualifier causes the new directory template to apply
   to all of the default stream's future descendants.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, /STREAM is the default.
 

/FACILITY

      /FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that the new directory template only applies to
   the facility given by the fac-name parameter. This parameter
   may not contain wildcard characters. If both this qualifier
   and the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier are specified, VDE creates a
   directory template for the specified facility subdirectory.
   If the /FACILITY qualifier is specified and the /SUBDIRECTORY
   qualifier is omitted, VDE creates a template for the specified
   facility's root directory.

   If the /FACILITY qualifier is omitted and the /SUBDIRECTORY
   qualifier is specified, VDE creates a directory template for the
   facility subdirectory for all facilities that are not explicitly
   specified in other templates. If both the /FACILITY qualifier and
   the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier are omitted, VDE creates a template
   for the stream or delta-file root directory.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after the directory
   template is created. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These
   messages indicate that the directory template has been added
   to the database and that the database transaction has completed
   successfully.
 

/PROMPT

      /PROMPT
      /NOPROMPT (default)

   The /PROMPT qualifier specifies that users who create new streams
   for which the default stream is the parent be prompted for the
   name of the new stream's root directory. This qualifier should
   be used when you do not want to use the default root directory
   name for new streams, but want the user to explicitly select the
   location of the new stream's directory tree each time (perhaps
   to select a different disk each time). The /NOPROMPT qualifier
   specifies that a new stream should get the root directory
   determined by VDE's default rules unless the user explicitly
   specifies otherwise on the CREATE STREAM command.
 

/REMARK

      /REMARK="string"

   Specifies a remark string to be stored for the new directory
   template. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 132
   characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the
   new directory template that you want stored in the VDE database.
 

/SUBDIRECTORY

      /SUBDIRECTORY=dir-symbol

   Specifies that the new directory template is for a facility
   subdirectory. The dir-symbol parameter specifies the directory
   symbol that you want to associate with the subdirectory. The
   directory symbol must follow normal VDE name syntax. You use the
   directory symbol in VDE scripts to reference the subdirectory;
   see the description of the CREATE SCRIPT command for an
   explanation of VDE scripts. If the /SUBDIRECTORY qualifier is
   omitted, VDE creates a directory template for a facility, stream,
   or delta-file root directory. (The description of the /FACILITY
   qualifier explains how the qualifiers interact to select the
   template to create.)

   When you specify facility subdirectories for delta-files, the
   directory symbol may have a special meaning to VDE. If you
   specify a delta-file subdirectory with the symbol VDE$CMS,
   VDE puts the CMS library for the facility in that subdirectory
   instead of in the facility root directory. If you specify a
   delta-file subdirectory with the symbol VDE$MARKER, VDE puts
   the actual source files for modules that use "marker files" in
   that subdirectory. If you use marker files, you must have both
   a marker-file subdirectory and a CMS-library subdirectory. (The
   description of the /MARKER qualifier to the CREATE MODULE command
   discusses marker files in more detail.)

           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$BLD] (symbol VDE$BLD)

        Directory templates for unspecified facilities:
           Subdirectory:   [.ANA] (symbol ANASYM)

           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$LOG] (symbol VDE$LOG)

        All other directories created using default rules

     VDE>

     This example creates a directory template for a new facility
     subdirectory. The directory specification is [.ANA], which says
     that a subdirectory called ANA should be created within each
     facility's root directory. The directory symbol associated with
     that subdirectory is ANASYM. This symbol is used in VDE scripts
     to reference the subdirectory. The SHOW DIRECTORY command shows
     that the new directory template is stored in the database.

   2.VDE> SET DIRECTORY/FACILITY=RMS [MYDIR.RMS]

        Stream root directory is [.V2_1-1] by default
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$BLD] (symbol VDE$BLD)

        Directory templates for unspecified facilities:
           Subdirectory:   [.OBJ] (symbol OBJ)
           Subdirectory:   [.SRC] (symbol SRC)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$COM] (symbol VDE$COM)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$LOG] (symbol VDE$LOG)

        Directory templates for facility RMS:
           Root directory: [MYDIR.RMS]

        All other directories created using default rules

     VDE>

     This example creates a directory template for the root
     directory of facility RMS. The directory specification is
     [MYDIR.RMS], an absolute directory specification for the root
     directory. VDE will create this directory for facility RMS
     when a subsequent CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command is entered
     for that facility or a new stream is created from the default
     stream. The SHOW DIRECTORY command shows that the new directory
     template is stored in the database.

     The following example shows an example of a VDE library
     creation, including a number of directory-related commands.

2  EDITOR
   Specifies the editor that VDE should use for those VDE commands
   that invoke an editor.

   Format

     SET EDITOR   "editor-string"
 

3  Parameter
 

editor-string

   The DCL command that VDE should spawn to invoke the desired
   editor. This string should include the editor name and any
   desired qualifiers. VDE will append the name of the file to edit
   to this string when invoking the editor.
 

3  Description
   The SET EDITOR command specifies the editor that VDE should
   use when a subsequent VDE command must invoke an editor for
   you. VDE can invoke an editor for you when you review queued
   replacements, for example, or when you create a comment file
   with the ACCEPT or REJECT REPLACEMENT command. In such cases,
   VDE spawns a DCL command to place you in an editing session.
   The spawned DCL command is formed by concatenating your editor
   string, a space, and the name of the file to edit. The editor
   string that you specify with the SET EDITOR command should thus
   give the DCL command that invokes your preferred editor, along
   with any qualifiers that you want for that command.

   VDE maintains two editor strings in memory for the current VDE
   session. One string is used for read-write editing and the other
   for read-only editing. Use the /READ_ONLY qualifier to specify
   the read-only editor string. If you do not specify a read-
   only editor string (or if you specify the null string for this
   case), VDE assumes that the editor you specified with the read-
   write editor string will accept the /READ_ONLY qualifier (most
   Digital editors do). In this case, VDE appends the /READ_ONLY
   qualifier to your read-write editor string to form the read-only
   editor string. For example, if you specify TPU as the read-write
   editor string but no read-only editor, then VDE uses the string
   TPU/READ_ONLY for read-only editing.

   The SET EDITOR command always modifies the read-write or read-
   only editor string for the current VDE session. If you specify
   the /DEFAULT qualifier, the command in addition writes your
   current editor settings to the VDE database to establish your
   default editor strings for future VDE sessions. VDE retrieves
   these editor strings each time you connect to the VDE database.

   If you do not use the SET EDITOR command to declare your
   preferred editor, VDE uses the system default text editor.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/DEFAULT

   Specifies that VDE should write the editor strings for your
   current session to the VDE database and that those strings should
   be your default editor strings for future VDE sessions.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after your editor
   strings are written to the VDE database. The /LOG qualifier
   causes such messages to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier
   suppresses them. These messages, which only appear if you specify
   the /DEFAULT qualifier, indicate that the editor strings have
   been updated in the database and that the database transaction
   has successfully committed.
 

/READ_ONLY

   Specifies that you are establishing the editor string to use for
   read-only editing. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE establishes
   the editor string to use for read-write editing.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET EDITOR "LSEDIT"

     VDE> SHOW EDITOR
     Current editor strings:
        Read-write editor string: LSEDIT
        Read-only editor string:  LSEDIT/READ_ONLY
     VDE>

     This example establishes LSEDIT (which invokes the Language-
     Sensitive Editor) as your read-write editor string. The SHOW
     EDITOR command confirms that this is now your current read-
     write editor string, and it shows that VDE will append the
     /READ_ONLY qualifier to this string for read-only editing.

   2.VDE> SET EDITOR/READ_ONLY "EDIT/EDT/READ"

     VDE> SHOW EDITOR
     Current editor strings:
        Read-write editor string: LSEDIT
        Read-only editor string:  EDIT/EDT/READ
     VDE>

     This example defines the editor string to use for read-only
     editing.

   3.VDE> SET EDITOR/DEFAULT "TPU"

     %VDE-I-EDITUPDATE, default editor definition updated in the VDE database
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>
     VDE> SHOW EDITOR/FULL
     Current editor strings:
        Read-write editor string: TPU
        Read-only editor string:  TPU/READ_ONLY
     Default editor strings:
        Read-write editor string: TPU
        Read-only editor string:  TPU/READ_ONLY
     VDE>

     This example establishes TPU as your editor. Because the
     /DEFAULT qualifier is specified, VDE then writes your current
     editor strings to the VDE database to be used in future VDE
     sessions. The SHOW EDITOR command shows that these settings
     have been established both for the current session and as the
     default for future sessions.
 

2  FACILITY
   Establishes the default facility for the current VDE session. The
   default facility is the facility to which a module is assumed
   to belong when no facility is specified in the module name.
   The default facility also can be assigned with the SET CONTEXT
   command.

   Format

     SET FACILITY  facil-name
 

3  Parameter
 

facil-name

   Specifies the name of the facility that becomes the default
   facility for the current VDE session.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET FACILITY RMS
     VDE> SHOW MODULE MOD1.MAR
     Module [RMS]MOD1.MAR
     VDE> SHOW DEFAULTS
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     Default directory is DEV$:[SMITH]
     Current session context:
        Default stream is MAIN
        Default facility is RMS
     VDE>

     The SET FACILITY command makes facility RMS the default
     facility for the current VDE session. The SHOW MODULE command
     then specifies a module name without a facility name. The
     module is thus assumed to belong to facility RMS. The SHOW
     DEFAULTS command also shows that RMS has been established as
     the default facility in the current session.
 

2  KEY
   Sets and locks the key-definition state for keys defined with the
   DEFINE/KEY command.

   Format

     SET KEY
 

3  Description
   Using the DEFINE/KEY command you can create as many definitions
   for a key as you want. However, each definition of the key must
   be assigned a separate context or state. For example, if you
   create five definitions for the PF4 key you must create five
   different states, one for each definition of the key. If you
   do not specify its state before you process a definition, the
   definition does not take effect.

   The SET KEY command lets you switch from the current state to
   any other state; you then can use the key definitions created for
   that state.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether the system displays a message indicating that
   the key state has been set. /LOG causes such a message to be
   displayed and /NOLOG suppresses it.
 

/STATE

      /STATE=state-name
      /NOSTATE (default)

   Specifies the name of the state to be set. The state name can be
   any alphanumeric string. If you omit the /STATE qualifier or use
   /NOSTATE, the current state is left unchanged.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET KEY/STATE=GOLD

     The SET KEY command in this example sets the key state to GOLD.
     You can now use the key definitions that are defined for the
     GOLD state.
 

2  LIBRARY
   Connects the current VDE session to a specified VDE library.

   Format

     SET LIBRARY  dir-spec
 

3  Parameter
 

dir-spec

   The name of the root directory of a VDE library. The root
   directory is the disk directory that contains the library's
   database. VDE connects the current VDE session to the specified
   library. Use the OpenVMS directory specification format to
   specify this parameter.

   VDE also accepts mnemonic names for the libraries, based on the
   contents of various logical names, and the list of libraries and
   the particular mnemonics can be tailored for individual users,
   for groups of users, and can be defaulted on a system-wide basis.
 

3  Description
   The SET LIBRARY command disconnects your VDE session from the
   current VDE library and connects it to the VDE library whose root
   directory or mnemonic you specify. Subsequent VDE commands then
   act on the specified library.

   To connect to the specified library, the SET LIBRARY command
   first defines logical name VDE$LIBRARY to point to the specified
   directory. It then connects to the library you specified and
   reads its database.

   Based on the information contained in the VDE library database,
   VDE checks to see if you are authorized to use the new library.
   If you are presently listed as an authorized user of the library,
   if the library is set to allow the automatic addition of users,
   or if you should possess the OpenVMS BYPASS privilege, VDE
   permits access, and you can continue your VDE session normally.

   Use of the OpenVMS privilege override is audited, and an
   informational message will be displayed.

   VSC also supports the SET LIBRARY command, but it defaults to the
   OpenVMS VAX library.

                  AUTOMATIC LIBRARY FORMAT CONVERSION

      This command can cause an automatic library conversion if
      the format of the VDE library predates the version of VDE
      currently in use. Automatic library conversion will only
      be performed if the library has the automatic conversion
      option enabled. See the SHOW LIBRARY, CONVERT LIBRARY and
      the MODIFY LIBRARY/[NO]AUTO_CONVERT commands.

   Should the filename, file extension and/or file version number
   be erroneously specified in the parameter, the SET LIBRARY
   command will silently ignore them. Only the device and directory
   specifications are germane to the command; the appropriate
   filename and file extension will be appended to the device and
   directory specification.

   For further information on mnemonics, see the VDE$LIBRARY_
   DEFAULTS, VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS, and VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_
   MNEMONICS logical names. To see the list of mnemonics available,
   and the translations associated with each, use the following DCL
   commands:

   If the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS logical name is defined,
   SET LIBRARY commands are available via keyboard <F17>, <F18>,
   <F19> and <F20> keys. Up to twelve keyboard definitions can be
   present, depending on the number of translations of VDE$LIBRARY_
   DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS present; the first four mnemonics are
   available in the default keypad state, the second four in the
   gold state, and the third four in the blue state.

   $
   $! These logical names can be (re)defined in the site-
   $! specific VDE system startup command procedure, or on
   $! a process-, job-, group- or system-specific basis.
   $
   $! Each logical name is a search list, and the first
   $! entry in VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS corresponds to the
   $! first entry in VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS, and
   $! in VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS, etc.
   $!
   $! Display the list of known/predefined libraries:
   $ SHOW LOGICAL VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS
   $
   $! Display the mnemonic name of each library
   $ SHOW LOGICAL VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS
   $
   $! Display the textual name of each library
   $ SHOW LOGICAL VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS
   $
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET LIBRARY DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     VDE>

     This example connects the VDE session to the VDE library whose
     root directory is DEV$:[PROJDIR]. All subsequent VDE commands
     act on that library until the current library is again changed.
 

2  LOG
   Records VDE input and output in a log file.

   Format

     SET LOG  [file-spec]
 

3  Parameter
 

file-spec

   The name of the log file to be created. All subsequent VDE input
   and output is recorded in this file until logging is disabled.
   File-spec is any valid OpenVMS file specification. The default
   file extension is LOG. If the file specification is omitted, the
   default file name is VDELOGFILE.LOG.
 

3  Description
   The SET LOG command records all VDE input and output in the
   specified log file. Input is recorded as entered. Output is
   recorded with a leading exclamation point (!).  Because the
   exclamation point is the VDE comment character, you can use the
   log file as a command procedure to rerun the logged VDE session.
   Use the CANCEL LOG command to disable input and output logging.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET LOG MYLOG
     VDE> SHOW LOG
     Output logging on file: DEV$:[MYDIR]MYLOG.LOG;1
     VDE>

     The SET LOG command creates the VDE log file [MYDIR]MYLOG.LOG.
     All subsequent commands and their outputs are recorded in this
     file. The SHOW LOG command confirms that output is being logged
     to this file.
 

2  NOVERIFY
   Disables the display (or echo) of command input to the terminal.

   Format

     SET NOVERIFY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SET NOVERIFY command disables the display of command input
   to the terminal. It cancels the effect of the SET VERIFY command.
   The SET NOVERIFY and CANCEL VERIFY commands are equivalent.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET VERIFY
     VDE> SHOW MODULE MOD1.FOR
     SHOW MODULE MOD1.FOR
     Module [FACIL]MOD1.FOR
     VDE> SET NOVERIFY
     SET NOVERIFY
     VDE> SHOW FACILITY FACIL
     Facility FACIL
     VDE>

     The SET VERIFY command enables command echoing. Therefore, the
     SHOW MODULE command is displayed on the terminal before the
     output of the command is displayed. The SET NOVERIFY command is
     also echoed but the command disables the display of subsequent
     commands. The SHOW FACILITY command that follows is not echoed
     on the terminal; only its output is displayed.
 

2  PRIVILEGES
   Enables VDE privileges for the current VDE session.

   Format

     SET PRIVILEGES  priv [, priv...]
 

3  Parameter
 

priv

   The name of a privilege enabled for the current VDE session.
   You can enable only those privileges for which you have
   authorization. To list the privileges for which you are
   authorized, use the SHOW PRIVILEGES/FULL command. For a list
   of privileges, see the top-level VDE_Privileges topic.
 

3  Description
   The VDE privileges enabled for the current session determine the
   VDE commands (and, in some cases, command qualifiers) you are
   allowed to use. For example, you must have the CREFAC privilege
   to use the CREATE FACILITY and MODIFY FACILITY commands.
   Likewise, you must have the USERNAME privilege to replace modules
   for another user using the /USERNAME qualifier of the REPLACE
   command.

   When you start a VDE session, the default privileges listed
   in your user table record in the database become the initial
   privileges for your session. After that, you can set additional
   privileges for the current session using the SET PRIVILEGES
   command if you are authorized to set those privileges. You can
   also cancel privileges for the current session using the CANCEL
   PRIVILEGES command and you can display your current privileges
   using the SHOW PRIVILEGES command.

   Users holding the OpenVMS privilege BYPASS are allowed to
   /OVERRIDE the VDE privileges.

   Use of a privilege override is audited, and an informational
   message will be displayed.

   To alter the default or authorized privileges associated with a
   particular username in the current library, use the MODIFY USER
   username/DEF_PRIVILEGES or MODIFY USER username/AUTH_PRIVILEGES
   command.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Enables all authorized VDE privileges. To alter the library-
   specific authorized privileges for a user, use the MODIFY USER
   username/AUTH_PRIVILEGES command.
 

/DEFAULT

   Resets the VDE privilege mask to the default setting for the
   current user-the default settings can be displayed using the
   SHOW USER username/FULL command. To alter the library-specific
   default privileges for a user, use the MODIFY USER username /DEF_
   PRIVILEGES command.
 

/OVERRIDE

   If the user has the OpenVMS privilege BYPASS enabled, this
   qualifer overrides all VDE privilege restrictions and enables
   all VDE privileges.

   Use of a privilege override is audited, and an informational
   message will be displayed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET PRIVILEGES CREFAC, CREMOD

     VDE> SHOW PRIVILEGES
     Currently set privileges:
           BUILD CREFAC CREGRP CREMOD CRESTEP RESREP
     VDE> SET PRIVILEGES/ALL
     VDE>

     The SET PRIVILEGES command sets the CREFAC and CREMOD
     privileges. The CREFAC privilege allows the user to create
     and modify facilities in the current library and the CREMOD
     privilege allows the user to create and modify modules in the
     library. The SHOW PRIVILEGES command (see SHOW PRIVILEGES)
     confirms that the privileges have been added to the current
     privilege mask.
 

2  PROMPT
   Changes the VDE prompt string from VDE> to a string of your
   choice.

   Format

     SET PROMPT  prompt-string
 

3  Parameter
 

prompt-string

   Specifies the string that is to become the new prompt. If the
   string contains blanks, special characters, or lowercase letters,
   you must enclose it in quotation marks (").
 

3  Description
   The SET PROMPT command lets you to change the VDE prompt to one
   of your choosing.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET PROMPT "Hello Dolly: "
     Hello Dolly:

     In this example, the VDE prompt is changed to "Hello Dolly:".
     VDE uses this string to prompt for the next command.
 

2  STREAM
   Establishes the default development stream for the current VDE
   session. Specifying a stream determines the group definitions
   and module-dependency data VDE uses for the current session:
   group definitions and module-dependency data are stream-specific.
   Establishing the default stream also determines what stream
   commands such as CREATE GROUP, SHOW GROUP, COMPILE, and BUILD
   operate on; those commands execute only in the default stream.

   The default stream also can be specified with the SET CONTEXT
   command.

   Format

     SET STREAM  stream-name
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   Specifies the name of the default stream for the VDE session.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET STREAM V5.3-FT2
     VDE> SHOW DEFAULTS
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     Default directory is DEV$:[SMITH]
     Current session context:
        Default stream is V5.3-FT2
        Default facility is RMS
     VDE>

     The SET STREAM command establishes stream V5.3-FT2 as the
     current stream for the VDE session. The SHOW DEFAULTS command
     shows that V5.3-FT2 has been set as the default stream for the
     session.
 

2  TERMINAL
   Changes the line width and page size that VDE uses to format
   output.

   Format

     SET TERMINAL
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SET TERMINAL command sets the number of characters per line
   and the number of lines per page that VDE uses to format output.
   It does not change the settings of your terminal. The default
   line width and page size are determined by your device type or by
   the last SET TERMINAL command you entered at the DCL level.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/PAGE

      /PAGE=n

   Specifies the number of lines on a page. Normally n is 24 or the
   page size of your workstation, but you can use any value from 11
   to 100.
 

/WIDTH

      /WIDTH=n

   Specifies the maximum number of characters on a line. Typically n
   is 80 or 132 but you can use any value from 20 to 255.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET TERMINAL/WIDTH=132

     This command specifies that the length of a line is 132
     characters.
 

2  VERIFY
   Enables the display (or echo) of command input to the terminal.

   Format

     SET VERIFY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SET VERIFY command enables the display of command input
   to the terminal. This display is useful when you want to see
   the commands issued by a command procedure before they are
   executed. You can disable the display with the CANCEL VERIFY
   or SET NOVERIFY command.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SET VERIFY
     VDE> @X.VDE
     @X.VDE
     SET FACILITY COPY
     SHOW MODULE FOO
     Module [FACIL]FOO.MAR
     VDE>

     The SET VERIFY command enables command echoing. Therefore,
     the next command (@X.VDE) is displayed on the terminal. Then
     a SET FACILITY and a SHOW MODULE command are read from the
     command procedure X.VDE. Both commands are displayed on the
     terminal. The output of the SHOW MODULE command follows the
     echoed command line.
 

1  SHOW
 

2  ARCHITECTURE
   Shows one or more architecture table entries in the VDE database.
   Each architecture table entry...

   ARCHITECTURE support is not fully implemented.

   Format

     SHOW ARCHITECTURE  arch-name [, arch-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

arch-name

   The name of the architecture to be displayed. This name may be up
   to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax.
 

3  Description
   Under Construction...
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Under Construction...
 

/CURRENT

   Under Construction...
 

/FULL

   Under Construction...
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=

   Under Construction...
 

/TOTAL

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW ARCHITECTURE VAXPDP
     VDE>

     Under Construction...
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Displays information about one or more specified build jobs.

   Format

     SHOW BUILD_JOB  [stream-name [, stream-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream. Information about one or more
   build jobs in this stream is displayed. Use the /IDENTIFICATION
   qualifier to specify the build jobs to be displayed. If you do
   not specify this qualifier, information about the most recent
   build job for the stream is displayed.

   You can display build jobs for more than one stream by using
   wildcard characters in the stream name. The percent sign (%)  in
   a name matches any single character in the position it occupies
   and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the
   position it occupies. Build jobs are displayed for those streams
   whose names match the wildcard pattern.

   If you omit the stream-name parameter, VDE displays information
   about one or more build jobs for the default stream.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW BUILD_JOB command displays information about specified
   build jobs. You can specify build jobs with the stream-name
   parameter and the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier. By default, the
   SHOW BUILD_JOB command displays information about the most recent
   build job belonging to the default stream.

   The SHOW BUILD_JOB command displays the following information for
   each build job:

   o  its identification number

   o  its stream name

   o  its status

   Optionally, the command can also show all other information
   available in the VDE database about the build job, including:

   o  the number of build steps in each state (the number of steps
      that are not yet started, are running, have completed with
      errors, and have completed successfully) and the total number
      of build steps in the job

   o  the type of build, full or minimal

   o  the remark string

   o  the name of the person who started the build job

   o  the number of build steps in the build job

   o  the dates and times of transitions for the build job (for
      example, when the job was entered on the execution queue, when
      it started, and when it stopped)

   The command can also display the list of batch queues and process
   counts used to run the build job, and it can show all build steps
   that make up the build job.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BEFORE

      /BEFORE=date-time

   Displays only those build jobs created before the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated using standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the type of information displayed about each build
   job.

   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the build-job identification
   number, the stream name, and status of each build job.

   The /SUMMARY qualifier displays the information provided by the
   /BRIEF qualifier, but it also displays the number of build steps
   currently in each state (that is, the number of steps that are
   not yet started, are running, have completed with errors, and
   have completed successfully) so that you can follow the progress
   of the build job. The /SUMMARY qualifier also prints the total
   number of steps in the build job.

   The /FULL qualifier displays all information in the database
   about the build job except queue information and build-step
   information. (To see queue information, use the /QUEUE qualifier;
   to see step information, use the /STEP qualifier.)

   See the Example section of this command for sample output of the
   /BRIEF, /SUMMARY, and /FULL qualifiers. Of /BRIEF, /SUMMARY and
   /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/SUMMARY

   Determines the type of information displayed about each build
   job.

   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the build-job identification
   number, the stream name, and status of each build job.

   The /SUMMARY qualifier displays the information provided by the
   /BRIEF qualifier, but it also displays the number of build steps
   currently in each state (that is, the number of steps that are
   not yet started, are running, have completed with errors, and
   have completed successfully) so that you can follow the progress
   of the build job. The /SUMMARY qualifier also prints the total
   number of steps in the build job.

   The /FULL qualifier displays all information in the database
   about the build job except queue information and build-step
   information. (To see queue information, use the /QUEUE qualifier;
   to see step information, use the /STEP qualifier.)

   See the Example section of this command for sample output of the
   /BRIEF, /SUMMARY, and /FULL qualifiers. Of /BRIEF, /SUMMARY and
   /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the type of information displayed about each build
   job.

   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the build-job identification
   number, the stream name, and status of each build job.

   The /SUMMARY qualifier displays the information provided by the
   /BRIEF qualifier, but it also displays the number of build steps
   currently in each state (that is, the number of steps that are
   not yet started, are running, have completed with errors, and
   have completed successfully) so that you can follow the progress
   of the build job. The /SUMMARY qualifier also prints the total
   number of steps in the build job.

   The /FULL qualifier displays all information in the database
   about the build job except queue information and build-step
   information. (To see queue information, use the /QUEUE qualifier;
   to see step information, use the /STEP qualifier.)

   See the Example section of this command for sample output of the
   /BRIEF, /SUMMARY, and /FULL qualifiers. Of /BRIEF, /SUMMARY and
   /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=id-range

   Specifies the build-job identification numbers of the build jobs
   to be displayed for the specified stream. The id-range parameter
   can be a single integer value, a range of integers, or a wildcard
   character. If the parameter is a single integer (for example,
   /IDENT=5), VDE displays the build job with that identification
   number. If the parameter is a range of integers (specified as
   two build-job identification numbers separated by a colon as
   in /IDENT=3:5), VDE displays all build jobs with identification
   numbers in that range. Finally, if the id-range parameter is an
   asterisk (as in /IDENT=*), VDE displays all build jobs for the
   specified stream.

   If you specify a zero or negative build-job identification
   number in the id-range parameter, that number is relative to
   the identification number of the most recent build job for the
   stream. For example, if the most recent build job is job 5, then
   /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=5 and /IDENT=-1 is equivalent to
   /IDENT=4.

   If you do not use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, VDE displays the
   most recent build job for the specified stream.
 

/QUEUE

   Displays queue information for the specified build jobs. This
   information includes the name of each batch queue used to run
   the build job, the process count for each queue, and the total
   process count for the build job.
 

/SINCE

      /SINCE=date-time

   Displays only those build jobs created after the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated using standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/STATUS

      /STATUS=(status [, status...])

   Displays only those build jobs that have one of the specified
   status values. Each status parameter must be one of the following
   keywords: NOTQUEUED, QUEUED, RUNNING, SUCCESS, ERRORS, STOPPED,
   SUSPENDED, and TIMEOUT.

   If you specify only one status parameter, the parentheses may be
   omitted.
 

/STEP

      /STEP [=(status [, status...])]

   Displays build-step information for each specified build job.
   For each build step in the build job, this qualifier displays
   the type of the build step (such as compile, copy, or link), the
   name of the module that the step is applied to, and the status
   of the step. If the /FULL qualifier is also specified, the /STEP
   qualifier additionally displays the wait count of each step (the
   number of steps that must complete before this step can execute)
   and the names of the steps that must wait for the current step to
   complete.

   If you specify one or more status parameters, the /STEP qualifier
   displays only those build steps that have one of the specified
   status values. Each status parameter must be one of the following
   keywords: NOTSTARTED, RUNNING, SUCCESS, or ERRORS.

   If you specify only one status parameter, the parentheses may be
   omitted. If you omit the status parameters, all build steps in
   the specified build jobs are displayed.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of build jobs that match the specified
   constraints. These constraints are the stream name, the range of
   build job identification numbers specified by the /IDENTIFICATION
   qualifier, the build job status values specified by the /STATUS
   qualifier, and the time constraints specified by the /BEFORE and
   /SINCE qualifiers. No information about the individual build jobs
   is shown; only the total count is displayed. A separate count is
   provided for each stream-name parameter.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW BUILD_JOB
     Build job 11 for stream MAIN has completed with errors
     VDE>

     This example shows the brief form of the SHOW BUILD_JOB output.
     The build job identification number (11) and stream name (BL22)
     of the build job are displayed, along with the status of the
     job (suspended). Because no stream name or /IDENTIFICATION
     qualifier is specified with the command, the most recent build
     job for the default stream is displayed.

   2.VDE> SHOW BUILD_JOB/SUMMARY
     Build job 11 for stream MAIN has completed with errors
        Number of build steps not yet started:             0
        Number of currently running build steps:           0
        Number of build steps completed with errors:       1
        Number of successfully completed build steps:      4
        Total number of build steps in build job:          5
     VDE>

     This example shows the summary output of the SHOW BUILD_JOB
     command. In addition to identifying the build job, the output
     shows how many build steps are in each state and gives the
     total number of build steps in the job. In this example,
     one step completed with errors and all other steps completed
     successfully.

   3.VDE> SHOW BUILD_JOB/FULL
     Build job 11 for stream BL22 has completed with errors
        Number of build steps not yet started:             0

     VDE>

     This example shows the full output of the SHOW BUILD_JOB
     command for the build job used in the previous example.

   4.VDE> SHOW BUILD_JOB/QUEUE V2.0-3/IDENT=2
     Build job 2 for stream V2.0-3 is not yet queued for execution
        Batch queues to run 20 processes for this build job:
           Submit 3 processes (scaled from 1) on queue QUE_A
           Submit 7 processes (scaled from 3) on queue QUE_B
           Submit 2 processes (scaled from 1) on queue QUE_C
           Submit 8 processes (scaled from 4) on queue QUE_D

     VDE>

     This example displays build job 2 (specified by the
     /IDENTIFICATION qualifier) for stream V2.0-3. The /QUEUE
     qualifier displays the names and process counts of the batch
     queues used to run the build job. A total of 20 processes will
     run the build job, distributed over four batch queues.

   5.VDE> SHOW BUILD_JOB BL22/STEP
     Build job 11 for stream BL22 is not yet queued for execution
        Build steps that are part of the build job:
           Compile step for [CODE]FOO.MAR is not started
           Link step for [CODE]FOO.EXE is not started
        Number of build steps displayed is 2

     VDE>

     This example displays information for the most recent build
     job in stream BL22. The /STEP qualifier displays build step
     information. Two steps are part of this build job: a compile
     step for module FOO.MAR and a link step for module FOO.EXE. The
     number of build steps is also shown.

   6.VDE> SHOW BUILD_JOB/TOTAL */IDENTIFICATION=*
     Number of build jobs for stream *: 14
     VDE>

     The /TOTAL qualifier displays the number of build jobs that
     match the selection criteria, in this example, all build
     jobs for all streams. There are 14 such build jobs in the VDE
     database.
 

2  CONTEXT
   Displays the names and definitions of one or more specified
   contexts. A context can be used to specify the default
   development stream, default architecture and default facility
   for a VDE session.

   Format

     SHOW CONTEXT  [ctx-name [, ctx-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

ctx-name

   The name of a context whose attributes are to be displayed.

   You can display more than one context using wildcard characters.
   The percent sign (%)  in a context name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those contexts whose names match the wildcard pattern are
   displayed.

   If no parameter is specified for the command, VDE displays the
   definitions of all contexts to which you have access. These
   include all public contexts and all of your private contexts.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW CONTEXT command
   can display the following: the name only of each selected
   context; the name and the default settings associated with the
   context; or all information about the context. The command also
   can show the total number of contexts that match a context name
   specification.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Controls whether public, private, or all contexts are displayed.
   The /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to display only your private
   contexts that match the context-name parameter. The /PUBLIC
   qualifier causes VDE to display only the public contexts that
   match the parameter. The /ALL qualifier causes VDE to display
   both your private contexts and the public contexts that match the
   parameter.

   Of /ALL, /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /ALL is the default.
 

/PRIVATE

   Controls whether public, private, or all contexts are displayed.
   The /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to display only your private
   contexts that match the context-name parameter. The /PUBLIC
   qualifier causes VDE to display only the public contexts that
   match the parameter. The /ALL qualifier causes VDE to display
   both your private contexts and the public contexts that match the
   parameter.

   Of /ALL, /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /ALL is the default.
 

/PUBLIC

   Controls whether public, private, or all contexts are displayed.
   The /PRIVATE qualifier causes VDE to display only your private
   contexts that match the context-name parameter. The /PUBLIC
   qualifier causes VDE to display only the public contexts that
   match the parameter. The /ALL qualifier causes VDE to display
   both your private contexts and the public contexts that match the
   parameter.

   Of /ALL, /PRIVATE and /PUBLIC, /ALL is the default.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed about each context.
   The /BRIEF qualifier lists only the type (public or private)
   and name of each context. The /NORMAL qualifier displays the
   name, type, and default settings associated with each context.
   The /FULL qualifier lists the same information as the /NORMAL
   qualifier and also the creation date of the context, a remark
   string, and the name of the user who created the context.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/NORMAL

   Determines the information that is displayed about each context.
   The /BRIEF qualifier lists only the type (public or private)
   and name of each context. The /NORMAL qualifier displays the
   name, type, and default settings associated with each context.
   The /FULL qualifier lists the same information as the /NORMAL
   qualifier and also the creation date of the context, a remark
   string, and the name of the user who created the context.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed about each context.
   The /BRIEF qualifier lists only the type (public or private)
   and name of each context. The /NORMAL qualifier displays the
   name, type, and default settings associated with each context.
   The /FULL qualifier lists the same information as the /NORMAL
   qualifier and also the creation date of the context, a remark
   string, and the name of the user who created the context.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of contexts that match each parameter.
   Other information about the individual contexts is not shown. A
   separate count is provided for each ctx-name parameter. Wildcard
   characters are usually used in the parameter when using this
   qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW CONTEXT/BRIEF
     Context BAR (public to all users)
     Context DEFAULT (private to user SMITH)
     Context DEFAULT (public to all users)
     Context FOO (private to user SMITH)
     Context NEWCTX (private to user SMITH)
     Context PUBCTX (public to all users)
     VDE>

     This example shows the brief form of the SHOW CONTEXT output.
     Only the context names and types (public or private) are
     displayed.

   2.VDE> SHOW CONTEXT PUBCTX
     Context PUBCTX (public to all users)
        Default stream is V2.0-1
        Default facility is EXEC

     VDE>

     This example shows the normal form of the SHOW CONTEXT output.
     The command displays the name and type of context PUBCTX and it
     shows the default settings associated with the context.

   3.VDE> SHOW CONTEXT/FULL/PRIVATE V3RMS
     Context V3RMS (private to user SMITH)
        Default stream is V3.1-FT
        Default facility is RMS
        Context added to database on 19-APR-1989 09:08:20.92
        Context added to database by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Remark: Version 3.1 of RMS code

     VDE>

     The SHOW CONTEXT command displays the full output for private
     context V3RMS.

   4.VDE> SHOW CONTEXT/TOTAL *
     Number of contexts matching name *: 6
     VDE>

     The /TOTAL qualifier displays the total number of contexts
     in the database. Because the /ALL qualifier is specified by
     default, this count includes both all private contexts for the
     current user and all public contexts.
 

2  DEFAULTS
   Displays the defaults for your current VDE session.

   Format

     SHOW DEFAULTS
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW DEFAULTS command displays the name of the current VDE
   library, the current default directory, the current context, the
   default stream, and the default facility. You can establish the
   default stream and facility at one time using the SET CONTEXT
   /DEFAULT command, you can create multiple default contexts using
   CREATE CONTEXT and MODIFY CONTEXT, and you can set individual
   defaults with the commands SET STREAM and SET FACILITY.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW DEFAULTS
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     Default directory is DEV$:[SMITH]
     Context DEFAULT (private to user JONES)
        Default stream is V2.0-1
        Default facility is EXEC

     VDE>

     This example shows that the default stream is V2.0-1 and the
     current default facility is EXEC. These settings come from (and
     are identical to) context DEFAULT, a context private to the
     current user. The current VDE library and the current default
     directory are also displayed.

   2.VDE> SHOW DEFAULTS
     Library LIBNAME in root directory DEV$:[PROJDIR]
     Default directory is DEV$:[SMITH]
     Current session context:
        Default stream is V2.0-1
        Default facility is RMS

     VDE>

     This command shows that the default stream is V2.0-1 and the
     default facility in the current session is RMS. These settings
     do not come from a specific named context because individual
     settings have changed either since the last SET CONTEXT command
     or since the start of the VDE session.
 

2  DEVELOPER
   Shows the current settings of the developer flags.

   Use this command only under the explicit direction of, and with
   the assistance of, a VDE developer.

   Format

     SHOW DEVELOPER
 

3  Description
   Under Construction...
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW DEVELOPER
     Under Construction...
     VDE>
 

2  DIRECTORY
   Displays directory templates for the default stream or for the
   current VDE library's delta files.

   Format

     SHOW DIRECTORY
 

3  Description
   The SHOW DIRECTORY command displays directory templates from
   the VDE database. Directory templates are defined with the
   SET DIRECTORY command and specify the names that VDE should
   assign to disk directories when creating directories for new
   streams or facilities. The SHOW DIRECTORY command displays the
   directory creation flags for the default stream, the template for
   the stream (or delta-file or staging-area) root directory, the
   template for each stream subdirectory, the template each facility
   root directory (if any), and the template for each facility
   subdirectory. You can use the /FACILITY qualifier to limit the
   display to those templates that apply to a specified facility.

   For additional information on directory creation, and on
   directory symbols (dir-symbol) and directory symbol processing,
   see CANCEL DIRECTORY, SET DIRECTORY, and Script Functions.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed for each directory
   template. The /BRIEF qualifier displays the directory
   specification and the directory symbol for each template.
   The /FULL qualifier lists the same information as the /BRIEF
   qualifier, but also shows the creation date of each directory
   template, the name of the user who created the template, and the
   template's remark string.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed for each directory
   template. The /BRIEF qualifier displays the directory
   specification and the directory symbol for each template.
   The /FULL qualifier lists the same information as the /BRIEF
   qualifier, but also shows the creation date of each directory
   template, the name of the user who created the template, and the
   template's remark string.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/DELTA_FILES

   Determines whether directory templates for the library's delta
   files, its staging area, or the default stream are displayed.
   The /DELTA_FILES qualifier specifies that directory templates
   for the VDE library's delta files (CMS libraries) be displayed.
   The /STAGING qualifier specifies that the directory template for
   the library's staging-area root directory be displayed. (Staging
   areas hold files for queued replacements.) The /STREAM qualifier
   specifies that directory templates for the default stream be
   displayed.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, /STREAM is the default.
 

/STAGING

   Determines whether directory templates for the library's delta
   files, its staging area, or the default stream are displayed.
   The /DELTA_FILES qualifier specifies that directory templates
   for the VDE library's delta files (CMS libraries) be displayed.
   The /STAGING qualifier specifies that the directory template for
   the library's staging-area root directory be displayed. (Staging
   areas hold files for queued replacements.) The /STREAM qualifier
   specifies that directory templates for the default stream be
   displayed.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, /STREAM is the default.
 

/STREAM

   Determines whether directory templates for the library's delta
   files, its staging area, or the default stream are displayed.
   The /DELTA_FILES qualifier specifies that directory templates
   for the VDE library's delta files (CMS libraries) be displayed.
   The /STAGING qualifier specifies that the directory template for
   the library's staging-area root directory be displayed. (Staging
   areas hold files for queued replacements.) The /STREAM qualifier
   specifies that directory templates for the default stream be
   displayed.

   Of /DELTA_FILES, /STAGING and /STREAM, /STREAM is the default.
 

/FACILITY

      /FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that only those directory templates that apply to the
   facility given by the fac-name parameter be displayed. If this
   qualifier is omitted, VDE displays directory templates for all
   facilities.

   You can display directory templates for multiple facilities by
   using wildcard characters in the fac-name parameter. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. Directory templates for those
   facilities whose names match the wildcard pattern are displayed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW DIRECTORY
     Directory-creation templates for stream V2.1-1:
        Directory creation flags:
           Do not defer creation of directory tree for substreams
           Do not prompt for root directory for substreams

        Stream root directory is [.V2_1-1] by default
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$BLD] (symbol VDE$BLD)

        Directory templates for unspecified facilities:
           Subdirectory:   [.OBJ] (symbol OBJ)
           Subdirectory:   [.SRC] (symbol SRC)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$COM] (symbol VDE$COM)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$LOG] (symbol VDE$LOG)

        All other directories created using default rules

     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW DIRECTORY
     command. This command shows the directory templates for the
     default stream because the /STREAM qualifier is assumed by
     default.

   2.VDE> SHOW DIRECTORY/DELTA_FILES
     Directory-creation templates for delta files:
        Delta-file root directory is [.VDE$CMS] by default

        All other directories created using default rules

     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW DIRECTORY
     command when the /DELTA_FILES qualifier is specified. The
     command shows the directory templates for the VDE library's
     delta files (its CMS libraries).

   3.VDE> SHOW DIRECTORY/FACILITY=RMS
     Directory-creation templates for stream V2.1-1:
        Directory creation flags:
           Do not defer creation of directory tree for substreams
           Do not prompt for root directory for substreams

        Stream root directory is [.V2_1-1] by default
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$BLD] (symbol VDE$BLD)

        Directory templates for unspecified facilities:
           Subdirectory:   [.OBJ] (symbol OBJ)
           Subdirectory:   [.SRC] (symbol SRC)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$COM] (symbol VDE$COM)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$LOG] (symbol VDE$LOG)

        Directory templates for facility RMS:
           Root directory: [MYDIR.RMS]
           Subdirectory:   [.ANA] (symbol ANA_FILES)
           Subdirectory:   [.COM] (symbol COM)
           Subdirectory:   [.SRC] (symbol SRC)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$COM] (symbol VDE$COM)
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$LOG] (symbol VDE$LOG)

        All other directories created using default rules

     VDE>

     This example shows those directory templates that apply to
     facility RMS. Note that all generic information is shown,
     including the templates for the stream root directory and
     for unspecified facilities, before the templates specific to
     facility RMS are displayed. Templates specific to facilities
     other than RMS are not displayed. In this case, facility RMS
     has templates for an explicitly specified root directory and a
     different set of subdirectories than other facilities. VDE uses
     these templates to create the directory tree for facility RMS
     when you create new development streams.

   4.VDE> SHOW DIRECTORY/FULL
     Directory-creation templates for stream V2.1-1:
        Directory creation flags:
           Do not defer creation of directory tree for substreams
           Do not prompt for root directory for substreams

        Stream root directory is [.V2_1-1] by default
           Subdirectory:   [.VDE$BLD] (symbol VDE$BLD)
              Template added to database on  9-DEC-1989 20:27:58.02
              Template added to database by user SMITH (Jane Smith)

              Remark:

        All other directories created using default rules

     VDE>

     This example shows the full output of the SHOW DIRECTORY
     command. For each directory template, the full output shows
     the date and time the template was created, the username and
     full name of the creator, and the template's remark string. For
     templates that VDE supplies by default, the template creator is
     simply the user who created the VDE library.
 

2  EDITOR
   Display what editor VDE uses for those VDE commands that invoke
   an editor.

   Format

     SHOW EDITOR
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW EDITOR command displays the editor strings that various
   VDE commands use to invoke your preferred editor, either to
   create new files or to display existing files. When VDE invokes
   an editor, it spawns a DCL editing command in a subprocess. VDE
   forms the editing command by concatenating your read-write or
   read-only editor string, a space, and the name of the file to
   edit. The SHOW EDITOR command displays the current read-write and
   read-only editor strings for your VDE session. The command can
   also display your default editor strings for future VDE sessions.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Control whether VDE displays the default editor strings stored
   in the VDE database. The /BRIEF qualifier only displays the two
   editor strings for your current VDE session. The /FULL qualifier
   diplays the editor strings for your current VDE session and your
   default editor strings for future VDE sessions.

   Of /FULL and /BRIEF, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/FULL

   Control whether VDE displays the default editor strings stored
   in the VDE database. The /BRIEF qualifier only displays the two
   editor strings for your current VDE session. The /FULL qualifier
   diplays the editor strings for your current VDE session and your
   default editor strings for future VDE sessions.

   Of /FULL and /BRIEF, /BRIEF is the default.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW EDITOR
     Current editor strings:
        Read-write editor string: TPU
        Read-only editor string:  TPU/READ_ONLY
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the brief output of the SHOW EDITOR
     command.

   2.VDE> SHOW EDITOR/FULL
     Current editor strings:
        Read-write editor string: TPU
        Read-only editor string:  TPU/READ_ONLY
     Default editor strings:
        Read-write editor string: EDIT/EDT
        Read-only editor string:  EDIT/EDT/READ_ONLY
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the full output of the SHOW EDITOR
     command. In this case, the editor strings for the current VDE
     session specify the TPU editor, but the default editor strings
     for future sessions specify the EDT editor.
 

2  FACILITY
   Displays the names and attributes of one or more specified
   facilities.

   Format

     SHOW FACILITY  [facil-name [, facil-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

facil-name

   The name of a facility whose attributes are to be displayed.

   You can display more than one facility using wildcard characters.
   The percent sign (%)  in a facility name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those facilities whose names match the wildcard pattern are
   displayed.

   If you do not specify a facility name or use the /CURRENT
   qualifier, VDE displays all facilities in the current library.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW FACILITY command
   displays either the name of each selected facility, the name
   and remark string of each facility, or the name and all other
   attributes of each facility. The command can also show the total
   number of facilities that match a specified facility name.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed about each facility.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the name of each facility that
   matches the facility name parameters. The /NORMAL qualifier
   displays the name and remark string of each facility. The /FULL
   qualifier lists all information about each facility, including
   its name, its creation date, its remark string, and the name of
   the user who created the facility.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/NORMAL

   Determines the information that is displayed about each facility.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the name of each facility that
   matches the facility name parameters. The /NORMAL qualifier
   displays the name and remark string of each facility. The /FULL
   qualifier lists all information about each facility, including
   its name, its creation date, its remark string, and the name of
   the user who created the facility.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed about each facility.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the name of each facility that
   matches the facility name parameters. The /NORMAL qualifier
   displays the name and remark string of each facility. The /FULL
   qualifier lists all information about each facility, including
   its name, its creation date, its remark string, and the name of
   the user who created the facility.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/CURRENT

   Displays information for the default facility. Do not specify the
   facil-name parameter if you use this qualifier.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of facilities that match each parameter.
   Other information about the individual facilities is not shown.
   A separate count is provided for each facil-name parameter.
   Wildcard characters are usually used in the parameter when using
   this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW FACILITY
     Facility CODE            "Code modules"
     Facility DELETE          "Code for DELETE command"
     Facility EXEC            "VMS Executive routines"
     Facility RMS             "Record Management Services"
     Facility SMG             "Screen Management Package"
     VDE>

     This example lists all facilities in the current VDE library,
     which is the default when no facility name parameter is
     present. The normal form of the output gives the name and
     remark string of each facility.

   2.VDE> SHOW FACILITY/BRIEF
     Facility CODE
     Facility DELETE
     Facility EXEC
     Facility RMS

     output, which shows only the name of each facility.

   3.VDE> SHOW FACILITY/FULL RMS
     Facility RMS
        Facility added to database on  4-APR-1989 14:57:14.12
        Facility added to database by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Facility can be deleted
        Remark: Record Management Services

     VDE>

     This example shows the full output of the SHOW FACILITY
     command.

   4.VDE> SHOW FACILITY/TOTAL %M*
     Number of facilities matching name %M*: 2
     VDE>

     The /TOTAL qualifier displays the number of facilities that
     match the specified parameter. The parameter (%M*)  matches all
     facility names that have an M in the second character position.
     Using the library in the previous example, the command finds
     two such facilities, RMS and SMG.

   5.VDE> SHOW FACILITY/CURRENT
     Facility CODE            "Code modules"
     VDE>

     The /CURRENT qualifier displays the name of the default
     facility.
 

2  FOLD
   Displays the attributes of one or more specified fold records.

   Format

     SHOW FOLD  [mod-name [, mod-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies a module for which fold records are to be displayed.
   The module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the facility
   name is omitted, the module is assumed to belong to the default
   facility. If the type name is omitted, VDE displays fold records
   for all source modules with the specified module name in the
   given facility.

   You can display fold records for more than one module by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies. VDE
   displays fold records for all source modules whose names match
   the wildcard pattern.

   If you omit the mod-name parameter, VDE displays fold records for
   all modules in the default facility.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW FOLD command
   displays either a one-line summary for each fold record or
   all attributes of each fold record. The command can also show
   the total number of fold records that match a specified module
   name. You can select the fold records to be displayed or counted
   with qualifiers that specify various selection criteria. These
   criteria include the fold record's creation date and time, its
   fold identifier, its associated development stream, and the user
   to whom it belongs. Only those fold records that satisfy all
   specified selection criteria are displayed or counted.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BEFORE

      /BEFORE=date-time

   Displays only those fold records created before the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/BRIEF

      /BRIEF (default)
      /FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed about each fold
   record. The /BRIEF qualifier displays a one-line summary for
   each fold record that matches the module name parameters and the
   other selection criteria. The /FULL qualifier lists all database
   information for each fold record.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=fold-ident

   Displays only those fold records with the fold identifier
   given by the fold-ident parameter. The fold identifier is the
   identifier you specified or VDE assigned when you created the
   fold record, usually a small integer value. If this qualifier is
   omitted, VDE displays fold records with all fold identifiers.
 

/SINCE

      /SINCE=date-time

   Displays only those fold records created after the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies the development stream for which fold records should
   be displayed. The stream-name parameter gives the name of the
   stream. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE displays fold records
   for all development streams.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of fold records that match each module-
   name parameter and satisfy the other selection criteria. Other
   information about the individual fold records is not shown. A
   separate count is provided for each mod-name parameter. Wildcard
   characters are usually used in the parameter when using this
   qualifier.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME[=username]

   Specifies the OpenVMS username of a user whose fold records are
   to be shown. If this qualifier is specified, only that user's
   fold records are shown. If the username parameter is omitted,
   only your own fold records are shown. If the whole qualifier is
   omitted, fold records for all users are shown.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW FOLD
     Fold 1 of [CODE]X.FOR;2(2) into stream V1.0            26-JUN-1990 JONES
     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW FOLD command.
     This output gives the fold identifier, the module name, the
     development stream the change should be folded into, the date
     the fold record was created, and the username of the fold
     record's owner.

   2.VDE> SHOW FOLD/FULL
     Fold 1 of [CODE]X.FOR;2(2)
        Module to be folded from stream MAIN into stream V1.0
        Fold record created by user JONES (Jon Jones)
        Fold record created on 26-JUN-1990 12:40:21.90
        Remark: Fix access violation in sort routine

     VDE>

     This example shows the full output of the SHOW FOLD command.
     This output gives all database information for the fold record.
 

2  GENERATION
   Displays current, differential or historical information about
   one or more specified module generations.

   Format

     SHOW GENERATION  [gen-spec [, gen-spec...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

gen-spec

   Specifies a module generation to be displayed. A generation
   specification consists of the following in order:

   o  an optional facility name enclosed in square brackets

   o  a module name

   o  an optional type name preceded by a period

   o  an optional generation number preceded by a semicolon

   An example of a generation specification is [RMS]MOD1.MAR;5.

   If you omit the facility name, module generations from the
   default facility are displayed. If you omit the type name,
   generations for all modules with the specified module name in
   the specified facility are displayed. If you omit the generation
   number, the most recent generation of the module in the specified
   (or default) stream is displayed.

   If you specify a zero or negative generation number, that number
   is relative to the most recent generation of the module in the
   stream specified by the /STREAM qualifier (or the default stream
   if that qualifier is omitted). For example, if the most recent
   generation is generation 5, then generation 0 is the same as
   generation 5 and generation -1 is the same as generation 4.

   If you specify the /GENERATION qualifier, VDE displays the
   generation with the given CMS generation expression and ignores
   the generation number on the gen-spec parameter.

   You can display more than one generation by using wildcard
   characters in the facility name, module name, or type name, or by
   specifying a wildcard on the /GENERATION qualifier. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. An asterisk (*)  in place of the
   generation number matches all generations of a module. Those
   module generations whose names match the wildcard pattern are
   displayed.

   If you omit the gen-spec parameter, VDE displays the most recent
   generation of each module in the default facility.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW GENERATION command displays part or all of the
   historical information stored in the VDE database for each
   selected generation. Unless you use the /GENERATION or /TREE
   qualifier, VDE only displays generation histories for a specified
   (or the default) development stream. The command can also
   show the total number of generations that match a generation
   specification or certain statistics about the generations that
   match a generation specification.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Controls whether generations for source modules, derived modules,
   or all modules are displayed. The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE
   to display only source module generations that match the gen-spec
   parameters. The /DERIVED qualifier causes VDE to display only
   derived module generations that match the parameters. The /ALL
   qualifier causes VDE to display both source module and derived
   module generations that match the parameters.

   Of /ALL, /SOURCE and /DERIVED, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/SOURCE

   Controls whether generations for source modules, derived modules,
   or all modules are displayed. The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE
   to display only source module generation histories that match the
   gen-spec parameters. The /DERIVED qualifier causes VDE to display
   only derived module generations that match the parameters. The
   /ALL qualifier causes VDE to display both source module and
   derived module generations that match the parameters.

   Of /ALL, /SOURCE and /DERIVED, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/DERIVED

   Controls whether generations for source modules, derived modules,
   or all modules are displayed. The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE
   to display only source module generation histories that match the
   gen-spec parameters. The /DERIVED qualifier causes VDE to display
   only derived module generations that match the parameters. The
   /ALL qualifier causes VDE to display both source module and
   derived module generation histories that match the parameters.

   Of /ALL, /SOURCE and /DERIVED, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/BEFORE

      /BEFORE=date-time

   Displays only those generations created before the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed for each generation.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the module name, generation number,
   creating user, and creation date and time of each generation that
   matches the gen-spec parameter. The /FULL qualifier displays all
   attributes of each generation, including its name, generation
   number, creation date, creating user, CMS generation expression,
   and remark string.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed for each generation.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the module name, generation number,
   creating user, and creation date and time of each generation that
   matches the gen-spec parameter. The /FULL qualifier displays all
   attributes of each generation, including its name, generation
   number, creation date, creating user, CMS generation expression,
   and remark string.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/GENERATION

      /GENERATION=gen-expr

   Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression
   given by the gen-expr parameter be diplayed. When this qualifier
   is specified, the generation number specified on the gen-spec
   parameter is ignored.

   /IF_SAME, /IF_DIFFERENT, /GENERATION and /TREE are mutually
   exclusive qualifiers. They also cause VDE to ignore any
   generation number you specify because they always reference the
   latest module generations in the specified streams.
 

/IF_SAME

      /IF_SAME=stream-name

   Displays only those generations that are the same (or different)
   in two streams. These qualifiers select the latest generation
   of each specified module in the stream given by the /STREAM
   qualifier (or your default stream). The /IF_SAME qualifier
   displays this generation only if it is also the latest generation
   of the module in the stream given by the stream-name parameter.
   The /IF_DIFFERENT qualifier displays this generation only if it
   differs from the latest generation of the module in the stream
   given by the stream-name parameter. These qualifiers thus show
   for what modules two developments streams are still the same and
   for what modules the streams differ.

   The latest generations of two streams are considered to be the
   same only if they are the identical generation with the same
   generation expression. VDE determines this from the contents
   of the VDE database, not by comparing the text of the two
   generations.

   /IF_SAME, /IF_DIFFERENT, /GENERATION and /TREE are mutually
   exclusive qualifiers. They also cause VDE to ignore any
   generation number you specify because they always reference the
   latest module generations in the specified streams.
 

/IF_DIFFERENT

      /IF_DIFFERENT=stream-name

   Displays only those generations that are the same (or different)
   in two streams. These qualifiers select the latest generation
   of each specified module in the stream given by the /STREAM
   qualifier (or your default stream). The /IF_SAME qualifier
   displays this generation only if it is also the latest generation
   of the module in the stream given by the stream-name parameter.
   The /IF_DIFFERENT qualifier displays this generation only if it
   differs from the latest generation of the module in the stream
   given by the stream-name parameter. These qualifiers thus show
   for what modules two developments streams are still the same and
   for what modules the streams differ.

   The latest generations of two streams are considered to be the
   same only if they are the identical generation with the same
   generation expression. VDE determines this from the contents
   of the VDE database, not by comparing the text of the two
   generations.

   /IF_SAME, /IF_DIFFERENT, /GENERATION and /TREE are mutually
   exclusive qualifiers. They also cause VDE to ignore any
   generation number you specify because they always reference the
   latest module generations in the specified streams.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/SINCE

      /SINCE=date-time

   Displays only those generations created after the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/STATISTICS

      /STATISTICS=(keyword [, keyword...])

   Computes and displays certains statistics about the module
   generations that match the generation specification parameters
   and any selection qualifiers (such as /SINCE, /BEFORE, or
   /USERNAME) that you specify. The keyword parameters specify what
   statistics to display and how to sort them. The qualifier accepts
   the following keyword parameters:

   o  ALPHABETICALLY-Sort the display alphabetically by facility
      name, module name, or type name. If this keyword is omitted,
      VDE sorts the display in descending order by generation count.

   o  FACILITY-Compute and display the number of generations in each
      facility.

   o  MODULE-Compute and display the number of generations for each
      module.

   o  TYPES-Compute and display the number of generations that have
      each module type.

   If you specify only one of these keywords, the surrounding
   parentheses may be omitted.

   When this qualifier is used, other information about the
   individual generations is not shown. Use selection qualifiers and
   wildcard characters in the generation specification parameters to
   select the generation population for which you want statistics.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that generations for the development stream given
   by the stream-name parameter be displayed. This qualifier thus
   affects the interpretation of generation numbers on the command's
   gen-spec parameter. If this qualifier is omitted, VDE displays
   generations for the default development stream.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of generations that match the gen-spec
   parameters. Other information about the individual generations
   is not shown. A separate count is provided for each gen-spec
   parameter. Wildcard characters are usually used in the parameters
   when using this qualifier.
 

/TREE

   Shows the whole generation tree for each specified module. This
   display shows the CMS generation expression for each generation,
   the date it was created, who created it, and the generation
   remark. It also shows for what streams the generation is the
   latest generation. This is the only display that shows all
   generations of a module regardless of what streams they belong
   to.

   /IF_SAME, /IF_DIFFERENT, /GENERATION and /TREE are mutually
   exclusive qualifiers. They also cause VDE to ignore any
   generation number you specify because they always reference the
   latest module generations in the specified streams.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME[=username]

   Displays only those generations created by a specified user.
   The username parameter gives the OpenVMS username of the user
   whose generations should be displayed. If the username parameter
   is omitted, only generations that you created are shown. If the
   whole qualifier is omitted, generations created by all users are
   shown.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW GENERATION/STREAM=BIRCH
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_A.REQ;2(2)     by user SMITH        on 12-DEC-1989 08:44
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_B.REQ;25(23A2) by user JONES        on  9-DEC-1989 20:34
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_C.B32;14(14)   by user BROWN        on  9-DEC-1989 20:34
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_D.B32;1(1)     by user MORELIKERED  on  9-DEC-1989 20:34
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;8(7E1)   by user JONES        on 29-DEC-1989 13:12
     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW GENERATION
     command. The command displays one line per generation. The
     /STREAM qualifier says to display generations for stream BIRCH.
     Because no generation specification parameter is specified,
     the command shows the latest generation for that stream of each
     module in the default facility.

   2.VDE> SHOW GENERATION MODULE_E.B32;*
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;8(8)     by user JONES        on 29-DEC-1989 13:12
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;7(7)     by user JONES        on 26-DEC-1989 14:00
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;6(6)     by user SMITH        on 19-DEC-1989 15:37

     Generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;2(2)     by user JONES        on 12-DEC-1989 08:35
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;1(1)     by user JONES        on  9-DEC-1989 20:34
     VDE>

     This example displays generations for module MODULE_E.B32 in
     facility RMS. It uses the asterisk wildcard character (*)  in
     place of the generation number. As a result, VDE displays the
     latest generation of the module in the current default stream
     and all previous generations leading up to that generation
     of the module. This display thus summarizes the historical
     development of that module for the default stream.

   3.VDE> SHOW GENERATION [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;8/FULL
     Generation [RMS]MODULE_E.B32;8(8)
        Generation created on 29-DEC-1989 13:12:51.55

        Remark: Add the mumble-fratz feature

     VDE>

     This example illustrates the full output of the SHOW GENERATION
     command. VDE displays all attributes of the specified module
     generation. The generation shown is generation 8 relative to
     the default stream.

   4.VDE> SHOW GENERATION/TREE [RMS]E.B32
     Generation tree for module [RMS]E.B32:

        (1)      18-JUN-1990 17:46:47.60 SMITH "Initial generation"

     VDE>

     This example shows the whole generation tree for module E.B32
     in facility RMS. Generation 4 is the latest generation in
     stream MAIN and generation 1A1 is the latest generation in
     stream HICKORY.

   5.VDE> SHOW GENERATION/TOTAL/SOURCE [RMS]*;*
     Number of generations matching name [RMS]*.*;*: 237
     VDE>

     In this example, the /TOTAL qualifier shows the total number of
     source-module generations in facility RMS. There are 237 such
     generations.
 

2  GROUP
   Displays the names, members, and other attributes of one or more
   specified groups.

   Format

     SHOW GROUP  [group-name [, group-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

group-name

   The name of a source group or build group in the default
   development stream whose attributes are to be displayed.

   You can display more than one group using wildcard characters.
   The percent sign (%)  in a group name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those groups whose names match the wildcard pattern are
   displayed.

   If no group name parameter is specified, VDE displays all group
   definitions for the default stream.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW GROUP command
   displays the names, members, and other attributes of the
   specified source groups or build groups. The /SOURCE or /BUILD
   qualifier determines whether the command displayes source groups
   or build groups. The command can also show the total number of
   groups that match a group-name specification. This command only
   displays group definitions for the default development stream.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the type of information that is displayed for a group.
   The /BRIEF qualifier lists only the names of the groups that
   match the group-name parameters. The /FULL qualifier lists the
   name of each group and also its creation date, its remark string,
   the stream to which it belongs, and the name of the creator of
   the group definition.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the type of information that is displayed for a group.
   The /BRIEF qualifier lists only the names of the groups that
   match the group-name parameters. The /FULL qualifier lists the
   name of each group and also its creation date, its remark string,
   the stream to which it belongs, and the name of the creator of
   the group definition.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/BUILD

   Specifies whether source groups or build groups are displayed.
   The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to display the source groups
   with the specified names. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to
   display the build groups with the specified names. If neither
   qualifier is specified, VDE displays source groups.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/SOURCE

   Specifies whether source groups or build groups are displayed.
   The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to display the source groups
   with the specified names. The /BUILD qualifier causes VDE to
   display the build groups with the specified names. If neither
   qualifier is specified, VDE displays source groups.

   Of /BUILD and /SOURCE, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/MEMBERS

      /MEMBERS
      /NOMEMBERS (default)

   Determines whether the members of the group are listed. The
   /MEMBERS qualifier prints the name of each module that is a
   member of the group. If the /FULL qualifier is also used, the
   /MEMBERS qualifier additionally shows who added the member to the
   group and the date the member was added. The /NOMEMBERS qualifier
   suppresses this output.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of groups that match the group-name
   parameters. Other information about the individual groups is
   not shown. A separate count is provided for each group-name
   parameter. Wildcard characters are usually used in the group-name
   parameters when using this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW GROUP
     Source group ALLMODS
     Source group GROUP-2
     Source group GRPNAM
     Source group GRP_1
     Source group GRP_2
     Source group GRP_3
     Source group GRP_4
     VDE>

     This example illustrates how the SHOW GROUP command without
     parameters or qualifiers lists the names of all source groups
     defined in the default development stream.

   2.VDE> SHOW GROUP/BUILD BLDGRP, BLDGRP-2
     Build group BLDGRP
     Build group BLDGRP-2
     VDE> SHOW GROUP/BUILD BLD*
     Build group BLDGRP
     Build group BLDGRP-2
     VDE>

     In this example, individual build-group names are used as
     parameters to list two build groups, both defined in the
     default stream. The second SHOW GROUP command illustrates the
     use of a wildcard character (*)  to list multiple build groups.

   3.VDE> SHOW GROUP/SOURCE ALLMODS/FULL
     Source group ALLMODS
        Group added to database on  4-AUG-1988 15:15:31.49
        Group added to database by user DOE (John Doe)
        Group defined in stream MAIN
        Remark:

     VDE>

     Here the /FULL qualifier shows when source group ALLMODS was
     added to the database, the name of the user who added it, the
     name of the development stream in which the group was created,
     and the remark string associated with the group.

   4.VDE> SHOW GROUP/BUILD/MEMBERS SYSGRP
     Build group SYSGRP
        Members of the group:
           Module [BUILD_TEST]X.EXE
           Module [BUILD_TEST]Y.EXE
           Module [BUILD_TEST]Z.HLB

     VDE>

     Here the /MEMBERS qualifier lists the names of all modules that
     are members of build group SYSGRP. The facility name, module
     name, and module type of each member are displayed.

   5.VDE> SHOW GROUP/BUILD/FULL/MEMBERS SYSGRP
     Build group SYSGRP
        Group added to database on  4-AUG-1988 15:15:31.49
        Group added to database by user DOE (John Doe)
        Group defined in stream MAIN
        Remark: All images for conversion program
        Members of the group:

              Added by user SMITH on 19-OCT-1988 16:10:40.05

     VDE>

     This example shows the output of the /FULL and /MEMBERS
     qualifiers used together. The output shows all database
     information about the specified group.

   6.VDE> SHOW GROUP/TOTAL *
     Number of groups matching name *: 7
     VDE>

     This example shows how the /TOTAL qualifier displays the number
     of source groups for the default stream that match a given
     group-name specification. In this case, a wildcard character
     (*)  is specified that matches all source group names. The
     default stream thus has a total of seven source groups defined.
 

2  KEY
   Displays the key definitions created with the DEFINE/KEY command.

   Format

     SHOW KEY  [key-name]
 

3  Parameter
 

key-name

   The name of the key whose definition is to be displayed. For a
   list of valid key names, see the DEFINE/KEY command.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW KEY command lists the key definitions created with
   DEFINE/KEY command. When used with the /DIRECTORY qualifier, the
   command lists the states associated with those key definitions.
   Use the SET KEY command to change key states.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Displays all of the key definitions for the current state or for
   the states specified with the /STATE qualifier. If you use the
   /ALL qualifier, do not specify a key name.
 

/BRIEF

      /BRIEF (default)
      /NOBRIEF

   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the key name, key definition, and
   state associated with the specified key. The /NOBRIEF qualifier
   displays any qualifiers associated with the key definition. The
   /BRIEF and /NOFULL qualifiers are equivalent.
 

/DIRECTORY

   Displays the names of all the states for which keys have been
   defined. If you have not defined any keys, SHOW KEY/DIRECTORY
   displays the DEFAULT, GOLD, and BLUE states (the states used by
   the initial key definitions on the VDE keypad).

   You cannot use the /DIRECTORY qualifier with any other SHOW KEY
   qualifiers. The key-name parameter is ignored if you use the
   /DIRECTORY qualifier.
 

/FULL

      /FULL
      /NOFULL (default)

   The /FULL qualifier displays all qualifiers associated with a
   key definition. By default, only the name, definition, and state
   of the key are displayed. The /FULL and /NOBRIEF qualifiers are
   equivalent.
 

/STATE

      /STATE=(state-name[,...])
      /NOSTATE (default)

   Displays the key definitions associated with the specified state
   or states. If you specify only one state name, you can omit the
   parentheses. State names can be any alphanumeric string. State
   names are created with the DEFINE/KEY command.

   If you omit the /STATE qualifier or use /NOSTATE, key definitions
   for the current state are displayed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW KEY KP4/FULL
     DEFAULT keypad definitions:
       KP4 = "SHOW DEFAULTS" (echo,terminate,nolock)

     In this example, the SHOW KEY command displays the complete
     definition of the KP4 key. Using the /FULL qualifier lists the
     qualifiers (/ECHO, /TERMINATE, and /NOLOCK) entered, either
     explicitly or by default, with the SHOW DEFAULTS command when
     the KP4 key was defined.

   2.VDE> DEFINE/KEY/TERMINATE COMMA "SHOW LIBRARY"

     %VDE-I-DEFKEY, DEFAULT key COMMA has been defined
     VDE> SHOW KEY COMMA
     DEFAULT keypad definitions:
       COMMA = "SHOW LIBRARY"
     VDE> SHOW KEY/FULL COMMA
     DEFAULT keypad definitions:
       COMMA = "SHOW LIBRARY"  (echo,terminate,nolock)

     In this example, the first SHOW KEY command is the default
     version of the command: it displays both the definition of
     the COMMA key (SHOW LIBRARY) and the state in which it is
     defined (DEFAULT). The second SHOW KEY command (with the /FULL
     qualifier) additionally displays all qualifiers associated
     with the key definition, which in this example are /TERMINATE,
     /ECHO, and /NOLOCK; the qualifiers either can be explicitly
     stated when the key is defined (as /TERMINATE) or can be
     defaults (as /ECHO and /NOLOCK) of the DEFINE/KEY command.

   3.VDE> SHOW KEY/ALL
     DEFAULT keypad definitions:
       PF1 = "" (echo,noterminate,nolock,state=GOLD)
       PF2 = "Help" (echo,terminate,nolock)
       PF3 = "SET VERIFY" (echo,terminate,nolock)
       PF4 = "" (echo,noterminate,nolock,state=BLUE)
       KP4 = "SHOW DEFAULTS" (echo,terminate,nolock)
       COMMA = "SET CONTEXT BUGFIX" (echo,terminate,nolock)

     This example the SHOW KEY command displays all of the key
     definitions that you created with the DEFINE/KEY command.
 

2  LIBRARY
   Displays the attributes of the current VDE library.

   Format

     SHOW LIBRARY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW LIBRARY command displays the name and root directory
   of the current library and optionally shows information from
   the database-header record of the library. This additional
   information includes the creation date of the library, a remark
   string, the name of the user who created the library, and the
   standard authorized and default privileges for new users of the
   library.
 

3  Qualifiers

     This example shows the full form of the SHOW LIBRARY output.
 

2  LOCATION
   Displays the names of the disk directories that contain
   either the files of the default development stream, the delta
   files of the current library, or the staging areas for queued
   replacements.

   Format

     SHOW LOCATION
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW LOCATION command displays the locations of the disk
   directories that contain the modules that make up your software
   system. You can display the directory locations of all files in
   the default development stream, of the current library's delta
   files (stored in the form of CMS libraries), or of the queued
   replacement "staging area."

   The directories for the default development stream contain
   derived files and clear copies of source files. VDE uses these
   directories when it builds your system. By default, the SHOW
   LOCATION command displays the names of all directories for the
   default stream.

   Each source module in your software system has a delta file. A
   delta file is a compact representation for storing all past and
   present generations of a source module. A delta file is the same
   as a CMS element. The SHOW LOCATION command can display the names
   of all delta-file directories.

   Each facility has a separate disk directory tree for both the
   default stream and the delta files. You can specify that you want
   to display only those directories for a specific facility.

   The VDE library also has a root directory for queued-replacement
   staging areas. Each time a user queues modules for replacement,
   VDE creates a new subdirectory (called a staging area) for that
   queued replacement and copies the modules to be replaced to
   the staging area. The SHOW LOCATION command can show the root
   directory for these staging areas.
 

3  Qualifiers

     This command shows that output logging is enabled and gives the
     name of the log file.

   2.VDE> SHOW LOG
     No output logging
     VDE>

     This command shows that output logging is disabled.
 

2  MEMORY
   Displays information about VDE's memory usage.

   Format

     SHOW MEMORY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW MEMORY command displays information about the memory
   pools that VDE uses. It displays information about the following
   memory areas:

   o  VDE's internal memory pool. VDE uses this memory pool for its
      own dynamic memory needs. VDE allocates memory in this pool
      primarily for command processing, but also uses it for more
      permanent storage, such as storing the names of the default
      stream and facility. The information displayed includes
      the total size of this memory pool, the amount of memory
      allocated, the amount of free memory, and other information.

   o  The size of the LIB$GET_VM and LIB$GET_VM_PAGE memory pools.
      These memory pools are managed by Run-Time Library routines
      and are used by CMS, Rdb, and system components such as RMS.
      CMS, in particular, uses substantial amounts of LIB$GET_VM_
      PAGE memory.

   o  The size of the VDE utility's address space and the amount of
      virtual memory by which the address space can be expanded.

   If you run out of virtual memory when running VDE, the SHOW
   MEMORY command can be helpful in determining where memory is
   being consumed. It is of course also helpful to VDE developers in
   identifying how memory is used.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW MEMORY
     Memory usage statistics:
        Number of bytes in VDE memory pool:       65536
        Number of areas in VDE memory pool:           1
        Number of allocated bytes in VDE pool:     1960
        Number of allocated blocks in VDE pool:      33
        Number of free bytes in VDE pool:         63564
        Number of free blocks in VDE pool:           17
        Number of bytes in VDE pool free list:    63548
        Number of blocks in VDE pool free list:      16
        Number of bytes of temporary memory:       1264
        Number of blocks of temporary memory:        12
        Number of successful LIB$GET_VM calls:          275
        Number of successful LIB$FREE_VM calls:         141
        Number of LIB$GET_VM bytes now allocated:    567120
        Number successful LIB$GET_VM_PAGE calls:         13
        Number successful LIB$FREE_VM_PAGE calls:         0
        Number of LIB$GET_VM_PAGE pages allocated:     1836
        Number of LIB$GET_VM_PAGE bytes allocated:   940032
        First free address at end of P0 space:     0063EE00
        First free address at end of P1 space:     7FDD6200
        Number of pages available for expansion:     182835

     VDE>

     This example shows the output of the SHOW MEMORY command.
     The first part of the output contains information about VDE's
     internal memory pool. This includes the total size of the pool,
     the amount of memory that is allocated, the amount that is
     free, the length of the free list (which should be the same as
     the amount of free memory except for a 16-byte list head), and
     the amount of "temporary memory" allocated. Temporary memory is
     allocated memory that is automatically released at the end of
     the current command.

     The middle section of the output displays information about the
     LIB$GET_VM and LIB$GET_VM_PAGE memory pools. This information
     comes from library routine LIB$STAT_VM. Finally, the last few
     lines give the sizes of the VDE utility's P0 and P1 address
     spaces and the number of pages by which the virtual address
     space can still be expanded before reaching the virtual page
     limit for the process.
 

2  MODULE
   Displays the attributes of one or more specified modules.

   Format

     SHOW MODULE  [mod-name [, mod-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of a module whose attributes are to be displayed. The
   module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period. An example is [FACIL]MOD1.PAS. If no
   facility name is specified, the default facility is assumed. If
   no type name is specified, all modules with the specified module
   name in the given facility are displayed.

   You can display more than one module by using wildcard characters
   in any of the three components of the module name. The percent
   sign (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position
   it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. Those modules whose names match the
   wildcard pattern are displayed.

   If you omit the mod-name parameter, VDE displays all modules in
   the default facility.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW MODULE
   command displays the name of each selected module, the name
   and remark string of each module, or the name and all other
   attributes of each module. The command can also show the total
   number of modules that match a module name specification or
   certain statistics about the modules that match a module name
   specification.

   To obtain generation-related information on one or more modules,
   use the SHOW GENERATION command. See SHOW GENERATION for further
   information.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Controls whether source modules, derived modules, or all modules
   are displayed. The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to display
   only source modules that match the module-name parameters.
   The /DERIVED qualifier causes VDE to display only derived
   modules that match the parameters. The /ALL qualifier causes
   VDE to display both source and derived modules that match the
   parameters.

   Of /ALL, /SOURCE and /DERIVED, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/SOURCE

   Controls whether source modules, derived modules, or all modules
   are displayed. The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to display
   only source modules that match the module-name parameters.
   The /DERIVED qualifier causes VDE to display only derived
   modules that match the parameters. The /ALL qualifier causes
   VDE to display both source and derived modules that match the
   parameters.

   Of /ALL, /SOURCE and /DERIVED, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/DERIVED

   Controls whether source modules, derived modules, or all modules
   are displayed. The /SOURCE qualifier causes VDE to display
   only source modules that match the module-name parameters.
   The /DERIVED qualifier causes VDE to display only derived
   modules that match the parameters. The /ALL qualifier causes
   VDE to display both source and derived modules that match the
   parameters.

   Of /ALL, /SOURCE and /DERIVED, /SOURCE is the default.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed for each module. The
   /BRIEF qualifier displays the name of each module that matches
   the module-name parameter. The /NORMAL qualifier displays the
   name and remark string of each module. The /FULL qualifier
   displays all attributes of each module, including its name,
   creation date, history and notes attributes, and remark string.
   It also indicates whether the module is a source module or a
   derived module.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/STATISTICS

      /STATISTICS=(keyword [, keyword...])

   Computes and displays certains statistics about the modules that
   match the module-name parameters. The keyword parameters specify
   what statistics to display and how to sort them. The qualifier
   accepts the following keyword parameters:

   o  ALPHABETICALLY-Sort the display alphabetically by facility
      name or type name. If this keyword is omitted, VDE sorts the
      display in descending order by module count.

   o  FACILITY-Compute and display the number of modules in each
      facility.

   o  TYPES-Compute and display the number of modules that have each
      module type.

   If you specify only one of these keywords, the surrounding
   parentheses may be omitted.

   When this qualifier is used, other information about the
   individual modules is not shown. Use wildcard characters in the
   module-name parameters to select the module population for which
   you want statistics.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of modules that match the module-name
   parameters. Other information about the individual modules
   is not shown. A separate count is provided for each mod-name
   parameter. Wildcard characters are usually used in the module-
   name parameters when using this qualifier.

   position it occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more
   characters in the position it occupies. Those replacements whose
   names match the wildcard pattern are displayed.

   Do not specify the rep-name parameter if you use the
   /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.

   If you specify neither a replacement name nor the /IDENTIFICATION
   qualifier, VDE displays all replacements in the VDE database.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW REPLACEMENT
   command displays either a one-line summary for each specified
   queued replacement or all database information for each
   replacement. The command can also show the total number of
   replacements that match a specified replacement name.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ACCEPTED

   Specify that only those queued replacements with certain review
   statuses be displayed. The /ACCEPTED qualifier displays those
   replacements accepted by all reviewers. The /REJECTED qualifier
   displays those replacements rejected by at least one reviewer.
   The /IN_REVIEW qualifier displays those replacements that are
   accepted by at least one reviewer but are not yet accepted or
   rejected by all reviewers. The /NOT_REVIEWED qualifier displays
   those replacements not accepted or rejected by any reviewers.

   If one or more of these qualifiers are specified, those
   replacements that have one of the specified status values are
   displayed. These qualifiers can thus be used in combination to
   show replacements of several different status values. If all
   of these qualifiers are omitted, VDE displays all replacements
   regardless of status.
 

/REJECTED

   Specify that only those queued replacements with certain review
   statuses be displayed. The /ACCEPTED qualifier displays those
   replacements accepted by all reviewers. The /REJECTED qualifier
   displays those replacements rejected by at least one reviewer.
   The /IN_REVIEW qualifier displays those replacements that are
   accepted by at least one reviewer but are not yet accepted or
   rejected by all reviewers. The /NOT_REVIEWED qualifier displays
   those replacements not accepted or rejected by any reviewers.

   If one or more of these qualifiers are specified, those
   replacements that have one of the specified status values are
   displayed. These qualifiers can thus be used in combination to
   show replacements of several different status values. If all
   of these qualifiers are omitted, VDE displays all replacements
   regardless of status.
 

/IN_REVIEW

   Specify that only those queued replacements with certain review
   statuses be displayed. The /ACCEPTED qualifier displays those
   replacements accepted by all reviewers. The /REJECTED qualifier
   displays those replacements rejected by at least one reviewer.
   The /IN_REVIEW qualifier displays those replacements that are
   accepted by at least one reviewer but are not yet accepted or
   rejected by all reviewers. The /NOT_REVIEWED qualifier displays
   those replacements not accepted or rejected by any reviewers.

   If one or more of these qualifiers are specified, those
   replacements that have one of the specified status values are
   displayed. These qualifiers can thus be used in combination to
   show replacements of several different status values. If all
   of these qualifiers are omitted, VDE displays all replacements
   regardless of status.
 

/NOT_REVIEWED

   Specify that only those queued replacements with certain review
   statuses be displayed. The /ACCEPTED qualifier displays those
   replacements accepted by all reviewers. The /REJECTED qualifier
   displays those replacements rejected by at least one reviewer.
   The /IN_REVIEW qualifier displays those replacements that are
   accepted by at least one reviewer but are not yet accepted or
   rejected by all reviewers. The /NOT_REVIEWED qualifier displays
   those replacements not accepted or rejected by any reviewers.

   If one or more of these qualifiers are specified, those
   replacements that have one of the specified status values are
   displayed. These qualifiers can thus be used in combination to
   show replacements of several different status values. If all
   of these qualifiers are omitted, VDE displays all replacements
   regardless of status.
 

/BEFORE

      /BEFORE=date-time

   Displays only those replacements queued before the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed about each
   replacement. The /BRIEF qualifier displays a one-line summary
   for each replacement. The /FULL qualifier displays all available
   database information for each replacement. The /MODULE qualifier
   displays the replacement name, the staging directory, the module
   list, and the remark string for each replacement.

   Of /BRIEF, /FULL and /MODULE, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed about each
   replacement. The /BRIEF qualifier displays a one-line summary
   for each replacement. The /FULL qualifier displays all available
   database information for each replacement. The /MODULE qualifier
   displays the replacement name, the staging directory, the module
   list, and the remark string for each replacement.

   Of /BRIEF, /FULL and /MODULE, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/MODULE

   Determines the information that is displayed about each
   replacement. The /BRIEF qualifier displays a one-line summary
   for each replacement. The /FULL qualifier displays all available
   database information for each replacement. The /MODULE qualifier
   displays the replacement name, the staging directory, the module
   list, and the remark string for each replacement.

   Of /BRIEF, /FULL and /MODULE, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/HISTORY

   Specifies that replacement history be displayed. Replacement
   history consists of all past replacements, both immediate and
   queued, that have already been performed; it does not include
   currently queued replacements. Replacement history allows you
   to see a historical record of all past modifications to your
   software system. This information complements the historical
   information available from the SHOW GENERATION command. When
   used with the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, the /HISTORY qualifier
   displays a list of all past replacements in chronological order.

   If you omit the /HISTORY qualifier, VDE displays currently queued
   replacements only.
 

/MODULE

   Displays all modules comprising the replacement.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=id-range

   Specifies that the replacements with the unique Replacement Ids
   given by the id-range parameter be displayed. Do not specify the
   rep-name parameter when you use this qualifier.

   VDE assigns a unique Replacement Id to each immediate or queued
   replacement into the VDE library. VDE assigns Replacement Ids
   in chronological order so that the first replacement into the
   library has Id value 1, the next has Id value 2, and so on. When
   you use this qualifier, all replacements that fit your other
   selection criteria and that have Id values in the range given
   by the id-range parameter are displayed in ascending order by
   Replacement Id. This is the same as chronological order.

   The id-range parameter can be a single integer value, a range
   of integers, or a wildcard character. If the parameter is
   a single integer (for example, /IDENT=5), VDE displays the
   replacement with that Replacement Id. If the parameter is a
   range of integers (specified as two integers separated by a
   colon as in /IDENT=3:5), VDE displays the replacements with
   Ids in that range. Finally, if the id-range parameter is the
   asterisk wildcard character (as in /IDENT=*), VDE displays all
   replacements. To be displayed, each replacement must also fit all
   selection criteria that you specify with other qualifiers.

   If you specify a zero or negative number in the id-range
   parameter, that number is relative to the largest Replacement
   Id value for the VDE library (the latest replacement). For
   example, if the latest replacement has Replacement Id 250, then
   /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=250 and /IDENT=-1 is equivalent
   to /IDENT=249.

   The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier is especially useful when used
   with the /HISTORY qualifier because then it displays all past
   replacements in chronological order.
 

/IN_REVIEW

   Displays all replacement component modules presently undergoing
   review.
 

/NOT_REVIEWED

   Displays all replacement component modules presently unreviewed.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/REJECTED

   Displays all modules comprising the replacement that have been
   rejected.
 

/REVIEWER

      /REVIEWER[=username]

   Specifies that only those replacements for which a given user
   is a reviewer be displayed. The username parameter gives the
   OpenVMS username of that reviewer. If you omit the username
   parameter, only those replacements for which you are a reviewer
   are displayed. If you omit the whole qualifier, replacements for
   all reviewers are displayed.
 

/SINCE

      /SINCE=date-time

   Displays only those replacements queued at or after the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM[=stream-name]

   Specifies that only those queued replacements that are for
   the development stream given by the stream-name parameter be
   displayed. If the stream-name parameter is omitted, replacements
   for the default development stream are displayed. If the whole
   qualifier is omitted, replacements for all streams are displayed.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of replacements that match each parameter.
   Other information about the individual replacements is not
   shown. A separate count is provided for each rep-name parameter.
   Wildcard characters are usually used in the parameter when using
   this qualifier.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME[=username]

   Specifies that only those replacements queued by a given user
   be displayed. The username parameter gives the OpenVMS username
   of that user. If you omit the username parameter, only your own
   replacements are displayed. If you omit the whole qualifier,
   replacements queued by all users are displayed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW REPLACEMENT
     Replacement ANDERSON-1      BIRCH       26-JUN-1990 ANDERSON     Accepted
     Replacement ANDERSON-2      BIRCH       27-JUN-1990 ANDERSON     Not reviewed

     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW REPLACEMENT
     command. This output shows the replacement name, the stream
     name, the date the replacement was queued, the username of the
     user who queued it, and its status.

   2.VDE> SHOW REPLACEMENT/FULL SMITH-1
     Queued replacement SMITH-1
        Replacement queued by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Replacement queued on 27-JUN-1990 15:10:27.20

     This example illustrates the output of the /MODULE qualifier.

   4.VDE> SHOW REPLACEMENT/TOTAL
     Number of replacements matching name *: 4
     VDE>

     This example shows that the /TOTAL qualifier can display the
     total number of queued replacements in the database.
 

2  RESERVATION
   Displays module reservations.

   Format

     SHOW RESERVATION  [mod-name [, mod-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of a source module whose reservation is to be displayed.
   A module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period (for example, [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If the
   facility name is omitted, the default facility is assumed. If
   the type name is omitted, reservations for all modules with the
   specified name in the given facility are displayed.

   You can display reservations for more than one module using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Reservations for the source modules whose names match the
   wildcard pattern are displayed.

   You can also display reservations for multiple modules by
   specifying the name of a source group instead of a module name.
   Source groups are created with the CREATE GROUP command. If you
   specify a group name, each reservation for a module that is a
   member of the group is displayed.

   If you omit the mod-name parameter, VDE displays all module
   reservations for the default facility.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW RESERVATION command displays all existing reservations
   and queued reservation requests for a specified set of modules
   or for all modules in the default facility. A module reservation
   is created with the RESERVE command and gives you the exclusive
   right to modify that module. A reservation is terminated with the
   REPLACE or UNRESERVE command.

   By default, the SHOW RESERVATION command shows reservations for
   all development streams, but the /STREAM qualifier lets you
   see only those reservations for a certain stream. Likewise, by
   default, the command shows reservations for all users, but the
   /USERNAME qualifier lets you see only those reservations that
   belong to a specific user, such as yourself. Other qualifiers,
   such as /BEFORE and /SINCE, lets you additionally restrict the
   set of reservations displayed.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BEFORE

      /BEFORE=date-time

   Displays only those reservations created before the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/BRIEF

      /BRIEF (default)
      /FULL

   Determines the type of information displayed about each
   reservation. The /BRIEF qualifier displays the reservation
   identifier, the name of the reserved module, the reserving
   user, the date of the reservation, and the stream in which the
   module is reserved. This display normally fits on one line.
   The /FULL qualifier displays all database information about the
   reservation; this display requires several lines per reservation.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/SESSION

      /SESSION=session-name

   Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations
   together, typically to group all modules related to a particular
   source code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all
   component modules reserved to be treated as a single entity
   for subsequent replacement operations. A session also allows
   additional modules to be reserved and incorporated into an
   existing session at a later time.

   Displays only those reservations that are members of the
   reservation session given by the session-name parameter. If you
   specify this qualifier, do not specify mod-name parameters on the
   SHOW RESERVATION command.

   Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE,
   MODIFY SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL
   SESSION commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on
   a queued-replacement stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be
   combined into the same session.
 

/SINCE

      /SINCE=date-time

   Displays only those reservations created after the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM[=stream-name]

   Displays only those reservations that were created for the
   development stream given by the stream-name parameter. If you
   omit the stream-name parameter, VDE only displays reservations
   created for your current default stream. If you omit the whole
   qualifier, VDE displays reservations for all streams.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of reservations that match the specified
   module names and usernames. Other information about the
   individual reservations is not shown. A separate count is
   provided for each mod-name parameter.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME[=username]

   Specifies the OpenVMS username of a user whose reservations are
   to be shown. If this qualifier is specified, only that user's
   reservations are shown. If the username parameter is omitted,
   only your own reservations are shown. If the whole qualifier is
   omitted, reservations for all users are shown.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW RESERVATION FOO.MAR
     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]FOO.MAR             SMITH        23-MAR-1989 V5.4
     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]FOO.MAR             JONES        24-MAR-1989 V5.5
     VDE>

     This command diplays the reservations for module FOO.MAR in the
     current default facility, FACIL. The output shows that users
     SMITH and JONES have reserved module FOO.MAR in streams V5.4
     and V5.5, respectively.

   2.VDE> SHOW RESERVATION/FULL
     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]FOO.MAR
        Reservation created on 23-MAR-1989 18:09:51.80
        Reservation created by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Generation 29 (27B2) reserved from stream V5.4
        Expected generation expression at replacement is 27B3
        Concurrent reservations are allowed
        Remark: Fix QAR 23 again

     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]MOD1.PAS
        Reservation created on 24-MAR-1989 18:50:33.18
        Reservation created by user JONES (John Jones)
        Generation 15 (15) reserved from stream V5.5
        Expected generation expression at replacement is 16
        Concurrent reservations are allowed
        Remark: Implement whistle feature

     VDE>

     This example shows the output of the /FULL qualifier. Because
     no module-name parameter is specified, the command displays
     reservations for all modules in the current default facility.

   3.VDE> SHOW RESERVATION/USERNAME=SMITH FOO
     Reservation 1 of [FACIL]FOO.MAR             SMITH        23-MAR-1989 V5.4
     VDE>

     In this example, only reservations of module FOO.MAR for user
     SMITH are displayed. User SMITH has one outstanding reservation
     (reservation 1) of this module.
 

2  SCRIPT
   Displays the type, attributes, and text of one or more specified
   VDE scripts from the VDE database.

   Format

     SHOW SCRIPT
 

3  Description
   Scripts are used to tailor the processing of VDE to local
   requirements. The help text on the Script Commands available,
   and the description of the CREATE SCRIPT command provide more
   complete explanations of the uses and types of scripts available,
   and how particular scripts are selected using the script-type
   qualifiers.

   The SHOW SCRIPT command can be used to display the type, the
   script text, and various other attributes of the specified VDE
   script, or to display a list of of all scripts that match a
   particular module specification.

   The /BRIEF, /FULL, and /TEXT qualifiers determine how much
   information is displayed by the command. The command only
   displays scripts that belongs to the default development stream.
   The /BRIEF and /FULL qaulifiers display information about the
   specified script, and the /TEXT qualifier is used to display the
   contents of the specified script.

   Scripts are specified by their types and, for most types, by
   their module-name or facility-name templates. A compile script
   with the selection template [CODE]*.FOR, for example, is used
   to compile all modules of type FOR in facility CODE. However,
   if there is also a compile script with the template [CODE]X.FOR,
   then that more specific script is used to compile module X.FOR in
   facility CODE while the more generically specified script is used
   for all other Fortran modules in the facility.

   When you specify a module-name or facility-name parameter on a
   script-selection qualifier, the SHOW SCRIPT command interprets
   wildcard characters in that parameter in one of two ways to
   select scripts for display. If the command uses exact matching
   to select scripts from the database, each wildcard character
   in the parameter must exactly match a wildcard character in a
   script's template for the script to be displayed. If the command
   uses wildcard matching, each wildcard character in the parameter
   matches any characters in a script's template.

   With exact matching, the qualifier /COMPILE=[CODE]*.FOR thus only
   displays the one compile script with the module-name template
   [CODE]*.FOR. However, with wildcard matching, the same qualifier
   displays the two compile scripts with templates [CODE]*.FOR and
   [CODE]X.FOR because the wildcard character (*)  in the qualifier
   matches both the asterisk (*)  and the X in the script templates.
   As this example shows, exact matching can at most display one
   script while wildcard matching can display many scripts. Use
   the /EXACT_MATCH qualifier to request exact matching or the
   /WILDCARD_MATCH qualifier to request wildcard matching; wildcard
   matching is the default.

   When you use exact matching, you must specify a script-type
   qualifier to select the script you want displayed. You must
   also specify the script segment number unless the default value
   applies.

   Commands used within scripts are documented in Script Keywords,
   while script functions are in Script Functions, and script types
   are in Script Types. For other script-related commands, also see
   CREATE SCRIPT, DELETE SCRIPT, EXTRACT SCRIPT, INVOKE SCRIPT, and
   MODIFY SCRIPT.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Specifies that all scripts of all types for the default stream be
   displayed. This qualifier may only be used if wildcard matching
   is specified (that is, if you do not specify the /EXACT_MATCH
   qualifier). If no other script selection qualifier is specified,
   this qualifier is used by default.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed for each script.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays the type of each script and the
   module-name or facility-name specification that the script is
   associated with. In addition to the information provided by the
   /BRIEF qualifier, the /FULL qualifier also lists the creation
   date of the script, the name of the user who created the script,
   and the script's remark string.

   The /TEXT qualifier is used to display the contents of the
   specified script.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the script information that is displayed for each
   script. The /BRIEF qualifier displays the type of each script and
   the module-name or facility-name specification that the script
   is associated with. In addition to the information provided by
   the /BRIEF qualifier, the /FULL qualifier also lists the creation
   date of the script, the name of the user who created the script,
   and the script's remark string.

   The /TEXT qualifier is used to display the contents of the
   specified script.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, /BRIEF is the default.
 

/BUILD

   Specifies that the default stream's BUILD script be displayed.
 

/COMPILE

      /COMPILE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's COMPILE scripts matching the
   specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/COPY

      /COPY=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's COPY scripts matching the
   specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/CREATE_FACILITY

   Specifies that the default stream's CREATE_FACILITY scripts be
   displayed.
 

/DELETE_GENERATION

      /DELETE_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's DELETE_GENERATION scripts
   matching the specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/DIFFERENCES

      /DIFFERENCES=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's DIFFERENCES scripts matching
   the specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/EXACT_MATCH

   Specifies the matching mode to use to select scripts for display.
   The /EXACT_MATCH qualifier specifies that exact matching be used
   between the mod-name or fac-name parameter to your script-type
   qualifier and the selection template associated with each script.
   The /WILDCARD_MATCH qualifier specifies that wildcard matching
   be used to select scripts. With exact matching, the SHOW SCRIPT
   command will display at most one script. With wildcard matching,
   it may display many scripts.

   Of /EXACT_MATCH and /WILDCARD_MATCH, the latter is the default.
 

/WILDCARD_MATCH

   Specifies the matching mode to use to select scripts for display.
   The /EXACT_MATCH qualifier specifies that exact matching be used
   between the mod-name or fac-name parameter to your script-type
   qualifier and the selection template associated with each script.
   The /WILDCARD_MATCH qualifier specifies that wildcard matching
   be used to select scripts. With exact matching, the SHOW SCRIPT
   command will display at most one script. With wildcard matching,
   it may display many scripts.

   Of /EXACT_MATCH and /WILDCARD_MATCH, the latter is the default.
 

/FETCH

      /FETCH=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's FETCH scripts matching the
   specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/INSERT_GENERATION

      /INSERT_GENERATION=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NEW_STREAM scripts matching
   the specified fac-name specification be displayed.
 

/NOKEEP

      /NOKEEP=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's NOKEEP scripts matching the
   specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/REPLACE

      /REPLACE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's REPLACE scripts matching the
   specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/RESERVE

      /RESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's RESERVE scripts matching the
   specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/SEGMENT

      /SEGMENT=seg-num

   Specifies the segment number of the script to display. The seg-
   num parameter specifies the integer segment number. If you omit
   this qualifier and request exact matching, VDE displays the
   script with segment number 10. If you omit this qualifier and
   request wildcard matching, VDE displays scripts with all segment
   numbers.
 

/SET_FACILITY

      /SET_FACILITY=fac-name

   Specifies that the default stream's SET_FACILITY scripts matching
   the specified fac-name specification be displayed.
 

/SET_STREAM

   Specifies that the default stream's SET_STREAM script be
   displayed.
 

/STAGING

      /STAGING=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's STAGING scripts matching the
   specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

/TEXT

   Specifies that the text of the specified script be displayed.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of scripts that match the specified script
   type and module-name or facility-name templates. This is the
   number of scripts that would be displayed if you omit the /TOTAL
   qualifier but leave all other qualifiers the same on the command.
   Other information about the individual scripts is not shown.
 

/UNRESERVE

      /UNRESERVE=mod-name

   Specifies that the default stream's UNRESERVE scripts matching
   the specified mod-name specification be displayed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/COMPILE=[*]*.FOR
     Script to compile module [*]*.FOR (segment 10)
     Script to compile module [CODE]*.FOR (segment 10)
     Script to compile module [CODE]X.FOR (segment 10)
     Script to compile module [ACCTNG]*.FOR (segment 9)
     Script to compile module [ACCTNG]*.FOR (segment 10)
     Script to compile module [ACCTNG]*.FOR (segment 20)
     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW SCRIPT command.
     Because this command uses wildcard matching by default, it
     displays all compile scripts whose module-name templates match
     the wildcarded string [*]*.FOR, including scripts with all
     segment numbers. In this example, there are six scripts that
     match these criteria.

   2.VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/EXACT_MATCH/FULL/COMPILE=[CODE]*.FOR
     Script to compile module [CODE]*.FOR (segment 10)
        Script added to database on  9-DEC-1989 20:34:25.44
        Script added to database by user JONES (John Jones)
        Remark: SCRIPT REMARK STRING

     VDE>

     This example shows the full output of the SHOW SCRIPT command.
     The script to compile Fortran modules in facility CODE was
     created by user Jones on the shown date and time. The output
     includes the script's remark string. Because the /EXACT_MATCH
     qualifier is specified, only the compile script with the exact
     module-name template [CODE]*.FOR is displayed.

   3.VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/EXACT_MATCH/TEXT/NEW_STREAM=*
     Script to create new stream for facility * (segment 5)
        Text of script:
          1: ! VDE script to populate the directories for a facility
          2: ! when a new stream is created.
          3: !
          4: EMIT "$ DEFINE/NOLOG OLDOBJ ", $DIR(OBJ,%CURRENT,%PARENT)
          5: EMIT "$ DEFINE/NOLOG NEWOBJ ", $DIR(OBJ,%CURRENT,%CURRENT)
          6: EMIT "$ COPY OLDOBJ:*.OLB NEWOBJ:"
          7: EMIT "$ COPY ",$DIR(SRC,%CURRENT,%PARENT),"*.H -"
          8: EMIT "       ",$DIR(SRC,%CURRENT,%CURRENT)
          9: EXIT

     VDE>

     This example displays a NEW_STREAM script for the default
     development stream. The script applies to all facilities
     (facility *) and its segment number is 5. The /TEXT qualifier
     displays the actual text of the script on the terminal.

   4.VDE> SHOW SCRIPT/TOTAL
     Number of scripts matching specifications: 17
     VDE>

     In this example, the /TOTAL qualifier displays the total number
     of scripts for the default stream. Because no script type is
     specified, this count includes all scripts of all types.
 

2  SESSION
   Displays the names and attributes of one or more specified
   reservation sessions.

   Format

     SHOW SESSION  [session-name [, session-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

session-name

   The name of a reservation session whose attributes are to be
   displayed. You can display more than one session using wildcard
   characters in the session name. The percent sign (%)  in a
   session name matches any single character in the position it
   occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in
   the position it occupies. Those sessions whose names match the
   wildcard pattern are displayed.

   Do not specify the session-name parameter if you use the
   /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.

   If you specify neither a session name nor the /IDENTIFICATION
   qualifier, VDE displays all sessions in the VDE database.

   If you do not specify a session name, VDE displays all sessions
   in the VDE database.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW SESSION command
   displays either a one-line summary for each specified reservation
   session or all database information for each session. The command
   can also show the total number of sessions that match a specified
   session name.

   Sessions are used to group a set of module reservations together,
   typically to group all modules related to a particular source
   code alteration or enhancement together.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BEFORE

      /BEFORE=date-time

   Displays only those sessions created before the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed about each session.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays a one-line summary for each
   session. The /FULL qualifier displays all available database
   information for each session.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed about each session.
   The /BRIEF qualifier displays a one-line summary for each
   session. The /FULL qualifier displays all available database
   information for each session.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=id-range

   Specifies that the sessions with the unique Session Ids given by
   the id-range parameter be displayed. Do not specify the session-
   name parameter when you use this qualifier.

   VDE assigns a unique Session Id to each reservation session
   for the VDE library. VDE assigns Session Ids in chronological
   order so that the first session for the library has Id value 1,
   the next has Id value 2, and so on. Session Ids share the same
   number space as Replacement Ids, so you should expect gaps in
   the Session Ids. When you use this qualifier, all sessions that
   fit your other selection criteria and that have Id values in the
   range given by the id-range parameter are displayed in ascending
   order by Session Id. This is the same as chronological order.

   The id-range parameter can be a single integer value, a range
   of integers, or a wildcard character. If the parameter is
   a single integer (for example, /IDENT=5), VDE displays the
   session with that Session Id. If the parameter is a range of
   integers (specified as two integers separated by a colon as in
   /IDENT=3:5), VDE displays the sessions with Ids in that range.
   Finally, if the id-range parameter is the asterisk wildcard
   character (as in /IDENT=*), VDE displays all sessions. To be
   displayed, each session must also fit all selection criteria that
   you specify with other qualifiers.

   If you specify a zero or negative number in the id-range
   parameter, that number is relative to the largest Session Id or
   Replacement Id value for the VDE library (the latest session or
   replacement). For example, if the latest session or replacement
   has Id 250, then /IDENT=0 is equivalent to /IDENT=250 and
   /IDENT=-1 is equivalent to /IDENT=249.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/SINCE

      /SINCE=date-time

   Displays only those sessions created at or after the specified
   date and time. The date and time can be stated in the standard
   OpenVMS date-time format or can be one of the following keywords:
   YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate
   the date from the time, remember to enclose the entire date-time
   string in double quotes. For further information about specifying
   OpenVMS date-time format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM[=stream-name]

   Specifies that only those reservation sessions created for
   the development stream given by the stream-name parameter be
   displayed. If the stream-name parameter is omitted, sessions
   for the default development stream are displayed. If the whole
   qualifier is omitted, sessions for all streams are displayed.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of sessions that match each parameter.
   Other information about the individual sessions is not shown.
   A separate count is provided for each session-name parameter.
   Wildcard characters are usually used in the parameter when using
   this qualifier.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME[=username]

   Specifies that only those reservation sessions created by a
   given user be displayed. The username parameter gives the OpenVMS
   username of that user. If you omit the username parameter, only
   your own sessions are displayed. If you omit the whole qualifier,
   sessions for all users are displayed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW SESSION
     Reservation session FIX-SORT-BUG     28-JUN-1990 ANDERSON
     Reservation session SMITH-1          25-JUN-1990 SMITH
     Reservation session SMITH-2          27-JUN-1990 SMITH
     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW SESSION
     command. This output shows the session name, the date the
     session was created, and the username of the user to whom it
     belongs.

   2.VDE> SHOW SESSION/FULL FIX-SORT-BUG
     Reservation session FIX-SORT-BUG
        Session created by user ANDERSON (Andy Anderson)
        Session created on 28-JUN-1990 17:49:40.71
        Session is for stream V2.0
        Unique session number is 26
        Reservations in session:
           Reservation 1 of [SYS]SORT.PAS
        Session contains 1 reservations
        Remark: Fix bug in sort routine

     VDE>

     This example shows the full output of the SHOW SESSION command,
     which includes all available information about the session.

   3.VDE> SHOW SESSION/TOTAL
     Number of sessions matching name *: 4
     VDE>

     This example shows that the /TOTAL qualifier can display the
     total number of reservation sessions in the database.
 

2  STEP
   Displays build-step dependency information for the specified
   build steps. Build-step dependency information consists of the
   kind of each build step (compile, copy, or link), the name of
   the module that is compiled, copied, or linked by the step, and
   the names of the modules that are inputs to and outputs from the
   build step.

   Format

     SHOW STEP  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of the module that is compiled, copied, or linked by the
   build step to be displayed. This name consists of an optional
   facility name enclosed in square brackets, a module name,
   and an optional type name preceded by a period (for example,
   [FACNAM]MOD1.PAS). If no facility name is specified, the default
   facility is assumed. If no type name is specified, all build
   steps with the specified module name in the stated facility are
   displayed.

   You can display more than one build step at a time by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those build steps that compile, copy, or link modules whose names
   match the wildcard pattern are displayed.

   If no module-name parameter is specified, VDE displays all
   build steps that compile, copy, or link modules in the default
   facility.
 

3  Description
   The SHOW STEP command displays build dependency information for
   the specified build steps. The command shows the kind (compile,
   copy, or link) of each step, the name of the module that is
   compiled, copied, or linked, and optionally the names of all
   modules that are inputs or outputs of the step. This is the build
   dependency information that the BUILD command uses to perform
   minimal system builds and to determine sequencing constraints
   between build steps. The SHOW STEP command always displays build-
   step information for the default development stream.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/ALL

   Displays compile steps, copy steps, link steps, or all steps
   for the specified modules. The /COMPILE qualifier displays only
   compile steps; the /COPY qualifier displays only copy steps; the
   /LINK qualifier displays only link steps; and the /ALL qualifier
   displays all three kinds of steps.

   Of /ALL, /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, the former is the default.
 

/COMPILE

   Displays compile steps, copy steps, link steps, or all steps
   for the specified modules. The /COMPILE qualifier displays only
   compile steps; the /COPY qualifier displays only copy steps; the
   /LINK qualifier displays only link steps; and the /ALL qualifier
   displays all three kinds of steps.

   Of /ALL, /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, the former is the default.
 

/COPY

   Displays compile steps, copy steps, link steps, or all steps
   for the specified modules. The /COMPILE qualifier displays only
   compile steps; the /COPY qualifier displays only copy steps; the
   /LINK qualifier displays only link steps; and the /ALL qualifier
   displays all three kinds of steps.

   Of /ALL, /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, the former is the default.
 

/LINK

   Displays compile steps, copy steps, link steps, or all steps
   for the specified modules. The /COMPILE qualifier displays only
   compile steps; the /COPY qualifier displays only copy steps; the
   /LINK qualifier displays only link steps; and the /ALL qualifier
   displays all three kinds of steps.

   Of /ALL, /COMPILE, /COPY and /LINK, the former is the default.
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the type of information that is displayed about each
   specified build step. The /BRIEF qualifier displays only the
   type of the build step (compile, copy, or link step) and the
   name of the module that is compiled, copied, or linked by the
   step. The /FULL qualifier displays the same information as the
   /BRIEF qualifier and also lists the names of all input and output
   modules for the build step. It also shows the total number of
   input and output modules for the step.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the type of information that is displayed about each
   specified build step. The /BRIEF qualifier displays only the
   type of the build step (compile, copy, or link step) and the
   name of the module that is compiled, copied, or linked by the
   step. The /FULL qualifier displays the same information as the
   /BRIEF qualifier and also lists the names of all input and output
   modules for the build step. It also shows the total number of
   input and output modules for the step.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/CHANGE_LEVEL

   Displays "change level" values for the inputs and outputs of each
   build step if used with the /FULL qualifier. The change level
   of a module is an integer value that indicates how recently the
   module has been updated for the default stream. Source modules
   are updated by the REPLACE command and certain other commands
   that affect the latest generation of the module for the stream.
   (INSERT GENERATION is an example of such a command.) Derived
   modules are updated when rebuilt with the BUILD, COMPILE, or LINK
   command. Modules that have been updated more recently have higher
   change level values than modules that have been updated less
   recently.

   You can use the change level values to determine whether the
   output modules of a build step are up-to-date with respect to the
   input modules. If the output modules are up-to-date, they have
   the same change level value as the largest change level value
   among the input modules. If some input module has a higher change
   level value than the output modules, those output modules are not
   up-to-date with respect to that input module. As a result, the
   build step needs to be performed to propagate the changes to the
   input module to the output modules. VDE uses this information to
   determine what build steps to perform for minimal system builds.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of build steps that match each specified
   mod-name parameter. Other information about the steps is not
   shown. Wildcard characters are usually used in the mod-name
   parameters when using this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW STEP
     Compile Step for module [CODE]FOO.MAR
     Link Step for module [CODE]FOO.EXE
     Link Step for module [CODE]MOD1.EXE
     Compile Step for module [CODE]MOD1.FOR
     Compile Step for module [CODE]MOD2.FOR
     Link Step for module [CODE]MOD4.EXE
     Compile Step for module [CODE]MOD4.FOR
     Link Step for module [CODE]MOD6.EXE
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the SHOW STEP command without
     parameters or qualifiers. Because no parameter is specified,
     the command displays the default form of its output: all build
     steps for modules in the default facility (facility CODE) are
     displayed.

   2.VDE> SHOW STEP/FULL FOO/COMPILE, MOD1/LINK
     Compile Step for module [CODE]FOO.MAR
        Dependency links for stream V2.1 follow
        Inputs to the build step:
           Module [CODE]FOO.MAR
        Outputs from the build step:
           Module [CODE]FOO.OBJ
        Build step has 1 inputs and 1 outputs

     Link Step for module [CODE]MOD1.EXE
        Dependency links for stream V2.1 follow
        Inputs to the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD1.OBJ
           Module [CODE]MOD2.OBJ
        Outputs from the build step:
           Module [CODE]MOD1.EXE
           Module [CODE]MOD1.MAP
        Build step has 2 inputs and 2 outputs

     VDE>

     This command displays the compile step for module FOO.MAR
     and the link step for module MOD1.EXE, both in the current
     default facility (facility CODE). Because the /FULL qualifier
     is specified, the command displays all dependency links for
     these build steps in the default stream, showing which modules
     are inputs to and outputs from each build step.

   3.VDE> SHOW STEP/FULL/CHANGE_LEVEL A.REQ, D.B32
     Copy Step for module [FACIL]A.REQ
        Dependency links for stream MAIN follow
        Inputs to the build step:
           Module [FACIL]A.REQ with change level 30
        Outputs from the build step:
           Module [FACIL]A.REQ with change level 30 (up-to-date)
        Build step has 1 inputs and 1 outputs

     Compile Step for module [FACIL]D.B32
        Dependency links for stream MAIN follow
        Inputs to the build step:
           Module [FACIL]A.REQ with change level 30
           Module [FACIL]D.B32 with change level 20
           Module [FACIL]B.L32 with change level 39
        Outputs from the build step:
           Module [FACIL]D.$OBJ with change level 39
           Module [FACIL]D.ANA with change level 39
        Build step has 3 inputs and 2 outputs

     VDE>

     This example shows the output of the /CHANGE_LEVEL qualifier.
     The change level value for module A.REQ is 30, and the "up-to-
     date" tag shows that the copy step has been performed since the
     last time module A.REQ was modified for stream MAIN. From the
     perspective of the VDE builder, A.REQ is thus up-to-date for
     the stream and the copy step is not needed for a minimal system
     build. The change level values for module D.B32 shows that the
     outputs of the compile step (with change level value 39) are
     up-to-date with respect to all the inputs to the step because
     the inputs have change level values that are less or equal to
     39. In other words, no input module has changed since the last
     time the step was performed for stream MAIN.
 

2  STREAM
   Displays the names and attributes of one or more specified
   development streams.

   Format

     SHOW STREAM  [stream-name [, stream-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream whose name and other attributes
   are to be displayed.

   You can display more than one stream using wildcard characters.
   The percent sign (%)  in a stream name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Those streams whose names match the wildcard pattern are
   displayed.

   If you do not specify a stream-name parameter, VDE displays all
   streams in the current library.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW STREAM command
   displays the name of each selected stream, the name and remark
   string of each stream, or the name and all other attributes
   of each stream. The command can also show the total number of
   streams that match a stream name specification.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the information that is displayed for each stream. The
   /BRIEF qualifier displays the name of each stream that matches
   the stream-name parameters. The /NORMAL qualifier displays
   the name and remark string of each stream. The /FULL qualifier
   displays the name and all other attributes of each stream.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL, and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/NORMAL

   Determines the information that is displayed for each stream. The
   /BRIEF qualifier displays the name of each stream that matches
   the stream-name parameters. The /NORMAL qualifier displays
   the name and remark string of each stream. The /FULL qualifier
   displays the name and all other attributes of each stream.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL, and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the information that is displayed for each stream. The
   /BRIEF qualifier displays the name of each stream that matches
   the stream-name parameters. The /NORMAL qualifier displays
   the name and remark string of each stream. The /FULL qualifier
   displays the name and all other attributes of each stream.

   Of /BRIEF, /NORMAL, and /FULL, /NORMAL is the default.
 

/DESCENDANTS

   Displays all descendants of each specified stream. This qualifier
   displays the name of each stream created from the specified
   stream (that is, whose parent is the specified stream), the
   descendants of each such child stream, the descendants of those
   descendants, and so on. The display is indented so that all
   streams with the same parent are indented by the same amount
   under that parent.
 

/OPEN

   Specifies that only streams with a certain status be displayed.
   /OPEN specifies that open streams be displayed, /FROZEN specifies
   that frozen streams be displayed, and /CLOSED specifies that
   permanently closed streams be displayed. If you specify a
   combination of these qualifiers, all streams with one of the
   specified status values are displayed. If you omit all three
   qualifiers, all streams are displayed regardless of status.
 

/FROZEN

   Specifies that only streams with a certain status be displayed.
   /OPEN specifies that open streams be displayed, /FROZEN specifies
   that frozen streams be displayed, and /CLOSED specifies that
   permanently closed streams be displayed. If you specify a
   combination of these qualifiers, all streams with one of the
   specified status values are displayed. If you omit all three
   qualifiers, all streams are displayed regardless of status.
 

/CLOSED

   Specifies that only streams with a certain status be displayed.
   /OPEN specifies that open streams be displayed, /FROZEN specifies
   that frozen streams be displayed, and /CLOSED specifies that
   permanently closed streams be displayed. If you specify a
   combination of these qualifiers, all streams with one of the
   specified status values are displayed. If you omit all three
   qualifiers, all streams are displayed regardless of status.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/QUEUE

   Dislays the default batch queues to which build jobs for the
   specified stream are submitted. This information includes the
   name of each batch queue used to run the build job, the process
   count for each queue, and the total process count for the build
   job.
 

/SUCCESSOR

   Displays all successor chains of each specified stream. This
   qualifier displays lists of streams separated by arrows (->)  to
   show how source changes are propagated from stream to stream by
   the REPLACE command.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of streams that match the stream-name
   parameters. Other information about the individual streams is
   not shown. A separate count is provided for each stream-name
   parameter. Wildcard characters are usually used in the stream-
   name parameters when using this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW STREAM

     Stream V2.0-FT         "Version 2 Field Test release"
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the normal output of the SHOW STREAM
     command. VDE lists all streams in the current VDE library (the
     default when no stream name parameter is present) and displays
     the name and remark string for each stream.

   2.VDE> SHOW STREAM/BRIEF
     Stream BASE-LEVEL-3
     Stream V1.0
     Stream V1.0-FT1
     Stream V1.0-FT2
     Stream V1.0-FT3
     Stream V1.1
     Stream V2.0
     Stream V2.0-FT
     VDE>

     This example shows the brief output of the SHOW STREAM command.
     VDE shows the name of each stream, but no more.

   3.VDE> SHOW STREAM/FULL BASE-LEVEL-3
     Stream BASE-LEVEL-3
        Stream created on  4-APR-1989 14:58:16.13
        Stream created by user SMITH (Jane Smith)
        Parent stream is V2.0
        Stream has no successors
        Stream is not part of the main development thread
        Stream cannot be deleted
        CMS class is not maintained for stream
        Replacements are immediate for stream

        Default build-step delay interval:     0 00:00:03.22
        Default build-job timeout interval:    0 00:45:05.00
        Remark: Base level 3 for version 2.1

     VDE>

     This example shows the full output of the SHOW STREAM command.

   4.VDE> SHOW STREAM/TOTAL V*
     Number of streams matching name V*: 7
     VDE>

     The /TOTAL qualifier displays the number of streams that match
     the name specification. In this case, the name specification
     (V*)  matches all streams whose names begin with the letter V.
     There are 7 such streams.

   5.VDE> SHOW STREAM MAIN/DESCENDANTS/SUCCESSOR/QUEUE
     Stream MAIN            "Main development stream"
        Descendant streams:
           MAIN (main)
              V1.0 (main)
                 V1.0-1
                 V1.0-2
                 V1.0-3
                 V2.0 (main)
                    V2.1-1
                    V2.1-2-BL1
                 SUBDIR_TEST
              HICKORY
        Successor chains:
           MAIN -> V1.0 -> V2.0
        Default build-job batch queues to run 1 processes:
           Submit 1 processes (scaled from 1) on queue SYS$BATCH

     VDE>

     This example shows the output of the /DESCENDANT, /SUCCESSOR,
     and /QUEUE qualifiers. The /DESCENDANTS qualifier shows the
     whole tree of descendants created, directly or indirectly,
     from stream MAIN. The /SUCCESSOR qualifier shows that the
     REPLACE command will propagate changes from stream MAIN into
     streams V1.0 and V2.0. The /QUEUE qualifier shows that build
     jobs for stream MAIN will submit one process to queue SYS$BATCH
     by default.
 

2  SYMBOL
   Displays all symbol definitions established with the
   DEFINE/COMMAND command. Such symbols are used for VDE command
   abbreviations.

   Format

     SHOW SYMBOL  symbol-name
 

3  Parameter
 

symbol-name

   Specifies the name of the symbol to show. If symbol-name includes
   asterisks (*),  each asterisk is treated as a wildcard character
   that matches zero or more characters. All symbols whose names
   match the wildcard pattern are shown.
 

3  Description
   The DEFINE/COMMAND command allows you to create command
   abbreviations in the VDE command language. The SHOW SYMBOL
   command lets you see all the symbols you have defined.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> DEFINE/COMMAND SM = "SHOW MODULE"
     VDE> SHOW SYMBOL SM
     Defined commands:
       SM = "SHOW MODULE"
     VDE>

     In this example, the DEFINE/COMMAND command creates a command
     abbreviation that binds the string "SHOW MODULE" to symbol SM.
     The SHOW SYMBOL command then displays the command definition
     for SM.

   2.VDE> SHOW SYMBOL *
     Defined commands:
       SETSTRMFACIL = "SET STREAM MAIN; SET FACILITY RMS"
       SM = "SHOW MODULE"
     VDE>

     The SHOW SYMBOL command contains a wildcard character for the
     symbol name. As a result, the command displays the definitions
     of all defined symbols.
 

2  TERMINAL
   Displays the line width and page size that VDE uses to format
   terminal output. To change these settings, use the SET TERMINAL
   command.

   Format

     SHOW TERMINAL
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW TERMINAL
     Terminal page size: 50, Terminal width: 80
     VDE>

     The SHOW TERMINAL command shows that VDE currently uses a
     page size of 50 lines and a line width of 80 columns to format
     output to the terminal.
 

2  USER
   Displays the database records of specified users of the current
   VDE library.

   Format

     SHOW USER  [username [, username...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

username

   The OpenVMS username of an existing user of the current VDE
   library. VDE displays this user's database record.

   You can display information for many users by using wildcard
   characters in the username. The percent sign (%)  in a username
   matches any single character in the position it occupies and the
   asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the position it
   occupies. VDE displays all user records whose usernames match the
   wildcard pattern.

   If you do not specify a username parameter or the /CURRENT
   qualifier, VDE displays all user records in the database.
 

3  Description
   Depending on the qualifiers you select, the SHOW USER command
   displays the OpenVMS username, full name string, creator and
   creation date of the user's database record, remark string, and
   authorized and default privileges for each specified user. The
   command also can show the total number of users that match a
   given username specification.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/BRIEF

   Determines the type of information about the specified users
   that is displayed. The /BRIEF qualifier lists the username and
   full name string of each user. The /FULL qualifier displays
   the same information as the /BRIEF qualifier and also the name
   of the creator of the user record and the date the record was
   created, the remark string, and the user's authorized and default
   privileges.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/FULL

   Determines the type of information about the specified users
   that is displayed. The /BRIEF qualifier lists the username and
   full name string of each user. The /FULL qualifier displays
   the same information as the /BRIEF qualifier and also the name
   of the creator of the user record and the date the record was
   created, the remark string, and the user's authorized and default
   privileges.

   Of /BRIEF and /FULL, the former is the default.
 

/CURRENT

   Displays the user record of the current user. Do not specify the
   username parameter if you use this qualifier.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/TOTAL

   Shows the total number of users that match the username
   parameters. Other information about the users is not shown. A
   separate count is provided for each username parameter. Wildcard
   characters are usually used in the username parameters when using
   this qualifier.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW USER
     User DOE (John Doe)
     User DOLOMITE (Rock Dolomite)
     User JONES (Frank Jones)
     User SMITH (Jane Smith)
     VDE>

     This example illustrates the SHOW USER command without
     parameters or qualifiers. The command lists the usernames and
     full names of all users recorded in the current database.

   2.VDE> SHOW USER SMITH, DO*
     User SMITH (Jane Smith)
     User DOE (John Doe)
     User DOLOMITE (Rock Dolomite)
     VDE>

     In this example, the SHOW USER command with username parameters
     gives a brief listing for user SMITH and all users whose
     usernames begin with "DO".

   3.VDE> SHOW USER SMITH/FULL
     User SMITH (Jane Smith)
        User added to database on 20-OCT-1988 17:56:23.83
        User added to database by user DOE (John Doe)
        Remark: OpenVMS Developer
        Default privileges:
           BUILD CREFAC CREMOD
        Authorized privileges:
           BUILD CREFAC CREMOD CREUSR

     VDE>

     Here the /FULL qualifier lists all database information for
     user SMITH.

   4.VDE> SHOW USER/TOTAL D*
     Number of users matching name D*: 2
     VDE>

     This example shows how the /TOTAL qualifier lists the number of
     users whose usernames match a given name specification. In this
     case, a username containing a wildcard character (D*)  selects
     all users whose usernames begin with "D." The output shows that
     there are two such users in the database.
 

2  VERIFY
   Indicates whether command input is verified (echoed) at the
   terminal before the input is executed. To enable verification,
   use the SET VERIFY command.

   Format

     SHOW VERIFY
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW VERIFY
     Not verifying commands
     VDE>

     The SHOW VERIFY command shows that command verification is
     disabled.
 

2  VERSION
   Displays the VDE version string for the version of VDE you are
   running.

   Format

     SHOW VERSION
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SHOW VERSION
     Executing VDE for OpenVMS VAX Version V1.5-0
     VDE>

     The SHOW VERSION command displays what version of VDE you are
     running.
 

1  SPAWN
   Creates a subprocess of the current process. The context of the
   subprocess is copied from the current process. You can use the
   SPAWN command to leave VDE temporarily, perform other functions
   (such as reading your mail), and then return to VDE.

   Format

     SPAWN  [command]
 

2  Parameter
 

command

   Specifies the DCL command string that executes in the created
   subprocess. When the command completes, the subprocess terminates
   and control is returned to the parent process. If this parameter
   is not specified, a subprocess is created that transfers control
   to the DCL command level.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/INPUT

      /INPUT=filespec

   Specifies an input file containing one or more DCL command
   strings to be executed by the spawned subprocess. If you specify
   a command string along with an input file, the command string is
   processed before the commands in the input file. After processing
   is complete, the subprocess is terminated.
 

/LOGICAL_NAMES

      /LOGICAL_NAMES (default)
      /NOLOGICAL_NAMES

   Specifies whether the logical names of the parent process are
   copied to the subprocess. When you do not want the subprocess to
   use the logical names of the parent process, enter the qualifier
   /NOLOGICAL_NAMES.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=filespec

   Identifies the output file to which the results of the SPAWN
   operation are written. If you omit the /OUTPUT qualifier, output
   is written by default to the current SYS$OUTPUT device. Whenever
   you use the /NOWAIT qualifier, you should also use the /OUTPUT
   qualifier to specify a new output destination. Doing so prevents
   output from being displayed on your terminal while you are
   entering new VDE commands.
 

/PROCESS

      /PROCESS=subprocess-name

   Specifies the name of the subprocess. The default name of the
   subprocess is USERNAME_n.
 

/SYMBOLS

      /SYMBOLS (default)
      /NOSYMBOLS

   Determines whether the system passes DCL global and local symbols
   to the subprocess. The default is /SYMBOLS.
 

/WAIT

      /WAIT (default)
      /NOWAIT

   Controls whether VDE waits until the subprocess is completed
   before allowing more VDE commands to be entered. The /NOWAIT
   qualifier allows you to enter new VDE commands while the
   specified subprocess is running. If you specify /NOWAIT, you
   should also use the /OUTPUT qualifier to direct the output stream
   to a file rather than to your terminal. Doing so prevents your
   terminal from being used by more than one process simultaneously.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> SPAWN
     $ SHOW TIME
       24-MAR-1989 16:35:14
     $ LOGOUT
       Process JONES_1 logged out at 24-MAR-1989 16:35:17.37
     %VDE-I-SPAWNED, subprocess spawned
     %VDE-I-RETURNED, control returned to process JONES
     VDE>

     The SPAWN command without parameters creates a subprocess that
     prompts for DCL command input. The user enters the SHOW TIME
     command at the DCL prompt and the time is displayed. The user
     then logs out of the subprocess, which returns control to the
     VDE session.

   2.VDE> SPAWN SHOW TIME
     15-OCT-1988 15:34:07
     %VDE-I-SPAWNED, subprocess spawned
     %VDE-I-RETURNED, control returned to process JONES
     VDE>

     This example shows how to create a subprocess that executes
     the DCL command SHOW TIME while you are using VDE. After the
     command is completed, you are returned immediately to the VDE
     prompt.

   3.VDE>SPAWN MAIL
     MAIL> READ/NEW
        .
        .
        .
     MAIL> EXIT
     %VDE-I-SPAWNED, subprocess spawned
     %VDE-I-RETURNED, control returned to process SMITH
     VDE>

     This example shows how to create a subprocess that invokes the
     OpenVMS MAIL Utility while you are in VDE. When you exit from
     the MAIL Utility, the subprocess disappears and the VDE> prompt
     returns.

   4.VDE> SPAWN /OUTPUT=TIME.DAT SHOW TIME
     %VDE-I-SPAWNED, subprocess spawned
     %VDE-I-RETURNED, control returned to process SMITH
     VDE> EXIT
     $ TYPE TIME.DAT
     15-OCT-1988 15:34:07
     $

     This example shows how to create a subprocess to invoke the
     DCL command SHOW TIME while you are using the VDE Utility. The
     /OUTPUT qualifier specifies that the results of the SHOW TIME
     command be written to a file named TIME.DAT.

   5.VDE> SPAWN /NOLOGICAL_NAMES SET HOST
     _Node: MARS
        .
        .
        .
     $ LOGOUT
     CRAMMER logged out at ...

     %REM-S-END, control returned to node _BETA::
     %VDE-I-SPAWNED, subprocess spawned
     %VDE-I-RETURNED, control returned to process JONES
     VDE>

     This example shows how to use the SPAWN command to create a
     subprocess which uses the SET HOST command to log onto another
     node. To leave node MARS and move back to node BETA, enter the
     DCL command LOGOUT. The /NOLOGICAL_NAMES qualifier prevents the
     logical names of the parent process from being copied to the
     subprocess.
 

1  START
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Starts the execution of a build job by submitting build processes
   to OpenVMS batch queues.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     START BUILD_JOB  [stream-name [, stream-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream. The most recent build job in
   this stream is started.

   You can start build jobs for more than one development stream by
   using wildcard characters in the stream name. The percent sign
   (%)  in a name matches any single character in the position it
   occupies and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters
   in the position it occupies. Build jobs are started for those
   streams whose names match the wildcard pattern.

   If you omit the stream-name parameter, VDE starts the most recent
   build job for the default stream.
 

3  Description
   The START BUILD_JOB command starts the most recently created
   build job in each stream that matches the specified stream names.
   (To create a build job, use the BUILD command.)

   To start a build job, the START BUILD_JOB command submits one or
   more batch jobs to the OpenVMS batch queues associated with the
   build job. Then each batch job runs a program called VDE$BUILD
   that executes the build steps belonging to the build job. The
   steps are executed in a loop until all the steps are done. The
   VDE$BUILD program does the following for each build step:

   o  The program looks in the database for the next available
      build step. (A build step is available if it is not waiting
      for another step to complete.) If no step is available,
      the program waits a few seconds before looking for another
      available build step.

   o  When the program finds a build step to run, it looks up the
      VDE script for that step and, from the script, generates the
      DCL commands needed to run the step. The program then sends
      the DCL commands to a subprocess that executes the build step,
      and waits for the step to complete.

   o  After the step completes, the program records the completion
      status of the step in the database. A step completes
      either successfully or with errors. If the step completes
      successfully, the program updates the step's build dependency
      information in the database and then looks for another step to
      perform.

   By running this program in many processes simultaneously for
   a single build job, you can distribute the execution of your
   build across several processors (whether in a single machine
   or in multiple machines in a cluster). The /QUEUE qualifier
   specifies the batch queues to run the build job. The /PROCESS_
   COUNT qualifier specifies the total number of processes VDE
   submits to the batch queues performing the build job.

   If you specify the /QUEUE and /PROCESS_COUNT qualifiers
   with the START BUILD_JOB command, they override any previous
   specifications. If you do not specify them with the START BUILD_
   JOB command, VDE uses the queues and process count specified
   with the BUILD command that created the build job. If neither was
   specified with the BUILD command, VDE uses the default queues and
   process count for the stream.

   You cannot start a build job that is currently running. However,
   you can suspend such a build job with the SUSPEND BUILD_JOB
   command and then restart it using the START BUILD_JOB command.
   (This is useful, for example, if you want to change the batch
   queues running the build job.) Also, you cannot start a build job
   that has already completed execution.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/AFTER

      /AFTER=date-time

   Indicates that the build job begins execution after the specified
   date and time. The date and time are stated in standard OpenVMS
   date-time syntax. This qualifier specifies the start time for
   each of the batch jobs that execute the build job.
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   build job started. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each build job asking whether you want that build
   job started. If you answer YES (or Y), the build job is started.
   If you answer NO (or N), the build job is not started. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to start the specified build
   jobs without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each build
   job has started. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be
   printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages
   indicate that the build job has started and shows how many
   processes have been submitted to each batch queue associated
   with the build job.
 

/PROCESS_COUNT

      /PROCESS_COUNT=proc-count

   Specifies the total number of processes to execute the build
   job. VDE creates the processes by submitting batch jobs to
   the queues specified by the /QUEUE qualifier or to the default
   queues for the default stream. The number of processes that VDE
   creates (that is, the number of OpenVMS batch jobs it submits)
   is specified with the proc-count parameter. This parameter thus
   specifies the degree of parallelism you want for the build job.
 

/QUEUE

      /QUEUE=(queue-name [,queue-name...])

   Specifies the OpenVMS batch queues to which the build job
   is submitted. Each queue-name parameter specifies one batch
   queue. The queue-name parameter may optionally be followed by
   a process count in parentheses. This count specifies the number
   of processes started on the queue that runs the build job. For
   example, SYS$BATCH(3) causes three build-job processes to be
   submitted to queue SYS$BATCH. If the process count is omitted,
   one process is submitted to the queue.

   If you only specify one queue-name parameter, the parentheses may
   be omitted.

   If you also use the /PROCESS_COUNT qualifier, the /PROCESS_
   COUNT qualifier states the total number of build-job processes
   to create. In that case, the process-counts attached to the
   queue-name parameters on the /QUEUE qualifier are used as scaling
   factors to distribute the build-job processes among the queues
   proportionally. For example, if you specify queues HI_BATCH, HO_
   BATCH(3) and a total process count of eight, then two processes
   are submitted to queue HI_BATCH and six processes to queue HO_
   BATCH. If the total process count does not divide evenly into the
   sum of the scaling factors, the remaining processes are allocated
   to the queues in the order the queues are listed. If the total
   process count is nine, for example, the one extra process is
   allocated to queue HI_BATCH because HI_BATCH is listed first.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> START BUILD_JOB
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSIZ, build job 15 for stream V2.0-3 consists of 25 steps
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTING, starting build job 15 for stream V2.0-3
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 549 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue CLUSTER_BATCH, entry 549) started on FOO_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 550 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue CLUSTER_BATCH, entry 550) started on PHI_BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTED, build job 15 for stream V2.0-3 started with 2 processes
     VDE>

     This command starts the most recent build job for the default
     development stream, in this case, build job 15 for stream V2.0-
     3. Two batch processes are submitted, one to batch queue FOO_
     BATCH and one to queue PHI_BATCH.

   2.VDE> START BUILD_JOB V5.3/AFTER=15:00/PROCESS_COUNT=1/QUEUE=SYS$BATCH
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSIZ, build job 12 for stream V5.3 consists of 2 steps
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTING, starting build job 12 for stream V5.3
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBAFTER, build job to be started after 12-JUL-1989 15:00:00.00
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBENT, entry number 583 submitted to queue SYS$BATCH
        Job VDEBUILD_0001 (queue FOO_BATCH, entry 583) holding until 12-JUL-1989 15:00
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTARTED, build job 12 for stream V5.3 started with 1 processes
     VDE>

     This example starts the most recent build job (build job 12)
     for stream V5.3. The /AFTER qualifier specifies that the batch
     job starts after 15:00 hours (3:00 pm) of the current day.
     The /PROCESS_COUNT and /QUEUE qualifiers specify that a single
     batch job is submitted to queue SYS$BATCH to run the build job.
     The log messages show that this happened as requested.
 

1  STOP
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Stops the execution of an existing build job. A stopped build job
   cannot be restarted.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     STOP BUILD_JOB  [stream-name [, stream-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream. The most recent build job for
   this stream is stopped.

   You can stop build jobs for more than one stream by using
   wildcard characters in the stream name. The percent sign (%)  in
   a name matches any single character in the position it occupies
   and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the
   position it occupies. Build jobs are stopped for those streams
   whose names match the wildcard pattern.

   If you omit the stream-name parameter, VDE stops the most recent
   build job for the default stream.
 

3  Description
   The STOP BUILD_JOB command stops the most recently created build
   job for each stream that matches a specified stream name. When
   a build job is stopped, it is marked as stopped in the database.
   Any processes executing the build job stop executing as soon
   as they read the new job status from the database. This command
   stops a build job permanently: it can never be restarted. Use
   the STOP BUILD_JOB command to stop a running build job or to
   mark an existing build job as stopped (even if it has never
   been started). After the most recent build job for a stream is
   stopped, you are free to create a new build job for that stream
   because the stopped job cannot execute and interfere with the new
   job.

   You cannot stop a build job that has already been stopped or that
   has already completed execution. Because such jobs cannot execute
   again, there is no need to stop them.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   build job stopped. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each build job asking whether you want that build
   job stopped. If you answer YES (or Y), the build job is stopped.
   If you answer NO (or N), the build job is not stopped. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to stop the specified build jobs
   without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each build job
   is stopped. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate
   that the build job has been stopped and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> STOP BUILD_JOB
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTOP, build job 15 for stream V2.0-3 stopped
     VDE>

     This command stops the most recent build job for the default
     development stream. In this case, the default stream is V2.0-3
     and its most recent build job is build job 15.

   2.VDE> STOP BUILD_JOB V5.3
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSTOP, build job 12 for stream V5.3 stopped
     VDE>

     This command stops the most recent build job for specified
     stream V5.3.
 

2  SUBPROCESS
   Stops the subprocess that VDE uses to execute the DCL command
   files it generates from VDE scripts. VDE automatically terminates
   this subprocess when you exit from VDE (or from the VDE kept
   subprocess), but this command allows you to explicitly terminate
   the script subprocess in order to reduce the number of open
   subprocesses you have.

   Format

     STOP SUBPROCESS
 

3  Parameters
   None.
 

3  Qualifiers
   None.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> STOP SUBPROCESS

     This command stops the subprocess VDE uses to execute DCL
     command files generated by VDE scripts.
 

1  SUSPEND
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Suspends the execution of an existing build job. A suspended
   build job can be restarted.

   Requires BUILD privilege.

   Format

     SUSPEND BUILD_JOB  [stream-name [, stream-name...]]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream. The most recent build job for
   this stream is suspended.

   You can suspend build jobs for more than one stream by using
   wildcard characters in the stream name. The percent sign (%)  in
   a name matches any single character in the position it occupies
   and the asterisk (*)  matches zero or more characters in the
   position it occupies. Build jobs are suspended for those streams
   whose names match the wildcard pattern.

   If you omit the stream-name parameter, VDE suspends the most
   recent build job for the default stream.
 

3  Description
   The SUSPEND BUILD_JOB command suspends the most recently created
   build job for each stream that matches a specified stream name.
   When a build job is suspended, it is marked as suspended in the
   database. Any processes executing the build job stop executing
   as soon as they read the new job status from the database. A
   suspended build job is not permanently stopped, however: it can
   be restarted with a START BUILD_JOB command. Use the SUSPEND
   BUILD_JOB command to temporarily stop a running build job; you
   can restart the suspended job later or restart it on different
   batch queues. You should also suspend a build job if one of the
   nodes it is running on fails; suspending a build job and then
   restarting it allows the build steps that were running on the
   failed node to reexecute.

   You can only suspend a build job that is currently queued for
   execution or running. There is no need to suspend a build job
   that has not yet been started or that has completed execution.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   build job suspended. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print a
   message for each build job asking whether you want that build job
   suspended. If you answer YES (or Y), the build job is suspended.
   If you answer NO (or N), the build job is not suspended. The
   /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to suspend the specified build
   jobs without asking for confirmation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each build job is
   suspended. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. These messages indicate
   that the build job is suspended and that the database transaction
   has successfully committed.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> SUSPEND BUILD_JOB
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSUSP, build job 15 for stream V2.0-3 suspended
     VDE>

     This command suspends the most recent build job for the default
     development stream, in this case, build job 15 for stream V2.0-
     3.

   2.VDE> SUSPEND BUILD_JOB V5.3
     %VDE-I-BLDJOBSUSP, build job 12 for stream V5.3 suspended
     VDE>

     This command suspends the most recent build job for stream
     V5.3. The stream name is specified in this example.
 

1  UNRESERVE
   Cancels one or more module reservations in the default
   development stream.

   Requires RESREP privilege.

   Format

     UNRESERVE  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

2  Parameter
 

mod-name

   Specifies one or more source modules whose reservations are to
   be canceled. The module name consists of an optional facility
   name enclosed in square brackets, a module name, and an optional
   type name preceded by a period (such as [FACIL]MOD1.MAR). If
   the facility name is omitted, the module is assumed to belong
   to the default facility. If the type name is omitted, all source
   modules with the specified module name in the given facility are
   unreserved.

   You can cancel reservations for more than one module using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   The source modules whose names match the wildcard pattern are
   unreserved.

   You can also unreserve multiple modules by specifying the name
   of a source group instead of a module name. Source groups are
   created with the CREATE GROUP command. If you specify a group
   name, each module that is a member of the group is unreserved.
 

2  Description
   The UNRESERVE command cancels an existing reservation for each
   specified module. Each module must be a source module currently
   reserved with the RESERVE command. The module reservation is
   canceled only for the default development stream.

   If you have more than one reservation of a module, you must
   specify the exact reservation to be replaced. You do this by
   using the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier. Use the SHOW RESERVATION
   command to determine the identification of each reservation.

   To cancel another user's reservation, you must use the /USERNAME
   qualifier to specify the OpenVMS username of that other user. You
   must have the USERNAME privilege to use the /USERNAME qualifier.

   Reservations created by the CREATE MODULE command cannot be
   canceled with the UNRESERVE command. To cancel the reservation(s)
   and delete these module(s), use the DELETE MODULE command.
 

2  Qualifiers
 

/CONFIRM

      /CONFIRM
      /NOCONFIRM (default)

   Controls whether VDE asks you to confirm that you want each
   module unreserved. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to print
   a message for each module that you specify asking whether you
   want to unreserve that module. If you answer YES (or Y), the
   reservation is canceled. If you answer NO (or N), the reservation
   is not canceled. The /NOCONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to unreserve
   each specified module without asking for confirmation.
 

/IDENTIFICATION

      /IDENTIFICATION=res-ident

   Specifies the reservation that is canceled. This qualifier
   is required when you have multiple reservations of the same
   module in the default stream. The res-ident parameter is the
   reservation identifier of the reservation to be replaced.
   The reservation identifier is a small integer value or the
   identifier you specified when reserving the module. Use the SHOW
   RESERVATION command to determine the reservation identifier of
   each reservation.
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed after each module is
   unreserved. The /LOG qualifier causes the messages to be printed
   and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate
   that each module has been unreserved and that the database
   transaction has successfully committed.
 

/SESSION

      /SESSION=session-name

   Sessions are used to logically group a set of module reservations
   together, typically to group all modules related to a particular
   source code alteration or enhancement together. It allows all
   component modules reserved to be treated as a single entity
   for subsequent replacement operations. A session also allows
   additional modules to be reserved and incorporated into an
   existing session at a later time.

   The /SESSION qualifier causes all module reservations comprising
   the session-name reservation session are canceled, and that
   the session be deleted from the VDE database. If you specify
   this qualifier, you cannot specify mod-name parameters on the
   UNRESERVE command.

   Sessions can be manipulated via the REPLACE, RESERVE, UNRESERVE,
   MODIFY SESSION, MODIFY RESERVATION, CREATE MODULE, and CANCEL
   SESSION commands. And modules created by CREATE MODULE (on
   a queued-replacement stream) and reserved via RESERVE can be
   combined into the same session.
 

/STREAM

      /STREAM=stream-name

   Specifies that the modules be unreserved from the development
   stream given by the stream-name parameter. If this qualifier is
   omitted, the modules are unreserved from the default development
   stream. If this qualifier is omitted and no default stream is
   defined, VDE prompts you for the stream name.
 

/USERNAME

      /USERNAME=username

   Specifies that another user's reservation is to be canceled. The
   username parameter is the OpenVMS username of the other user. You
   must have the USERNAME privilege to use this qualifier.
 

2  Examples

   1.VDE> UNRESERVE [FACIL]FOO.MAR
     %VDE-I-UNRESERVED, reservation for module [FACIL]FOO.MAR canceled
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This example cancels an existing reservation for module FOO.MAR
     in facility FACIL. The log messages show that the reservation
     was successfully canceled.

   2.VDE> UNRESERVE MOD1
     %VDE-I-UNRESERVED, reservation for module [COPY]MOD1.PAS canceled
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed
     VDE>

     This command cancels the reservations for all source modules
     called MOD1 in the current default facility, COPY. Because
     there is only one such module, MOD1.PAS, the reservation for
     that module is canceled.

   3.VDE> UNRESERVE/IDENTIFICATION=2/CONFIRM FOO.MAR
     Unreserve module [FACIL]FOO.MAR ? [No]: YES
     %VDE-I-UNRESERVED, reservation for module [FACIL]FOO.MAR canceled
     %VDE-I-COMMIT, database transaction has successfully committed

     In this example, reservation 2 of module FOO.MAR in the current
     default facility is canceled. The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier
     is required if you have more than one reservation of the same
     module at the same time. The /CONFIRM qualifier causes VDE to
     ask for confirmation before unreserving the module. In this
     case, the user answers "YES", and the reservation is canceled.
 

1  VERIFY
 

2  GENERATION
   Verifies that a specified set of module generations exist in
   the corresponding CMS libraries and optionally recovers any
   missing generations. This command thus ensures that CMS libraries
   within the VDE library are consistent with the contents of the
   VDE database.

   Format

     VERIFY GENERATION  mod-name [, mod-name...]
 

3  Parameter
 

mod-name

   The name of a module whose generations are to be verified. The
   module name consists of an optional facility name enclosed
   in square brackets, a module name, and an optional type name
   preceded by a period. An example is [FACIL]MOD1.PAS. If no
   facility name is specified, the default facility is assumed. If
   no type name is specified, all modules with the specified module
   name in the given facility are verified.

   You can verify generations for more than one module by using
   wildcard characters in any of the three components of the
   module name. The percent sign (%)  in a name matches any single
   character in the position it occupies and the asterisk (*)
   matches zero or more characters in the position it occupies.
   Generations for those modules whose names match the wildcard
   pattern are verified.

   If you omit the mod-name parameter, VDE verifies generations for
   all modules in the default facility.
 

3  Description
   The VERIFY GENERATION command verifies that the generations you
   specify actually exist in the CMS libraries belonging to your
   VDE library. This command should be used if there is reason to
   think that one or more CMS libraries in the VDE library may not
   be consistent with the VDE database. Such a situation can arise
   any time you have had to restore the VDE library's database from
   back-up files or its CMS libraries from back-up tapes. Provided
   you have enabled journalling, the VDE database can be fully
   recovered after a failure up to and including the last completed
   database transaction before the failure. However, the contents
   of the associated CMS libraries cannot be recovered past the
   last available back-up. If you back up your disks daily, the CMS
   libraries may thus be as much as a day out of date. As a result,
   the CMS libraries may be missing generations created by REPLACE
   or PERFORM REPLACEMENT commands that were entered after that last
   back-up, while the VDE database contains up-to-date information
   about those generations.

   The VERIFY GENERATION command therefore assumes that the VDE
   database contains correct information about what generations
   should be found in the CMS libraries for your VDE library. If it
   finds any differences between the generations that the database
   says ought to exist and the generations that actually exist in
   the CMS libraries, VDE prints a message for each such generation.
   Optionally, VDE can also print a message for each generation that
   was correctly found.

   If you specify the /RECOVER qualifier, the VERIFY GENERATION
   command will attempt to recover any missing generations. If the
   missing generations were created by REPLACE commands and if the
   replacements were queued, VDE retrieves the text of each missing
   generation from the staging area for the queued replacement that
   created the generation. The retrieved text is then inserted
   into the CMS library. For immediate replacements, VDE does not
   maintain staging areas, but if you have a file that contains the
   text of a missing generation, you can specify that the missing
   generation be recovered from that file. Using either the VDE
   staging areas or files you explicitly specify, the /RECOVER
   qualifier thus allows you to repair any inconsistencies between
   the VDE database and its CMS libraries.

   The VERIFY GENERATION command is usually used with wildcard
   characters in the module name parameters because you normally
   want to verify all generations in a specific facility (if the
   CMS library for that facility was restored from a back-up tape)
   or all generations for all facilities (if your whole disk was
   restored). To speed up the verification, you can use the /SINCE
   qualifier to verify and recover only those generations created
   since the back-up date for the CMS libraries.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/GENERATION

      /GENERATION=gen-expr

   Specifies that the generation with the CMS generation expression
   given by the gen-expr parameter be verified. When you use this
   qualifier, you would normally not use wildcard characters in
   the module name parameter. If you specify an asterisk (*)  for
   the gen-expr parameter or if you omit the entire qualifier, VDE
   verifies all generations for each specified module.
 

/LOG

      /LOG
      /NOLOG (default)

   Controls whether log messages are printed for successfully
   verified generations. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and /NOLOG suppresses them. The log messages for
   generations that are not successfully verified are always printed
   and are not affected by these qualifiers.
 

/OUTPUT

      /OUTPUT=file-spec

   Directs the printed output of this command to a specified file.
   The file-spec parameter specifies the name of the file. VDE
   creates a new file with that name, directs the command's print
   output to that file, and prints nothing on your terminal. If this
   qualifier is omitted, all output appears on the terminal.
 

/RECOVER

      /RECOVER[=file-spec]

   Specifies that each generation that is found in the VDE database
   but is missing in the corresponding CMS library should be
   recovered into the CMS library. If you omit the file-spec
   parameter, VDE recovers each missing generation by taking its
   text from the staging area for the queued replacement that
   created the generation, provided such a staging area exists.
   You should omit the file-spec parameter when you want to recover
   all missing generations for a given set of facilities and those
   generations are available from staging areas.

   If you specify the file-spec parameter, VDE recovers each missing
   generation by taking its text from the file specified by that
   parameter. If the parameter specifies a directory name without
   a file name, VDE assumes that the file has the same name as the
   module being recovered. When you use the file-spec parameter,
   you would normally also use the /GENERATION qualifier to identify
   the specific generation to recover and you would omit wildcard
   characters in the module name parameter. You should use the file-
   spec parameter when you want to recover an individual module
   generation that cannot be found in VDE's staging areas.

   This qualifier requires the PERFREP privilege.
 

/SINCE

      /SINCE=date-time

   Verifies (and if requested, recovers) only those generations
   created on or after the specified date and time. The date and
   time can be stated in the standard OpenVMS date-time format
   or can be one of the following keywords: YESTERDAY, TODAY, or
   TOMORROW. If you use a space to separate the date from the time,
   remember to enclose the entire date-time string in double quotes.
   For further information about specifying OpenVMS date-time
   format, see the OpenVMS DCL Concepts.

        Total number of generations scanned:               9

     VDE>

     This example verifies all generations in facility FACIL to
     make sure that each such generation is found in the CMS library
     for that facility. The /LOG qualifier causes VDE to print log
     messages for the generations that are successfully verified as
     well as those that are missing. In this case, generation 2 of
     B.REQ is not found in the CMS library and the whole CMS element
     for module C.B32 is missing. The summary statistics indicate
     that seven generations were successfully verified and two were
     not.

   2.VDE> VERIFY GENERATION/SINCE=TODAY/RECOVER [*]*

        Number of generations recovered:                   1
        Number of generations not recovered:               1

     VDE>

     This example verifies all generations created since last
     midnight in all facilities. Because the /RECOVER qualifier
     is specified, VDE recovers all missing generations from their
     queued-replacement staging areas and inserts them into their
     CMS libraries. In this example, generation 2 of module B.REQ
     was successfully recovered from its staging directory. However,
     generation 1 of C.B32 could not be recovered because no staging
     area exists for the replacement that created that generation.
     This example illustrates a typical recovery operation after the
     disk containing your VDE library has been restored from back-up
     tapes and the VDE database has been recovered from its back-up
     and journal files.

   3.VDE> VERIFY GENERATION [SYS]FOO.MAR/GENERATION=10A2/RECOVER=DISK$:[MYDIR]

     %VDE-I-ELENOTFOUNDCMS, element [SYS]FOO.MAR;12(10A2) not found in CMS library
     %VDE-I-GENRECOVERED, generation [SYS]FOO.MAR;12(10A2) successfully recovered
     from DISK$:[MYDIR]FOO.MAR;

     Summary statistics:
        Number of generations successfully verified:       0
        Number of CMS elements not found:                  1
        Number of CMS generations not found:               0
        Total number of generations scanned:               1
        Number of generations recovered:                   1
        Number of generations not recovered:               0

     VDE>

     This example verifies generation 10A2 of module FOO.MAR in
     facility SYS. Because that generation is missing from the
     CMS library in this example, VDE recovers its text from file
     DISK$:[MYDIR]FOO.MAR and inserts it into the CMS library for
     facility SYS. This example thus illustrates how you can recover
     a specific missing generation when the generation is not found
     in any VDE staging area but happens to be available elsewhere.

   VDE Version 1.5-0.
 

1  WAIT
 

2  BUILD_JOB
   Waits for an existing build job to complete.

   Format

     WAIT BUILD_JOB  [stream-name]
 

3  Parameter
 

stream-name

   The name of a development stream. VDE waits for the most recent
   build job in this stream to complete. If you omit the stream-name
   parameter, VDE waits for the completion of the most recent build
   job in the default stream.
 

3  Description
   The WAIT BUILD_JOB command waits for the most recently created
   build job in the specified stream to complete. The command checks
   the status of the build job in the database every 15 seconds
   until the build job is marked as completed. A build job is marked
   as completed in any of the following circumstances:

   o  the job completes successfully

   o  the job completes with errors

   o  the job is stopped or suspended

   o  the job times out (is automatically stopped) because of lack
      of progress

   Use the WAIT BUILD_JOB command in batch jobs that must wait for
   the completion of a build job before another task can begin, for
   example, before printing the status of the job.

   The WAIT BUILD_JOB command stops waiting automatically if the
   build job does not complete within a certain interval. You can
   specify that interval with the /TIMEOUT qualifier. The default
   timeout interval is 12 hours.

   If you use the WAIT BUILD_JOB command interactively, you can
   abort the wait by pressing CTRL/C. Expect a delay of up to 15
   seconds before CTRL/C takes effect.
 

3  Qualifiers
 

/LOG

      /LOG (default)
      /NOLOG

   Controls whether log messages are printed when VDE begins and
   ends the waiting period. The /LOG qualifier causes such messages
   to be printed and the /NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The log
   message at the beginning of the waiting period indicates what
   build job VDE is waiting for. The log message at the end of the
   wait indicates that the build job completed or that the wait
   exceeded the timeout interval.
 

/TIMEOUT

      /TIMEOUT=time-interval

   Specifies the timeout interval for the wait. If the build job
   does not complete in this interval, VDE ends the waiting period
   and prints a log message to that effect. Specify the timeout
   interval using the following syntax to denote the number of
   hours, minutes, and seconds in the interval:

   hh:mm:ss.ss

   If this qualifier is not specified, the command ends after 12
   hours.
 

3  Examples

   1.VDE> WAIT BUILD_JOB
     Waiting until build job 34 for stream MAIN completes...
     Build job 34 for stream MAIN has successfully completed
     VDE>

     This command waits for the most recent build job for the
     default stream to complete, in this case, build job 34 for
     stream MAIN. The second log message, printed after the job
     finished, indicates that the job completed successfully.

   2.VDE> WAIT BUILD_JOB/TIMEOUT=5:00 V5.3
     Waiting until build job 33 for stream V5.3 completes...

     VDE>

     This command waits for the most recent build job for stream
     V5.3. The timeout interval is 5 minutes. In this case, the
     timeout interval expired before the build job completed, as
     indicated by the second log message.
 

1  Overview
   OpenVMS Development Environment VDE is the OpenVMS Development
   Environment package, and is used to manage the source code
   libraries used for the OpenVMS operating system, and the source
   code libraries for a number of other products.

   This section provides an overview of the various features of the
   VDE utility, and a basic introduction to the structure of a VDE
   library. The information here is not a substitute for reviewing
   the Guide to Using VDE and the VDE Reference Manual - please see
   the Documentation topic for pointers to these manuals.

   VDE libraries are heirarchical in nature: each library contains
   the streams, streams contain facilities, and facilities contain
   modules. The modules are the source files that are associated
   with each project.

   VDE streams can be set up to allow all module replacements to
   be immediately copied into the VDE libraries, or the streams can
   be set up to queue the replacements internally after the users
   replace modules in the stream. The queued replacement setting
   allows one or more designated individuals to review the changes
   made by the user, and allows the project leader(s) to release the
   changes into the library at the appropriate time.

   Changes to the source code in a module in one release stream
   can be propogated to other streams automatically, assuming the
   changes are not blocked by and do not require a "fold" because
   of another change to the module in a later release stream. For
   information on folds, see the fold topic.
 

1  Hints
   This section contains hints on the various tasks users might
   perform in VDE, and the commands that might be used:

   o  Showing available libraries and selecting a target VDE library
      using the SET LIBRARY command. To list all predefined VDE
      libraries, use the SET LIBRARY command with no parameters;
      to select a particular VDE library, use the library mnemonic
      or the OpenVMS database directory path as the parameter on a
      subsequent SET LIBRARY command.

   o  Locating development streams, available facilities, and lists
      of modules using the SHOW STREAM, SHOW FACILITY, and SHOW
      MODULE commands.

   o  Reserving, replacing, fetching, and unreserving modules using
      the RESERVE, REPLACE, FETCH, and UNRESERVE commands. Current
      reservation status can be examined with the SHOW RESERVATION
      command. Module reservations can be grouped together and then
      manipulated as a group using VDE "sessions"; commands include
      RESERVE/SESSION, REPLACE/SESSION, and SHOW SESSION.

   o  Creating new modules, creating new marker files, updating
      module characteristics, and marking particular generations
      of old modules as obsolete using the CREATE MODULE, CREATE
      MODULE/MARKER, MODIFY MODULE, and MODIFY GENERATION/OBSOLETE
      commands. VDE may require the specification of both the CREATE
      MODULE (or CREATE MODULE/MARKER) command and a subsequent
      REPLACE command to create a new module, depending on the
      target stream.

   o  Customizing your own VDE environment using the VDE$INIT
      initialization file, by setting up default names for commonly
      accessed facilities and streams using the CREATE CONTEXT,
      MODIFY CONTEXT, SET CONTEXT and SET CONTEXT/DEFAULT commands,
      by setting up shorthand commands using the DEFINE/COMMAND
      command, by setting up key definitions using the DEFINE/KEY
      command, and by declaring your prefered text editor using the
      SET EDITOR command.

   o  Reviewing the various changes made by other users via the SHOW
      REPLACEMENT command, via the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem, and
      the ACCEPT REPLACEMENT and REJECT REPLACEMENT commands.

   o  A user can determine the names and the locations of the pre-
      defined VDE libraries by issuing a SET LIBRARY command without
      a library name parameter-the message displayed by this command
      will include the mnemonic names, location and associated
      remark for each preconfigured library.

   o  A user can take advantage of the automatic SET LIBRARY key
      definitions configured for the predefined libraries-these SET
      LIBRARY definitions are associated with the F17, F18, F19,
      and F20 keys, and allow access to the first twelve libraries
      in conjunction with the PF1 "gold" key and the PF4 "blue"
      keys. To connect to the first VDE library in the list of
      preconfigured libraries, press F17. Press PF1-F17, PF1-F20,
      and PF4-F17 for the fifth, eighth, and ninth libraries in the
      list, respectively.

   o  A user can add new or change existing VDE key definitions
      using the VDE initialization file (VDE$INIT), and the VDE
      DEFINE/KEY command.

   o  To select a default library when VDE first starts up, a user
      can use logical names, For further information, see the
      logical names HELP topic for information on the VDE$LIBRARY
      logical name, and see the DCL HELP on the VDE verb for
      assistance on the VDE /LIBRARY command qualifier.

   o  A user that wishes to select a default stream and facility
      when VDE first connects to a library should see the CREATE
      CONTEXT, MODIFY CONTEXT, and the SET CONTEXT/DEFAULT commands.
      Additional (non-default, private) contexts can also be created
      for individual user, and shared contexts can be created for a
      group of users.
 

1  Folds
   VDE uses release "streams" to track and manage the source code
   for each release currently under development, and various release
   streams can be "open" and under development in parallel. Because
   multiple streams can be open, and because source code changes
   should be incorporated into subsequent release streams, source
   code changes made in one module in one development stream will
   "propogate" into the corresponding module in all descendent
   streams.

   Conceptually, the stream propogation path might look something
   like this:

   zombie -> goblin -> gryphon

   where the arrows indicate the direction of the source code
   propogation, and the stream names are the "code names" for
   various product releases. (Use the SHOW STREAM/SUCCESSOR command
   to display the names of the successor streams and the stream
   propogation path.)

   In the simplest example, if an engineer checks a change to a
   source code module into the zombie stream, the changes will be
   propogated through the stream descendancy chain and into the
   goblin and gryphon streams, so that all streams will contain the
   same source code and the same update.

   In a more complex situation, assume one engineer has updated
   a particular module and has checked the code into the gryphon
   stream, while another engineer updates the same module in the
   earlier zombie stream. The normal and expected propopgation
   of the change from the zombie stream into gryphon stream would
   overwrite the original gryphon change, and this is obviously
   undesirable behaviour. Equally undesirable is the possibilility
   that the change to zombie is not "folded" into the gryphon
   change, is lost, and that it results in a "regression" in
   software function or in software quality occurs.

   In this situation, VDE creates a "fold" record, indicating that
   changes to one or more modules need to be considered, and the
   modules potentially updated, because of a change to an earlier
   version of the module. This "fold" record serves as a marker
   and as a reminder, and helps the engineer avoid introducing a
   "regression" into the source library, and to the customers.

   Additionally, it is possible that folds that are not promptly
   and properly resolved can result in skewed software and broken
   builds. This skew can arise when some of the modules in a
   multiple-module checkin are propogated into a descendent stream,
   and-because of previous changes-other module replacements are
   blocked and the conflicts result in the creation of one or more
   fold records.

   For information on outstanding folds, see the SHOW FOLD command.

   When working with a VDE stream set for "immediate" replacement,
   fold records are created during the REPLACE operation.

   When working with a VDE stream set for "queued" replacement,
   folds are detected and fold records are created after the REPLACE
   operation, when the checkin has been accepted and the library
   has been updated. The replacement notification mail indicates
   the acceptance of the checkin, and it includes information on the
   modules and the streams where any fold records were created by
   the replacement.
 

1  History
   VDE includes various commands useful for displaying the history
   of modules, among these commands:

   o  The SHOW GENERATION command

   Examples

   1.VDE> show generation [lib_h]ucbdef.h /generation=*/full

   In this example, SHOW GENERATION is used to display detailed
   historical information on all generations of a specified module.

   2.VDE> show generation/tree [sys]account.mar

   In this example, SHOW GENERATION is used to display the
   generation tree for the specified module.

   3.VDE> show generation [sys]*.* -

     _VDE> /stream=eagle/since=1-jan-1996

   In this example, SHOW GENERATION is used to display brief
   information about all new generations created in stream EAGLE
   since the first of the year for modules in the [SYS] facility.

   o  The SHOW REPLACEMENT/HISTORY command

   Examples

   1.VDE> show replacement/history -

     _VDE> /user=winters/since=1-jun-1996/full

   In this example SHOW REPLACEMENT/HISTORY is used to display
   detailed historical information about all replacements made by
   user WINTERS since the first of June.

   2.VDE> show replacement/history/stream=dragon

   In this example SHOW REPLACEMENT/HISTORY is used to display all
   replacements submitted to the DRAGON stream.

   For alternative displays, one can access the underlying CMS
   libraries directly, and use the CMS SHOW HISTORY command.
 

1  Logical_Names
   Logical Names contains a description of the various logical names
   used by the various components of the VDE package.

   Table 6-1 Logical Names

   Logical
   Name  Description

   VDE$LIBRARY
         References the device and directory of a VDE library.
   VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS
         A search list logical name that contains zero or more VDE
         libraries available by default. Used in conjunction with
         VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS and VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_
         MNEMONICS, and the number of translations must match the
         number of translations present in VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_
         LABELS and VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS.

         If not defined or defined without translations, an attempt
         is made to access a list of default library labels located
         in the X Windows resource file.
   VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS
         A search list logical name that contains zero or more
         labels for VDE libraries. Used in conjunction with
         VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS, and the number of translations must
         match the number of translations present in VDE$LIBRARY_
         DEFAULTS.

         If not defined or defined without translations, an attempt
         is made to access a list of default library labels in the X
         Windows resource file.

         To avoid user confusion, one should configure the remark
         in each library to match the associated translation(s) of
         the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS logical name. See the SET
         LIBRARY/REMARK command.
   VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_CMS
         A search list logical name that contains zero or more root
         locations for the VDE CMS libraries. This logical is used
         in conjunction with the other VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS logical
         names, and the number of translations must match the number
         of translations present in VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS.

         If not defined or defined without translations, an attempt
         is made to access a list of default library labels in the X
         Windows resource file.

         This logical is used by a VDE manager to provide the
         location of the CMS libraries to programs and procedures
         associated with VDE, but this logical name is not used
         within VDE.
   VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS
         A search list logical name that contains zero or more
         mnemomic names for VDE libraries. Can be used in the
         SET LIBRARY command. This logical name is used in
         conjunction with VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS, and the number of
         translations must match the number of translations present
         in VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS.

         Mnemonics are not utilitized under the X Windows
         interfaces.

         To avoid user confusion, one should configure the name in
         each library to match the associated translation(s) of the
         VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS logical name. See the SET
         LIBRARY/NAME command.
   VDE$LIBRARY_LABEL
         Contains the remark associated with the last VDE library
         accessed. This logical is intended for use within command
         procedures calling VDE.

         To avoid user confusion, one should configure the remark
         in each library to match the associated translation(s) of
         the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_LABELS logical name. See the SET
         LIBRARY/REMARK command.

This logical name is write-only; VDE does not translate it and users
should not modify the contents.)
   VDE$LIBRARY_MNEMONIC
         Contains the mnemonic, when known, or the specification
         associated with the last VDE library accessed.

         To avoid user confusion, one should configure the name in
         each library to match the associated translation(s) of the
         VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS_MNEMONICS logical name. See the SET
         LIBRARY/NAME command.

This logical is intended for use within command procedures calling
VDE. This logical name is write-only; VDE does not translate it and
users should not modify the contents.)
   VDE$NOTES_LIBRARY
         When defined, the translation of this logical name
         is used to override the default SCT notes conference
         specification of NOTES$LIBRARY:.NOTE. Among the obvious
         use in relocating the SCT notes conferences to a remote
         node or remote cluster, this logical name can be defined
         as 0::NOTES$LIBRARY:.NOTE to force all SCT note entries
         to made via the notes server process(es). Only one notes
         conference default specification is possible per node.
   VDE$OFFLINE
         When defined, disables VDE. The translation is assumed
         to contain the reason why the VDE environment is offline,
         and is displayed to all VDE users. Only fully-privileged
         definitions of this logical name are accepted and
         processed.
   VDE$REPLACE_DEFAULT
         If defined, this logical contains "EDIT", "FILE", or
         "NOTE", and selects the default processing for the
         location of the SCT note. If undefined or defined to
         an invalid value, VDE defaults to "EDIT", as indicated
         by the brackets in the "Enter file to load into SCT:
         (filename/[EDIT]/NOTE)" prompt. The brackets will indicate
         the default for the prompt.
not translate it and users should not modify the contents.
For further information on prompting for SCT notes, see the
documentation on the REPLACE command.)
   VDE$SCRATCH
         A logical name that translates into the directory
         specification for the VDE scratch directory. If this
         logical name is not specified, a [.VDE$SCRATCH]
         subdirectory will be created underneath the SYS$SCRATCH:
         directory, and the logical name VDE$SCRATCH will be defined
         to reference it.
   VDE$TEMPLATES
         References the device and directory that contains the
         predefined SCT template files SCT-NEW.TEMPLATE, and SCT-
         BUG.TEMPLATE. This logical name is used during the REPLACE
         command. This logical name definition is optional-no
         default SCT template is available if this logical name
         is not defined, or if the two template files are not
         located. In either case, the user is placed in the chosen
         text editor and must include the appropriate template file
         manually.
   VDE$WHEREIS_BACKUPS_AFTER_IMAGE
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to locate the after-image BACKUP files.
   VDE$WHEREIS_BACKUPS_ARCHIVE
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to locate the database backup archival directory.
   VDE$WHEREIS_BACKUPS_CURRENT
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to locate the database backup directory
         containing the most recent backups.
   VDE$WHEREIS_BACKUP_FULL
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the filename used for the full
         backups.
   VDE$WHEREIS_BACKUP_INCR
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the filename used for incremental
         backups.
   VDE$WHEREIS_BUILD
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. This logical is not
         fully implemented.
   VDE$WHEREIS_CMS
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the root specification of the CMS
         library.
   VDE$WHEREIS_DATABASE
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the specification of the directory
         containing the root database file.
   VDE$WHEREIS_LABEL
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the text label associated with a
         particular database.
   VDE$WHEREIS_MNEMONIC
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the mnemonic name associated with
         a particular database.
   VDE$WHEREIS_STAGING
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the root specification of the staging
         area for a VDE database.
   VDE$WHEREIS_STATISTICS
         Output from the VDE/WHEREIS command. Allows a command
         procedure to retrieve the specification of the statistics
         database file for a VDE database.
 

1  Error_Messages
   This section describes the various error messages that can be
   reported by the components of the VDE package.
 

2  ABKEYW
ambiguous qualifier or keyword 'text' - supply more characters

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: VDE cannot complete the command because 'text' is
   ambiguous in the context of this command.
 

2  ABTBADST
VDE may be in an inconsistent internal state

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The user has typed 3 or more CTRL/Cs. VDE normally
   responds to a CTRL/C by continuing execution until a consistent
   internal state is achieved and then aborts the current command.
   However, if VDE is in an infinite loop and does not detect this
   "consistent" state, it will abort anyway after the 3rd CTRL/C.

   User Action: Leave and enter VDE again to make sure the internal
   state is consistent.
 

2  ABTCNTLC
command aborted by Control-C

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The current VDE command has been aborted due to a
   control C issued by the user. VDE will attempt to gracefully
   recover.

   User Action: Issue another command to VDE. It has gracefully to a
   consistent internal state.

2  ARCHADDED
architecture architecture added to the database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that the indicated
   architecture definition has been added to the VDE database. This
   message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the
   CREATE ARCHITECTURE command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  ARCHDEL
architecture architecture deleted from the database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that the definition for the
   indicated architecture has been deleted from the VDE database.
   This message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on
   the DELETE ARCHITECTURE command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  ARCHEXISTS
architecture architecture already exists in database; not changed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated architecture name was specified on a
   CREATE ARCHITECTURE command, but an entry for that architecture
   is already present in the database. Hence a new entry was not
   created for that architecture. Alternatively, the indicated name
   was specified as the new name for an existing architecture on the
   MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command, but another architecture already
   has the requested new name. Hence the name of the existing
   architecture could not be changed to the new name.

   User Action: If you entered the wrong architecture name, reenter
   the command with the correct name. If you entered the right
   architecture name, use the SHOW ARCHITECTURE command to display
   the database information for that architecture. If you are not
   satisfied with that information, use the MODIFY ARCHITECTURE
   command to change it.
 

2  ARCHMOD
information for architecture architecture modified in the database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that information for the
   indicated architecture has been modified in the VDE database.
   This message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on
   the MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  ARCHNOTDEL
architecture architecture not deleted

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You are attempting to delete an architecture that
   cannot be deleted. Additional messages are normally included with
   this message, and these messages indicate why the architecture
   cannot be deleted.

   User Action: Resolve the problem(s) flagged by the other error
   messages, and reenter the DELETE ARCHITECTURE command.
 

2  ARCHNOTFOUND
architecture architecture not found in database; parameter ignored

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated architecture name was entered on a
   SHOW ARCHITECTURE command, but no such architecture was found in
   the VDE database.

   User Action: This is not necessarily an error; the message simply
   tells you that the indicated architecture does not exist in the
   database.
 

2  ARCHSYNTAX
invalid architecture name syntax: name

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The name or format specified for the architecture
   name is not using valid syntax.

   User Action: Respecify the architecture name using only
   alphanumeric, underscore, dollar sign and hyphen characters.
 

2  AREASON

   Explanation: The current script has invoked the indicated script
   function (such as $DIR or $FACROOT), but the directory location
   specified with that function invocation is not found in the VDE
   database. This may mean that the directory tree for the specified
   stream or facility has not been created, or that the function
   invocation specifies a directory symbol that is not used for that
   stream and facility.

   User Action: Create the directory tree for the facility or
   stream, or correct the directory symbol name in the function
   call. Then reissue the command that invokes the script.
 

2  DIRSPECREQ

2  EXPGENDIFF
expected generation expression expression differs from actual
expression

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: When you reserved the module you are replacing,
   the RESERVE command displayed the expected replace-time CMS
   generation expression of the new module generation. However,
   the actual CMS generation expression that VDE assigned during
   the current replacement differs from that expected generation
   expression. This situation is normal because VDE cannot predict
   the actual replace-time CMS generation expression when you
   reserve the module; it can only tell you the most likely
   generation expression. By the time you replace the module,
   various circumstances can change the appropriate generation
   expression to use.

   User Action: None. This message is informational only. However,
   if you used the expected CMS generation expression in code
   comments, you may have to change those comments.
 

2  EXPGENEXPR
expected generation expression at replacement is generation

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: When you replace the module you just reserved, the
   new generation of the module is expected to have the indicated
   CMS generation expression. You may use this generation expression
   as an "audit trail identifier" in the comments in your code if
   your project uses that convention. The indicated generation
   expression may differ from the one that VDE actually assigns
   when you replace the module, but only in certain unusual
   circumstances.

   User Action: None. This message is informational only.
 

2  EXPGENLONG
expected CMS generation expression is too long

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The expected replace-time CMS generation expression
   for the module you are reserving will be longer than 16
   characters, which is longer than CMS allows. As a result, you
   cannot reserve the module.

   User Action: This error indicates that you have reserved and
   replaced modules on too many nested non-main streams. You should
   create new streams off the main development stream and place
   the offending generations there so that they have CMS generation
   expressions of modest size. Even though you cannot reserve the
   generation in question, you can still fetch it out and replace it
   into the new streams.

   Explanation: The indicated facility name was specified on a
   CREATE FACILITY command, but an entry for that facility is
   already present in the database. Alternatively, the indicated
   name was specified as the new name for an existing facility using
   the MODIFY FACILITY command, but another facility already has
   the requested new name. In either case, the command fails and the
   facility is not created or modified.

   User Action: If you entered the wrong facility name, reenter the
   command with the correct name. If you entered the right facility
   name, use the SHOW FACILITY command to display the database
   information for that facility. If you are not satisfied with
   that information, use the MODIFY FACILITY command to change it.
 

2  FACMOD

2  FOLDEXP
fold record for fold expected for stream stream

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that VDE expects to
   generate a fold record for the indicated stream. The fold
   record will be generated when this module change is approved and
   performed by the project leader-when the queued replacement is
   performed. Because there may be a delay before the replacement
   is performed by the project leader and because the project
   leader may reject the replacement, the fold record will not
   immediately appear via commands such as SHOW REPLACEMENT. The
   fold will be generated when VDE sends you the notification that
   the replacement has been performed. This message is only issued
   when you use the /LOG qualifier on the REPLACE command, and only
   for a queued replacement from which VDE expects to generate a
   fold record.

   User Action: You may/will need to resolve the fold record that
   will (eventually) be generated by this replacement. Use the
   /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish to see the
   message.
 

2  FOLDIDREQ
fold identifier required for module module

   uniquely indicate to which fold record you want the command to
   apply.

   User Action: Reissue the command with the /IDENTIFICATION or
   /FOLD qualifier to indicate the specific fold record to which you
   want the command to apply.
 

2  FOLDIDUSED
fold identifier identifier already used for module module attempt to
create fold record has failed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You are trying to create a fold record for a module
   using the same fold identifier as you have used on a previous
   fold record for the same module in the same development stream.
   This is not allowed, since fold identifiers must be unique.

   User Action: Reissue the CREATE FOLD command with a different
   fold identifier specified on the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.
   Alternatively, you can omit the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, in
   which case VDE will assign a unique identifier for you.
 

2  FOLDINSTRM
generation generation must be folded into stream stream

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that you must manually fold
   the indicated module generation into the indicated development
   stream in order to propagate the changes in that generation
   into the stream. VDE cannot propagate the changes automatically
   because the module has already diverged between that stream and
   its predecessor. This message is only issued when you use the
   /LOG qualifier on the REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.

   deleted in either of these cases.

   User Action: Check that you have specified the correct generation
   for deletion.
 

2  GENNOPRED
generation generation of module has no predecessor

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The generation of the indicated module with the
   shown CMS generation expression does not have a predecessor
   generation. As a result, the current operation cannot be
   performed. For example, the DIFFERENCES command cannot compare
   generation 1 with its predecessor because it has no predecessor.

   User Action: Specify a generation that has a predecessor
   (normally any generation except generation 1) and rerun the
   command.
 

2  GENNOTCLASSMEM

2  MODALRQUEREP
module module already queued for replacement replacement

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have tried to replace or unreserve a module
   that already belongs to the indicated queued replacement. A
   reservation that already belongs to a queued replacement cannot
   be unreserved or queued for another replacement; the reservation
   remains until the original replacement is performed or cancelled.
   As a result, your attempt to replace or unreserve the module has
   failed.

   User Action: If you want to remove the module reservation from
   its current queued replacement, you must cancel that replacement
   with the CANCEL REPLACEMENT command. You can then unreserve the
   module or replace it as part of another replacement.
 

2  MODALRRES
module module already reserved; reservation has failed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have tried to reserve a module that is already
   reserved by another user (possibly yourself). That reservation
   does not allow concurrent reservations, or you have not requested
   a concurrent reservation. The reservation may be in the current
   default stream, or in an ancestor stream. As a result of this
   prior reservation, your attempt to reserve the module has failed.

   User Action: Wait until the user who has reserved the module
   replaces it in the library. Then reserve it yourself. You can
   use the SHOW RESERVATION/FULL command to see who currently has
   the module reserved, and in what stream the module was originally
   reserved. Alternatively, you can use the /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT
   qualifier to concurrently reserve the module, or the /QUEUE
   qualifier to queue a request for notification when the module
   becomes available.

   not wish to see the message.
 

2  MODEXISTS
module module already exists in database; module not changed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated module name was specified on a CREATE
   MODULE command, but an entry for that module is already present
   in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that
   module. Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as the
   new name for an existing module on the MODIFY MODULE command, but
   another module in the same facility already has the requested new
   name. Hence the name of the existing module could not be changed
   to the new name.

   User Action: If you entered the wrong module name, reenter
   the command with the correct name. If you entered the right
   module name, use the SHOW MODULE command to display the database
   information for that module. If you are not satisfied with that
   information, use the MODIFY MODULE command to change it.
 

2  MODINSTEP

   being replaced by another user who is updating the same
   generation as you want to update. As a result, your replacement
   attempt failed.

   User Action: Wait a minute or two and then try the operation
   again. If the other user deleted your concurrent reservation
   through his or her replacement, your second attempt will fail
   with a message to that effect. If the other user's replacement
   failed or did not conflict with yours, your new replacement
   attempt can succeed.

   available libraries, issue the "SET LIBRARY" command with no
   parameters. As part of the error message, this command will
   display the names of the predefined VDE libraries, the Rdb root
   directory for each, and the mnemonic name for each. Once the
   mnemnonic name or the Rdb root directory name for the target
   library is known, one can: A) use the mnemnonic name or the Rdb
   root directory name as the libname parameter on a "SET LIBRARY
   libname" VDE command. B) Use use the mnemnonic name or the Rdb
   root directory name as the parameter on the VDE /LIBRARY=libname.

   User Action: Check your process's quotas.
 

2  NOSTAGROOT
no staging area root directory exists for library

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have tried to create queued replacement for
   some module, but no staging area root directory exists for the
   library. Hence VDE cannot create a disk directory for saving (or
   "staging") the files to be replaced.

   User Action: Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE/STAGING command to
   create the root directory for the library's staging areas.
   Then reenter the REPLACE command. Alternatively, replace the
   module with an immediate (as opposed to queued) replacement. An
   immediate replacement does not use a staging area.
 

2  NOSTRMROOT
no stream root directory exists for stream stream

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have tried to create a directory tree for
   a specific facility within the current stream, but no root
   directory exists for the stream. Hence VDE cannot create any
   disk directories for the indicated facility.

   User Action: Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create a
   directory tree for the current stream. That will automatically
   create both the stream root directory and the subdirectories for
   all facilities.
 

2  NOSTRMSPEC
no stream specified for operation

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The command you have entered requires that you
   specify the name of a development stream, either with the /STREAM
   qualifier or as a command parameter, but the stream name is
   missing on the entered command.

   required.
 

2  NOSUCHARCH
architecture architecture not found in database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated architecture name was entered on a
   command, but no such architecture was found in the VDE database.

   User Action: This is not necessarily an error; the message simply
   tells you that the indicated architecture does not exist in the
   database. However, if you had expected such an architecture
   to exist, you may use the SHOW ARCHITECTURE command to see
   what architectures are found in the database. If the desired
   architecture is not there, ask your project administator to
   add it to the database. Then reenter your command with a valid
   architecture name.
 

2  NOSUCHCTX

   the database. However, if you had expected such a context to
   exist, you may use the SHOW CONTEXT command to see what contexts
   are found in the database.
 

2  NOSUCHDIRSYM
directory symbol symbol not found in database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated directory symbol was referenced by
   a script but no such directory symbol was found in the VDE
   database. VDE tried to use the directory symbol either to look
   up the directory location for the script's DCL command file or
   to evaluate a script function such as $DIR or $STRMDIR. The most
   likely reason for the error is that you used a script function
   that takes a directory symbol as a parameter, and you misspelled
   the symbol name or specified a symbol you have not yet defined.
   Directory symbols are defined with the /SYMBOL qualifier of the
   SET DIRECTORY command.

   User Action: Correct the script function call to have a correct
   directory symbol that is already defined. Then reenter the script
   in the database with the CREATE SCRIPT command and reenter the
   command that got the error message.
 

2  NOSUCHFAC
facility facility not found in database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated facility name was entered on a
   command, but no such facility was found in the VDE database.

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have tried to reference a fold record with the
   indicated fold identifier for the indicated module and stream,
   but there is no such fold record in the VDE database. As a
   result, VDE has aborted the current command and rolled back the
   current transaction.

   User Action: Specify a valid fold record and reenter the command.
 

2  NOSUCHFUNC
no such script function exists: function

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated script function was specified in a
   VDE script, but no such function exists. The most likely cause
   for this error is that you misspelled the function name. VDE
   recognizes a script function by the fact that all script function
   names begin with a dollar sign. Directory symbol names, which
   can appear in the same places as functions in scripts, should not
   begin with dollar signs.

   User Action: Correct the spelling of the function name or select
   a directory symbol name that does not begin with a dollar sign.
 

2  NOSUCHGEN
generation generation not found in database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated module generation was entered on a

   User Action: This is not necessarily an error; the message
   simply tells you that the indicated replacemen does not exist
   in the database. However, if you had expected such a replacemen
   to exist, you may use the SHOW REPLACMENT command to see
   what replacements are found in the database. If the desired
   replacement is not there, ask your project administator to
   add it to the database. Then reenter your command with a valid
   replacement name.
 

2  NOSUCHRES
reservation reservation for module module not found

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   the SHOW USER * command to see what usernames are found in the
   database. If the desired user is not there, ask your project
   administator to add that user to the database. Then reenter your
   command with a valid username.
 

2  NOTCONNLIB
you are not connected to a VDE library; command not performed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You are trying to perform a command that requires
   you to be connected to an existing VDE library, but you are
   not connected to such a library. This normally means that
   you have not defined logical name VDE$LIBRARY to point to the

   the location of the output file containing the fetched module
   generation.

   User Action: None. This is an informational message.
 

2  OUTMODSRC
output module module of build step is a source module; ignored

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The automatically collected dependency information
   for the current build step specifies that the indicated module
   is an output from the step. However, the module is marked as a
   source module in the VDE database, and a source module cannot be
   an output of a build step. Hence this dependency information is
   ignored and is not recorded in the database.

   User Action: If the module is erroneously marked as a source
   module in the VDE database, you should delete the module and
   rerun the build step. If the module actually is a source module,
   you should investigate why the compiler or other processor
   specifies it as an output from the build step.
 

2  OUTNLA0
if /OUTPUT=NLA0: was used, respecify with non-null output

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message suggests a workaround for a failure
   to fetch a module-this situation occurs only when fetching
   or reserving a module that uses a marker file, and when
   /OUTPUT=NLA0: was specified on the command. The underlying
   problem will be fixed in a future release of VDE.

   User Action: If fetching or reserving a module that uses a marker
   file, respecify the command with a non-null output device and
   directory.
 

2  OVERRIDE

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: A VDE command line may only consist of records that
   are less than 1024 characters long.

   User Action: If you want more than 1024 characters for input,
   divide each line into records that are less than 1024 characters
   and use the continuation character "-" at the point of each
   break. If the sum of these records are greater than 32,768
   characters, then the complete command line cannot be processed.
 

2  PREFIXNOTALL
prefix VDE$ not allowed in facility or stream names

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have tried to create or rename a facility or
   stream with a name that begins with the prefix "VDE$" but VDE
   does not allow facilities or streams to have such names. VDE uses
   facility and stream names as disk directory names, but VDE also
   creates directories reserved for its own use whose names always
   begin with the VDE$ prefix. To prevent name conflicts between
   facility or stream directories and these reserved directories,
   VDE does not allow facility or stream names to begin with the
   VDE$ prefix.

   User Action: Reenter the command with a facility or stream name
   that does not begin with VDE$.

   REPLACE command, but an entry for that replacement is already
   present in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for
   that replacement. Alternatively, the indicated name was specified
   as the new name for an existing replacement on the MODIFY
   REPLACEMENT command, but another replacement already has the
   requested new name. Hence the name of the existing replacement
   could not be changed to the new name.

   User Action: If you entered the wrong replacement name, reenter
   the command with the correct name. If you entered the right
   replacement name, use the SHOW REPLACEMENT command to display
   the database information for that replacement. If you are not

   User Action: Correct the module name to be the name of an
   existing module or create the module with the CREATE MODULE
   command before reentering the CREATE STEP command.
 

2  STEPNOTFOUND
build step for module module not found in database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have specified a build step that does not exist
   in the VDE database. As a result, the current MODIFY STEP command
   cannot modify any information in the database.

   User Action: Reenter the command specifying an existing build
   step or create the desired build step with the CREATE STEP
   command.
 

2  STEPNOTMOD
build step not modified; module module not found in database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have specified a module that does not exist
   in the VDE database as the primary input or output module for a
   build step. As a result, the MODIFY STEP command cannot modify
   database information.

   User Action: Correct the module name to be the name of an
   existing module before reentering the MODIFY STEP command, or
   create the module with the CREATE MODULE command and enter the

   procedures.

   User Action: Embed some of the command procedures within others
   to decrease the level of nesting to fewer than 16.
 

2  STRMADDED
stream stream added to the database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that the indicated stream
   definition has been added to the VDE database. This message is
   only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the CREATE STREAM
   command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  STRMCLOSED
stream stream is permanently closed; state not changed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You have tried to change the state of a stream
   development stream with the /OPEN or /FROZEN qualifier on
   the MODIFY STREAM command when the stream is already in the
   permanently closed state. The rest of the command still takes
   effect, but the stream state is not changed; the stream remains
   closed.

   User Action: No user action is necessary; the state cannot be
   changed and the command did not change it.
 

2  STRMDEL
stream stream deleted from the database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that the definition for
   the indicated stream has been deleted from the VDE database. This
   message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the
   DELETE STREAM command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  STRMEXISTS
stream stream already exists in database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated stream name was specified on a CREATE
   STREAM command, but an entry for that stream is already present
   in the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that
   stream. Alternatively, the indicated name was specified as the
   new name for an existing stream on the MODIFY STREAM command, but
   another stream already has the requested new name. Hence the name
   of the existing stream could not be changed to the new name.

   User Action: If you entered the wrong stream name, reenter
   the command with the correct name. If you entered the right
   stream name, use the SHOW STREAM command to display the database
   information for that stream. If you are not satisfied with that
   information, use the MODIFY STREAM command to change it.
 

2  STRMMOD
information for stream stream modified in the database

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that information for the
   indicated stream has been modified in the VDE database. This
   message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on the
   MODIFY STREAM command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  STRMNOTCLOSED
stream stream can not be deleted because it is not closed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You are trying to delete a stream which is in an
   open or frozen state. Only streams in a closed state may be
   deleted.

   User Action: If appropriate, change the state of the stream to
   closed and repeat the delete stream command.
 

2  STRMNOTDEL
stream stream not deleted

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You are attempting to delete a stream that cannot
   be deleted. Additional messages are normally included with this
   message, and these messages indicate why the strean cannot be
   deleted.

   User Action: Resolve the problem(s) flagged by the other error
   messages, and reenter the DELETE STREAM command.
 

2  STRMNOTFOUND
stream stream not found in database; parameter ignored

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated stream name was entered on a SHOW
   STREAM command, but no such stream was found in the VDE database.

   User Action: This is not necessarily an error; the message
   simply tells you that the indicated stream does not exist in
   the database.
 

2  STRMNOTOPEN
stream stream is not open; operation not allowed

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You are trying to reserve or replace a module,
   but the currently active stream (whose name is given in the
   message) is either frozen or closed. It is thus not open for
   the reservation or replacement of modules.

   User Action: You can use the SHOW STREAM/FULL command to see
   the status of the current stream. If the stream is closed, it is
   permanently protected against being changed, and you should not
   be trying to reserve or replace modules in it. If the stream
   is frozen, it is currently protected against being changed,
   but changes may be allowed later when the library administrator
   sets the state back to open. You must then wait until the stream
   becomes open. (You may reserve modules from a frozen stream, but
   not replace them.) Finally, if you meant to reserve or replace
   modules in another stream, you should use the SET STREAM command
   to switch your context to that stream and then reserve or replace
   the desired modules.
 

2  STRMNOTPOP
stream stream is not allowed to be populated

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: You are attempting to populate the indicated stream
   with the POPULATE STREAM command but a stream attribute disallows
   use of this command for the stream. Hence the stream has not been
   populated.

   User Action: Either you should not be trying to populate the
   stream or else you must set the stream attribute that allows
   you to populate the stream before retrying the operation. To set
   that attribute, use the /POPULATE qualifier to the MODIFY STREAM
   command.
 

2  STRMPOP
stream stream populated from stream stream

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message informs you that the indicated stream
   has been populated with all generations from the second indicated
   stream. This message is only issued when you use the /LOG
   qualifier on the POPULATE STREAM command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  STRMPOPCOUNT
populate module counts: update count, insert count, remove count

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: This message tells you how many modules were updated
   in, inserted into, and removed from the target stream by the
   current POPULATE STREAM command. This message is only issued when
   you use the /LOG qualifier on the POPULATE STREAM command.

   User Action: Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do
   not wish to see the message.
 

2  STRTOOLONG
quoted string too long; must be shortened

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The maximum length of the quoted string is
   determined by the nature of the string. For the DEFINE command,
   the string is limited to 255 characters. For remark strings, it
   is limited to 132 characters.

   User Action: Try to shorten the size of the string.
 

2  SUCGENEXIST
successor generation for module already exists in library

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The new generation of the indicated module created
   by the current REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command should
   get a whole-number CMS generation expression but the reserved
   generation already has a successor generation in the VDE library
   with that whole-number CMS generation expression. This situation
   can arise if you have placed the reserved generation into a
   stream using the INSERT GENERATION command or if you have changed
   the stream that "owns" the whole-number successor generation with
   the /MAIN_STREAM qualifier to the MODIFY GENERATION command.

   User Action: If the existing whole-number successor generation
   should not be in the VDE library, delete it and its successors
   with the DELETE GENERATION command. Then repeat the failed
   replacement. Otherwise, use the /MAIN_STREAM qualifier to the
   MODIFY GENERATION command to allocate ownership of the whole-
   number successor generation to the stream that already owns that
   generation, but not to any stream into which you are trying to
   replace the module. This will force the replacement to use a CMS
   variant letter. Then repeat the replacement.
 

2  SUCLNKADD
successor link from stream stream to stream stream added

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The successor stream relationship, from the first
   stream specified to the second stream specified, has been added.

   than one history or notes parameter. This is not allowed.

   User Action: Reenter the command with a valid history or notes
   string.
 

2  TRANTOODEEP
translation of logical name logical more than 7 deep

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The indicated logical name is either too deeply
   nested, or is defined incorrectly to point back to itself causing
   an infinite translation loop.

   User Action: Reenter the command without using the logical name.

2  UNACONVDBFORM
unable to convert database format due to access conflict with
another user

   Facility: VDE, OpenVMS Development Environment

   Explanation: The VDE database does not have the format required
   by the current version of VDE and VDE has attempted to convert
   the database to the required format. This operation has failed
   because of an access conflict with another user attempting
   to convert the database at the same time. That other user has
   probably succeeded in converting the database format, which is
   why you cannot do so.

   User Action: Retry the CONVERT LIBRARY command and try accessing
   the database again. You should find that you are now able to
   convert the database format or that the format has already been
   converted. Either way, you should be able to use VDE with that
   database.

   Explanation: The indicated username was specified on a CREATE
   USER command, but an entry for that user is already present in
   the database. Hence a new entry was not created for that user.
   Alternatively, the indicated username was specified as the new
   username for an existing user on the MODIFY USER command, but
   another user already has the requested new username. Hence the
   username of the existing user could not be changed to the new
   username.

   User Action: If you entered the wrong username, reenter the
   command with the correct username. If you entered the right
   username, use the SHOW USER command to display the database
   information for that user. If you are not satisfied with that
   information, use the MODIFY USER command to change it.
