<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
The FACDIFF command activates the utility from DCL and then acts on the 
library(s) specified.

<p>
The FACDIFF utility performs a number of functions. First it verifies 
that both class names specified are in fact part of the library(s) 
specified. If there are any errors, FACDIFF reports them. An example of 
an error would be one of the classes specified is not present in the 
library.

<p>
FACDIFF then uses CMS to get a list of all elements in each class. From 
this list it determines which elements have changed generations between 
the two classes specified and displays this information. Optionally, a 
user can instruct FACDIFF to not only display information about 
different generations but it can also go in and verify that the code 
did in fact change.

<p>
Output can be formatted to the users needs. The output can contain 
pagination headers, or simply one header for each library processed. 
Also FACDIFF has the ability to put the output in a form that can be 
easily parsed by a user written utility (see the /FORMAT qualifier).
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>library-spec</h3>
  Specifies the CMS library that is to be acted on. This specification 
  can contain wildcards, but it must be a valid CMS library directory 
  specification (i.e. VMS$:[YELLOW_TEST.CMS]). An example of a wildcarded 
  specification would be: VMS$:[Y*.CMS]. This specification would process 
  all libraries that start with the letter "Y".
<h3>base-class</h3>
  Specifies the CMS class name that will be used as the basis for the 
  comparison.
<h3>target-class</h3>
  Specifies the CMS class name that will be compared to the base class.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Command Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/[NO]COMPARE</h3>
  Indicates that not only should the CMS generations be checked, but that 
  also the source code should be checked. This is useful when trying to 
  locate code that has changed generations, but the actual source code 
  has not changed.
<h3>/[NO]FORMAT</h3>
  Indicates that the user wants the output in the form of:
<br>
   /libraryspec/elementname/baseclassgeneration/targetclassgeneration/
<h3>/[NO]HEADER=(header_type[,header_type,...])</h3>
  Indicates what the user wants for header displays. The choices are:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]LIBRARY - Specifies that the user wants to see a header only 
  when a new library is being processed.
  <li>[NO]PAGE = Specifies that the user wants to see a header at the 
  beginning of each new page. <br>Note: for terminals a page is defined 
  as the size of the display screen.
</ul>

<h3>/[NO]LOG</h3>
  Specifies that the FACDIFF utility should display a message for every 
  LIBRARY that is processed.
<h3>/OUTPUT=file-specification</h3>
  Specifies the name of a file that is to contain all the output.

<p>
Note: error messages and informational messages will not be put into 
the output file.
<h3>/PROCESS=(attribute[,attribute,...])</h3>
  The PROCESS qualifier is used to identify what libraries are to be 
  processed. Some libraries have special attributes associated with them, 
  VMSCMS$NO_PROPAGATE.FLAG is an example of an attribute. This attribute 
  indicates that this library is not to have any code propagation 
  performed within it. The process qualifier is used to selectively 
  process or skip libraries marked with certain attributes. The list of 
  acceptable attributes is:

<ul>
  <li>[NO]ALL - process all libraries no matter what attribute it may have
  <li>[NO]ARCHIVEDFACILITY - process all archived libraries
  <li>[NO]FLAGFREE - process libraries with not attributes
  <li>[NO]NOPROPAGATE - process libraries marked no propagate
</ul>

<h3>/STATISTICS</h3>
  Specifies that statistical information should be collected and 
  displayed.
