<hr>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>dir-spec</h3>
Specifies the name of the root directory of the library. The root 
directory is the disk directory that contains the database of the 
library. It normally also contains subdirectories that hold the 
contents of the library. Use the OpenVMS directory specification 
format to specify the <strong>dir-spec</strong> parameter.

<p>
This parameter is required. If not specified, VDE prompts you 
for the name of the root directory.
<a name="index_x_186"></a>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
A VDE library is the repository for all the modules in your 
software system. A library consists of a top-level disk directory 
called the root directory, an Rdb database which resides in the root 
directory, and a number of directories (or subdirectories) which 
contain all the source modules, derived modules, and other components 
of your software system.

<p>
The CREATE LIBRARY command first creates a root directory for the new 
library and defines logical name VDE$LIBRARY to contain the
<a name="index_x_187"></a>
<a name="index_x_188"></a>
name of this directory. It then creates and initializes a VDE 
database in the root directory. The CREATE LIBRARY command normally 
also creates the disk directory structure that will hold all sources 
and other files that make up your software system. However, if the 
default directory structure is not appropriate for you, you can use the 
/DEFER qualifier to postpone directory creation until you have 
specified the directory structure that you want.

<p>
The VDE database is a multifile Rdb database. This database 
consists of three separate files: an Rdb root file (the .RDB file), a 
storage area file (the .RDA file), and a snapshot file (the .SNP file). 
The
<a name="index_x_189"></a>
<a name="index_x_190"></a>
.RDB file is always stored in the VDE library's root 
directory. This file is relatively small. The .RDA file stores the bulk 
of the database contents and the .SNP file allows multiple users to use 
the database concurrently. The .RDA and .SNP files are stored in the 
VDE library's
<a name="index_x_191"></a>
root directory by default, but you can specify different directory 
locations for these files with the /DATABASE and /SNAPSHOT qualifiers, 
or by defining the logical names VDE$DB_AREA and VDE$SNAPSHOT.
<a name="index_x_192"></a>
<a name="index_x_193"></a>
<a name="index_x_194"></a>
<a name="index_x_195"></a>
<a name="index_x_196"></a>
<a name="index_x_197"></a>
By placing these files on different disks, you can distribute your 
VDE library's space and I/O requirements across multiple 
disks.

<p>
You may also want to establish an Rdb after-image journal file for the 
VDE database. If used with the RMU database backup facility, 
such a journal file allows Rdb to recover all database data as of the 
last completed transaction after a disk failure. To establish 
journalling, use the /JOURNAL qualifier to specify the directory 
location of the journal file. This directory should always be on a 
different physical disk than the rest of your VDE database.

<p>
Once you have created a new VDE library, that library becomes 
the current VDE library for your present process so that 
subsequent VDE commands act upon that library. To change the 
current VDE library, you must use the SET LIBRARY command or 
redefine logical name
<a name="index_x_198"></a>
<a name="index_x_199"></a>
VDE$LIBRARY to point to the root directory of the VDE library 
you want to work with.

<p>
Most steps in creating a new VDE library are reasonably fast. 
For example, each directory in your directory structure is created in a 
fraction of a second unless your system is heavily loaded. However, 
VDE requires several minutes to create and initialize the 
library database. The database can usually be created in about six to 
eight minutes but more time may be required on a heavily loaded system. 
A log message tells you when database creation starts.

<hr>
<h2>Qualifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ALLOW_DELETE (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOALLOW_DELETE</h3>
Specifies the default value for the <strong>delete</strong> attribute 
for new modules, facilities, and streams. The /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier 
causes VDE to set the <strong>delete</strong> attribute by 
default when users create new such entities. As a result, users can 
delete these entities without first having to set the 
<strong>delete</strong> attribute with a separate MODIFY command. The 
/NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier causes VDE to clear the 
<strong>delete</strong> attribute by default for new modules, 
facilities, and streams. As a result, it is harder for a user to delete 
an entity by mistake; the entity's <strong>delete</strong> attribute 
must be set with a separate MODIFY command before the entity can be 
deleted with a DELETE command. When creating new modules, facilities, 
and streams, you can override this default setting with an explicit 
/DELETE or /NODELETE qualifier to the CREATE command.

<p>
Use the /ALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you expect to make frequent changes 
to your library, often deleting modules, facilities, and streams. Use 
the /NOALLOW_DELETE qualifier if you are more concerned about 
preventing accidental deletion of such entities.
<h3>/ASK_INFO_FILE</h3>
<h3>/NOASK_INFO_FILE (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the user 
whether he or she wants to edit an information file when creating a
<a name="index_x_200"></a>
queued replacement. The /ASK_INFO_FILE qualifier sets a library 
attribute that causes the REPLACE command to ask for an information 
file by default. The /NOASK_INFO_FILE qualifier clears this library 
attribute so that the REPLACE command does not ask for an information 
file by default. This library attribute only affects queued 
replacements (not immediate replacements), and it only affects the 
REPLACE command's default behavior; users can always use the command's 
/INFORMATION or /NOINFORMATION qualifier to explicitly request either 
behavior.
<h3>/ASK_REPL_CAUSE</h3>
<h3>/NOASK_REPL_CAUSE (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the REPLACE command should by default ask the user 
for the &quot;cause&quot; of the replacement. The cause may be a fold 
operation, a Source Control Tracking (SCT) entry in a Notes conference,
<a name="index_x_201"></a>
<a name="index_x_202"></a>
<a name="index_x_203"></a>
or some other cause. The /ASK_REPL_CAUSE qualifier sets a library 
attribute that causes the REPLACE command to query the user for the 
cause of the replacement. The /NOASK_REPL_CAUSE qualifier clears this 
library attribute so that the REPLACE command does not ask for this 
information.
<h3>/AUTH_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies the standard authorized privileges for the library. These are 
the authorized privileges that a new user gets when added to the 
library unless a different set of authorized privileges is explicitly 
specified for that user. Authorized privileges are those VDE 
privileges the user is allowed to set with the SET PRIVILEGE command.

<p>
If only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted. If 
this qualifier is omitted entirely, VDE provides default 
values for the standard authorized privileges of the library.

<p>
Each <strong>priv</strong> parameter specifies the name of one 
privilege. For a list of privileges, see <a href="vde_manual_028.html#tbl_privileges">Table 3-5</a> in <a href="vde_manual_028.html#vde_cmd_set_priv">SET PRIVILEGES</a>.
<h3>/AUTO_ADD_USER[=rights-ident]</h3>
<h3>/NOAUTO_ADD_USER (default)</h3>
Specifies whether new users should be added to the library database 
automatically when they first access the library. The /AUTO_ADD_USER 
qualifier specifies that new users should be added to the library 
database automatically when they first access the library. If the 
<strong>rights-ident</strong> parameter is specified, new users are 
only added to the library if they hold the OpenVMS rights 
identifier specified by the parameter. The /NOAUTO_ADD_USER qualifier 
specifies that new users not be added to the library database 
automatically. In this case, new users can only be added with explicit 
CREATE USER commands.

<p>
The owner information specified in the OpenVMS SYSUAF
<a name="index_x_204"></a>
 database will be used as the owner of any new VDE username 
 created. VDE will ignore any leading numerics, leading 
 hyphens, leading space characters, and leading tilde characters, listed 
 in the SYSUAF owner field.
<h3>/AUTO_CONVERT</h3>
<h3>/NOAUTO_CONVERT (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the library and its database are automatically 
converted to the new library format when a new version of VDE 
is used on the library. A new version of VDE will frequently 
require a different database schema and possibly other changes to a 
library than the previous version. Each new version of VDE 
can convert a VDE library from an older format to the current 
format. This is either done automatically the first time someone 
accesses the library database, or it is done with an explicity CONVERT 
LIBRARY command. These qualifiers determine the behaviour.
<a name="index_x_205"></a>
<a name="index_x_206"></a>

<p>
The /AUTO_CONVERT qualifier specifies that the library should be 
converted automatically the first time a user uses a new version of 
VDE on the present library and its database. /NOAUTO_CONVERT 
specifies that the library should not be converted automatically; 
instead a privileged user must explicitly convert the library with the 
CONVERT LIBRARY command.

<p>
The advantage of automatic conversion is that it is automatic and 
requires no special steps on the part of the user. However, once a 
library has been converted, it is not possible to use an older version 
of VDE on that library.

<p>
The advantage of disabling automatic conversion is that you get a 
chance to back up the database (or the whole library) before you 
explicitly convert the library. You then have the option of restoring 
the backed up copy of the library if you need to go back to using the 
old version of VDE. However, once you install a new version 
of VDE, nobody can use the existing library until it is 
converted. Also, all accessors must use the same or a compatible 
version of VDE.

<p>
In general, automatic conversion is best for small VDE 
libraries whose databases are relatively easy to rebuild if necessary. 
Explicit conversion may be more suitable for large libraries where the 
difficulty of rebuilding the library justifies more stringent backup 
and recovery procedures.

<p>
/NOAUTO_CONVERT is the default.
<h3>/AUTO_MAIL (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOAUTO_MAIL</h3>
<a name="index_x_207"></a>
Specifies whether VDE should automatically send mail 
notification to the user who has queued a replacement when that 
replacement is later performed. The /AUTO_MAIL qualifier sets a library 
attribute that causes the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to send such mail 
notification. The /NOAUTO_MAIL qualifier clears this library attribute 
so that the PERFORM REPLACEMENT command does not send such notification.
<h3>/CMS_ELEM_HIST (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOCMS_ELEM_HIST</h3>
Specifies whether VDE creates the CMS elements for new 
modules with default CMS history and notes strings. The /CMS_ELEM_HIST 
qualifier causes VDE to
<a name="index_x_208"></a>
create the CMS elements for new modules with default history and notes 
strings and the /NOCMS_ELEM_HIST qualifier causes VDE to 
create CMS elements with no default history or notes strings. 
/NOCMS_ELEM_HIST is normally only used if you regularly fetch 
VDE modules using the CMS FETCH command and you want to make 
sure you do not get CMS history or notes by default. If you always 
fetch through VDE, use /CMS_ELEM_HIST because it allows 
VDE to avoid a deficiency in CMS and always give and remove 
history information correctly.
<h3>/CREATOR_NAME="string"</h3>
Specifies the full name of the user who created the library. The quoted 
name string, which may be up to 40 characters long, should contain your 
first name, middle initial, and last name. The CREATE LIBRARY command 
automatically creates a user record in the new library for the 
library's creator. This name string becomes part of that user record.

<p>
This qualifier is required. An empty name string may be specified but 
this is not recommended. If the /CREATOR_NAME qualifier for a library 
is not specified, VDE prompts you for the name string.
<a name="index_x_209"></a>
<h3>/DATABASE=dir-spec</h3>
Specifies that the database storage area (.RDA) file and the snapshot 
(.SNP) file be created in the directory location given by the 
<strong>dir-spec</strong> parameter. This qualifier lets you put the 
largest part of the VDE database on a different disk than the 
rest of the VDE library. If you omit this qualifier, 
VDE creates the .RDA and .SNP files in the VDE 
library's root directory.
<a name="index_x_210"></a>
<a name="index_x_211"></a>
<h3>/DEFER</h3>
<h3>/NODEFER (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the creation of the directory structure for the new 
library should be postponed. The /DEFER qualifier postpones creation of 
the disk directory structure for the library and the /NODEFER qualifier 
causes the directory structure to be created immediately. Use the 
/DEFER qualifier when the default directory structure is inappropriate 
for the new library.

<p>
If the /NODEFER qualifier is specified (or /DEFER is omitted), the 
CREATE LIBRARY command first creates the root directory and the 
VDE database for the library. Then it creates the remaining 
disk directory structure for the library. This structure, which 
includes directories to hold delta-files for one facility and 
directories to hold files for one development stream, is determined by 
the default rules of the utility. Once the directory structure exists, 
source modules and other files can be added to the new library.

<p>
If the /DEFER qualifier is specified, the CREATE LIBRARY command 
creates only the library's root directory and its database; it does not 
create the remaining directory structure for the new library. If you 
use the /DEFER qualifier, you can enter SET DIRECTORY commands to 
specify the disk directories you want for the library. Then use the 
CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create that directory structure on 
disk. The CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command uses VDE defaults 
combined with the rules you specified with SET DIRECTORY commands to 
create the new directory structure.
<h3>/DEF_PRIVILEGES=(priv [,priv...])</h3>
Specifies the standard default privileges for the library. These are 
the default privileges that a new user gets when added to the library 
unless a different set of default privileges is explicitly specified 
for that user. Default privileges are those VDE privileges 
that are enabled each time the user starts a VDE session.

<p>
If only one privilege is specified, the parentheses may be omitted. If 
this qualifier is omitted entirely, VDE provides default 
values for the standard default privileges of the library.

<p>
Each <strong>priv</strong> parameter specifies the name of one 
privilege. For a list of privileges, see <a href="vde_manual_028.html#tbl_privileges">Table 3-5</a> in <a href="vde_manual_028.html#vde_cmd_set_priv">SET PRIVILEGES</a>.

<p>
Each privilege specified becomes a standard authorized privilege as 
well as a standard default privilege. This rule ensures that users are 
authorized to have all their default privileges.
<h3>/HISTORY_NOTES (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOHISTORY_NOTES</h3>
Specifies whether VDE's RESERVE command can produce CMS 
history or notes
<a name="index_x_212"></a>
<a name="index_x_213"></a>
information in its output files. The /HISTORY_NOTES qualifier allows 
the RESERVE command to produce history and notes information and to 
accept the /HISTORY, /NOTES, and /POSITION qualifiers. The 
/NOHISTORY_NOTES qualifier causes the RESERVE command to never produce 
history and notes information (even when such information is the 
default for a module being reserved) and to not accept the /HISTORY, 
/NOTES, and /POSITION qualifiers. In this case, you must use the 
VDE FETCH command to get CMS history or
<a name="index_x_214"></a>
<a name="index_x_215"></a>
notes information for a module. Disabling history and notes information 
in reserved files makes certain mistakes less likely where such 
information gets replaced into the VDE library as part of the 
module text.
<h3>/JOURNAL=dir-spec</h3>
Enables after-image journalling and specifies that a database 
after-image journal (.AIJ) file be created in the directory location 
given by the <strong>dir-spec</strong> parameter. When used with the 
RMU backup and restore facilities, after-image journalling allows you 
to recover the up-to-date contents of your database after a disk 
failure. The specified directory should always reside on a different 
physical disk than any of your other database files so that the journal 
file cannot be damaged by the same disk failure as the database itself. 
If you omit this qualifier, VDE disables after-image 
journalling. Digital recommends that you always use journalling.
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Controls whether log messages are printed when the new library is 
created. The /LOG qualifier causes messages to be printed and the 
/NOLOG qualifier suppresses them. The messages indicate that the 
library and its many components have been created.
<h3>/NAME=lib-name</h3>
Specifies a name for the new library to be created. This name may be up 
to 39 characters long and must follow VDE name syntax. 
VDE stores this name in the database and displays it back to 
you when you enter the SHOW LIBRARY or SHOW DEFAULTS command. This 
qualifier is required; if you do not specify it, VDE prompts 
you for the library name.
<a name="index_x_216"></a>
<h3>/REMARK="string"</h3>
Specifies a remark string. The quoted remark string, which can be up to 
132 characters long, may contain any explanatory remark about the new 
library that you want stored in the library's database. Typically the 
remark describes the purpose or contents of the new library.

<p>
Although this qualifier is required, you can specify an empty remark 
string. If you do not specify the /REMARK qualifier, VDE 
prompts you for a remark string.
<a name="index_x_217"></a>
<h3>/REPL_HISTORY (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOREPL_HISTORY</h3>
Specifies whether VDE should maintain a history of all past 
source code replacements into the VDE library. The 
/REPL_HISTORY qualifier specifies that such history information be 
maintained in the VDE database. The /NOREPL_HISTORY qualifier 
specifies that such information not be maintained. When you maintain 
replacement history, you can display past replacements using the 
/HISTORY qualifier to the SHOW REPLACEMENT command.

<p>
For documentation on the SHOW REPLACEMENT command in <a href="vde_manual_032.html#vde_cmd_show_repl">SHOW REPLACEMENT</a>.
<h3>/SEND_MAIL (default)</h3>
<h3>/NOSEND_MAIL</h3>
<a name="index_x_218"></a>
Specifies whether VDE should send mail notification messages 
for those VDE operations that normally send such messages. 
The /SEND_MAIL qualifier enables VDE to send such mail 
messages and the /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier suppresses all VDE 
mail messages. The /NOSEND_MAIL qualifier is useful when you want to 
test or play with a private VDE library without sending 
notification messages to other people. However, for normal production 
use, you should always leave the mail notification feature enabled. The 
CREATE LIBRARY command enables mail notification by default.
<h3>/SHOW_ARCH_NAME</h3>
<h3>/NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the architecture name is displayed as part of every 
module name in VDE output. The /SHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier sets 
a library attribute that causes VDE to always include the 
architecture name in every module name it displays. This attribute also 
causes the SHOW DEFAULTS command to display the default architecture. 
The /NOSHOW_ARCH_NAME qualifier clears this library attribute so that 
VDE omits the architecture names when displaying module 
names. You normally only want to see the architecture name if you have 
defined multiple architectures for your VDE library.

<p>
<em>This qualifier is not yet implemented.</em>
<h3>/SHOW_GEN_EXPR</h3>
<h3>/NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR (default)</h3>
Specifies whether the expected replace-time CMS generation expression 
for each module is displayed by the RESERVE command. The /SHOW_GEN_EXPR 
qualifier sets a library attribute that causes the RESERVE command to 
compute and display the CMS generation expression that the 
corresponding REPLACE command is most likely to use for the new module 
generation. You can use this value as an &quot;audit trail 
identifier&quot; in your code if your project uses this convention. 
This library attribute also causes the SHOW RESERVATION command to 
display the expected CMS generation expression and it causes the 
REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command to print an informational 
message if the actual CMS generation expression for the replaced 
generation turns out to be different than the expected one. The 
/NOSHOW_GEN_EXPR qualifier disables this library attribute.

<p>
Please note that VDE cannot guarantee that the expected CMS 
generation expression will actually be used. It is not possible to 
determine at RESERVE time whether a CMS variant letter should be used 
when the module is eventually replaced; that decision can only be made 
at REPLACE time and depends on propagation decisions and stream 
successor relationships at that time. However, the expected CMS 
generation expression is generally the one that is actually used.
<h3>/SNAPSHOT=dir-spec</h3>
Specifies that the database snapshot (.SNP) file be created in the 
directory location given by the <strong>dir-spec</strong> parameter. 
This qualifier lets you put the snapshot file on a separate disk to 
better use disk space or to improve database performance. If you omit 
this qualifier, VDE creates the .SNP file in the directory 
given by the /DATABASE qualifier if that qualifier is specified. If 
neither qualifier is specified, VDE creates the snapshot file 
in the VDE library's root directory.
<a name="index_x_219"></a>
<h3>/LOCK</h3>
<h3>/UNLOCK</h3>
The /LOCK and /UNLOCK qualifiers provide a method by which RESERVE, 
REPLACE, UNRESERVE, and other similar commands can be disabled on a 
copy of a VDE library. This mechanism is not intended to 
completely lock-out all access to a VDE library.

<p>
Specification of /LOCK write-locks the library, and the corresponding 
/UNLOCK qualifier reverses the lock. The write-lock status is read only 
when the user initially accesses the library---once a user has 
connected to the library, the lock status is <em>not</em> updated.

<p>
A write-locked library can be used to prevent various user 
modifications to the contents of the library during library 
maintenance, or to maintain a shadow copy of a library.

<p>
Users holding the MODLIB privilege are allowed to override the library 
write-lock.
<a name="index_x_220"></a>
  An informational message will be displayed when the lock is overridden.
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3>
Enables statistics collection on the specified library. This will cause 
various extra questions to be asked during replacement and related 
operations. This includes the addition of questions around the reason 
for the change, the number of defects fixed, and the particular project 
a change is associated with.
<a name="index_x_221"></a>
<h3>/WILD_INS_GEN</h3>
<h3>/NOWILD_INS_GEN (default)</h3>
Specifies whether wildcard characters are allowed in the parameters to 
the INSERT GENERATION command when the /GENERATION qualifier is 
specified. The /WILD_INS_GEN qualifier causes VDE to allow 
wildcard characters in such parameters while the /NOWILD_INS_GEN 
qualifier causes VDE to not allow such wildcard characters. 
When the /GENERATION qualifier to INSERT GENERATION specifies a 
specific CMS generation expression, it is unlikely that this generation 
expression could apply to more than one module. As a result, it is 
unlikely that the use of wildcard characters in the module-name 
parameters will give the result the user intended. To prevent mistakes, 
VDE therefore does not allow such wildcard usage by default. 
However, there are some situations when such usage might be correct 
(for example, if the specified CMS generation expression is 1). For 
such situations, you can enable the use of wildcard characters with the 
/WILD_INS_GEN qualifier.
