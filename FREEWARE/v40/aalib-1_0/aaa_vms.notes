AAlib 1.0 port under OpenVMS                   November 1997
============================

AAlib is an Ascii Art rendering library. The current OpenVMS port works only 
with X11 driver but not curses driver. You need an X11 display to view ascii 
art :-)

Kit with full sources plus VAX & Alpha objects and binaries (VAX VMS 6.1, DEC C
5.0 & Alpha VMS 6.2, DEC C 5.2)
