DESCRIPTION:
This tool was developed to get users passwords.  This is to help determine
security issues releating to passwords.  I use this program to verify that new
users don't use "simple" passwords.

USAGE:
You need to define the logical TOOLS to point to the directory that the
executable and dictionary are located.  Then, issue the command "$ set command
guess_pass" to insert the verb into your local DCLTABLES.

To use GUESS_PASS, you must supply a username to check.  You may also change the
checking method, timing intervals, and dictionary.
