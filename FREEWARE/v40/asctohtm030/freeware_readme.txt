AscToHTM, UTILITIES, Convert ASCII text files to HTML web pages

AscToHTM is a powerful and highly configurable utility that
converts text files into one or more HTML files.  It recognises
headings, bullets, indentation levels, tables and ascii art,
adds hyperlinks to URLs, keywords and contents list.  A great
time saver for novice and expert alike.  

AscToTab is a subset of AscToHTM that converts tables of information 
held in ordinary text files into fully fledged HTML tables.  It 
doesn't require comma-separated lists, instead it attempts to
analyse and identify the number and position of columns and
calculate the alignment of data in each cell.
