The command file FREEWARE_DEMO.COM will allow you to try AscToHTM before
installing the software.

The command file will prompt you for a filespec of file(s) you want converting 
to HTML.  It will then convert those files to HTML for you, placing the 
results in the same directory as the input files, but with .HTML file 
extensions.  If multiple files are being created, then an "INDEX.HTML" linking
all those files together will also be created.

Nore if you already have .HTML files, the program will generate higher versions,
and the input directory must be writable.  The installed version of the 
software allows many configuration options not available in this demo,
including the ability to direct output to a different directory.
