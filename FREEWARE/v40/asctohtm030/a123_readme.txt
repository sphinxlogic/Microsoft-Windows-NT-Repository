This kit includes the following:

      - AscToHTM version 3.0 (see ASCTOHTM_README.TXT)
      - AscToTab version 3.0 (see ASCTOTAB_README.TXT)

For each we have provided
      
      - vax/alpha object libraries and a LINK_PROGS.COM file to build the
        programs.

      - NOSHARE executables in the [.EXE] subdirectory

      - documentation kits for both programs in the [.DOC] subdirectory.

You can generate HTML documentation for the software using AscToHTM itself
as follows:-

      $! 
      $! Specify your disk and directory to make this foreign command
      $ A2H :== $disk:[dir]AscToHTM
      $!
      $ A2H a2hdoco.txt ia2hdoco.pol	! documentation for AscToHTM
      $ A2H a2tdoco.txt ia2tdoco.pol	! documentation for AscToTab

Both these tools are developed and maintained under VMS, and Yezerski Roper
would like to make them free to all VMS users.  

They have also been ported to Windows where AscToHTM is offered as shareware 
(price $35), and AscToTab is offered as freeware.  

This software is produced by staff at Yezerski Roper, who produce 
high quality VMS systems (high availability call centre work flow systems),
but are increasingly involved in NT and Internet-based development.

You can visit our web page at
      
      http://www.yrl.co.uk/

for more details on the company, or simply visit

      http://www.yrl.co.uk/~yr/Free/

if you want more of our free software (mostly OpenVMS and some Windows).

Both these programs are still under development with new releases and/or new
related programs appearing every 3 months or so.  In the near future we hope
to offer a text-toRTF converter.  Monitor the web site for details.

If you wish to get updates for these utilities, either email us your details
at jaf@yrl.co.uk, or use the NetMind service to monitor the VMS pages
