Notes on Release 3.0 of AscToTab for VMS
========================================

The notes on AscToTab are largely the same as in the file ASCTOHTM_README.TXT,
so go and read that file again, but with the following differences in URLs

      AscToTab homepage : http://www.yrl.co.uk/~jaf/AscToTab.html
      VMS ascToTab page : http://www.yrl.co.uk/~jaf/A2tvms.html
      VMS download page : http://www.yrl.co.uk/~jaf/A2tdownload.html
      on-line doc0      : http://www.yrl.co.uk/~jaf/doco/A2tdoco.html

Note, since Version 2.3, AscToTab (which is a subset of AscToHTM) has had its
releases and version numbers synchronized with AscToHTM, and is now bundled in
the release kits.

AscToTab assumes that the files it converts are single tables.  The actual
conversion is done using the same software as AscToHTM, and you can get the
same results using AscToHTM provided

      a) It correctly detects that the file is a single table (it doesn't
         always)
or
      b) You *tell* AscToHTM the file is a table (by markign up the source).

If you *know* your file is a single table, it's simpler just to use AscToTab.

AscToTab is currently free to all users (not just VMS users like AscToHTM)
All we ask is that you visit our web page at

      http://www.yrl.co.uk/~yr/Free/

and take some other free VMS goodies off us.

Once again, thanks for looking
