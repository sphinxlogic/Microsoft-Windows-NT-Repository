.; vt100/vt52 keypad
Like EDT, FLIST supports both the VT100 and VT52 keypads.
The VT52 keypad is a subset of the VT100 keypad;
it doesn't have PF4, "-" or ",".
Unlike EDT, which assigns different functions on the two keypads,
FLIST assigns the same function to keys having the same marking.

.b;Like EDT, FLIST uses PF1 as a "GOLD key" (an escape-shift function).
FLIST provides four sorting commands on the keypad: NAME, TYPE, DATE and SIZE.
The GOLD key selects a reverse-sort for each of these.
.b;The forward and backward operations work as in EDT;
they set a direction flag (used in the "scroll" function).
.b;In Figure#2, the uppercase keywords are FLIST commands;
the lowercase are functions.

.b;The extra keys on the VT100 keypad are used for functions which
can be performed in other ways, but which are useful on the keypad:
.lm+8
.b.i-4
o	The /CLEFT and /CRIGHT operations rotate the column-list.
.b.i-4
o	The "recall" function retrieves the previous command.
This function may be also achieved by a normal "-" key (to enter
command-edit mode), or by an up-arrow key (while in command-edit).
