FLISTFRONTEND, UTILITIES, File-List Manager
FLIST (directory-editor) provides you, the user with a powerful and  versatile
interface  to VAX/VMS.  Rather than the line-oriented, "glass teletype", FLIST
is a full-screen editor which  shows  the  effects  of  commands  rapidly  and
naturally.   It  provides  both interfaces to VAX/VMS file management commands
(EDIT, COPY, RENAME) as well as extensions to the command interface to  better
integrate VMS commands, and to augment them

    o   Directory sorting shows you the relationship between  files  based  on
        their directory-attributes (e.g., size, date).

    o   Alternate display formats (from a palette of directory-attributes) can
        easily be constructed.

    o   A built-in command history and parameter substitution  facility  makes
        FLIST simple to learn and easy to use.

    o   Commands which alter or create files are  reflected  in  the  display,
        which is updated automatically for most operations.
