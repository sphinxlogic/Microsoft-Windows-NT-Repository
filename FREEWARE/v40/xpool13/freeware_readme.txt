  DESCRIPTION

           If you know how to play pool, excellent!, if you  don't,
           here is all I can say (and know) about this game:
           With the current setup, we have two sets of balls, first
           set   is ball # 1-7, second  set is ball # 9-15. whoever
           gets his/her balls in first and then gets the black ball
           in last wins. We don't have automatic scoring right now,
           so whoever wins is supposed to increase his/her score by
           clicking on his/her '+' color button.
           If you  want to  see where your  ball will  go, click on
           'Cheat' button to get a trajectory of your shot.
           The cue stick lenght determines the hitting strenght, so
           if you want to hit harder, change your cue stick  lenght
           by moving your mouse away from the white ball. You don't
           have to click  on the white ball to start stick handling
           you can click  anywhere  on the  table and  start  stick
           handler. The white ball  goes to the opposite  direction
           relative to the cue stick.
