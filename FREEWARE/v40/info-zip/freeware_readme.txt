INFO-ZIP, UTILITIES, V5.12 of Info-ZIP file compression/decompression tools

Zip is a utility to compress multiple files into a single .ZIP archive.
The images and sources are located in zip20.zip.  Use the UNZIP images
located in this directory to obtain these images and sources.

UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format (also
called "zipfiles").  Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP
and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our
primary objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.
