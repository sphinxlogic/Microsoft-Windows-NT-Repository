SD, UTILITIES, Another SD rich-featured powerful robust.

SD is a powerful and flexible alternative to the DCL command "SET DEFAULT".

It has the capability to

  . quickly set default to the default login directory (SYS$LOGIN);
  . quickly set default to any user's default login directory (privileged use);
  . set default to logical directory names, wildcarded directory names
    and complex directory specifications;
  . store a history of "visited" directories in a "Last In First Out" (LIFO)
    directory stack;
  . set default to any given directory in the directory stack;
  . display the contents of the directory stack;
  . allow different styles of stack display;
  . manipulate the contents of the directory stack;
  . set the maximum size of the directory stack;
  . re-initialize the directory stack;
  . write the directory stack to a disk file for later re-loading of the
    stack;
  . read a previously dumped directory stack from a disk file to re-load
    the stack;
  . change the session prompt to reflect the current default directory;
  . allow flexible specification of the format of the new session prompt;
  . provide direct access to help information from the command line;
