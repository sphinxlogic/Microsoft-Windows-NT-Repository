NETLIB is a freely available package that provides *one* interface to
most of the TCP/IP kits commonly running on OpenVMS.

SOCKETSHR is a freely available package that provides BSD socket routines
on top of NETLIB (and currently, also UCX).  It needs NETLIB 1.7 to run.

Both NETLIB and SOCKETSHR are available by anonymous FTP from:

	ftp.wku.edu:[.VMS.FILESERV]
	ftp.vms.stacken.kth.se:[.WKU.VMS.FILESERV]
	ftp.spc.edu:[.MACRO32] (I think)
