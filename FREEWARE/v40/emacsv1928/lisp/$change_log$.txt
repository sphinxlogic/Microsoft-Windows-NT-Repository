	number of a file.
	(find-backup-file-name): New function.  Needed by dired.

	Also, does not convert 8-bit printable chars to space any more.
	And last, calls command-line-1, after fooling Emacs with a
	couple of variables, so Emacs won't do all the startup stuff,
	just the command line processing.
