NOTE:
If the public key of the person that has signed this package isn't in your
public key ring, then PGP will ask for it. It is distributed in the file
PGP.public-key.pgp (and in ASCII form with fingerprint, in PGP.public-key.asc).

Thus, if PGP asks you for the PGP public key file, type PGP.public-key.pgp,
or whatever file contains it.

The files have been modified!!! If it is'nt you who has
modified them,  then somebody else has,  and he/she may
have introduced a security hole.

Please get the sources from a trusted site,  as well as
the public key for the signer of the file certification.
