Changes from XPaint 2.1.1 to XPaint 2.2


1.  New features:

1.1 Changed image processing functions (filters):
	Filter commands uses whole canvas if no selection (#define
	FILTERNEEDSSELECTION if you want the old behaviour)
	'Smooth' filter now has variable mask size
	'Oil Paint' filter now has variable mask size

1.2 New image processing functions (filters):
	'Add Noise'
	'Blend'
	'Despeckle'
	'Directional Smooth'
	'Normalize Contrast'
	'Pixelize'
	'Quantize Colors'
	'Solarize'
	'Spread'
	'Repeat Last Filter' operation

1.3 Changed operators:
	Multiple undo and redo.
	Fill operator takes color tolerance into account.
	Draw centered boxes and ellipses that are not square.
	Improved performance of Gaussian Spray.
	Brush tool has 'Transparent' option which uses a soft-edged
	brush (only works well on TrueColor visuals).
	Brush cursor is the correct size when zooming.
	Brush cursor in FatBits popup is the correct size.
	Snap rounds instead of truncating (#define TRUNC_SNAP if you want the
	old behaviour).

1.4 Changed region functions:
	Holding Shift down while moving a region constrains movement to
	horizontal or vertical.
	Holding Shift down while rotating a region constrains rotation to
	multiples of 15 degrees.

1.5 New region functions:
	'Crop to Region' tool.
	Cursor keys can be used to move region in 1 pixel steps.
	Undo undoes region selection.

1.6 New operators:
	Select circle-shaped area.
	Select polygon-shaped area.
	Gradient fill (Conical, Square, Radial, Linear).
	'Smear' tool.

1.7 Miscellaneous new functions:
	AutoCrop function - removes borders from an image.
	'Revert' function.
	Writing of JPEG files.

1.8 Interface changes:

	The 'Select Range' dialog now uses the color map of the current canvas. 
	Therefore, it is no longer found in the toolbox, but in the palette
	area (the 'Select Color Range' button).
	New 40 x 40 icons. If you create a better set of icons, please let me
	know.
	'Region' menu split into 'Region' and 'Filter' menus, the latter for
	image processing functions.
	Busy cursor while saving.

2  Fixed bugs:

	Changing the image size no longer does funny things
	to the fatbits cursor.
	Changing the zoom on the canvas now resizes and
	repositions the fatbits cursor.
	FatBits cursor window changes size when changing zoom of canvas.
	Problem with flipping region fixed.
	In color picker, Enter now works in delta textwidgets.

3  Source code changes:

	Xpm and TIFF libraries no longer included in distribution.
	Massive reformatting of all source files.
	A couple of new source files.
	Some unused code removed.
	Toolbox uses Xpm icons exclusively.
