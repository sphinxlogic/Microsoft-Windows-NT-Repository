Note that the writing of alpha-channel images in PNG format is NOT yet
supported!  This is mainly laziness on my part, but I have to get some
other things done this weekend. :-)  I'll get back to it before the summer
is out...  I also promise to get rid of the PNG debug messages, which I've
left in for now.

Problems with the PNG support can be reported to me.  More generic XPaint
problems should probably go to Torsten.  Note that the original author,
David Koblas, is no longer involved; don't pester him with anything.
