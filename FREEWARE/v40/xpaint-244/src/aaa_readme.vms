Some corrections for VMS:

1) The "readonly" variable was renamed into "Readonly" to avoid collision with
   reserved word into all source files.

2) Adding some M_PI definition where missing.

3) Collision at link time between graphicCreate and GraphicCreate routines.
   We rename GraphicCreate into Graphic_Create to avoid double definition
   and crash at run time ...
