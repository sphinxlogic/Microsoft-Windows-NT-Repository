	syspql V1.0B
---
	This program modifies the quota for the startup process.
it is implemented with 3 files
	sys$loadable_images:syspql.exe:	loadable_images that does the work
	sys$loadable_images:syspql.dat: new parameters for the startup process
	setsyspql.exe: creates and manages the syspql.dat file
---
	backup this kit keeping the directory structure:
	backup sysqpl010b.back/sav [...]
	install with: @install_syspql
	update with:  @install_syspql update
	remove with:  @install_syspql remove
---
	syspql.exe can only increase quota.
---
	when the system boots, the system actual startup quota are copied
	to the syspql.dat file, if they have changed from the last boot.
	These saved parameters are used by setsyspql.exe. SYSPQL.dat must be
	/NOMOVE for the update to take place. setsyspql.exe creates the
	file /NOMOVE.
---
	if you have trouble booting and suspect SYSPQL.EXE is the problem,
	boot into SYSBOOT and set the parameter LOAD_SYS_IMAGES to 0
