WATCHER V2.9-1, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, An idle terminal monitor/killer
                                       
   [30-SEP-1994]
   
   WATCHER is an idle terminal monitor. That is, it logs out interactive
   users after a certain period of inactivity. WATCHER is fully
   configurable, allowing the system manager to define which terminals to
   watch, what measurements to use, and how long a terminal should be
   idle before getting zapped. It also includes provisions for preventing
   logouts or overriding inactivity settings based on any combination of
   username, UIC, terminal, privileges, image being run, held identifier,
   and time of day.
   
   WATCHER runs on VAX/VMS V5.0 and later, and OpenVMS AXP V1.0 and
   later.
   
   WATCHER is written primarily in BLISS. Complete sources are provided.
