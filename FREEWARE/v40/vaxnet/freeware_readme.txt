VAXNET, Software, Asynch communication with scripts tool w/src

This utility set allows asynchronous communication with a sophisticated
script language, and can use its own, or the Kermit or Xmodem
protocols to transfer files, or can do raw send or receive over
a VMS asynchronous connection. Its connection handling has long been
the best available in VMS in terms of using minimal system resources.
