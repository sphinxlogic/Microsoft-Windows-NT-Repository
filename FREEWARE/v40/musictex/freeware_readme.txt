MUSICTEX, MISCELLANEOUS, Score macros for TeX/LaTeX

Here are the tools to write music with MusicTeX under TeX.
The useful macros are MUSIC*.TEX and the *.STY for LaTeX.
The MUSICTEX.ZIP contains a complete distribution to be un`zipped'
on a PC (with pkunzip).

MUSICDOC gives a supposedly (LaTeX) complete notice about how to use MusicTeX.
