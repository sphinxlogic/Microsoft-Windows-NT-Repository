"- Pine 3.89 is a primarily a maintenance (bug fix) release, correcting",
"  several bugs introduced in 3.88 and earlier.",
" ",
"- If this is the first version of Pine you've used since Pine 3.0x,",
"  you should read the subsequent section on changes since 3.07. ",
" ",
"- Fixed: Possibly the last bugs associated with zero length folders",
"  causing crash with \"Bad msgno in mail_fetchstructure\" with new mail",
"  arrival and \"Bad msgno in mail_elt\" after failed save.",
" ",
"- Fixed: Bug in \"Goto\" command causing attempted open of garbaged ",
"  folder names and other odd behavior under certain circumstances.",
" ",
"- Fixed: Explicitly set mode of temporary files for sendmail to 0600.    ___----",
" ",
" ",
"- Fixed: BOOTP gateway, netmask and nameserver recognition (packet-driver",
"  version).",
" ",
"- Fixed: Display bug showing zero length attachments on re-entering the ",
"  composer.",
" ",
"- Fixed: Export no longer reports success when write fails.              ___----",

"Note to Sequent PTX users:  if you are experiencing performance problems,",
" make sure you get the new patch from Sequent to make \"fsync\" work like",
" all other Unix \"fsync\"s instead of just doing a \"sync\" instead!",
" ",
"Note to AIX users: There have been reported problems with pine built",
" in certain AIX 3.2.X environments.  If you experience problems building",
" or running a newly built pine, you might try pine-bin.aix32 available on",
" ftp.cac.washington.edu.  Work to find the source of these problems ",
" continues.",
" ",
"Note to NeXT users: We're aware of, but unable to reproduce, a crash",
" in the Folder Index.  If you can reproduce it, please send details to",
" pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.",

"III. CONFIGURING PINE                                                    ___----",
" ",
"Pine configuration is accomplished via entries in a personal configuration",
"file, and/or --in the case of Unix Pine-- an optional system-wide",
"configuration file.  The standard pathnames for these files are as",
"follows:",
" ",
" -Unix Pine system-wide configuration file: /usr/local/lib/pine.conf",
" -Unix Pine personal configuration file:  ~/.pinerc",
" -PC-Pine personal configuration file:  \\PINE\\PINERC",
" ",
"Unix Pine can normally be used without any personal configuration, since",
"the normal defaults or entries in the system-wide pine configuration file",
"should usually be sufficient to get Pine running.  However, PC-Pine needs",
"information that you must supply the first time you run Pine.",
" ",
"Beyond the basic information necessary to run Pine, there are an         ___----",
"ever-growing number of features that you can enable via entries in your",
"personal config file.  Below is the default pinerc configuration file,",
"including comments, that is created if none exists.  Note: comments in",
"existing pinerc files are not updated by new versions of Pine, but new",
"variables will be added as appropriate. ",

"\043 Pine configuration file -- customize as needed.",
"\043",
"\043 This file sets the configuration options used by Pine and PC-Pine.  If you",
"\043 are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide configuration",
"\043 file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments in",
"\043 this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about",
"\043 specific settings see the section on configuration options in the Pine",
"\043 notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.",
"\043 For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated",
"\043 by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a",
"\043 continuation of the previous line.",

"IV. READING NEWS                                                         ___----",
" ",
"Background.  ",
" ",
"Pine can read Internet news (NetNews or Usenet) groups, using the same",
"commands as for mail.  This capability is still \"work in progress\", so",
"some obvious capabilities are missing.  For example, Pine does not yet",
"know how to post messages to a news group, nor does it have commands to",
"subscribe to or unsubscribe newsgroups.  The consequence of this is that,",
"for now, you must already have a \"newsrc\" file in order to permit Pine",
"to read news.  Any Unix newsreader (e.g. rn, trn, nn) can be used to",
"create a suitable .newsrc file.  Pine will update the .newsrc file in a",
"way that is compatible with other news readers, although Pine uses the",
"information in the file in a slightly different way than other news readers.",
" ",
"Configuring Pine for news access.                                        ___----",
" ",
"Pine can access news folders in any one of three different ways: ",
" ",
" -Using the Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) to access news on",
"  a remote news server.  In this case the newsrc file is stored on ",
"  the machine where Pine is running.  Put a line similar to the following",
"  in your .pinerc to use this mode of access:  ",
" ",
"      news-collections=News *{news.wherever.edu/nntp}[]",
" ",
" -Using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to access news       ___----",
"  on a remote news server.  In this case, your newsrc file is stored",
"  on the news server, in your home directory, so you must have an",
"  account on the news server, but you would be running Pine on a ",
"  different machine.  The news server must be running an IMAPd server",
"  process.  Put a line similar to the following in your .pinerc",
"  to use this mode of access: ",
" ",
"      news-collections=News *{news.wherever.edu}[]",
" ",
" -Using local file access to the news database.  In this case, your newsrc",
"  file is stored on the news server, in your home directory, so you must",
"  have an account on the news server, and you would be running Pine on the",
"  same machine.  Put a line similar to the following in your .pinerc to",
"  use this mode of access: ",
" ",
"      news-collections=News *[]",
" ",
" ",
"In the first two examples, the hostname \"news.wherever.edu\" should be  ___----",
"replaced with the domain name of your local news server.  For Unix Pine,",
"these entries can be placed in either the system-wide or your personal",
"configuration file.",
" ",
"If you are a PC-Pine user, either option 1 (NNTP) or option 2 (IMAP) is",
"possible.  If you don't have an account on the news server, or if the news",
"server is not running an IMAP daemon, then you must use NNTP.  In this",
"case, a Unix .newsrc file can be transferred to your PC.  It should be",
"named \\NEWSRC.  A future version of PC-Pine will be able to access and",
"update a newsrc file stored on a Unix host, so that it will be possible to",
"alternate between PC-Pine and Unix-based news readers. ",
" ",
"Using Pine to read news.                                                 ___----",
" ",
"Once defined in the .pinerc (or the global pine.conf) file, the news",
"folder collection can be accessed either via the FOLDER LIST screen,",
"of via the GOTO command.",
" ",
"Once a news folder has been opened, Pine currently positions you at the",
"last message.  (In the future, this is expected to change.)  Pine uses the",
"same commands for manipulating news folders as for mail folders.  This",
"means, for example, that when you are done with a message, you would use",
"\"D\" to mark it as Deleted (or Dismissed, if you prefer.)",
" ",
"This \"mail like\" behavior differs from that of most newsreaders, wherein",
"a message is implicitly dismissed after you have looked at it once. We",
"strongly believe that Pine should offer as much consistency as possible",
"between mail and news, so the mail paradigm --wherein a message does not",
"magically disappear without explicit action by the user-- is used for",
"news as well.",
" ",
"News folders are actually Read-Only, but the newsrc file allows Pine to  ___----",
"keep track of which messages you have dismissed (marked as Deleted) just",
"as in a regular mail folder. The difference is that, although messages",
"marked as Deleted will show up in the Index (just as mail messages do",
"until an eXpunge), you cannot expunge news messages.  However, in the",
"future there will be a way to \"hide\" (or \"eXclude\") messages that are",
"so marked from the Folder Index.",
" ",
"If you answer a message in a news folder, the index view will show the",
"\"A\" flag as usual; but the newsrc file has no way of storing this flag,",
"so it will not be preserved across sessions.  The Deleted flag is the only",
"one that is preserved between sessions. ",
" ",
"NOTE: full NetNews functionality is not yet available in Pine; there",
"is still much to be done in this area.  Stay tuned...",
" ",

"V. CHANGES SINCE PINE 3.07                                               ___----",
" ",
"Version 3.89 is the fourth maintenance release since 3.85, which was a",
"major release with lots of changes and new features since 3.07.  If you",
"are upgrading from 3.07 to 3.89, here are some of the changes you may",
"notice:",
" ",
"- Pine 3.8x has several major new features (compared to Pine 3.07):",
"   o Various UI improvements (command consistency, simplification, etc).",
"   o Multiple folder collections.",
"   o Remote folder create/append (requires new IMAPd).",
"   o Composer has Mark command for block cut/paste.",
"   o Messages directly to you marked with \"+\" in Folder Index.",
"   o Messages that have been answered marked with \"A\" in Folder Index.",
"   o Improved handling of text and postscript attachments.",
"   o Improved mailbox lock handling: latest Pine will now be read-write.",
"   o Several new .pinerc options.",
"   o Several new command line options.",
"   o Easier access to newsgroups (but still not a full newsreader).",
"   o TAB command to move to next unseen message.",
" ",
"- Several command key changes were needed to allow for new features:     ___----",
"   o Print is now \"Y\" instead of \"L\"",
"   o The Folder List is now uniformly accessible via \"L\"",
"   o Viewing/saving attachments is now done via \"V\" instead of \"A\"",
"   o SortIndex is now \"$\" instead of \"Z\"",
" ",
"- In addition...",
"  - Release includes PC-Pine ports, as well as Unix Pine.",
"  - Ability to view plain text attachments.",

"  - Command line -p flag to specify an alternate personal config file.",
"  - Command line -P flag to specify an alternate system-wide config file.",
"  - Command line -o flag for opening a mailbox Read-Only.",
"  - Command line -I flag for initial keystroke list.",
"  - More support for USENET news access via both IMAP and NNTP",
"    (The NNTP driver reads/updates local newsrc configuration files).",
"  - Changed order of reply prompts to reduce mistakes.                   ___----",
"  - In the Save command, folder name completion using TAB key.",
"  - More consistency of commands across screens.",
"  - Main menu command selection via Prev/Next/Enter.",

"them actually exist yet.  In particular: Flag, Bounce, Pipe, Apply, Zoom.",
"Also: news item eXclude/uneXclude and news group subscription/unsubscription",
"are not yet available. ",
" ",
"Handling Locking with multiple sessions.                                 ___----",
" ",
"Pine 3.84 introduced a new mechanism to handle competition between",
"multiple sessions for a single INBOX.  Previously, the first session would",
"have to be stopped before another could get read/write permissions on an",
"open inbox.  Now, the newest session forces the older session to surrender",
"read/write access to the mailbox.  Note: in the future, Unix Pine will",
"also support the MTX mailbox format used by PC-Pine.  This format permits",
"multiple sessions to all have read-write access (except that eXpunge can ",
"only occur when there is a single session). ",
" ",
"Folder Collections.                                                      ___----",
" ",
"Pine allows you to have full access to sets of folders on you local",
"machine plus those on any remote host running an IMAP server.  These sets",
"of folders are called \"collections\" and Pine has some special new",
"browsing features to take advantage of them. By default, everyone has one",
"folder collection.  Additional collections may be defined by editing your",
".pinec configuration file. ",
" ",
"MIME Attachments.                                                        ___----",
" ",
"Pine now recognizes attachments which are displayable text and marks them",
"the appropriate MIME type for text.  Pine has a new system for determining",
"which MIME text attachments should be displayed automatically and which",
"should be displayable on request.  In addition there is a new text",
"attachment viewer module just for browsing these attachments.  Finally,",
"Pine will now recognize postscript files and TIFF image files and assign",
"the correct MIME type information in the message.",
" ",
"Other things you should know.",
" ",
"Unfortunately, when you Save a message to a folder, the message state",
"flags (e.g. whether it was Deleted, or Answered) are not preserved.  This",
"will be fixed in a future release. ",
" ",
"Msg sizes are intentionally left blank in the index when using NNTP.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"If a file called ~/mail.txt exists and is either empty or appears to be a",
"Tenex-style mailbox, Pine will decide to use its \"tenex2\" driver which",
"will move all pending mail from /usr/spool/mail/$USER to mail.txt, and use",
"mail.txt as your INBOX.  This behavior is subject to change; in particular,",
"the \"tenex2\" driver will be deprecated in favor of an MTX driver that",
"will provide a common mailbox format between Unix Pine and PC-Pine.",
" ",
" ",
"VI. RATIONALE FOR USER-INTERFACE CHANGES IN PINE 3.8x                    ___----",
" ",
"In Pine 3.85/3.86, there are many feature additions and more consistent",
"use of command keys; but a few changes may trip you up the first time. ",
"Here are some specific things to watch out for, and an explanation of why",
"we changed them: ",
" ",
"  o Main menu: \"F FOLDERS\" is now \"L LIST FOLDERS\"",
"    WHY: In order to implement a pervasive command (L) to get to the Folder",
"         List screen, available from all major screens.  The letter \"F\" ",
"         conflicted with \"Forward\" on the Folder Index and Message Text ",
"         screens.",
" ",
"  o The \"L Print\" command is now the \"Y Print\" command.              ___----",
"    WHY: We needed to reclaim L so there would be a consistent and ",
"         mnemonic command for the important operation of getting to the ",
"         Folder List screen (\"L ListFldrs\").  Since printing is also an",
"         important operation, this change was made with great reluctance. ",
"         On the other hand, \"L Print\" wasn't especially mnemonic, and",
"         \"Y Print\" offers a nice environmental message!",
"      ",
"  o The \"O OTHER\" command on the Main menu and the corresponding ",
"    \"OTHER\" screen has been eliminated.  In its place, there is a Setup",
"    command, and a couple of other commands added to the key menu at the",
"    bottom of the Main menu. ",
"    WHY: Simplification.  Providing more direct access to some of the",
"         \"miscellaneous\" functions allowed elimination of the Other screen.",
"         This also allowed us to use \"O OTHER CMDS\" on the main key menu,",
"         for greater consistency with the other screens.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"  o The Main menu now supports selection of the principal commands using ",
"    Previous/Next navigation commands, and RETURN to select.",
"    WHY: Consistency with the other Pine screens.",
" ",
"  o In \"Reply\" the order of prompts has been reversed.  The prompt          ",
"    \"Include original message in Reply?\" is now always the first one.",
"    WHY: \"Reply to all recipients?\" depends on the specific msg header,",
"         and therefore is not always present.  Although it may take",
"         getting used to, we felt that in the long run it would be better",
"         to have the first prompt be the one that is *always* applicable. ",
"         Also, with the future ability to post news replies, there will be",
"         different prompts following a Reply.  Again it seemed best to",
"         start with the invariant prompt.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"  o The ^T sub-command under Save and Goto will behave slightly differently.",
"    WHY: We hope the new \"select\" behavior makes it clearer to the user",
"         what is going on.  In other words, a \"user interface improvement\".",
" ",
"  o The \"Z Sort Folder\" command is now \"$ Sort Index\"",
"    WHY: Two reasons.  The change from Z to $ was because we will need ",
"         \"Z\" for some of the newsreading and aggregate operations",
"         that are planned for a future release.  Besides, \"$\" looks more",
"         like an \"S\" for Sort than \"Z\" does...  In addition, the word",
"         \"Folder\" was changed to \"Index\" to emphasize that only the",
"         Index is being affected; the folder itself is *not* reordered by",
"         the Sort command.",
" ",
"  o The disk quota command has been removed.",
"    WHY: Because on many systems it caused nothing but trouble, ",
"         moreover it was useless for remote folder management. ",
" ",
" ",
"VII. PC-PINE: BACKGROUND, DIFFERENCES/LIMITATIONS                         ___----",
" ",
"Summary: There are several known limitations in the PC version...",
" ",
"   o There is no spelling checker.",
"   o Sorting the Index (by other than Arrival) is *hopelessly* slow.",
"   o The alternate editor function is not available.",
"   o Memory: it needs about 500K out of 640K.",
"   o Probably can't run image viewer from within Pine, due to memory.",
"   o Performance optimization still needs to be done.",
"   o Versions: packet driver, Novell LWP, FTP PC-TCP, Sun PC-NFS",
" ",
"Most of the work done on Pine from 6/92 to 6/93 focused on changes needed to",
"support a truly distributed electronic messaging environment (e.g. remote",
"folder manipulation), and getting Pine to run on DOS (which was a *lot* of",
"work).  The first version of PC-Pine (3.84) was released in July 1993, and",
"included first steps toward integrating news and email access in Pine.",
" ",
"Doing the DOS port was very difficult for a variety of reasons, but      ___----",
"especially because of DOS memory management (or lack thereof).  However,",
"simply porting Pine 3.07 to DOS was not sufficient.  For a desktop mailer",
"such as PC-Pine to be useful at UW, it was necessary to fully support",
"access to existing *remote* saved-message folders, as well as local",
"(desktop) folders -- and of course, the remote INBOX.  Accomplishing this",
"required extensions to IMAP, a new version of the IMAPd server code, and",
"extensive work in Pine to support multiple collections of folders. ",
" ",
"The principal reason for porting Unix Pine to DOS was to obviate the need",
"for PC users to transfer files between their PC and the Unix system running",
"Pine.  Now it is possible to save messages directly to the PC's filesystem,",
"and to directly include PC files in outgoing messages.  Binary files (e.g.",
"word processing documents, spreadsheets, image files, executables) may be ",
"directly attached to your messages. ",
" ",
"With the advent of Pine 3.85/3.86, both Unix Pine and PC-Pine have       ___----",
"essentially similar functionality and user-interface.  But there are",
"some differences.  Below is a list of PC-Pine differences and limiations:",
" ",
"-Sorting the index is *hopelessly* slow right now... especially for",
" newsgroups accessed via NNTP. ",
" ",
"-There is no spelling checker for PC-Pine.",
" ",
"-The \"alternate editor\" function is not available.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"-Composing/Replying/Forwarding: the entire message text must fit in DOS ",
" memory.  However, attachments may be any size.",
" ",
"-PC-Pine wants about 500K of DOS memory.",
" ",
"-Don't expect to display a picture without exiting PC-Pine, due",
" to DOS memory limitations.  In some configurations, there *may* be enough",
" memory for the viewer and a small image, but don't count on it.",
" ",
"-Performance optimization has not been done.  This will be most          ___----",
" noticeable when using NNTP to access newsgroups, or when Index screens are",
" redrawn while using PC-Pine over low-speed lines (via SLIP or PPP).",
" Encoding a decoding attachments is also very slow in this version.",
" ",
"-While message folders may be either local or remote, several support",
" files must be available on the local disk.  In particular:",
"	\\pine\\pinerc",
"	\\pine\\addrbook (you may specify a different name/location for this)",
"	\\newsrc",
"	\\pine\\pine.sig (you may specify a different name/location for this)",
" ",
" Other files (postponed and interrupted messages, debug files) are also",
" stored locally.  The same is true for Unix Pine, but only users of both",
" PC-Pine and Unix Pine must worry about keeping their pinerc, address book,",
" and newsrc files in sync.   This may be done using remote file system ",
" protocols or manual copying.  (Remote access to these support files is",
" planned for the future.)",
" ",
"-PC-Pine wants to live in a directory called \\PINE                      ___----",
" ",
"-The PC-PINE message folder format, denoted by files with an \"MTX\" extension,",
" is based on byte-counts for maximum efficiency, so they must not be edited.",
" The format is non-standard, but conversion utilities would not be difficult.",
" In the future, this format may be supported in Unix Pine as well.",
" ",
"-PC-Pine does not create debug files",
" ",
"-PC-Pine mouse support is not yet available on some screens",
" ",
"                                                                         ___----",

"COMMANDS: The bottom two lines of the screen are always used to list the",
"commands you can give.  You press the keys that are highlighted to give the",
"command.  The commands for getting help and going back to the main menu are",
"always present (except when viewing help as you are now).",
" ",
"{:OTHER COMMANDS: The \"Other Commands\" function changes the keys you see}",
"{:at the bottom of any screen.  In some cases there are three different pages}",
"{:of keys which it toggles through.  ALL COMMANDS ARE ACTIVE, even if they}",
"{:are not currently showing at the bottom of your screen.}",
"                                                                         ___----",

"^V to page down and ^Y to page up as you do in the message composer. ",
" ",
"RETURN KEY: The return key is usually a synonym for a frequently used",
"command.  When viewing a message, there is currently not a default command,",
"so RETURN does nothing; when in the index, it is synonymous with \"view msg\".",

"     3. Notes on Pine Screens ",
" ",
"The top line of the screen is Pine's status line.  It will always display",
"the current version of Pine and will also convey information about the",
"status of the program.  This is where you look to find out what collection,",
"folder and message number is active. ",
" ",
"If the top line says \"READONLY\" it means that the open folder (typically",
"your INBOX) is \"locked\" by another mail session -- most likely a more",
"recent session of Pine has taken the INBOX lock.  See an earlier part of",
"this \"Help\" section for an explanation of how you can understand the",
"READONLY sessions. ",
"                                                                         ___----",
"If the top line says \"CLOSED\" it means that you are trying to access a",
"folder on a remote mail server, and for some reason, communication with",
"the mail server has either been lost, or never successfully established. ",
"This can be a result of trying to open a non-existent folder, or one",
"stored on an invalid or non-operational server, or it can mean that",
"Pine has been suspended for more that 30 minutes while accessing a remote",
"mail server. ",
" ",
"                                                                         ___----",
"Basic Features",
"--------------",
"    ",
"      4. Printing on PCs and Macs from Unix Pine",
" ",
"Printing directly to printers attached to PCs is known to work with the ",
"following communication software: UW-modified NCSA Telnet, WinQVT, WRQ ",
"Reflections, Kermit and Procomm.  All but the latest version of UW-modified ",
"NCSA telnet require \"capfile = PRN\" in the config.tel file.  Direct printing ",
"does not work with current versions of Novell LWP, DEC Pathworks and PC-NFS. ",
"On the Mac, direct printing is known to work with UW-modified NCSA telnet ",
"(version 2.3.2WA), Microphone II  v4.0, MacKermit, and VersaTerm (both regular ",
"and Pro). ",
" ",
"      5. Mark, Cut and Paste in Composer (block moves)                   ___----",
" ",
"In the message composer, you use the mark (ctrl-^), cut (ctrl-k) and ",
"paste (crtl-u) sequence to move a block of text.  This is a convenient ",
"way to move large blocks of text around in the composer.  If you use ",
"the cut command before specifying a mark, it will cut one line of text.",
" ",
"      6. Pine Over Dialup Lines (modem)                                  ___----",
" ",
"Pine can usually recognize when it is being used over a low speed dialup",
"line via a modem.  In this case it will show the current message in the",
"index with a \"->\" instead of showing it all in reverse video.  This",
"results in faster operation.  The screen painting in the message composer",
"is also done slightly differently at low speed.",
" ",
"If you attempt to upload files from your PC or Mac directly into the Pine",
"composer you may find it doesn't work very well.  This is because Pine was",
"designed for humans to type messages into, including features like line",
"wrapping and notification of new mail, which confuse the process of ",
"uploading files.  The best way to accomplish this is to up load the file",
"outside of Pine using Kermit of xmodem and then include the file with the",
"^R command.",
" ",
"Solutions to Common Problems                                             ___----",
"----------------------------",
" ",
"      7. Lost Read/Write on INBOX                                       ",
"Pine only allows one email session to modify a Berkeley Unix format mail",
"folder at a time.  If you have one Pine session open and then begin",
"another, the first session switches into \"READONLY\" with respect to your",
"INBOX.  A common scenario would be that you left one session running in",
"your office and started the second from a dial-in connection from home. ",
"          ",
"When you get back to that first Pine session, you will note that it is",
"\"READONLY\".  As the name implies, you can't take any action on a",
"READONLY mailbox, so it won't delete or expunge.  Not as obvious but",
"equally true is the fact that a READONLY session does not get notification",
"of new email messages.  If your INBOX is on a server and accessed via",
"IMAP, any state changes (e.g. marking a message for deletion) made by the",
"old session in the last few minutes/seconds before the new session is",
"started up (since the checkpoint) may be lost.  Don't worry, there is no",
"risk to the messages themselves. ",
" ",
"      8. If ^C Doesn't Work on a Mac                                     ___----",
" ",
"There's a problem with the default configuration of the Macintosh version ",
"of NCSA telnet which prevents Control-Cs from reaching Pine.  Under the",
"\"session menu\", select \"setup keys\".  There you'll see an entry for ^C.",
"You should make sure it's blank.  If it's not, ^C won't work in Pine. ",
"This will fix it just for the current session.  To make it permanent",
"you have to edit the configuration file.  You should add a line:",
" ",
"        localkeys={{:{}0,19,17}",
" ",
"somewhere after the line that contains \"name=default\".  Also, on",
"VersaTerm Pro a similar problem occurs where ^C causes a break to be ",
"sent on the modem or serial line.",
" ",
"Configurable Features                                                    ___----",
"---------------------",
" ",
"      9. Placement of Signature Files",
" ",
"Pine encourages a format different from the usual for replies",
"which include the original text.  The idea is to add the new text",
"*before* the original included text so that the readers of the message",
"see the new text they are interested in right away without having to",
"read through the original text they have seen before.  This is why the",
"signature is included before the original text.  Similar is true for",
"forwarding messages.  Unfortunately placing the signature before the",
"text is cumbersome when the reply is to be interspersed within the",
"original text.  Adding \"signature-at-bottom\" to the \"feature-list\"",
"variable in your Pine configuration file (PINERC or .pinerc) will cause ",
"Pine to put the signature (and cursor) at the end of the message as is ",
"more conventional.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"By default, Pine will use a file in your home directory called ",
"\".signature\" however, in order to permit a different signature for",
"mail than that used in Bulletin Board applications, you may set the",
"\"signature-file\" variable to the name of a file containing your",
"email signature.",
"                                                                        ",
"      10. Understanding File Carbon Copy                                 ___----",
" ",
"Pine automatically saves a copy of all the outgoing email that you send. ",
"By default, this goes into a file \"sent-mail\" or \"sentmail\" in your",
"regular email directory.  You can use set the variable \"default-fcc\" in",
"your Pine configuration file to change this.  For instance, some people",
"who use both PC-Pine and Pine want all their sent mail to be put in the",
"same folder.  This could be done with a default-fcc (on the PC) like this: ",
"      default-fcc={computer.used.for.unix.pine}mail/sent-mail",
"If you want no file-carbon-copy at all, you place two double quotes there:",
"      default-fcc=\"\"",
"Note that whatever directory you specify for the fcc must already exist.  If",
"the specific file does not exist, you will be asked if you want to create ",
"it or not.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"      11. Alternate Editor for Composing Messages",
" ",
"There are two ways to get Pine to use an alternate editor for composing",
"messages.  One option is to choose an editor ahead of time and set the",
"\"editor\" variable in your Pine configuration file.  If this is done,",
"\"^_ Alt Edit\" will show in the menu of the composer.  The second option",
"is to enable the feature \"enable-alternate-editor-cmd\" in the Pine",
"configuration variable \"feature-list\".  Then you can give the \"^_\"",
"command while in the composer even if it is not shown on the menu.  You",
"will be prompted for the name of the editor to invoke.  At present you",
"cannot edit the header with the alternate editor. ",
" ",
"      12. Using PC-Pine to get PC-Pine Updates                           ___----",
" ",
"PC-Pine has the ability to access newsgroups, understand MIME messages",
"and write files to your PC's disk.  If you put this all together, you find",
"that you can use PC-Pine to pickup newer versions of PC-Pine.  If you see",
"bugs in PC-Pine and want to find out if you have the most current version ",
"or if you know there is a more current version and need to get it, use ",
"Pine's internal update function.  You can select \"Update\" from Pine's",
"\"SETUP\" function.",
"       ",
"Update connects your PC to the machine pine.cac.washington.edu which",
"always holds the most current version of PC-Pine.  You may then view a the",
"message containing the new version and, using Pine's \"View Attachment\"",
"command, save it to your local disk. ",
"        ",
"Background Information                                                   ___----",
"----------------------",
" ",
"      13. What is MIME?",
"MIME stands for \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\" and it is a",
"specification for including binary data in Internet mail messages, which",
"until now have generally been limited to ascii text.  MIME-capable",
"mailers, such as Pine 3.x, allow word processing documents, spreadsheets,",
"programs, images, audio, and other binary data to be attached to a ",
"message.  MIME allows for alternative representations of the same data.",
"For example, there can be an attachment in text form followed by one",
"containing bitmap page images of the same information.",
" ",
"MIME-capable mail software is not yet widely deployed, but MIME support ",
"is growing rapidly.  If you need to send binary data to colleagues at",
"institutions not yet supporting MIME, encourage them to talk to their",
"system administrators about installing MIME tools.  MIME software, ",
"compatible with many different mail programs, is freely available (as ",
"is our own Pine mailer.)",
" ",
"                                                                         ___----",
"     14. History and Origin of Pine",
" ",
"Pine was originally conceived in 1989 as a simple, easy-to-use mailer for",
"administrative staff at the University of Washington in Seattle.  The goal",
"was to provide a simple mailer that naive users could use without fear of",
"making mistakes.  We wanted to cater to users who were less interested in",
"using electronic mail than in doing their jobs; users who perhaps had some",
"computer anxiety.  We felt the way to do this was to build a system that",
"didn't do surprising things the user didn't understand, a mailer that had",
"limited, well-thought-out functionality.  A that time, there was no such",
"Unix mailer commercially or freely available, but Elm seemed closest to",
"the goal, so we started modifying it. ",
"                                                                         ___----",
" ",
"One of the greatest problems with most mailers on Unix systems is the",
"editor.  One can normally choose between emacs and vi.  We experimented with",
"some versions of emacs and settled on a hacked version of micro emacs.",
"Eventually it became heavily modified and tightly integrated with the rest",
"of Pine.  One of the main features of having a tightly coupled editor is",
"that it can guide the user through editing the header of the message, and",
"Pine takes great care to do this.  A very simple and efficient interface to",
"the Unix spell command was also added.  The emacs style key bindings were",
"retained, though most of the other wild and wonderful emacs functions were",
"not.  The Pine composition editor is also available as a very simple stand",
"alone editor named \"pico\". ",
"                                                                         ___----",
"Also working at the University of Washington is the author of the Interactive ",
"Mail Access Protocol (IMAP).  IMAP is a functional superset of POP.  The IMAP",
"author had finished writing the \"c-client\" library as an interface to IMAP",
"and as a switch between drivers for IMAP mailboxes, Berkeley mail files and ",
"Tenex mail files.  Great care was taken to make the code writing the mail files",
"robust against disks filling up, other mailers overwriting the mail file, and",
"other errors to guarantee mail file consistency.  It was clear that Pine would",
"benefit greatly from using the c-client to access mail storage so the old Elm",
"code was replaced by calls to the c-client.  Consequently Pine can write and",
"access three different mail file formats and new ones can be added by creating",
"a simple driver.  In addition the c-client does a very careful job of doing all",
"the RFC 822 header parsing and achieves the highest compliance with the RFC.",
" ",
"The name \"Pine\" originally stood for \"Pine Is Nearly Elm\"; today",
"\"Pine Is No-longer Elm\" is more appropriate.  As it evolves, we hope the",
"interpretation \"Program for Internet News and Email\" will also apply.",
"                                                                         ___----",

"      2. General Description of the Address Book",
" ",
"The address book helps you keep a list of addresses you send mail to so you",
"do not have to remember addresses that are often complex.  Each entry in the",
"address book has three parts.  The nickname is short, usually less than eight",
"letters, and easy to remember.  You type this nickname in as you are",
"addressing the message in the composer and the address will be taken from the",
"address book.  The name is a longer field where you can put the full name of",
"the person and other information to clearly identify the address.  Usually the",
"full names are put in last name first so they sort nicely in alphabetical",
"order.  The third part is the address itself.  The addresses are sorted",
"alphabetically on the full name with distribution lists sorted to the end.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"Pine also allows distribution lists so you can have one nickname that refers",
"to a list of addresses to send mail to.  Each distribution list has a",
"nickname, a full name and a list of addresses.  The addresses may be actual",
"addresses or they may be other nicknames in your address book.  They may even",
"refer to other distribution lists.  The command to create a distribution list",
"is {F4:\"S\"} and the command to add entries to an existing list is {F5:\"Z\"}. ",
"Use {F11:\"D\"} to delete entries, placing the cursor on the address if an ",
"address is to be deleted, or on the nickname or full name of the list to ",
"delete the whole list.",
" ",
"The distribution lists in Pine are private distribution lists as is the rest",
"of the address book and can't be shared among several users.  One reason for",
"this is that any shared distribution list set up would be only available to",
"Pine users and therefore would preclude others using other mailers from using",
"the list even though they might be in the list.",
" ",
" ",
"      3. Notes on Address formats                                        ___----",
" ",
"There are a number of different formats for e-mail addresses, depending on the",
"kind of network the recipient is on.  The Internet style is preferred and",
"hopefully the world is moving toward it.  Also, it is often necessary to",
"combine address formats to get mail to some sites.",
" ",
"The standard format for the Internet address is:",
" ",
"                User Name <user@dept.org.domain>",
"                           or",
"                User Name <user@computer.dept.org.domain>",
" ",
"The number of segments on the right of the \"@\" sign can vary depending on",
"how the address is structured for the particular host.  Therefore, the above",
"examples are not absolute.  If you are sending to someone on the same system",
"as you are, you can leave the \"@\" and all the information to its right off",
"of the address, and Pine will fill it in automatically.  Sometimes you can also",
"abbreviate the right part of the address if you are at the same site.  So if",
"                                                                         ___----",
"your address is \"You <you@admin.washington.edu>\" and you're sending mail to",
"\"Them <them@purchase.washington.edu>\" then the address \"Them <them@purchase>\"",
"is often sufficient.  You may also leave off the user name and the angle",
"brackets and use just the plain address.",
" ",
"   Examples:    Dan Green <dang@cac>",
"                The Flying Legume <wingbean@laxvax.math.washington.edu>",
"                dizzy@deegee.com",
"                Joe Jackson <joe>",
" ",
"Another common Internet format is:",
" ",
"                dang@cac.washington.edu (Dan Green)",
" ",
"This is an older, unofficial format that will hopefully fall into disuse.",
"Pine understands both formats, but generates the official Internet style",
"addresses.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"When sending messages across gateways to other networks, the address gets",
"more complicated because they often have an Internet part and a part for the",
"other network.  One example of this is:",
" ",
"                joe%uwavm@gate.upitt.edu",
" ",
"First the message goes to the gateway gate.upitt.com and the gateway",
"deletes its name from the address and turns the % into an @.  The gateway",
"then figures out what to do with the address joe@uwavm.  ",
"                                                                         ___----",
"You may see an email address which looks like this:",
" ",
"                host1!host2!host3!user",
" ",
"This is an address on the UUCP network.  \"host1,\" and \"host2,\" are the",
"names of computers between you and the computer, \"host3,\" that \"user\"",
"to whom you want to send mail to has an account on.  In many cases, there ",
"will be a UUCP gateway, so you can just send your email to:",
"                ",
"                user@host3.uucp",
"                                                                         ___----",
"BITNET sites use a format that is similar to the Internet:",
"   ",
"                host@site",
" ",
"If you are sending mail from an Internet site to a BITNET site a local",
"gateway may have been setup so you can send mail to:",
"         ",
"                host@site.bitnet",
" ",
"This will automatically forward the mail through to BITNET rather than you",
"having to explicitly route it through a gateway.",

"the menu displayed at the bottom of your Pine compose screen. ",
" ",
"When in the header, the following keys have these meanings:",
"         ^J   Attach file",
"         ^R   Rich Header",
"         ^T   To Address Book or Files",
"The following keys are not active in the header:  ^W, ^_ and ^^",
" ",
"      4. About Marking, Cutting and Pasting                              ___----",
" ",
"The mark feature (^^) allows you to mark any segment of text, cut it out",
"(^K), move the cursor, and paste it (^U) in the new location.  You can",
"paste more than once, allowing you to use this feature to copy a block of",
"text also. ",
" ",
"If you use ^K (delete) and ^U (undelete) without using ^^ (mark), then",
"Pine assumes you want to delete 1 line for each ^K and paste all the lines",
"that were deleted together by pressing ^K multiple times. ",
" ",
"Mark is shown as \"^^\".  The first \"^\" means you should hold down the ",
"\"Control\" key on your keyboard.  The second \"^\" means \"type the ",
"character ^\".  ",
" ",
"      5. About the Contents of the Message                               ___----",
" ",
"Messages are usually just text, about 80 columns wide.  Using upper and lower",
"case is encouraged.  On some systems the size limit of the message is about",
"100,000 characters, which is about 2,000 lines.  You can include punctuation",
"and special characters found on most keyboards, but you can't include",
"characters with diacritical marks and certain special symbols.",
" ",
"Text automatically wraps as you type past the end of a line so you do not have ",
"to hit return.  Using the {F4:\"^J\"} command, you can also reformat text ",
"explicitly, perhaps after you have deleted some text.",
" ",
"You can include other text files with the {F5.:\"^R.\"} You will be prompted",
"for the file name of the file.",

"These are Bcc: (Blind Carbon Copy) and Fcc: (File Carbon Copy).  Those",
"addressed in the Bcc: field will receive a copy of the message but it",

" ",
"      8. Hebrew",
" ",
"The Hebrew editing capabilities are very similar to the English ones,",
"with two additions: the ability to toggle between entering Hebrew and",
"English text, and the ability of changing the writing direction. The",
"status line shows the current language (Heb or Eng) and the current",
"direction (<- or ->). The initial status is Heb and <- . To change the",
"language, type ^T. English entered in Hebrew mode will be \"pushed\"",
"(the cursor won't move, and the text to its left will move to the left",
"as more characters are entered). To change the writing direction, hit",
"the Escape key, followed by T. It is important to understand that the",
"text is stored as a stream on characters, and on each line the last",
"Hebrew character is stored first. This can cause some unexpected",
"results when justification, line breaking etc. are applied.",

"      3. Address formats                                                 ___----",
" ",
"There are a number of different formats for e-mail addresses, depending on",
"the kind of network the recipient is on.  The Internet style is preferred and",
"hopefully the world is moving toward it.  Also, it is often necessary to",
"combine address formats to get mail to some sites.",
" ",
"The standard format for the Internet address is:",
" ",
"                User Name <user@dept.org.domain>",
"                           or",
"                User Name <user@computer.dept.org.domain>",
" ",
"The number of segments on the right of the \"@\" sign can vary depending on",
"how the address is structured for the particular host.  Therefore, the above",
"examples are not absolute.  If you are sending to someone on the same system",
"as you are, you can leave the \"@\" and all the information to its right off",
"of the address and Pine will fill it in automatically.  Sometimes you can also",
"abbreviate the right part of the address if you are at the same site.  So if",
"                                                                         ___----",
"your address is \"You <you@astro.washington.edu>\" and you're sending mail to",
"\"Them <them@aero.washington.edu>\" then the address \"Them <them@aero>\"",
"is often sufficient.  You may also leave off the user name and the angle",
"brackets and use just the plain address.",
" ",
"   Examples:    Dan Green <dang@cac>",
"                The Flying Legume <wingbean@laxvax.math.washington.edu>",
"                dizzy@deegee.com",
"                Joe Jackson <joe>",
" ",
"Another common Internet format is:",
" ",
"                dang@cac.washington.edu (Dan Green)",
" ",
"This is an older, unofficial format that will hopefully fall into disuse.  Pine",
"understands both formats, but generates the official Internet style addresses.",
"                                                                         ___----",
"When sending messages across gateways to other networks, the address gets",
"more complicated because they often have an Internet part and a part for the",
"other network.  One example of this is:",
" ",
"                joe%uwavm@gate.upitt.edu",
" ",
"First the message goes to the gate.upitt.com and then the gateway figures",
"out what to do with the address joe%uwavm.  ",
" ",
"You may see an email address which looks like this:",
" ",
"                host1!host2!host3!user",
" ",
"This is an address on the UUCP network.  \"host1,\" and \"host2,\" are the",
"names of computers between you and the computer, \"host3,\" that \"user\"",
"to whom you want to send mail to has an account on.  In many cases, there ",
"will be a UUCP gateway, so you can just send your email to:",
"                ",
"                user@host3.uucp",
"                                                                         ___----",
" ",
"BITNET sites use a format that is similar to the Internet:",
"   ",
"                host@site",
" ",
"If you are sending mail from an Internet site to a BITNET site, a local",
"gateway may have been setup so you can send mail to:",
"         ",
"                host@site.bitnet",
" ",
"This will automatically forward the mail through to BITNET rather than you",
"having to explicitly route it through a gateway.",
