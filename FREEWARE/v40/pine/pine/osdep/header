 This contains most of Pine's interface to the local operating system
and hardware.  Hopefully this file, os-xxx.h and makefile.xxx are the
only ones that have to be modified for most ports.  Signals.c, ttyin.c,
and ttyout.c also have some dependencies.  See the doc/tech-notes for
notes on porting Pine to other platforms.  Here is a list of the functions
required for an implementation:


  File System Access
     can_access          -- See if a file can be accessed
     file_size           -- Return the number of bytes in the file
     is_writable_dir     -- Check to see if directory exists and is writable
     create_mail_dir     -- Make a directory
     rename_file         -- change name of a file
     build_path          -- Put together a file system path
     last_cmpnt          -- Returns pointer to last component of path
     expand_foldername   -- Expand a folder name to full path
     fnexpand            -- Do filename exansion for csh style "~"
     filter_filename     -- Make sure file name hasn't got weird chars
     disk_quota          -- Check the user's disk quota
     read_file           -- Read whole file into memory (for small files)
     create_tmpfile      -- Just like ANSI C tmpfile function
     temp_nam            -- Almost like common tempnam function
     fget_pos,fset_pos   -- Just like ANSI C fgetpos, fsetpos functions

  Abort
     coredump            -- Abort running Pine dumping core if possible

  System Name and Domain
     hostname            -- Figure out the system's host name, only
                              used internally in this file.
     getdomainnames      -- Figure out the system's domain name
     canonical_name      -- Returns canonical form of host name

  Job Control
     have_job_control    -- Returns 1 if job control exists
     stop_process        -- What to do to stop process when it's time to stop
			      (only used if have_job_control returns 1)

  System Error Messages (in case given one is a problem)
     error_description   -- Returns string describing error

  System Password and Accounts
     gcos_name           -- Parses full name from system, only used
			      locally in this file so if you don't use it you
			      don't need it
     get_system_login    -- Returns user's login name 
     get_system_fullname -- Returns user's full name 
     get_system_homedir  -- Returns user's home directoru
     get_system_passwd   -- Returns enscrypted password
     local_name_lookup   -- Get full name of user on system
     change_passwd       -- Calls system password changer

  MIME utilities
     mime_can_display    -- Can we display this type/subtype?
     gf_play_sound       -- Play audio MIME if possible

  Other stuff
     srandom             -- Dummy srandom if you don't have this function
