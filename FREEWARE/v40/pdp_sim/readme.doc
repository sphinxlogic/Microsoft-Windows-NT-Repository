I am pleased to announce the (internal field test) for V2 of the PDP-8,
PDP-11, and Nova simulators.  The main new feature in V2 is symbolic
decoding and encoding of instructions as part of examine/deposit.

To get the sources and the simulated OS8 and RT11 disks (no software for
the Nova yet), copy supnik::dka300:[supnik.sim]*.* to your system and
proceed as outlined in these notes.  Documentation on the simulators is
in file SIM.DOC.

1. The simulators work on both VAX/VMS and on Alpha/OSF1.

2. The PDP-8 includes 8/E CPU, EAE, reader, punch, teletype, clock, line
   printer, RK08, RX8E, and RF08.  The PDP-11 includes J-11 CPU, floating
   point, reader, punch, terminal, clock, line printer, RK11, RX11, and
   RL11.  The Nova includes Nova 1200 CPU, multiply/divide, reader, punch,
   terminal, clock, line printer, moving head disk, fixed head disk.
   The disk images are:

	OS8.DSK		RK: OS/8
	RT11.DSK	RK: RT11SJ V5.04 (RT11FB is also on the disk pack)
	RSX11M.DSK	RL: RSX11M
	RSTS.DSK	RL: RSTS/E

   The OS8 disk is of doubtful origin, and the copy of BASIC on the
   simulated disk does not work (checked on other simulators).  The
   RSTS/E disk also has problems during startup but is functional.

3. There's a VMS build file for each simulator:

	pdp8_build	builds PDP8.EXE
	pdp11_build	builds PDP11.EXE
	nova_build	builds NOVA.EXE

   The build files include the debugger, remove that if you want.

   For OSF/1, the build command lines are:

	cc pdp8*.c scp*.c -lm -o pdp8
	cc pdp11*.c scp*.c -o pdp11
	cc nova*.c scp*.c -lm -o pdp11

4. The simulators are only partially tested.  The PDP-8 and PDP-11 have
   run their respective operating systems.  The Nova has run small test
   programs.

   I would APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK.  Feel free to try small programs
   to test the EAE, FP11, and devices.  If you find bugs, feel free to
   look through the sources and send me the fixes...:-)

5. To get the simulated operating systems up and running (OSF/1 shown):

	% pdp8

	PDP-8 simulator V1.0
	sim> att rk0 os8.dsk
	sim> boot rk0

	. <-- OS/8 prompt

   This is pretty much instantaneous on either VAX or Alpha.  You
   must first set the date (note that OS/8 REQUIRES CAPITAL LETTERS
   FOR INPUT) and then you can type HELP or DIR to explore further:

	.DA 14-MAR-95

	.DIR

   For the PDP-11 and RT11:

	% pdp11

	PDP-11 simulator V1.0
	
	sim> att rk0 rt11.dsk
	sim> boot rk0

	RT11SJ (S) V5.04

	.
	. <-- RT11 prompt

   Note that on a slow VAX (eg, a 3100) it takes 45 seconds to get to
   the banner, and another 15-20 seconds to get to the prompts.  On
   Alpha/OSF1, it takes a few seconds to reach the prompt.  You can
   then set the date, type HELP or DIR, and so on.  RT11 accepts lower
   case input.

   The simulator is stopped by typing ^E (control-E).  This can be
   changed through the WRU register.
