     gopherrc - configuration file for gopher(1)

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ggoopphheerrrrcc file contains a list of directives that alter
     the behaviour of the ggoopphheerr((11)) client.  It is composed of
     lines of the form:

          _T_o_k_e_n: _V_a_l_u_e

     Tokens are case insensitive and the value field will change,
     depending on the token.  A pound sign ("#") at the beginning
     of a line signifies a comment line.

     Gopherrc files are used in a number of places.  There is a
     global gopherrc file (called gopherrc).  This is usually
     placed in a systemwide directory.  A file with the same for-
     mat called remotegopher.rc is also used by the gopher client
     when using the -r switch.

     Also, an individual has their own customized version of this
     file in their home directory in the file .gopherrc. On VMS
     this file is called GOPHERRC.

     All of these files use the format described below.

     Most people will set the values in this file by pressing the
     'O' key to set options in the curses gopher client, rather
     than editing this file directly.  People considering editing
     this file on VMS should make sure their editor preserves the
     Stream_LF format of the file.

     The sequence of %s is replaced with the filename of a tem-
     porary file containing the document to be printed or viewed.

     If the command starts with the vertical bar (|) the command
     will be executed immediately and the document will be sent
     to the commands standard input.  Note this feature does not
     work on VMS.

     If the display command is set to 'builtin', then the text
     file pager inside the gopher client will be used to display
     the item.


     _S_e_a_r_c_h_B_o_l_d_i_n_g:

     is 'yes', then search words will be bolded.  Otherwise
     they'll be left alone.
