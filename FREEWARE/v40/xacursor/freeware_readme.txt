XACURSOR, MOTIF_TOYS, Set an animated cursor in a window 

Hi, thanks for using "xacursor".  It is, as its name implies, a
program that animates the cursors in an X-terminal.  The program has
3 modes, it can:

     1. change the cursor to the one specified using the "-cursor" option
     2. show the standard demonstration by the option "-demo"
     3. Most importantly, it changes the cursor in the sequence provided by
        a configuration file, so an animated effect is achieved.
