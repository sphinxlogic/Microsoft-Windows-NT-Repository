  following:

          o Do a full BACKUP of the system disk.  This is a standard precau-
            tion recommended by Digital whenever using VMSINSTAL.

          o Install the Fragmentation Cost Analysis and Fragmentation
            Analysis Utility using VMSINSTAL.  See Section 1.8.

          o Define symbols to invoke the Fragmentation Analysis Utility and
	    the Fragmentation Cost Analysis.  See Sections 1.10 and 1.11.


1.8  Installation Procedure
___________________________
  
  The Fragmentation Cost Analysis and the Fragmentation Analysis Utility are
  distributed together on the same media.  Both utilities are intended to be
  installed in the same directory.  During the installation procedure, you are
  allowed to specify the device and directory locations for the two utilities.
  By default, they are installed at SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ESI_FAU]

  
Step 1:

  Log into the OpenVMS system manager's account (username SYSTEM, UIC [1,4])
  and give your process the OPER and SETPRV privileges.  This ensures that you
  will have access to the files and images needed for the installation and
  that files created during the installation will be created properly.

  The device name DUA0 is used as an example in this dialog.  During
  installation, the physical name of SYS$SYSDEVICE for your system will appear
  in place of DUA0 shown in the dialog below.

                                                 _____________________
				                 Installation - Page 3


Step 2:

  Set the default disk directory to SYS$UPDATE:

          $ SET DEFAULT SYS$UPDATE
  
Step 3:

  Execute the VMSINSTAL command procedure defining the product being
  installed, followed by the input device name (CD ROM drive DKB500: in this
  example).
  
          $ @VMSINSTAL FAU DKB500:[ESI.UTILITIES.FRAG_ANALYSIS.V11.KIT]

  VMSINSTAL will begin by displaying some information about the state of your
  system, such as whether DECnet[TM] is running, then ask whether you want
  to continue.  Respond with YES only if the information displayed is as
  expected.

  Note: It is not necessary to shut down DECnet or log off users to install
  the Fragmentation Analysis Utility.

          * Do you want to continue anyway [NO]? YES

  
Step 4:

  Next, VMSINSTAL will ask whether you are satisfied with the backup of your
  system disk.  While every precaution has been taken to prevent adverse
  side-effects during installation of our product, Digital and Executive
  Software recommend having a current full backup of your system disk when
  installing any new software.

          * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? YES


Step 5:

  There will be a period of a few minutes of processing.  Read all messages and
  answer any questions asked.  Normally, the installation proceeds like this:

          %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED,FAU mounted on DKB500:
          The following products will be processed:

            FAU V1.1

                  Beginning installation of FAU V1.1 at 14:36

          %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A...
          * Do you want to purge files replaced by this installation [YES]? YES

  
Step 6:

  A temporary directory is created; product saveset A is restored; and the
  copyright notice is displayed.

  Press <Return> when prompted to do so.


  
                                               _____________________
				                 Installation - Page 4


Step 7:

  Next, you are given the opportunity to specify the device and directory
  where the Fragmentation Cost Analysis and the Fragmentation Analysis Utility
  will be installed.  Press <Return> to accept the default, or answer NO at the
  following prompt:


          * OK to install FAU at SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ESI_FAU] [YES]? YES

  If you answer NO, you will be prompted to enter the device and directory
  where you want the Fragmentation Cost Analysis and Fragmentation Analysis
  Utility files to reside.

  
Step 8:

  There will be another period of a few minutes of processing.  Watch for
  errors or any other messages, such as:

 FAU will be installed at SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ESI_FAU]

 %VMSINSTAL-I-SYSDIR, This product creates system disk directory DUA0:[ESI_FAU].

 Copying files, please wait...

 All files copied and secured
 %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target directories...

         Installation of FAU completed at 14:37

  VMSINSTAL procedure done at 14:37

  
Step 9:

  Since VMSINSTAL modifies your process environment, you should log out and
  back on to your system after this installation is complete.


1.9  Fragmentation Cost Analysis and Fragmentation Analysis Utility Kit Files
_____________________________________________________________________________
  
  After installation, the Fragmentation Cost Analysis and Fragmentation
  Analysis Utility files reside in SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ESI_FAU] if the default
  directory was accepted at installation time.  This directory specification
  will differ if you specified an alternate directory location for the
  Fragmentation Cost Analysis and Fragmentation Analysis Utility files.  The
  files installed are shown in Table 1-2.

             Total of 2 Files.
             __________________________________________________________________
             [2]The xxx portion of the filename will be either AXP or VAX,
             depending upon your computer platform.
             __________________________________________________________________
  

  
1.10  Defining a Symbol for the Fragmentation Analysis Utility
______________________________________________________________

  For ease of use, define the following symbol in the system-wide login
  procedure or the individual login procedures of the users needing access to
  the Fragmentation Analysis Utility:

	$ FAU == "$ device:[directory]FRAG_ANALYSIS_xxx.EXE"

  where device:[directory] is the device and directory where the Fragmentation
  Analysis Utility executable image was installed during the installation
  procedure.  Note that the "xxx" portion of the image name is either AXP or
  VAX, depending upon your computer platform.

  Once this has been done, run the Fragmentation Analysis Utility using a
  command of this form:

	$ FAU disk_name /qualifiers

  If the disk name is omitted, the Fragmentation Analysis Utility will prompt
  for the disk name.  Only one disk can be specified at a  time.   The
  optional qualifiers represent Fragmentation Analysis Utility qualifiers, as
  shown in the Fragmentation Analysis Utility User's Guide.

  
1.11  Defining a Symbol for the Fragmentation Cost Analysis
___________________________________________________________

  For ease of use, define the following symbol in the system-wide login
  procedure or the individual login procedures of the users needing access to
  the Fragmentation Cost Analysis:

	$ FCA == "@device:[directory]FCA.COM"

  where device:[directory] is the device and directory where the FCA.COM
  command procedure was installed during the installation procedure.  Once the
  FCA symbol has been defined, run the  Fragmentation Cost Analysis by
  entering this command at the DCL ($) prompt:

	$ FCA
