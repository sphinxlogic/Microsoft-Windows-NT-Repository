Hi,

Section 14.2.3 DECNET Server and Client Nodes of the ANU News 6.0 manual is
very vague.  For example, it says "the process is not documented here" at one
point.  I've played with this stuff and figured it out.  I sent the following 
instructions to the person downstream and we were able to use them to
successfully bring up a news feed.  These directions were originally VERY site
specific.  I've tried to generalize some, but it is not totally general.  Also,
these instructions may not be optimal (i.e. I may have done unnecessary steps)
and may not work with all configurations of News.  These directions also do not
address NNTP_DECM.EXE, but the differences are adquately explained in the
manual already. (Enough disclaimers I think :).

I'm sending them out in hopes that someone in netland will benefit from them
and maybe that Geoff can clean them up somewhat and combine them with the
existing material in the next release of the manual.


Here are the steps:

1.  Create an account which looks like the following (you can use any UIC
    however):

Username: NNTP$SERVER                      Owner:  nntp$server default
Account:  DECNET                           UIC:    [376,377] ([NNTP$SERVER])
CLI:      DCL                              Tables: 
Default:  NEWS_ROOT:[NNTP$SERVER]

1a. You need to give the account some type of password and remember it below
    (after you do that step, it doesn't matter if you forget it).

2.  Give NNTP$SERVER a disk quota if it is on a drive with disk quota enabled.

3.  Create a directory NEWS_DEVICE:[NNTP$SERVER] which is owned by
    NNTP$SERVER.

4.  In that directory, put the following file (call it NNTP.COM):

$! NNTP.COM - executed in response to an incoming connect
$! to "NNTP="
$ RUN NEWS_MANAGER:NNTP_DEC

5.  SET PROTECTION:W:E NEWS_MANAGER:NNTP_DEC.EXE

6.  INSTALL ADD NEWS_MANAGER:NNTP_DEC.EXE/PRIV=SYSPRV/OPEN

7.  Run authorize and type ADD/PROXY remote-node::NEWSMGR NNTP$SERVER/DEFAULT

8.  RUN SYS$SYSTEM:NCP and then at the NCP prompt (it is one long command): 

    DEFINE OBJECT NNTP NUMBER 197 FILE NEWS_MANAGER:NNTP_DEC.EXE USER
    NNTP$SERVER PASSWORD [put the one from above here] PROXY BOTH ALIAS
    INCOMING ENABLED

    and

    SET OBJECT NNTP NUMBER 197 FILE NEWS_MANAGER:NNTP_DEC.EXE USER
    NNTP$SERVER PASSWORD [put the one from above here] PROXY BOTH ALIAS
    INCOMING ENABLED

    Note: if you type SHOW KNOWN OBJECTS in NCP and 197 is used (it shouldn't
          be), then I believe you can pick anything you want instead (not sure 
          if mine and yours have to be the same number or not).

9.  DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC NEWS_remotenode_TASK "TASK=NNTP"
    Also, add this line to your ANU News startup file.
