Operating Instructions

Dungeon comes ready to run; simply run the executable appropriate to
your system - either DUNGEON_VAX.EXE or DUNGEON_ALPHA.EXE. Dungeon
needs two data files to work; by default they are assumed to be in
your default directory. If they are not, you must define the following
logical names:

$ DEFINE DINDX device:[directory]DINDX.DAT
$ DEFINE DTEXT device:[directory]DTEXT.DAT

Should you wish to rebuild Dungeon from source, simply invoke
MAKE_DUNGEON.COM.
