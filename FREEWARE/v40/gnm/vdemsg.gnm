!
! MODULE FUNCTION
!   The .GNM file is the central file for error messages.  Both the .MSG
!   to be compiled into the software and the .GNC to be included in the
!   document are derived from this file.  
!
!
!                 < < < < < < < + > > > > > > > >
!                 < < <   W A R N I N G   > > > >
!                 < < < < < < < + > > > > > > > >
!
!   DO *NOT* REORDER ANY MESSAGES PRESENT IN THIS FILE.  ADD MESSAGES
!   ONLY AT THE ENDS OF THE SECTIONS, AND SUBSTITUTE DUMMY MESSAGES
!   FOR ANY MESSAGE ENTRIES THAT ARE REMOVED.  (Use the name SPARE_n
!   for the dummy message, where 'n' is a unique value.)
!
!
!   The file can be thought of as a series of directives:
!
!   .NAME	    - The message symbol without the VDE$_
!   .MESSAGE	    - The message text, it may be wrapped
!   .EXPLANATION    - The description that appears in the document
!   .USER_ACTION    - The recovery section that appears in the document.
!   .BREAK	    - May be used to start a new paragraph in the
!		      .explanation or .user_action
!   .DESTINATION    - Which file the following appears in, parameters are
!		      both, message
!   .SEVERITY       - informational, success, warning, error, or fatal
!
!   The first 4 directives: .name, .message, .explanation, .user_action,
!   occur as a group in that order for each message.  .explanation and
!   .user_action are optional.  The FAO arguments within the .message
!   are contained within <>.  Within the <> there are 2 arguments, the
!   first is a word which will be emphasized in that position in the
!   document, the second is the FAO argument which will appear in the
!   message file in that position.  
!
!   The .destination directive must appear between message groups and is
!   in effect until another .destination directive occurs.  Thus, when
!   one message is to goto the message file only a .destination message
!   will precede the message group and a .destination both will follow
!   the group.  
!
!   Developers are encouraged to include explanations and user actions.
!   The writer will clean things up before a release.  
!
!   Use spaces for the indentation of the message text and explanations.
!   The utilities that process the .GNC file don't like tabs.
!
!   Other rules apply to the file but these are the ones necessary for
!   normal updating of the message 
!
! REVISION HISTORY
!	Steve Hoffman		22-Mar-1994
!	Added the `no reorder' warning (avoids various problems in
!	mixed-version/mixed-architecture VMScluster environments)
!	and also added the quota-related messages.

.name	    ARCHADDED
.message	architecture <architecture, !AC> added to the database
.explanation	This message informs you that the indicated architecture 
		definition has been added to the VDE database.  This 
		message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier 
		on the CREATE ARCHITECTURE command.
.user_action	Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
		wish to see the message. 

.name	    ARCHDEL
.message	architecture <architecture, !AC> deleted from the database
.explanation	This message informs you that the definition for the 
		indicated architecture has been deleted from the VDE 
		database.  This message is only issued when you use 
		the /LOG qualifier on the DELETE ARCHITECTURE command.
.user_action	Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not 
		wish to see the message. 

.name	    ARCHEXISTS
.message	architecture <architecture, !AC>  already exists in database; not changed
.explanation	The indicated architecture name was specified on a CREATE 
		ARCHITECTURE command, but an entry for that architecture 
		is already present in the database.  Hence a new entry was 
		not created for that architecture.  Alternatively, the 
		indicated name was specified as the new name for an existing 
		architecture on the MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command, but another 
		architecture already has the requested new name.  Hence the 
		name of the existing architecture could not be changed to 
		the new name.
.user_action	If you entered the wrong architecture name, reenter the 
		command with the correct name.  If you entered the right 
		architecture name, use the SHOW ARCHITECTURE command to 
		display the database information for that architecture.  
		If you are not satisfied with that information, use the 
		MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command to change it.

.name	    ARCHMOD
.message	information for architecture <architecture, !AC> modified in the database
.explanation	This message informs you that information for the indicated 
		architecture has been modified in the VDE database.  This 
		message is only issued when you use the /LOG qualifier on 
		the MODIFY ARCHITECTURE command.
.user_action	Use the /NOLOG qualifier for the command if you do not wish 
		to see the message. 

.name	    DEFARCH
.message	architecture <architecture, !AC> not deleted; you cannot delete default architecture
.explanation	This message informs you that the indicated architecture, 
		namely the current default architecture, has not been 
		deleted from the database.  You are not allowed to delete 
		the default architecture.  This prohibition prevents you 
		from accidentally deleting all architectures, especially 
		when using a wildcarded architecture name specification.  
		There is thus no way to delete all architectures from the 
		database.  (If you could delete all architectures, the 
		library would become useless since it could not contain 
		any modules.)
.user_action	If you want to delete a given architecture from the database, 
		set your default architecture to another architecture that you 
		want to keep.  Then issue the DELETE ARCHITECTURE command.

.name	    ARCHNOTFOUND
.message	architecture <architecture, !AC> not found in database; parameter ignored
.explanation	The indicated architecture name was entered on a SHOW 
		ARCHITECTURE command, but no such architecture was found 
		in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated architecture does not exist in the 
		database. 

.name	    ATTACHED
.message	terminal now attached to process <process-name, !AS>
.explanation	The SPAWN command issues this message before attaching to 
		the new process.  

.name	    BADQUESTAT
.message	bad status for batch queue <queue-name, !AC>
.explanation	A batch queue to which you are attempting to submit a 
		build job is not available.  The reason why it is not 
		available is given by a second message following this 
		message.
.user_action	This is an informational message only.  If you need the 
		displayed batch queue for your build job, stop the build 
		job and resubmit it later when the queue is available again.

.name	    BLDALRSTART
.message	build job <job, !SL> for stream <stream, !AC> already started;<,!/> build job cannot be started again
.explanation	You are attempting to start a build job that cannot be 
		started because it has already been started.  A build job 
		can only be started if it is not queued for execution or if 
		it is suspended.  As a result, the specified build job could 
		not be started.
.user_action	This is an informational message.  No user action is required.

.name	    BLDALRSTOP
.message	build job <job, !SL> for stream <stream, !AC> has already stopped;<,!/> build job cannot be stopped again

.name	    EXPGENDIFF
.message	expected generation expression <expression,!AC> differs from actual <expression,!AC>
.explanation	When you reserved the module you are replacing, the 
		RESERVE command displayed the expected replace-time CMS 
		generation expression of the new module generation.  
		However, the actual CMS generation expression that VDE 
		assigned during the current replacement differs from that 
		expected generation expression.  This situation is normal 
		because VDE cannot predict the actual replace-time CMS 
		generation expression when you reserve the module; it 
		can only tell you the most likely generation expression.  
		By the time you replace the module, various circumstances 
		can change the appropriate generation expression to use.
.user_action	None.  This message is informational only.  However, if 
		you used the expected CMS generation expression in code 
		comments, you may have to change those comments.

.name	    EXPGENEXPR
.message	expected generation expression at replacement is <generation,!AC>
.explanation	When you replace the module you just reserved, the new 
		generation of the module is expected to have the indicated 
		CMS generation expression.  You may use this generation 
		expression as an <QUOTE>(audit trail identifier) in the 
		comments in your code if your project uses that convention.  
		The indicated generation expression may differ from the 
		one that VDE actually assigns when you replace the module, 
		but only in certain unusual circumstances.
.user_action	None.  This message is informational only.

.explanation	This message informs you that VDE expects to generate a fold
		record for the indicated stream.  The fold record will be
		generated when this module change is approved and performed
		by the project leader -- when the queued replacement is
		performed.  Because there may be a delay before the
		replacement is performed by the project leader and
		because the project leader may reject the replacement, the
		fold record will not immediately appear via commands such
		as SHOW REPLACEMENT.  The fold will be generated when VDE
		sends you the notification that the replacement has been
		performed.  This message is only issued when you use the
		/LOG qualifier on the REPLACE command, and only for a queued
		replacement from which VDE expects to generate a fold record.

.message	output module <module,!AC> of build step is a source module; ignored
.explanation	The automatically collected dependency information for the 
		current build step specifies that the indicated module is 
		an output from the step.  However, the module is marked as 
		a source module in the VDE database, and a source module 
		cannot be an output of a build step.  Hence this dependency 
		information is ignored and is not recorded in the database.
.user_action	If the module is erroneously marked as a source module in 
		the VDE database, you should delete the module and rerun 
		the build step.  If the module actually is a source module, 
		you should investigate why the compiler or other processor 
		specifies it as an output from the build step.

.name	    QUECLOSED
.message	batch queue <queue,!AC> is closed and cannot accept jobs
.explanation	The indicated batch queue is closed and cannot accept

.name	    COMTERMEOF
.message	command terminated by CTRL/Z or end-of-file on input
.explanation	The current command has been terminated because the 
		user entered a CTRL/Z in response to a query for 
		additional information needed to execute the command.  
		Alternatively, an end-of-file may have been encountered 
		in the current input file in response to such a query.
                This error can also appear if an attempt is made to
		use DCL command procedure with a VDE kept subprocess.
.user_action	Not an error since a user may intentionally terminate 
		commands in this way.  To execute the original command, 
		reenter the command and supply all required information.
                If using a DCL command procedure to issue VDE commands,
		disable the use of the VDE kept subprocess, or switch

		default stream specified by the context has been deleted.  
		As a result, the context cannot be set.
.user_action	Redefine the context to reference a stream that has not 
		been deleted.  Then reissue the command.

.name	    DATETOOLONG
.message	date-time value is too long; maximum length is 24: <date,!AD>...
.explanation	A date-time value entered as a command parameter is too
		long because it exceeds the maximum length indicated in
		the message. 
.user_action	Reissue the command with a shorter date-time value.

.name	    DCLBUFOVFL
.message	DCL command line being generated is too long for buffer
.explanation	Some command which generates a DCL command file to perform 
		part of its actions generated a DCL command line that is 
		too long for its buffer; this normally means that the line 
		is excessively long since the buffer size is ample for 
		normal use.
.user_action	Change the command line specification in the script for it.

.name	    DCLERROR
.message	error status returned by spawned DCL <DCL,!AC> command
.explanation	VDE has run a DCL command in a spawned subprocess and that 
		command has returned an error status.  The command's status 
		is displayed by the following status line.

		the VDE command.

.name	    DIRTOOLONG
.message	directory specification is too long; maximum length is 255
.explanation	A directory specification entered as a command parameter 
		is too long because it exceeds the maximum length indicated 
		in the message.
.user_action	Reissue the command with a shorter directory specification.

.name	    DIRNOTFOUDCL
.message	directory location not found for script's DCL command file
.explanation	The subdirectory in the VDE library that should be used 
		for the DCL command file that the current script generates 
		is not found in the database.  This message indicates that 
		some required subdirectory is not present in the directory 
		tree for the current development stream.
.user_action	Create the directory tree or correct the directory structure 
		for the current stream or stream and facility.  Then 
		reissue the command that invokes the script.

.name	    DIRNOTFOULOG
.message	directory location not found for build-step log file
.explanation	The subdirectory in the VDE library that should be used 
		for the log file for the current build step is not found 
		in the database.  This message indicates that some required 
		subdirectory is not present in the directory tree for the 
		current development stream.
.user_action	Create the directory tree or correct the directory structure 
		for the current stream or stream and facility.  Then 
		reissue the command that executes the build step.

.name	    DIRNOTFOUSCRP
.message	directory location not found by script function <function,!AC>
.explanation	The current script has invoked the indicated script 
		function (such as $DIR or $FACROOT), but the directory 
		location specified with that function invocation is not 
		found in the VDE database.  This may mean that the 
		directory tree for the specified stream or facility 
		has not been created, or that the function invocation 
		specifies a directory symbol that is not used for that 
		stream and facility.
.user_action	Create the directory tree for the facility or stream, or 
		correct the directory symbol name in the function call.  
		Then reissue the command that invokes the script.

.name	    DUPLNAME
.message	duplicate name in list not allowed: <name,!AC>
.explanation	You have entered the same name twice in a comma list where 
		such duplicates are not allowed.  Possibly, you may have 
		mistyped one of the names.
.user_action	Correct the error and reissue the command without any 
		duplicates.

.name	    EDITUNDEF
.message	your editor is undefined; editor cannot be invoked
.explanation	The command you have entered is attempting to invoke an 
		editor to read or edit a file, but you have not specified 
		what editor to invoke.  You must specify the editor you 
		want VDE to use by entering the SET EDITOR command.
.user_action	Use the SET EDITOR command to define the editor you want 
		VDE to invoke for all commands to put you in an editor.

.name	    ERRDIRSPEC
.message	error in directory or file specification <file-name, !AD>
.explanation	There is a syntax error or other error in the indicated 
		directory or file specification.  The RMS message that 
		follows explains the error in more detail.
.user_action	Correct the error in the directory or file specification 
		and reissue the command.

.name	    ERRWRIFIL
.message	error writing file <file-name,!AC>
.explanation	The output could not be written to the appropriate file. 
.user_action	Determine if there is any external interference with RMS 
		writing to the specified file.  If no interference can 
		be found, please contact VDE support for assistance.

.name	    EXPGENLONG
.message	expected CMS generation expression is too long
.explanation	The expected replace-time CMS generation expression for 
		the module you are reserving will be longer than 16 
		characters, which is longer than CMS allows.  As a result, 
		you cannot reserve the module.
.user_action	This error indicates that you have reserved and replaced 
		modules on too many nested non-main streams.  You should 
		create new streams off the main development stream and 
		place the offending generations there so that they have 
		CMS generation expressions of modest size.  Even though 
		you cannot reserve the generation in question, you can 
		still fetch it out and replace it into the new streams.

.name	    FACEXISTS
.message	facility <facility,!AC> already exists in database
.explanation	The indicated facility name was specified on a CREATE 
		FACILITY command, but an entry for that facility is already 
		present in the database.  Alternatively, the indicated name 
		was specified as the new name for an existing facility using 
		the MODIFY FACILITY command, but another facility already 
		has the requested new name.  In either case, the command 
		fails and the facility is not created or modified.
.user_action	If you entered the wrong facility name, reenter the command 
		with the correct name.  If you entered the right facility 
		name, use the SHOW FACILITY command to display the database 
		information for that facility.  If you are not satisfied 
		with that information, use the MODIFY FACILITY command to 
		change it.

.name	    FILENOTFOUND
.message	file not found: <file,!AC>
.explanation	The indicated file was requested through a VDE command, 
		but could not be found.  Hence the current command cannot 
		perform the requested action.
.user_action	Do without the file or determine why the file is missing 
		and correct the problem.

.name	    FILREADERR
.message	unable to read file <file,!AD>
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to read a line of text from 
		an input file.  A more specific error message follows 
		this message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    FILWRITERR
.message	unable to write file <file,!AD>
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to write a line of text to 
		an output file.  A more specific error message follows 
		this message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    FIRGENNODEL
.message	generation <generation,!AC> is first generation of module; cannot be deleted
.explanation	You are trying to delete the first generation of a module 
		with the DELETE GENERATION command, which VDE does not 
		allow.  If you want to delete all generations of a module, 
		you must delete the entire module with the DELETE MODULE 
		command.
.user_action	If you mistyped the generation number, reenter it correctly.  
		If you want to delete all generations of the module, use 
		the DELETE MODULE command.

.name	    FOLDIDREQ
.message	fold identifier required for module <module,!AC>
.explanation	You have multiple fold records for the indicated module.  
		You must therefore specify a fold identifier with the 
		/IDENTIFICATION or /FOLD qualifier (depending on the 
		command) to uniquely indicate to which fold record you 
		want the command to apply.
.user_action	Reissue the command with the /IDENTIFICATION or /FOLD 
		qualifier to indicate the specific fold record to which 
		you want the command to apply.

.name	    FOLDIDUSED
.message	fold identifier <identifier,!AC> already used for module <module,!AC><,!/>      attempt to create fold record has failed
.explanation	You are trying to create a fold record for a module using 
		the same fold identifier as you have used on a previous 
		fold record for the same module in the same development 
		stream.  This is not allowed, since fold identifiers must 
		be unique.
.user_action	Reissue the CREATE FOLD command with a different fold 
		identifier specified on the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.  
		Alternatively, you can omit the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, 
		in which case VDE will assign a unique identifier for you.

.name	    GENNODEL
.message	generation <generation,!AC> cannot be deleted
.explanation	You are trying to delete a generation of a module which is 
		still reachable by at least one stream and/or is not a leaf 
		generation (some other generation points to it as its previous 
		generation).  VDE does not allow a generation to be deleted 
		in either of these cases.
.user_action	Check that you have specified the correct generation for 
		deletion.

.name	    GENNOPRED
.message	generation <generation,!AC> of <module,!AC> has no predecessor
.explanation	The generation of the indicated module with the shown 
		CMS generation expression does not have a predecessor 
		generation.  As a result, the current operation cannot 
		be performed.  For example, the DIFFERENCES command 
		cannot compare generation 1 with its predecessor because 
		it has no predecessor.
.user_action	Specify a generation that has a predecessor (normally any 
		generation except generation 1) and rerun the command.

.name	    GETJPI
.message	SYS$GETJPI system service failed, unable to attach
.explanation	The ATTACH command could not continue because a failed 
		service call to SYS$GETJPI occurred.
.user_action	Determine if there is any external interference. 
		If no interference can be found, then please submit a 
		problem report.

.name	    GETQUIERR
.message	get queue information system service error for queue <queue,!AC>
.explanation	You have attempted to start a build job and the VMS get 
		queue information ($GETQUI) system service returned an error 
		status.  The message that follows gives more information to 
		explain the error.
.user_action	The action to take to correct the error depends on the 
		nature of the error.  You or your system manager should 
		correct the error and restart the build job.

.name	    INVGENEXPR
.message	invalid CMS generation expression:  <expression,!AC>
.explanation	A CMS generation expression on a VDE command is not 
		syntactically correct.
.user_action	Reenter the VDE command with a valid CMS generation 
		expression.

.name	    INVDATTIM
.message	invalid date-time; use DD-MMM-YYYY:HH:MM:SS.CC format: <time,!AS>
.explanation	The format of a date-time value entered as a command
		parameter is invalid.
.user_action	Correct the error in the date-time value and reissue
		the command.

.name	    INVDBFORM
.message	invalid database format; VDE is unable to access library
.explanation	The VDE database does not have the proper format.  The 
		database header record could be read successfully, but 
		that record does not contain the proper sentinel value 
		or its database version value indicates an out-of-date 
		or invalid database format.  This error could indicate 
		that the database has been corrupted in some way or 
		that VDE has generated it incorrectly.
.user_action	Try to connect to the database again using the SET LIBRARY 
		command.  If that does not work, you may have to recreate 
		the library (and thus the database) from scratch with the 
		CREATE LIBRARY command.  If that still does not work, 
		please contact VDE support for assistance.

.name	    INVDIGDEC
.message	invalid decimal number: <number, !AD>
.explanation	A decimal digit is 
		often expected in many contexts such as a parameter.  If 
		the provided input is not a digit, this error message will  
		be generated. 
.user_action	Reissue the command with the appropriate number.

.name	    INVDIRSPEC
.message	invalid directory specification: <text,!AC>
.explanation	A directory specification on a VDE command is not 
		syntactically correct.  This message is also printed 
		if a logical name (such as VDE$LIBRARY) that is supposed 
		to be bound to a directory specification is not bound to 
		a syntactically correct directory specification.
.user_action	Reenter the VDE command with a valid directory specification 
		or define the logical name to be bound to a valid directory 
		specification.

.name	    INVHISCHAR
.message	invalid history or notes character following poundsign<,!/>invalid string is: <string,!AC> 
.explanation	A history or notes string was specified which contains an 
		invalid character after the poundsign character.  Valid 
		characters for a history string are:  H, h, B, or b.  Valid 
		characters for a notes string are:  G or g.  A poundsign 
		character may be included in the string by quoting it with 
		another poundsign character.
.user_action	Reenter the VDE command with a valid history or notes string.

.name	    INVINPUT
.message	invalid interactive command input; command aborted
.explanation	The current command has queried the user for input and has 
		gotten invalid input several times in a row.  This can be 
		caused by specifying insufficient parameter or qualifier 
		information on a command in a command file, which may cause 
		subsequent commands to be read as responses to interactive 
		queries.  Due to the invalid input, the current command is 
		aborted.
.user_action	Reissue the command with correct qualifiers and parameters 
		or with correct input to interactive queries for command 
		information.

.name	    INVINTVAL
.message	invalid integer value on command line: <integer,!SL>
.explanation	The indicated integer value was entered on the current 
		command line but its value is not in the valid range for 
		that kind of value.  For example, if the number of 
		seconds in a delta-time interval is exceeds 59, you will 
		get this error message.
.user_action	Reissue the command with a valid integer value.

.name	    INVPAGE
.message	invalid screen height, value must be between <minimum_height, !UL> and <maximum_height, !UL>
.explanation	For the SET TERMINAL command, the /PAGE qualifier must 
		provide a page length between 11 and 100, inclusively.
.user_action	Reissue the SET TERMINAL command with an acceptable page size.

.name	    INVWIDTH
.message	invalid screen width, value must be between <minimum_width, !UL> and <maximum_width, !UL>
.explanation	For the SET TERMINAL command, the /WIDTH qualifier can
		provide a page length between 40 and 255, inclusively.
.user_action	Reissue the SET TERMINAL command with an acceptable width.

.name	    INVWILDSPEC
.message	invalid wildcard specification in script selector: <selector,!AC>
.explanation	The indicated module name or facility name is wildcarded 
		in a way that is not valid in a module-name or facility 
		specification used to select scripts.  The only form of 
		wildcarding that is allowed in this context is a single 
		asterisk <PARENDCHAR>(*); other, more general forms of 
		wildcarding are not allowed in script selectors.  Also, 
		the components of a full module (such as [FAC]MOD.TYP) 
		may all be wildcarded individually, but only in certain 
		combinations.  Invalid combinations yield this error 
		message.
.user_action	Reissue the command with an acceptable wildcard specification.

.name	    LIBNOTSET
.message	library not set; no VDE database found in directory <directory,!AC>
.explanation	You have attempted to set a VDE library by specifying a 
		directory specification or library mnemonic specification
		on the SET LIBRARY command, but the directory or mnemonic
		either does not exist or does not reference a valid VDE
		library database.  If you are using a mnemonic for the
		library, check to make sure you have entered a valid
		mnemonic, then check to see that the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS*
		logical names all include the appropriate and matching
		numbers of translations.  (If you are uncertain how to
		check 	the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS* logical names, consult
		the VDE user's guide.)
.user_action	Reenter the command with a directory specification that
		specifies a valid root directory for a VDE library, or
		enter a correct mnemonic.  If the directory or mnemonic
		is correct, contact the local system management staff and
		ask that the translations of the VDE$LIBRARY_DEFAULTS*
		logical name(s) be corrected.

.name	    LOGNAMUNDEF
.message	logical name <logical,!AC> undefined; operation cannot complete
.explanation	The current VDE operation requires the indicated logical 
		name to be defined, but it is not defined.  As a result, 
		VDE cannot perform the operation.
.user_action	Exit the VDE kept process with the EXIT/KEPT_PROCESS 
		command, define the required logical name, restart VDE, 
		and retry the operation.

.name	    MAXIDVAL
.message	maximum allowed Id value in database exceeded: <ID,!AC>
.explanation	Each entity in the VDE database, such as each module, each 
		stream, and each build job, has an integer Id value that 
		uniquely identifies it.  This Id value may not assume a 
		value larger than 2,000,000,000, but the operation you have 
		attempted to perform has tried to create an entity with an 
		Id value larger than this maximum.  The indicated name tells 
		which Id value is affected.  This error should never occur 
		unless the database is extremely large.
.user_action	Please contact VDE support for assistance.  Most likely the
		VDE database has been damaged by an internal error.

.name	    MISCONTSCRP
.message	missing continuation line in script
.explanation	The current script specified that the last line should 
		be continued but no such continuation line exists.  A 
		hyphen <PARENDCHAR>(-) at the end of a line indicates 
		that the line should be continued.
.user_action	Either remove the hyphen at the end of the last line or 
		supply a continuation line, whichever is appropriate.

.name	    MISHISPARM
.message	missing history parameter in string "<string,!AC>" 
.explanation	A history string was specified which does not contain 
		a history parameter.  A history parameter is required 
		as part of the history string.
.user_action	Reenter the VDE command with a valid history string.

.name	    MISTYPNAM
.message	missing type name for module <string,!AC>; type name required
.explanation	A module name has been specified without a module type in 
		a context where the module type is required.  For example, 
		the command CREATE MODULE M1 is incorrect because a module 
		type, as in CREATE MODULE M1.FOR (where FOR is the module 
		type), is required for this command.  The type name must 
		be separated from the module name by a dot (.) as shown in 
		the example.

.name	    MODALRQUEREP
.message	module <module,!AC> already queued for replacement <replacement,!AC>
.explanation	You have tried to replace or unreserve a module that already 
		belongs to the indicated queued replacement.  A reservation 
		that already belongs to a queued replacement cannot be 
		unreserved or queued for another replacement; the reservation 
		remains until the original replacement is performed or 
		cancelled.  As a result, your attempt to replace or unreserve 
		the module has failed.
.user_action	If you want to remove the module reservation from its current 
		queued replacement, you must cancel that replacement with the 
		CANCEL REPLACEMENT command.  You can then unreserve the 
		module or replace it as part of another replacement.

.name	    MODALRRES
.message	module <module,!AC> already reserved; reservation has failed
.explanation	You have tried to reserve a module that is already reserved 
		by another user (possibly yourself).  That reservation does
		not allow concurrent reservations, or you have not requested
		a concurrent reservation.  The reservation may be in the
		current default stream, or in an ancestor stream.  As a
		result of this prior reservation, your attempt to 
		reserve the module has failed.
.user_action	Wait until the user who has reserved the module replaces it 
		in the library.  Then reserve it yourself.  You can use the 
		SHOW RESERVATION/FULL command to see who currently has the
		module reserved, and in what stream the module was originally
		reserved.  Alternatively, you can use the /OVERRIDE=CONCURRENT
		qualifier to concurrently reserve the module, or the /QUEUE
                qualifier to queue a request for notification when the
		module becomes available.

.name	    MODLOCKED
.message	module <module,!AC> locked for replacement by another user
.explanation	The module you are trying to replace is currently being 
		replaced by another user who is updating the same generation 
		as you want to update.  As a result, your replacement attempt 
		failed.
.user_action	Wait a minute or two and then try the operation again.  
		If the other user deleted your concurrent reservation 
		through his or her replacement, your second attempt will 
		fail with a message to that effect.  If the other user's 
		replacement failed or did not conflict with yours, your 
		new replacement attempt can succeed.

.name	    MODNOTINSTRM
.message	generation <generation,!AC> not in stream <stream,!AC>
.explanation	This message informs you that an attempt was made to update
		the specified stream with a new generation of the specified  
		module, but the specified module is not part of the specified
		development stream. 
.user_action	Use the /NOPROPAGATE qualifier for the command or populate the 
		specified stream with the specified generation and try the 
		command again.

.name	    MODNOTRES
.message	module <module,!AC> is not currently reserved
.explanation	You are trying to replace the indicated module but that 
		module is not currently reserved in the current stream 
		development stream.
.user_action	Reserve the module before trying to replace it.

.name	    MODNOTREV
.message	module <module,!AC> not found in review list
.explanation	You have specified a module that does not exist in the 
		current review list.  As a result, you cannot select the 
		module with the name you specified.
.user_action	Reenter the SELECT command specifying a module that is 
		present in the review list for the current REVIEW command.  
		Use the DIRECTORY subcommand to determine what modules are 
		present in the list.

.name	    NAMTOOLONG
.message	name is too long: <text,!AC>; maximum length is <number, !SL>
.explanation	A name entered as a command parameter is too long because 
		it exceeds the maximum length indicated in the message.
.user_action	Reissue the command with a shorter name.

.name	    NEEDMOD
.message	module must be specified on command
.explanation	You have failed to specify a module name on a command that 
		requires it.
.user_action	Enter the module name you want on the command.

.name	    NEEDSTEP
.message	build step must be specified on command
.explanation	You have failed to specify a build step on a command that 
		requires it.
.user_action	Enter a module name on the command to select the build step 
		you want.

.name	    NOACCLIB
.message	no access to library allowed for user <username,!AC>
.explanation	You are not authorized to access the VDE library that 
		logical name VDE$LIBRARY points to or that you are 
		trying to establish with a SET LIBRARY command.
.user_action	Correct the definition of logical name VDE$LIBRARY, 
		specify the name of a library you are authorized to 
		access on the SET LIBRARY command, or request that 
		the administrator for the desired VDE library give 
		you the right to access that library.

.name	    NOARCHSPEC
.message	no architecture specified for operation
.explanation	You have entered a command that requires a default 
		architecture to exist, but you have not established a 
		default architecture.  Usually, this means that the 
		command you have entered contains a module name with an 
		omitted architecture name and the architecture cannot be 
		defaulted.  As a result, the module cannot be looked up 
		in any architecture.
.user_action	Either establish a default archtecture with the SET 
		ARCHITECTURE command and reenter the command, or reenter 
		the command with an explicitly specified architecture 
		name, as in ARCHNAM:[FACNAM]MOD.TYP.

.name	    NOATTACH
.message	failed to attach to process PID !XL
.explanation	The ATTACH command has failed to attach to the requested 
		process. 
.user_action	Verify that the requested process exists.  Check spelling 
		of the process name. 

.name	    NOBLDSTEPS
.message	build job contains no build steps; build job is not created
.explanation	You tried to create a build job with the BUILD command, 
		but the build job turns out to contain no build steps.  
		As a result, the build job is not created in the database.  
		The usual cause of this error is that you specified a 
		minimal build of modules that are already up-to-date with 
		respect to their source modules.
.user_action	If you intended to perform a minimal build, the build job 
		is unnecessary.  If you intended to perform a full build, 
		specify the /FULL qualifier on the BUILD command.

.name	    NOCANRES
.message	cannot cancel reservation to create first generation of <module,!AC>
.explanation	You have entered an UNRESERVE command to cancel the 
		reservation that will create the initial generation of the 
		indicated module.  The reservation was created by a CREATE 
		MODULE command and VDE does not allow you to cancel such a 
		reservation.
.user_action	If you no longer want the reservation that will create the 
		first generation of the module, you must delete the module 
		with the DELETE MODULE command.  If you just want to change 
		the attributes of the reservation, you must do so with the 
		MODIFY RESERVATION command.

.name	    ARCHNOTDEL
.message	architecture <architecture,!AC> not deleted
.explanation	You are attempting to delete an architecture that
		cannot be deleted.  Additional messages are normally
		included with this message, and these messages
		indicate why the architecture cannot be deleted.
.user_action	Resolve the problem(s) flagged by the other error
		messages, and reenter the DELETE ARCHITECTURE command.

.name	    FACNOTDEL
.message	facility <facility,!AC> not deleted
.explanation	You are attempting to delete a facility that
		cannot be deleted.  Additional messages are normally
		included with this message, and these messages
		indicate why the facility cannot be deleted.
.user_action	Resolve the problem(s) flagged by the other error
		messages, and reenter the DELETE FACILITY command.

.name	    FACNOTMT
.message	facility contains modules
.explanation	The specified facility contains modules.
.user_action	The requested operation is prohibited due to the presence
		of modules in the facility.

.name	    MODNOTDEL
.message	module <module,!AC> not deleted
.explanation	You are attempting to delete a module that
		cannot be deleted.  Additional messages are normally
		included with this message, and these messages
		indicate why the module cannot be deleted.
.user_action	Resolve the problem(s) flagged by the other error
		messages, and reenter the DELETE MODULE command.

.destination message
.name	    SPARE_4
.message	was STRMNOTDEL
.explanation	message superceded (was STRMNOTDEL)
.user_action	Contact VDE support for assistance
.destination both

.name	    NODELTAROOT
.message	no delta-file root directory exists for library
.explanation	You have tried to create a directory tree for a specific 
		facility's delta files, but no delta-file root directory 
		exists for the library.  Hence VDE cannot create any disk 
		directories for the indicated facility.
.user_action	Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE/DELTA_FILES command to create 
		a directory tree for the library's delta files.  That will 
		automatically create the delta-file root directory for the 
		library and the delta-file subdirectories for all facilities.

.name	    NODIRDELTA
.message	no delta-file directory found for facility <facility,!AC>
.explanation	VDE tried to access the delta-file directory for the 
		indicated facility, but no such directory is recorded 
		in the database.  This normally means that you have 
		not yet created the disk directories for the facility.
.user_action	To create the facility's delta-file directory, use the 
		CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command with the /DELTA_FILES and 
		possibly /FACILITY qualifiers.  Use the SHOW LOCATION 
		command to see what disk directories are recorded in 
		the VDE database.

.name	    NODIRMARKER
.message	no marker-file directory found for facility <facility,!AC>
.explanation	VDE tried to access the marker-file directory for the 
		indicated facility, but no such directory is recorded 
		in the database.  This normally means that you have 
		failed to create a delta-file subdirectory with directory 
		symbol VDE$MARKER for the indicated facility.  Such a 
		directory must exist for you to create modules that use 
		marker files.
.user_action	To create the needed subdirectory, use the SET DIRECTORY 
		command with the /DELTA_FILES and /SYMBOL=VDE$MARKER 
		qualifiers.  Then create the facility's delta-file 
		directory tree with the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command, 
		using the /DELTA_FILES and possibly /FACILITY qualifiers.  
		Use the SHOW LOCATION command to see what disk directories 
		are recorded in the VDE database.

.name	    NOFACSPEC
.message	no facility specified for operation
.explanation	You have entered a command that requires a default facility 
		to exist, but you have not established a default facility.  
		Usually, this means that the command you have entered 
		contains a module name with an omitted facility name and 
		the facility cannot be defaulted.  As a result, the module 
		cannot be looked up in any facility.
.user_action	Either establish a default facility with the SET FACILITY 
		command and reenter the command, or reenter the command 
		with an explicitly specified facility name, as in 
		[FACNAM]MOD.TYP.

.name	    NOFREE
.message	no free storage available
.explanation	VDE has run out of virtual memory.
.user_action	Use less complex commands, raise the virtual-address quota, 
		or submit a problem report.

.name	    NOGENSTRM
.message	generation <generation,!AC> not found in stream <stream,!AC>
.explanation	The indicated module generation was entered on a command, 
		but no such generation was found in the specified stream.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated generation does not exist in the 
		specified stream.  First, verify that you have either specified 
		the correct stream on the command or that your context is set 
		to the correct stream.  If the stream name was correct and 
		you had expected such a generation of a module to exist in 
		that stream, you may use the SHOW GENERATION/STREAM=stream-name
		command to see what module generations are found in that stream.

.name	    NOLIBDEF
.message	no VDE library defined
.explanation	VDE is unable to perform the specified operation as
		the target VDE library -- the library on which the
		operation will be performed -- has not been established.
.user_action	Specify the target VDE library.  To determine the
		available libraries, issue the "SET LIBRARY" command
		with no parameters.  As part of the error message, this
		command will display the names of the predefined VDE
		libraries, the Rdb root directory for each, and the
		mnemonic name for each.  Once the mnemnonic name or the
		Rdb root directory name for the target library is known,
		one can: A) use the mnemnonic name or the Rdb root directory
		name as the libname parameter on a "SET LIBRARY libname"
		VDE command.  B) Use use the mnemnonic name or the Rdb root
		directory name as the parameter on the VDE /LIBRARY=libname.
		C) Define the logical name VDE$LIBRARY to translate to
		the VDE mnemnonic name or to the Rdb root directory name.

.name	    NOMEMGRP
.message	no members specified for group <group,!AC>
.explanation	You have tried to create a group without specifying 
		any members for that group.  A group must have at 
		least one member.  (The members of a group are the 
		modules to be built when the group name is specified 
		on a GROUP command.)
.user_action	Reenter the CREATE GROUP command, specifying the 
		names of the modules that you want to be the members 
		of the new group.

.name	    NOMOREMOD
.message	no more modules in review list
.explanation	You have attempted to review the next module in the 
		current review list, but there are no more such modules.  
		You also get this message if you attempt to review the 
		previous module when you are positioned at the first 
		module in the list.
.user_action	Review build steps in the other direction or exit from 
		the REVIEW REPLACEMENT subsystem.

.name	    NOMORESTEP
.message	no more build steps in review list
.explanation	You have attempted to review the next build step in the 
		current review list, but there are no more such steps.  
		You also get this message if you attempt to review the 
		previous build step when you are positioned at the first 
		step in the list.
.user_action	Review build steps in the other direction or exit from 
		the REVIEW BUILD_JOB subsystem.

.name	    NOPARSTRM
.message	no parent stream specified for new stream
.explanation	You are creating a new development stream, but you did not 
		specify the parent of the new stream.  You must specify the 
		parent stream by using the /PARENT qualifier with the CREATE 
		STREAM command or by establishing a default stream for the 
		VDE session with the SET STREAM command before entering the 
		CREATE STREAM command.
.user_action	Establish a default stream with SET STREAM and reenter the 
		CREATE STREAM command or specify the /PARENT qualifier with 
		the CREATE STREAM command.

.name	    NOPRIVQUAL
.message	insufficient privilege to use <qualifer,!AC> qualifier
.explanation	You attempted to use a command qualifier that requires a 
		privilege, and you did not have that privilege set.
.user_action	If you are authorized to use the qualifier, use the 
		SET PRIVILEGES command to give yourself the necessary 
		privilege.  Then try the original operation again.  If 
		you are not authorized to use the qualifier, you should 
		either request the necessary privilege from your project 
		administrator or you should not use the qualifier.

.name	    NOPRIVS
.message	insufficient VDE privilege(s) for attempted operation
.explanation	You attempted to use a command or qualifier that
		requires one or more VDE privileges, and you did not
		have sufficient privileges enabled.  This message is
		normally displayed in conjunction with other error
		messages, usually a no-privilege error.
.user_action	If you are authorized to use the privilege, use the 
		VDE SET PRIVILEGES command to give yourself the necessary 
		privilege.  Then try the original operation again.  If 
		you are not authorized to use the qualifier, you should 
		either request the necessary privilege from your project 
		administrator or you should not use the qualifier.

.name	    NOSCRIPTYP
.message	no script type specified on command
.explanation	The current SCRIPT command (such as CREATE SCRIPT) does not 
		include any qualifier to specify the type of script that the 
		command should apply to.  As a result, the command cannot be 
		performed.
.user_action	Reenter the command with a qualifier to specify the script 
		type of the script.

.name	    NOSTRMSPEC
.message	no stream specified for operation
.explanation	The command you have entered requires that you specify 
		the name of a development stream, either with the /STREAM 
		qualifier or as a command parameter, but the stream name 
		is missing on the entered command.
.user_action	Renter the command, specifying the stream name as required.

.name	    NOSUCHARCH
.message	architecture <architecture,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated architecture name was entered on a command, 
		but no such architecture was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated architecture does not exist in the 
		database.  However, if you had expected such an architecture 
		to exist, you may use the SHOW ARCHITECTURE command to see 
		what architectures are found in the database.  If the 
		desired architecture is not there, ask your project 
		administator to add it to the database.  Then reenter your 
		command with a valid architecture name.

.name	    NOSUCHCTX
.message	context <context,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated context name was entered on a command, but 
		no such context was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated context does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a context to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW CONTEXT command to see what contexts are found 
		in the database.

.name	    NOSUCHDIRSYM
.message	directory symbol <symbol,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated directory symbol was referenced by a script 
		but no such directory symbol was found in the VDE database.
		VDE tried to use the directory symbol either to look up the 
		directory location for the script's DCL command file or to 
		evaluate a script function such as $DIR or $STRMDIR.  The 
		most likely reason for the error is that you used a script 
		function that takes a directory symbol as a parameter, and 
		you misspelled the symbol name or specified a symbol you 
		have not yet defined.  Directory symbols are defined with 
		the /SYMBOL qualifier of the SET DIRECTORY command.
.user_action	Correct the script function call to have a correct directory 
		symbol that is already defined.  Then reenter the script in 
		the database with the CREATE SCRIPT command and reenter the 
		command that got the error message.

.name	    NOSUCHFAC
.message	facility <facility,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated facility name was entered on a command, but 
		no such facility was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated facility does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a facility to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW FACILITY command to see what facilities are 
		found in the database.  If the desired facility is not there, 
		ask your project administator to add it to the database.  
		Then reenter your command with a valid facility name.

.name	    NOSUCHFOLD
.message	fold record <record,!AC> not found for module <module,!AC> and stream <stream,!AC>
.explanation	You have tried to reference a fold record with the indicated 
		fold identifier for the indicated module and stream, but 
		there is no such fold record in the VDE database.  As a 
		result, VDE has aborted the current command and rolled 
		back the current transaction.
.user_action	Specify a valid fold record and reenter the command.

.name	    NOSUCHFUNC
.message	no such script function exists: <function,!AC>
.explanation	The indicated script function was specified in a VDE 
		script, but no such function exists.  The most likely 
		cause for this error is that you misspelled the function 
		name.  VDE recognizes a script function by the fact that 
		all script function names begin with a dollar sign.  
		Directory symbol names, which can appear in the same 
		places as functions in scripts, should not begin with 
		dollar signs.
.user_action	Correct the spelling of the function name or select a 
		directory symbol name that does not begin with a dollar 
		sign.

.name	    NOSUCHGEN
.message	generation <generation,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated module generation was entered on a command, 
		but no such generation was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated generation does not exist in the 
		database.  However, if you had expected such a generation 
		of a module to exist, you may use the SHOW GENERATION 
		command to see what module generations are found in the 
		database.

.name	    NOSUCHGRP
.message	group <group,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated group name was entered on a command, but 
		no such group was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated group does not exist in the 
		database. However, if you had expected such a group 
		to exist, you may use the SHOW GROUP command to see 
		what groups are found in the database.  If the desired 
		group is not there, use the CREATE GROUP command 
		to add it to the database.  Then reenter your command with 
		a valid group name.

.name	    NOSUCHMOD
.message	module <module,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated module name was entered on a command, but 
		no such module was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated module does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a module to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW MODULE command to see what modules are found 
		in the database.  If the desired module is not there, you 
		can use the CREATE MODULE command to add it to the database.  
		Then reenter your command with a valid module name.

.name	    NOSUCHPRIV
.message	no such privilege name exists: <priv-name, !AC>
.explanation	An invalid privilege name was specified on a VDE command.
.user_action	Check the spelling of the privilege name and reenter the 
		command with a correct privilege name.

.name	    NOSUCHREP
.message	replacement <replacement,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated replacement name was entered on a command, but 
		no such replacement was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated replacemen does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a replacemen to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW REPLACMENT command to see what replacements are 
		found in the database.  If the desired replacement is not there, 
		ask your project administator to add it to the database.  
		Then reenter your command with a valid replacement name.

.name	    NOSUCHRES
.message	reservation <reservation,!AC> for module <module,!AC> not found
.explanation	You have specified a reservation identifier for a module 
		reservation, but no reservation with that identifier exists.  
		Hence the current command has not been performed for that 
		reservation.
.user_action	Specify the correct reservation identifier and reissue the 
		command.

.name	    NOSUCHSCRP
.message	script <script,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated script was specified on a command, but no such 
		script is found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated script does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a script to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW SCRIPT command to see what scripts are present 
		in the database.

.name	    NOSUCHSES
.message	session <session,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated session name was entered on a command, but 
		no such session was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated session does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a session to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW SESSION command to see what session are 
		found in the database.  If the desired session is not there, 
		ask your project administator to add it to the database.  
		Then reenter your command with a valid session name.

.name	    NOSUCHUSER
.message	user <user,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated username was entered on a command, but no 
		such user was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated user does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a user to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW USER * command to see what usernames are found 
		in the database.  If the desired user is not there, ask 
		your project administator to add that user to the database.  
		Then reenter your command with a valid username.

.name	    NOSUCHSTRM
.message	stream <stream,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	The indicated stream name was entered on a command, but 
		no such stream was found in the VDE database.
.user_action	This is not necessarily an error; the message simply tells 
		you that the indicated stream does not exist in the database. 
		However, if you had expected such a stream to exist, you may 
		use the SHOW STREAM * command to see what streams are 
		found in the database.  If the desired stream is not there, 
		ask your project administator to add it to the database.  
		Then reenter your command with a valid stream name.

.name	    NOSPAWN
.message	spawn command failed
.explanation	A process cannot be spawned by VDE.
.user_action	Check your process's quotas.

.name	    NOSTAGROOT
.message	no staging area root directory exists for library
.explanation	You have tried to create queued replacement for some module, 
		but no staging area root directory exists for the library.  
		Hence VDE cannot create a disk directory for saving (or 
		<QUOTE>(staging)) the files to be replaced.
.user_action	Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE/STAGING command to create 
		the root directory for the library's staging areas.  Then 
		reenter the REPLACE command.  Alternatively, replace the 
		module with an immediate (as opposed to queued) replacement.  
		An immediate replacement does not use a staging area.

.name	    NOSTRMROOT
.message	no stream root directory exists for stream <stream,!AC>
.explanation	You have tried to create a directory tree for a specific 
		facility within the current stream, but no root directory 
		exists for the stream.  Hence VDE cannot create any disk 
		directories for the indicated facility.
.user_action	Use the CREATE DIRECTORY_TREE command to create a 
		directory tree for the current stream.  That will 
		automatically create both the stream root directory 
		and the subdirectories for all facilities.

.name	    NOTREVREP
.message	you are not a reviewer for replacement <replacement,!AC>
.explanation	You are trying to mark a replacement as accepted or 
		rejected, but you are not a reviewer for the replacement.  
		As a result, your attempt to mark the replacement as 
		accepted or rejected has failed.
.user_action	Specify the name of a replacement for which you are a 
		reviewer or have yourself added as a reviewer by someone 
		authorized to add you.

.name	    NOTCONNLIB
.message	you are not connected to a VDE library; command not performed
.explanation	You are trying to perform a command that requires you to 
		be connected to an existing VDE library, but you are not 
		connected to such a library.  This normally means that you 
		have not defined logical name VDE$LIBRARY to point to the 
		root directory of a properly formed VDE library that you 
		are authorized to use.  This problem can also occur after 
		you have encountered an error when trying to set or create 
		a new library; you are then disconnected from the formerly 
		set library without successfully connecting to the new one, 
		leaving you unconnected to any library.
.user_action	Define logical name VDE$LIBRARY to point to the root 
		directory for the VDE library you wish to access.  Then 
		try the command again.

.name	    NOTRESINSTRM
.message	module <module,!AC> not reserved in stream <stream,!AC>
.explanation	You are trying to unreserve or replace a module in the 
		indicated stream, but the module is not reserved in that 
		stream.
.user_action	Use the SHOW RESERVATION/FULL command to see what stream the 
		reservation was made in.  Then use the SET STREAM command 
		to set the current stream to the appropriate stream and
		re-enter the command, or (when available) you can append
		the /STREAM qualifier on the failing command and reissue
		the command.  If you are performing a REPLACEMENT, a
		replacement performed in the ancestor stream propogated
		forward into any and successors of the target stream.

.name	    NULSTRNOT
.message	a null string is not allowed 
.explanation	This qualifier requires that a string with a minimum length
		of 1 character be provided if any string is specified at all.
		The null string is not allowed.
.user_action	Reenter the command providing a string with this qualifier,
		or no value at all.

.name	    PREFIXNOTALL
.message	prefix VDE$ not allowed in facility or stream names
.explanation	You have tried to create or rename a facility or stream 
		with a name that begins with the prefix <QUOTE>(VDE$) 
		but VDE does not allow facilities or streams to have 
		such names.  VDE uses facility and stream names as disk 
		directory names, but VDE also creates directories reserved 
		for its own use whose names always begin with the VDE$ 
		prefix.  To prevent name conflicts between facility or 
		stream directories and these reserved directories, VDE 
		does not allow facility or stream names to begin with 
		the VDE$ prefix.
.user_action	Reenter the command with a facility or stream name that 
		does not begin with VDE$.

.name	    QUALDISALL
.message	qualifier <qualifier,!AC> is disallowed for the <command,!AC> command
.explanation	You have specified a command qualifier that is not 
		allowed with the specified command.  Because the 
		qualifier is not allowed, the command is not executed.  
		In certain cases, the qualifier is disallowed by your 
		VDE library due to a library attribute, and the 
		qualifier would be allowed if the library attribute 
		that disallows it were changed.
.user_action	Reenter the command without the offending qualifier or 
		change the library attribute that disallows it, if 
		applicable.

.name	    QUALNOTALL
.message	qualifier <qualifier,!AC> is not allowed when a parameter is specified
.explanation	You have specified both the indicated qualifier and a command 
		parameter on a command that does not allow both to be 
		specified.  The command is not executed for this reason.
.user_action	Reenter the command with either the indicated qualifier or 
		with command parameters, but not both.

.name	    QUALTOOMANY
.message	qualifier <qualifier,!AC> has been specified too many times
.explanation	You have specified the indicated qualifier too many times for 
		a parameter on this command line.  The command is not executed 
		for this reason.
.user_action	Reenter the command with the indicated qualifier specified no 
		more than once for each parameter.

.name	    REPBELUSER
.message	replacement <replacement,!AC> belongs to another user
.explanation	You are attempting to modify or cancel a queued replacement 
		that belongs to another user, and you do not have the 
		PERFREP privilege that would allow you to cancel or modify 
		another user's replacements.  As a result, the replacement 
		is not cancelled or modified.
.user_action	Reenter the command specifying your own queued replacement 
		to cancel or modify, or else have someone with the necessary 
		privilege perform the operation.

.name	    RESIDREQ
.message	reservation identifier required for module <module,!AC>
.explanation	You have multiple reservations for the indicated module.  
		You must therefore specify a reservation identifier with 
		the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier to uniquely indicate to which 
		reservation you want the command to apply.
.user_action	Reissue the command with the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier to 
		indicate the specific reservation to which you want the 
		command to apply.

.name	    RESIDUSED
.message	reservation Id <ID,!AC> already used for module <module,!AC><,!/>      attempt to reserve module has failed
.explanation	You are trying to reserve a module concurrently using the 
		same reservation identification as you have used on a previous 
		reservation of the same module in the same stream 
		development stream.  This is not allowed, since reservation 
		identifications must be unique.
.user_action	Reissue the RESERVE command with a different reservation 
		identification specified on the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier.  
		Alternatively, you can omit the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, 
		in which case VDE will assign a unique identification for you.

.name	    RIGIDNOTFOU
.message	required rights identifier <ID,!AC> not found in rights database
.explanation	You have not yet been added to the VDE database, and to 
		be added you must hold the indicated VMS rights identifier.  
		However, that rights identifier is not present in the 
		system rights database.  As a result, you are not allowed 
		access to the VDE library.
.user_action	Have your system manager add the rights identifier to the 
		system rights database and assign it to the users who 
		should have access to the VDE library, or have the VDE 
		library maintainer use the MODIFY LIBRARY command specify 
		the correct rights identifier in the VDE database.

.name	    RIGIDNOTHELD
.message	you do not hold required rights identifier <ID,!AC>
.explanation	You have not yet been added to the VDE database, and to 
		be added you must hold the indicated VMS rights identifier.  
		However, you do not hold that rights identifier in the 
		system rights database.  As a result, you are not allowed 
		access to the VDE library.
.user_action	If you should have access to the VDE library, have your 
		system manager assign you the indicated rights identifier.  
		Then try accessing the VDE library again.

.name	    SCRPCMDTOOLONG
.message	script command is too long; it exceeds <count,!SL> characters
.explanation	You have entered a script command that is too long for 
		VDE's internal script command buffer.  The message 
		indicates the maximum size of this buffer.  The total 
		length of the script command includes the initial line 
		for the command and all continuation lines.
.user_action	Change the script command so that it is not so long.

.name	    SCRPFACFAIL
.message	script for facility <facility,!AC> terminated with errors
.explanation	The script for the indicated facility terminated with 
		errors when executed for the current command.  The type 
		of the script depends on the command.  For the CREATE 
		STREAM command, for example, the new-stream script 
		is invoked to perform part of the stream creation.
.user_action	Correct the error in the script and reenter the command.

.name	    SCRPFUNCUNDEF
.message	script function <function,!AC> is undefined in the current script
.explanation	The indicated script function is used in the currently 
		executing script, but is undefined for this type of 
		script.  This means that the function is not allowed 
		to be used in this type of script.  The module-name 
		functions, for example, are undefined in scripts invoked 
		at stream creation because these scripts are not applied 
		to individual modules.
.user_action	Do not use the indicated function in the script.

.name	    SCRPMODFAIL
.message	<script,!AC> script for module <module,!AC> terminated with errors
.explanation	The script for the indicated module terminated with 
		errors when executed for the current command.  The 
		type of the script is specified in the message.
.user_action	Correct the error in the script and reenter the command.

.name	    SESBELUSER
.message	session <session,!AC> belongs to another user
.explanation	You are attempting to modify or cancel a reservation session 
		that belongs to another user, and you do not have the 
		PERFREP privilege that would allow you to cancel or modify 
		another user's session.  As a result, the session is not 
		cancelled or modified.
.user_action	Reenter the command specifying your own reservation session 
		to cancel or modify, or else have someone with the necessary 
		privilege perform the operation.

.name	    SETUNAUTH
.message	attempt to set unauthorized privileges; privileges not set
.explanation	You have attempted to use the SET PRIVILEGES command to 
		grant yourself one or more privileges that you are not 
		authorized to set according to the VDE database.
.user_action	Use the SHOW PRIVILEGES/FULL command to see what privileges 
		you are authorized to set.  Then reenter the SET PRIVILEGES 
		command to set only authorized privileges.  Alternatively, 
		ask the project administrator to grant you authorization to 
		set the privileges you want.  Then exit from VDE, start a 
		new VDE session, and set the privileges you want.

.name	    SNDJBCERR
.message	job controller error status for queue <queue,!AC>
.explanation	You have attempted to start a build job and the VMS job 
		controller (the $SNDJBCW system service) returned an error 
		status when VDE submitted a build process to a system batch 
		queue.  The message that follows gives more information to 
		explain the error.
.user_action	The action to take to correct the error depends on the 
		nature of the error.  You or your system manager should 
		correct the error and restart the build job.

.name	    SRCNOTOUT
.message	source module <module,!AC> cannot be an output from build step
.explanation	You have specified that a source module is an output from 
		a build step.  A source module can be an input to a build 
		step, but it can by definition not be an output.  The 
		build step definition is not added to the database.
.user_action	If this error occurs on a CREATE STEP or MODIFY STEP 
		command, correct the error and reenter the command with 
		valid output modules.

.name	    STATNOTSPEC
.message	the kind of statistics to display was not specified
.explanation	This qualifier requires a keyword specifying what kind of 
		statistics to display.
.user_action	Reenter the command providing a keyword specifying what kind 
		of statistics to display.

.name	    STEPNOTCRE
.message	build step not created; module <module,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	You have specified a module that does not exist in the 
		VDE database as the primary input to a compile step.  As a 
		result, the CREATE STEP command does not add the compile 
		step or its dependency information to the database.
.user_action	Correct the module name to be the name of an existing 
		module or create the module with the CREATE MODULE command 
		before reentering the CREATE STEP command.

.name	    STEPNOTFOUND
.message	build step for module <module,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	You have specified a build step that does not exist in the 
		VDE database.  As a result, the current MODIFY STEP command 
		cannot modify any information in the database.
.user_action	Reenter the command specifying an existing build step or 
		create the desired build step with the CREATE STEP command.

.name	    STEPNOTMOD
.message	build step not modified; module <module,!AC> not found in database
.explanation	You have specified a module that does not exist in the 
		VDE database as the primary input or output module for a 
		build step.  As a result, the MODIFY STEP command cannot 
		modify database information.
.user_action	Correct the module name to be the name of an existing 
		module before reentering the MODIFY STEP command, or 
		create the module with the CREATE MODULE command and 
		enter the step information with the CREATE STEP command.

.name	    STEPNOTREV
.message	build step for module <module,!AC> not found in review list
.explanation	You have specified a build step that does not exist in the 
		current build-step review list.  As a result, you cannot 
		select the build step with the module name you specified.
.user_action	Reenter the SELECT command specifying a build step that 
		is present in the build-step review list for the current 
		REVIEW BUILD_JOB command.  Use the DIRECTORY subcommand 
		to determine what build steps are present in the list.

.name	    STKOVF
.message	command procedures too deeply nested; limit is 16 levels
.explanation	VDE allows only 16 levels of nesting of command 
		procedures. 
.user_action	Embed some of the command procedures within others to decrease
		the level of nesting to fewer than 16. 

.name	    STRMEXISTS
.message	stream <stream,!AC> already exists in database
.explanation	The indicated stream name was specified on a CREATE 
		STREAM command, but an entry for that stream is already 
		present in the database.  Hence a new entry was not created 
		for that stream.  Alternatively, the indicated name was 
		specified as the new name for an existing stream on the 
		MODIFY STREAM command, but another stream already has 
		the requested new name.  Hence the name of the existing 
		stream could not be changed to the new name.
.user_action	If you entered the wrong stream name, reenter the command 
		with the correct name.  If you entered the right stream 
		name, use the SHOW STREAM command to display the database 
		information for that stream.  If you are not satisfied 
		with that information, use the MODIFY STREAM command to 
		change it.

.name	    STRMNOTCLOSED
.message	stream <stream,!AC> can not be deleted because it is not closed
.explanation	You are trying to delete a stream which is in an open or 
		frozen state.  Only streams in a closed state may be deleted.  
.user_action	If appropriate, change the state of the stream to closed 
		and repeat the delete stream command.

.name	    STRMNOTOPEN
.message	stream <stream,!AC> is not open; operation not allowed
.explanation	You are trying to reserve or replace a module, but the 
		currently active stream (whose name is given in the 
		message) is either frozen or closed.  It is thus not open 
		for the reservation or replacement of modules.
.user_action	You can use the SHOW STREAM/FULL command to see the status 
		of the current stream.  If the stream is closed, it is 
		permanently protected against being changed, and you should 
		not be trying to reserve or replace modules in it.  If the 
		stream is frozen, it is currently protected against being 
		changed, but changes may be allowed later when the library 
		administrator sets the state back to open.  You must then 
		wait until the stream becomes open.  (You may reserve 
		modules from a frozen stream, but not replace them.)  
		Finally, if you meant to reserve or replace modules in 
		another stream, you should use the SET STREAM command 
		to switch your context to that stream and then reserve 
		or replace the desired modules.

.name	    STRMNOTPOP
.message	stream <stream,!AC> is not allowed to be populated
.explanation	You are attempting to populate the indicated stream with 
		the POPULATE STREAM command but a stream attribute disallows 
		use of this command for the stream.   Hence the stream has 
		not been populated.
.user_action	Either you should not be trying to populate the stream or 
		else you must set the stream attribute that allows you to 
		populate the stream before retrying the operation.  To set 
		that attribute, use the /POPULATE qualifier to the MODIFY 
		STREAM command.

.name	    SUCGENEXIST
.message	successor generation for <module,!AC> already exists in library
.explanation	The new generation of the indicated module created by the 
		current REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACEMENT command should get 
		a whole-number CMS generation expression but the reserved 
		generation already has a successor generation in the VDE 
		library with that whole-number CMS generation expression.  
		This situation can arise if you have placed the reserved 
		generation into a stream using the INSERT GENERATION 
		command or if you have changed the stream that <QUOTE>(owns) 
		the whole-number successor generation with the /MAIN_STREAM 
		qualifier to the MODIFY GENERATION command.
.user_action	If the existing whole-number successor generation should 
		not be in the VDE library, delete it and its successors 
		with the DELETE GENERATION command.  Then repeat the failed 
		replacement.  Otherwise, use the /MAIN_STREAM qualifier to 
		the MODIFY GENERATION command to allocate ownership of the 
		whole-number successor generation to the stream that already 
		owns that generation, but not to any stream into which you 
		are trying to replace the module.  This will force the 
		replacement to use a CMS variant letter.  Then repeat the 
		replacement.

.name	    TRANTOODEEP
.message	translation of logical name <logical,!AC> more than 7 deep
.explanation	The indicated logical name is either too deeply nested, 
		or is defined incorrectly to point back to itself causing 
		an infinite translation loop.
.user_action	Reenter the command without using the logical name.

.name	    TOOMANPARM
.message	too many poundsign parameters in history or notes string<,!/>invalid string is: <string,!AC> 
.explanation	The history or notes string specified contains more than 
		one history or notes parameter.  This is not allowed.
.user_action	Reenter the command with a valid history or notes string.

.name	    UNACLOFIL
.message	unable to close file <file-name, !AD>
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to close the indicated text 
		file.  A more specific error message follows this message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    UNACLOLOG
.message	unable to close log file <file-name, !AF> 
.explanation	The SYS$CLOSE system service was not performed successfully 
		in closing the log file. 
.user_action	Determine what could be preventing RMS from closing the file 
		successfully.  If the reason cannot be determined, 
		please contact VDE support for assistance.

.name	    UNACONLOG
.message	unable to connect log file <file-name, !AF>
.explanation	The SYS$CONNECT system service was not performed successfully 
		in connecting the log file's RAB and FAB. 
.user_action	Determine what could be preventing RMS from connecting the
		file's FAB and RAB successfully.  If this cannot be done, 
		please contact VDE support for assistance.

.name	    UNACONVDBFORM
.message	unable to convert database format due to access conflict with another user
.explanation	The VDE database does not have the format required by the 
		current version of VDE and VDE has attempted to convert 
		the database to the required format.  This operation has 
		failed because of an access conflict with another user 
		attempting to convert the database at the same time.  That 
		other user has probably succeeded in converting the database 
		format, which is why you cannot do so.
.user_action	Retry the CONVERT LIBRARY command and try accessing the 
		database again.  You should find that you are now able to 
		convert the database format or that the format has already 
		been converted.  Either way, you should be able to use VDE 
		with that database.

.name	    UNACREFIL
.message	unable to create file <file-name, !AD>
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to create or open a new 
		text file.  A more specific error message follows this 
		message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    UNACRELOG
.message	unable to create log file <file-name, !AF>
.explanation	The SYS$CREATE system service was not performed successfully 
		in creating the output file. 
.user_action	Determine what could be preventing RMS from creating the file 
		successfully.  If the reason cannot be determined, 
		please contact VDE support for assistance.

.name	    UNACREMBX
.message	unable to create temporary mailbox
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to create a mailbox for 
		sending text between processes.  A more specific error 
		message follows this message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    UNADELFIL
.message	unable to delete file <file-name,!AC>
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to delete the indicated file.  
		A more specific error message follows this message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    UNAOPEFIL
.message	unable to open file <file-name, !AD>
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to open an existing text 
		file for reading.  A more specific error message follows 
		this message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    UNAPARFIL
.message	unable to parse file name <name,!AC> with default string <name,!AC>
.explanation	An error occurred when trying to parse the indicated file 
		specification with the indicated default name string.  A 
		more specific error message follows this message.
.user_action	Examine the error message that follows to diagnose the 
		reason for the error.  Then correct the problem accordingly.

.name	    UNKFILEXT
.message	Unknown file extension in analysis file; the complete file<,!/>specification found was <spec,!AS>
.explanation	The program VDEDEPEND encountered a file specification 
		that has a file extension it does not support.  This error 
		occurred while VDEDEPEND was processing an analysis (.ANA) 
		file recording compiler or assembler dependency information.
.user_action	Determine if the analysis file is corrupted.  If the 
		analysis file is not corrupted and the file extension 
		corresponds to a file type that should be recorded as 
		dependency information,	please contact VDE support for assistance.

.name	    USERNOTUAF
.message	user <user,!AC> not found in system User Authorization File
.explanation	The indicated username is your username, but it was 
		not found in the system User Authorization File.
.user_action	This error should not happen except to VDE developers 
		who redefine the current user during testing.  Submit 
		a problem report.

.name	    WILDGENNUM
.message	wildcarded generation number not allowed in <module,!AC>
.explanation	You have specified a wildcarded generation number on 
		a module name for a command which does not allow the 
		generation number to be wildcarded.
.user_action	Decide what generation of the module you want to apply 
		the command to.  Then reissue the command, specifying 
		that generation number.  Alternatively, you may omit 
		the generation number, in which case the command is 
		applied to the last (most recent) generation of the 
		module.

.name	    WILDNOTALL
.message	wildcard characters not allowed in name: <name,!AD>
.explanation	You have specified a wildcard character (asterisk or 
		percent sign) in a name that is not allowed to have 
		wildcard characters.  The message displays the name 
		up to and including the wildcard character.
.user_action	Specify the name without a wildcard character and 
		resubmit the command.

.name	    INCNOTVAL
.message	INPUT not valid on streams marked for queued replacement
.explanation	The specified or default stream is marked for queued
		replacements, and the CREATE MODULE /INPUT command
		cannot be processed as it attempts to directly create
		the module(s) without regard to the review and replacement
		policy associated with the stream.
.user_action	Perform a CREATE MODULE sans the /INPUT qualifier,
		and then use a REPLACE command.  [This restriction may
		be relaxed in a future release of VDE.]

.name	    CREDIRFAI
.message	create directory failed
.explanation	A directory specification on a VDE command is not 
		syntactically correct.  This message is also printed 
		if a logical name (such as VDE$LIBRARY) that is supposed 
		to be bound to a directory specification is not bound to 
		a syntactically correct directory specification.
.user_action	Reenter the VDE command with a valid directory specification 
		or define the logical name to be bound to a valid directory 
		specification.

.name	    NOSCRATCH

.name	    INVDATLNM
.message	invalid VDE$DATE_TIME; use DD-MMM-YYYY:HH:MM:SS.CC format: <time,!AS>
.explanation	The format of a date-time value entered as a logical
		name is invalid.  This message should appear only during
		VDE testing, and is only displayed by debug versions of
		VDE, and the logical name is only translated by debug
		versions.
.user_action	Contact VDE support for assistance, as the version of
		VDE in use contains debug-only images.  If the logical
		name is being specified, correct the error in the
		date-time logical name value and reissue the command.

.name	    LOCKED
.message	library write access is disabled
.explanation	This message is displayed when an attempt is made
		to write -- RESERVE, REPLACE or PERFORM REPLACE a
		module, etc -- into to a locked library.
.user_action	Contact the staff responsible for the library to
		determine why access to the library is currently
