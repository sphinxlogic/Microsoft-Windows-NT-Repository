.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -w
Use a gamma correction for the graphic with the values 1.0 for red, 0.0
for green and 0.4 for blue.
.br
Please note: The gamma values used are not a gamma correction in the
traditional way. Just check it out.
.TP
.B -R \fIred\fR
The value for the gamma correction for red color-part. This option
takes a floating point argument.
.TP
.B -G \fIgreen\fR
The value for the gamma correction for green color-part. This option
takes a floating point argument.
.TP
.B -B \fIblue\fR
The value for the gamma correction for blue color-part. This option
takes a floating point argument.
.TP
.B -v
Be verbose on startup (this tells the LinCity version too).
.TP
.B -g \fIgeom\fR
Specify the X11 geometry argument. E.g. use 
.B -g \fI+0+0\fR
to put the window to the upper left corner on startup.
.TP
.B -d
This doubles the size of the window. Please note: This option is only
avail, if enabled in the Makefile.
.TP
.B -n
Don't show the opening help. The game starts up with a bare playfield.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B LinCity
is a city/country simulation game running with SVGA graphics on a
Linux console or in an X11 window under Linux and other platforms.
.br
You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house,
provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go
for broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and
resource starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources
available in any one place, this is not a game that you can leave for
long periods of time.
.br
For more about how to play, please read the excellent online help
provided with the game.
