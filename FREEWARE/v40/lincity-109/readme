WHAT IS LinCity?
================

LinCity is an SVGALIB (Linux only) and X based city/country simulation game
for Linux and other Unix platforms - Solaris, FreeBSD, HP_UX, AIX, SCO and
IRIX. There is also a Win32 version (win95 and NT) available as a separate
package at

    www.winsite.com/info/pc/win95/games/lc108.zip/index.html

or follow the Win32 link from the LinCity home page

    www.floot.demon.co.uk/lincity.html

You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house,
provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for
broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource
starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any
one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.

This is the final development release of LinCity, only bug fixes will cause
future releases. Bug reports should be sent to ijp@floot.demon.co.uk .

Work is underway on LinCity Version 2. You can join in (or just lurk) by

Major changes since 1.03
========================

1.09
****

- Documentation updates only.

1.08
****

 - Ooops, another problem with loading (good-time, bad-times) fixed.
 - Missing tech level help page added.

1.07
****

- strcat bug in the new load code, fixed.
- mkdir -p fails on sco if the dir exists, workround done.

1.06
****

- Quite a serious 'clicking in the wrong place at the wrong time' bug fixed.
  Thanks to Timothy C. Hagman for spotting this one.
- A potential security hole closed. vga_init() is now called as close to the
  start of main() as possible.
- SCO port added.
- Gzip called with 'system' rather than through a pipe. The pipe caused
  some platforms to fail while saving.

1.05
****

- "When you are in a scene and use for example roads and then load a less
   developed scene, you can still use them, until you switch to another
   item." - Alexander Klink    Bug fixed, thanks Alex.
-  The X multi-transport code didn't actually produce working transport, it
   just 'looked right'. Thanks to Holger Dietze for the bug report and
   patch.

1.04
****

- Pix doubled X screen redraw bug, fixed.
- remove_scene() bug fix by Chris J. Kiick. Thanks.
- mini screen messy power text overwrite, fixed.
- negative interest payment bug fixed.
- prints money straight after a load.
- Modern windmill OK box added.
- Shanty placement over the edge, bug fixed. Thanks to Chris J. Kiick.
- Installed dir permissions explicitly set. Not needed for most platforms,
  but does no harm.
- Fire, cricket, health and power cover mini screens now show the areas
  that are _NOT_ within the their areas. A number of people wanted this
  change.
- An attempt at getting 24bpp X visuals working. (maybe)



REQUIREMENTS:   *  A graphics card supported by svgalib or X11.
============
                *  svgalib 1.2.9 (or greater), some earlier versions are
                               broken (eg compressed fonts)
                        [  1.2.9 and 1.2.10 are now available in 
                    disabuse.demon.co.uk:/pub/unix/linux/libs/svga ]

         OR	 X11.
         ^^
                *  An ELF install, or...
                 ... if you are using a.out libraries you will have to compile
                               it for yourself (make clean, make install).

                *  You probably need at least a 486DX2-66. (Even better
                   for the X version I suspect.)

                *  Other things? That's what you're there to find out :)



INSTALLATION:
============

To install LinCity, (as root) untar the file lincity109-src.tgz 

     tar -xzvf lincity109-src.tgz

This will unpack the game into the directory ./lincity109 .

You now want to compile the source, go into the direcrory ./lincity109

      cd lincity109
      make lincity      (or xlincity)
      make install


For more instructions on compiling/installing, look at the file
README.INSTALL   (Typing  make  on its own will also give you some help.)

If you are non-linux, please read the README for your platform. Do not try
to compile using the Imakefile or the (platform)Makefile - they will not
work - these need to be called from the top level Makefile.

If you have a version less than 0.95 installed on your system, you MUST
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                     ^^^^
remove the following symlinks with:
                rm /usr/local/bin/lin-city
		rm /usr/local/bin/xlin-city
You should also get rid of the old source tree (although this isn't strictly
necessary), with
		rm -r /usr/local/games/lin-city


RUNNING LINCITY
===============

Usually you will invoke the game with    lincity   or   xlincity

             lincity  [opts]
             xlincity [opts]

The following options apply to both.

        -w   Do some *crude* gamma correction to boost the red and blue.
             This makes some 'washed out' displays a bit more colourful.
             You have control of the individual values, see below.

        -R <num>
	-G <num>
	-B <num>
             These options allow you to boost the individual colours.
             <num> is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
             The default values for -w are  1.0   0.0   0.4  (ATTOW)

This option only applies to xlincity.

        -b   Do not include the extra border around the game.
        -d   Double the size of the window to 1280x960


KNOWN BUGS:
===========

Had a report of the technology indicator showing both a rise and fall,
although I have now seen this, I haven't tracked it down yet.  (This has
been here for ages. The indicator code needs a rewrite. :(  )

There is a very minor (display) bug, where a small block is left when
exiting a help page. The only happens when part of the mouse cursor is in
the main window during the re-draw. It quicky disappears when the main
window is scrolled or updated. This is such a minor bug, that I consider it
best left in (I don't want to risk breaking something else at this stage),
so this will only get fixed if there are other bugs to fix in the future.

"This program has something for everyone. Some people want to find bugs, so
I added some."
                                                      -unknown.

HISTORY:
=======

I started writing LinCity in June 1995 as an exercise in mouse control in
SVGALIB. It quickly became a usable, then even fun, game to play. Over the
next 18+ months it evolved into a challenging and stable game which, in a
number of people's opinion, is worth uploading to the net. The current
version is 1.09 .
