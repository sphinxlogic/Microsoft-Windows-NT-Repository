Version 0.8.1 of the slrn newsreader is now available from space.mit.edu in
pub/davis/slrn. In addition, it is also available (or soon will be) from the
European mirror site ftp.uni-stuttgart.de:/pub/unix/misc/slang.

slrn is a powerful but very friendly NNTP based newsreader for Unix and VMS
that boasts the following features:

  * True referenced-based threading
  * Score (Kill) file support with scores that can be set to expire
  * Built-in MIME support
  * Draws a colored thread tree using line drawing characters
  * Multiple server support
  * Multiple windows
     - Header summary window showing threads
     - Article window
  * Customizable 
     - Keybindings
     - Colors
         For example, the default colors, say, using a color xterm such as
	 rxvt, shows the top status bar in blue on white, the author's name
	 in the header summary window as magenta on white, the thread tree
	 as red lines connecting subject titles, the window status lines
	 appear as yellow on blue, the article headers in the article window
	 are cyan on white, the quoted text appears as red on white, and
	 the body of the article appears as blue on white.
     - Server -> newsrc mappings
  * Smart screen updating
  * Online help which is also customizable
  * Automatic reconnect if server drops connection
  * Fast on slow modem connections.  It does not have to read the whole
     active file like many other newsreaders.
  * Compile with TERM support under Linux
  * XTerm mouse support
  * Easy uudecoding of articles

The current version does not yet provide support for a local news spool.
However, this is being worked on.

Here is a list of changes since 0.8.0:

0.  Updated FAQ with a complete discussion of uudecoding articles
1.  The `toggle_sort' function bound to `ESC s' in article mode has been
    modifed.  Now, it prompts for the sorting method.
2.  New variables for the .slrnrc file:

      % If 0, do not sort.  If 1, perform threading.  If 2, sort by subject
      % If 3, thread then sort result by subject
      set sorting_method 3

      % If non-zero, threads will be uncollapsed when a group is entered
      set uncollapse_threads 0
      
    Note: methods 2 and 3 were not available in previous versions of slrn.
    This is why the `toggle_sort' function needed to be modified.
3.  It is now possible to have all posted articles saved in a file.  The
    file is specified in the .slrnrc with a line like:

        set save_posts "News/My_Posts"

4.  slrn now generates its own message id provided that it can find the
    machines fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  The reason for this is
    that one can easily more efficiently score follow-ups to the user's
    posted articles.  For example, if the FQDN is `machine.my.domain' and
    the user's name is `user' then simply put:
    
       [*]
       Score: 100      (or whatever)
       References: user@machine.my.domain>
       
    in the score file.  (The first part of the generated message-id is
    composed of a base 32 representation of the current time and process-id).
5.  Default values available at all yes/no prompts.

6.  Saving an article is slightly different but simpler.  The new bindings
    are: 
    
	`:'  uudecode file
        `o'  save a file-- no decoding
	
    Use "decode" and "save_article" to re-bind these.
    See the FAQ for more detailed help on uudecoding articles.
    
7.  New variable: 'save_directory' may be used to specify where files are
    saved.  The default is 'News'.  Use something in your .slrnrc file:
    
        set save_directory "News"
	
8.  There is now an option for slrn to read the active file upon startup.
    Using this option may result in faster startup times.  Using the active
    file also has the advantage that the `L' key will list all groups
    available at the server.  
    
    There are two ways of enabling this option:
    
        a.  Startup slrn with the -a switch:  slrn -a
	b.  Add the line:
	  
	         set read_active 1
	   
	    to your .slrnrc file.

9.  The `Expires' date may be given in one of the following formats:

       MM/DD/YYYY
       DD-MM-YYYY
       
    Previous versions only allowed the first format.

10.  MIME support add by Michael Elkins <elkins@aero.org>.
    To enable MIME support, add:
    
        set use_mime 1
	
    to your .slrnrc file.  In addition, you may select a character set by
    adding something like:
    
        set mime_charset "iso-8859-1"

    to your .slrnrc file.
    
    The MIME code is still in the testing phase but it appears to be ok.

Enjoy.
