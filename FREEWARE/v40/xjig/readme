                       the jigsaw puzzle


 available at ftp.x.org and mirrors as:
                    /contrib/games/xjig-2.4.tgz


 Description:
      XJig is a puzzle, that tries to replicate a jigsaw puzzle on the
      screen as close as possible. Gif-images can be loaded and sliced
      into pieces and as in every jigsaw puzzle, the goal is to
      set the parts together again.

 Special effects:
      - Tiles are freely rotatable with intuitive pointer movement.
      - Tiles can even be flipped to their back (to mirror them).
      - Tiles can be shown as shaped windows on the desktop.


 Restrictions:
 -  The game needs a C++ - compiler (tested with gcc-2.7.0 and HP's CC)
 -  The game works only on color monitors.
 -  For the texture-mapping routines, you might a bit of machine power
    to make them look good (it runs very smooth on my Pentium 90).

 Have fun.
