XCOMM =====================================================================

XCOMM set the compiler that you like,
XCOMM gcc should suit, since the libraries are not needed. But I had problem
XCOMM with the optimize-options on gcc-2.7.0. You should try to use
XCOMM optimization on your version, but if it doesn't work, a compiler bug
XCOMM might be the reason...

XCOMM           CXX = gcc -g

XCOMM On some machines (like on linux) you can gain speed by using the
XCOMM MIT-SHM extension for transfering images to the server via shared
XCOMM memory. If your system doesn't support that or if you don't see any
XCOMM enhancement, you could remove the -DUSE_MIT_SHM flag from the CXXFLAGS.

        USE_MIT_SHM = -DUSE_MIT_SHM

XCOMM There is a speed optimization in not doing any checks about crossing
XCOMM the image boundaries during the texture mapping routines. Some extra
XCOMM memory therefore surround the image for not crashing due to nonallocated
XCOMM memory access. You can switch range-checking on by uncommenting the
XCOMM following flag.

XCOMM    RANG_CHECK = -DRANGE_CHECK

XCOMM which default file should be loaded if no option is set

        JIG_DEFAULT = \"tina.gif\"
