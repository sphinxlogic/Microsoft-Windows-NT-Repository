
Making the game can be done with the supplied Makefiles, or with
the Imakefile, by using:
	xmkmf
	make depend
	make

You should probably check the comments comments at the top of the
Imakefile for setting additional parameters.

Have a look at the man-page or xjig.cat for further instructions on
the usage.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:

- There are problems with the optimize option in some gcc version (e.g. 2.7.0).
  If the compilation runs fine, but nothing happens on the screen, this might
  be the problem and you should re-compile it non-optimized.

- The game wasn't tested on 64bit machines yet. Since the texture-mapping
  routines are very low level C-functions, there might be hidden bugs
  depending on the underlying datatypes of the system. Comments are welcome.


Have fun.
