To Install :
	edit the Imakefile as appropriate for your system. create a DATADIR
		for the xataxx boards and bitmaps, and define BINDIR if
		you want the game to go somewhere other than the default
		system area.
	"make Makefile" OR "xmkmf"
	make install

	.... and that should be it. Full, gory docs in the manpage.

	This game has a lot that could still happen to it - if you are
interested in working on the code, see the TODO file. Since we are way
overloaded here at CMU, there is somewhat small chance that we'll be
able to get around to chopping items from the list anytime soon. If
you do anything to the code, please let us know back here so we can
merge it into future releases.

	In any case xataxx *is* a finished game as is. Have fun ...

p.s. the supplied Makefile is for bootstrap purposes ONLY. It is unlikely
	it will work unmodified on your system. "make Makefile" before
	doing anything else.

p.p.s this has only been tested (and heavily) on MIT X11R4 systems. Others
	are caveat emptor, but patches welcome if neccesary :-)
