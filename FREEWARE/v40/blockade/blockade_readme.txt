This is an X version of the `blockade' Macintosh game by Christer
Ericson.  To build it, edit the Makefile and customize it for your
local setup, then `make' should build it.

This is known to build on SunOS 4.1.  It should build on any mostly-BSD
UNIXish system.

As noted in the credits screen, the first 80 built-in scenes are not my
work.  The exact details of the pictures used are my work, but the
basic designs of the levels were taken from the Macintosh version.  All
the code is mine; when I was told the original was in Pascal, I decided
it would be easier to write it from scratch.

Some of this software is copyrighted by various persons and/or
organizations; please see the accompanying file COPYRIGHT for details.

Edit works now!  Unfortunately getting started with it is a bit tricky;
you want to run `blockade filename', but the first time you do this you
need to give the -new option, or blockade won't like the file.  Then
use ^P to ask for level 81, click the Edit button, and away you go.

A few levels I've built are included in sample.lev.
