PBMPLUS, UTILITIES, Portable Bit Map Toolkit (10dec91 version)

PBMPLUS is a toolkit for converting various image formats to and from
portable formats, and therefore to and from each other.  The idea is,
if you want to convert among N image formats, you only need 2*N
conversion filters, instead of the N^2 you would need if you wrote each
one separately.

In addition to the converters, the package includes some simple tools
for manipulating the portable formats.
