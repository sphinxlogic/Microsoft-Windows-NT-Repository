          OpenVMS Freeware for VAX and AXP Systems

          The OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM contains free software
          tools and utilities to aid software developers in
          creating applications and managing and using OpenVMS
          systems.

          Many of these tools are popular packages already
          widely known and in use, while others are internally
          developed Digital tools our engineers are making
          available to our OpenVMS customers. For example,
          the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM includes Bliss-32 for
          OpenVMS VAX, Bliss-32 for OpenVMS AXP, and Bliss-64
          for OpenVMS AXP.

          The Disk / File utilities is a tool developed to
          help finding and solving disk , directory and file
          problems. The usage of low-level VMS-I/O features
          have resulted in a powerfull and high-performance
          utility. Also, DFU provides many features which are
          not available with normal DCL commands.

          DFU supports all types of disk sets which comply to
          the VMS ODS-2 standard such as volume sets, stripe
          sets, shadow sets and RAID sets, and combinations of
          these. Spiralog disks are NOT supported

          DFU also supports the new Extended File Specifications
          (also known as ODS-5) which is introduced in VMS 7.2
          (Alpha-only).

          DFU is fully Year-2000 compliant.

          DFU provides the following functions (in alphabetical
          order) :

          o  DEFRAG : This function allows simple defragmentation
             of a file or files.

                                                              1-1                                                              1-1                                                              1-1

 


          Introduction          Introduction          Introduction





          o  DELETE : This function allows either a delete by
             file-id, or a fast delete of a complete directory or
             directory tree with all its subdirectories.

          o  DIRECTORY : This function has 7 options :

            1  COMPRESS a directory

            2  DUMP a directory block by block

            3  CREATE a directory with a preallocated size

            4  RECOVER a corrupted directory

            5  Search all directories on the disk for files
               which have multiple versions

            6  Search all directories on the disk for alias file
               entries

            7  Search all directories on the disk for empty
               directories

          o  REPORT : Generates a file and free space report for
             a disk. Also a disk space usage report, based on
             UIC/Identifier, can be generated, even on a disk
             which has disk quota disabled.

          o  SEARCH : Look up files on a disk by specific file
             attributes (eg. files sizes, dates, ownership, and
             so on)

          o  SET : This functions allows setting of vitually all
             possible file attributes.

          o  UNDELETE : A safe file recovery function.

          o  VERIFY : This function performs a fast disk
             structure verification and can optionally repair
             certain disk structure errors (comparable with
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR).

          Each function is described in detail in the
          corresponding chapter.

          DFU is supported on OpenVMS V6.2 through V7.2 (VAX and
          Alpha).

   1.3    New features and bugfixes of V2.6   1.3    New features and bugfixes of V2.6   1.3    New features and bugfixes of V2.6

          This version of DFU offers some improved and new
          features, as well as a couple of bugfixes. All
          bugfixes previous released as V2.5 ECO 1 and ECO 2
          are included in V2.6. The table below lists all new
          features :

          o  DFU completely supports the new ODS-5 file system on
             VMS 7.2, including ISO-Latin1 file names. DFU does
             not fully support UCS-2 file names.

          o  DFU supports deep directories , which is a new VMS
             7.2 feature.

          o  All code has been reviewed for Y2K compliancy.

          o  New Search qualifiers :

            1  /LIMIT=(minimum :n, maximum :m) : List all
               directories with a default file version limit
               between n and m.

            2  /FULL will now also list the last access date and
               last attribute date (VMS 7.2 only)

            3  Qualifiers to search for the new VMS 7.2 date
               fields : /ACCESS=(BEFORE=date | SINCE=date) and
               /ATTRIB=(BEFORE=date | SINCE=date).

            4  /TYPE=ODS2 | ODS5 : search for specific ODS2 or
               ODS5 type file headers.

          o  SET : New qualifiers to set the new V7.2 file
             dates : /ACCESS=date , /NOACCESS and /ATTRIB=date,
             /NOATTRIB

          o  REPORT now reports the Erase and/or Highwater
             marking attributes.

          o  Directory processing is now optimized by using Fast-
             IO features of VMS (7.1 and higher, Alpha only).

          o  VERIFY will now detect and repair (/FIX) a broken
             backlink to VMS$COMMON.DIR

                                                              1-3                                                              1-3                                                              1-3

          o  The diskquota list restriction of 750 entries has
             been lifted; DFU now supports an unlimited number of
             diskquota entries.

          o  All commands have been enhanced with paging support
             (/PAGE qualifier). This only works in SMG mode and
             allows the output to be presented page by page.

          The following bugs and problems are fixed :

          o  DIRECTORY/ALIAS did not report alias files in the
             same directory.

          o  DIRECTORY/COMPRESS could set the directory bit on
             non-directory files.

          o  SEARCH/ACE did not report matching ACE's in
             extension headers.

   1.4    Restrictions and Parameters   1.4    Restrictions and Parameters   1.4    Restrictions and Parameters

          The DFU program has a few restrictions :

          o  DFU can not handle volume sets with more than 32
             members.

          The following minimum process quotas are recommended
          for DFU usage:

          o  WSQUOTA : 1500

          o  WSEXTENT : 3000

          o  DIOLM : 40

          o  ASTLM : 40

          o  FILLM : 40

          If you use DFU on volume sets with a large number of
          members you may need to increase the SYSGEN parameter
          CHANNELCNT.

          If you use the directory command on very large
          directory files (> 1000 blocks) and run into errors
          you may need to increase the following parameters:

          o  WSQUOTA at least 1000 + size-of-largest directory
             file

          o  WSEXTENT : WSQUOTA + at least 1000

          o  CTLPAGES (SYSGEN parameter) : at least 100

          o  WSMAX (SYSGEN parameter) : at least WSEXTENT

          Do not change parameters unless you run into errors
          such as EXCEEDED QUOTA or INSUFFICIENT WORKING SET
          LIMITS.

   1.5    Restrictions on FAST-IO features   1.5    Restrictions on FAST-IO features   1.5    Restrictions on FAST-IO features

          VMS 7.1 introduced a way to improve I/O performance,
          called FAST-IO. This feature does only work on
          Alpha. DFU will try to perform directory processing
          using FAST-IO. If this fails DFU will switch back
          to 'normal' I/O. To enable FAST-IO the following
          conditions must be met:

          o  The user must have the identifier VMS$BUFFER_OBJECT_
             USER granted.

          o  There must be sufficient free Buffer object space.
             This is governed by the SYSGEN parameter MAXBOBMEM.
             DFU may require up to 1000 MAXBOBMEM pages.

          If DFU can use FAST-IO then commands such as
          DIR/ALIAS, DIR/VERSION and VERIFY/DIR will gain a
          10-15% performance improvement.

          This chapter describes the installation procedure and
          other actions which must be taken to run DFU.

          __________________________________________________________________

   2.1    Installation procedure   2.1    Installation procedure   2.1    Installation procedure

          DFU must be installed with the PRODUCT INSTALL
          utility. During the installation PRODUCT INSTALL does
          the following:

          o  Moves the documentation to SYS$HELP (Optional)

          o  Relinks DFU

          o  Creates the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier needed to perform
             the special privileged functions. (See chapter 2.2)

          The DFU utility in fact contains just 2 files :

          1  SYS$SYSTEM:DFU.EXE : the DFU program

          2  SYS$HELP:DFUHLP.HLB : the on-line help file

          The installation no longer offers an opportunity for
          private installation. If you don't want DFU to be
          available systemwide you must manually move DFU.EXE
          and the help file to your private directory.

          To install DFU log in into a privileged account. Next,
          copy the .PCSI installation kit to disk:[directory]
          (may be anywhere on your system). Note that there
          are two different kits, one for the VAX and one for
          the Alpha architecture, named DEC-VAXVMS-DFU-V0206-
          1.PCSI and DEC-AXPVMS-DFU-V0206-1.PCSI. Next enter the
          following command:

                                                              2-1                                                              2-1                                                              2-1

                           $ Product Install DFU/SOURCE=disk:[directory]

                           The following product has been selected:
                           DEC VAXVMS DFU V2.6

                           Do you want to continue? [YES]

          If you enter YES the installation will proceed :

                           *** DEC VAXVMS DFU V2.6: Disk and File Utilities for OpenVMS

                               Do you want all the default values for this product? [YES]

          If you enter YES DFU will be installed with all
          manuals. If you enter NO you will be prompted for the
          manuals you want to install. Finally, Product Install
          will continue with the installation :

                           %PCSIUI-I-DONEASK, execution phase starting
                           The following product will be installed:

                           DEC VAXVMS DFU V2.6

          If you installed DFU system wide you may manually
          execute SYS$STARTUP:DFU$STARTUP.COM on any node in the
          cluster. Executing DFU$STARTUP.COM adds DFU.EXE to the
          installed file list and thus improves performance. if
          you want DFU Installed each time the system boots you
          must add the command @SYS$STARTUP:DFU$STARTUP to the
          file SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.

          Next you must grant any DFU user including yourself
          the DFU_ALLPRIV identifiers if they must be able to
          use all DFU functions. See chapter 2.2 for the meaning
          of this identifier.

   2.2    Security and access   2.2    Security and access   2.2    Security and access

          DFU has some functions which must not be made
          available for general usage. Therefore DFU has a
          certain group of commands which require the user
          to be granted the DFU_ALLPRIV qualifier. The DFU_
          ALLPRIV identifier is created during the installation
          procedure. To enable a user to perform these
          special functions the system manager must grant this
          identifier as follows :

                           $ mc authorize
                           UAF> grant/id DFU_ALLPRIV username

          If the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier is not granted then the
          functions listed below cannot be performed :

          1  DEFRAG

          2  DELETE/FILE

          3  SPAWN

          4  UNDELETE

          5  VERIFY/FIX and VERIFY/REBUILD

          Note that this behaviour is different from previous
          versions of DFU. Some commands which required the DFU_
          ALLPRIV identifier on previous DFU versions have been
          removed from the list above. It is highly recommended
          that the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier is only granted to a
          limited number of users.

          All DFU functions need SYSPRV or BYPASS privilege.

          IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT *** IMPORTANT

          Please note that the DFU$STARTUP.COM procedure
          installs DFU.EXE with BYPASS privilege. Because
          of the new SPAWN command you must not grant non-
          privileged users the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier. Otherwise
          they can get the BYPASS privilege simply by using
          the SPAWN command. As a workaround you can change

                                                              2-3                                                              2-3                                                              2-3

          To run DFU you can enter :

                           $ RUN disk:[mydir]DFU

          or (if DFU is installed systemwide):

                           $ MC DFU

          You can also define and use a symbol for DFU as
          follows:

                           $ DFU == "$disk:[dir]DFU"
                           $ DFU

          DFU now prompts with :

                               Disk and File Utilities for OpenVMS DFU V2.6

                           DFU>

          You can now enter DFU commands. HELP gives you online
          help. After each command DFU returns to the DFU>
          prompt. You can recall and edit commands, just as with
          DCL (20 commands will be stored in the recall buffer).
          Use EXIT or CTRL/Z to leave DFU. If you use a symbol
          for DFU, you also process a single command and return
          to DCL immediately:

                           $DFU SEARCH disk/qualifiers

          During a DFU run, you can interrupt DFU with CTRL/C
          or CTRL/Y. These interrupts are caught by DFU to
          allow a correct rundown of the current command. It
          may therefore take some time before DFU responds to a
          CTRL/C or Y interrupt.

   2.4    Using an indirect file list   2.4    Using an indirect file list   2.4    Using an indirect file list

          There are 3 commands, DIRECTORY, DEFRAG and SET which
          accept an indirect file as input parameter. This is
          achieved by using the @ sign. An indirect file is a
          file containing a list of valid filenames (each line
          in such a file must contain exactly one filename).
          Such indirect files can be the output file of the DFU
          Search command eg.:

                           $ DFU
                           DFU> SEARCH mydisk/CHAR=DIRECTORY/OUTPUT=x.x

          DFU uses SMG (Screen management routines) to perform
          output for an interactive DFU session. This chapter
          describes the layout of the DFU screen, the special
          commands used only in the SMG interface and other
          items with respect to the SMG interface.

          DFU automatically selects SMG output if you run an
          interactive DFU session on a terminal or workstation
          which supports SMG. In a batch job or a non-DEC
          terminal DFU will use normal line oriented output.
          You can explicitly disable SMG by defining the logical
          DFU$NOSMG to any value.

          You may prefer to perform interactive DFU sessions in
          SMG mode, and single DFU commands in normal line mode.
          This can be done by using the command procedure listed
          below:

             for the output from DFU commands. Also broadcast
             messages are send to this window.

          o  Statistics : the lower part contains statistics from
             the current command. During most of the commands
             this screen will contain a progress indicator and a
             status for the current command.

             command)

          o  HELP or PF2 : invokes a special SMG window for the

          Although only some 20 lines are visible in the output
          (main) screen DFU in fact remembers 500 output lines.
          You can scroll back and forward through one screen
          with the NEXT and PREV SCREEN keys, and one line with
          the REMOVE and INSERT HERE keys. At the beginning of
          each new DFU command these lines are cleared.

          If you execute a command which produces a lot of
          output, you can paginate the output by using the /PAGE
          qualifier.

          On a workstation with DECwindows/Motif you can change
          the DECterm size to be more than the standard 24
          lines. DFU's SMG screen will automatically adjust
          to the screen size of such a DecTerm.

          There are a few side effects when using SMG mode.
          CTRL/C and CTRL/Y are catched but not echoed. Also all
          broadcast messages are trapped and will be displayed
          in the main screen at the end of the current DFU
          command. Sometimes this may slightly disrupt the main
          screen, which can be repaired with the CTRL/W key.

          Further, during the execution of a DFU command the
          cursor will disappear. After the command finishes the
          cursor will reappear at the DFU> prompt.

   4      DFU basics   4      DFU basics   4      DFU basics



          Note : this chapter is meant for first time users of
          DFU. If you already used DFU before you may probably
          skip this chapter.

          This chapter gives a brief overview of the commands
          which can be used with DFU, and how they can provide
          the system manager with the necessary information.

          One of most common actions by a system manager is
          trying to locate specific files eg. files with a
          certain file size. Although a lot can be done with
          the VMS DIRECTORY command this can be a time consuming
          process, especially if the complete disk must be
          scanned. The SEARCH command of DFU is exactly meant
          for this situation. It gives a very quick list of
          specific files, with their size, and if needed the
          number of file fragments. Some useful SEARCH commands
          are :

                           DFU> SEARCH disk/SIZE=MINIMUM=1000 (files > 1000 blocks)
                           DFU> SEARCH disk/IDENT=SYSTEM (files owned by SYSTEM)
                           DFU> SEARCH disk/FRAGMENT=MINIMUM=10 (files with at least 10 fragments)
                           DFU> SEARCH disk/CHAR=MARKED (all files marked for delete)
                           DFU> SEARCH disk/CREATED=SINCE=YESTERDAY (all files created since YESTERDAY)

          Of course these qualifiers can be combined to narrow
          the search. As the SEARCH command scans INDEXF.SYS,
          not directories, the output generated by SEARCH may
          look a bit random (but it is just the order in which
          the file headers are in the INDEXF.SYS file). To
          smooth the output use the /SORT qualifier.



                                                              4-1                                                              4-1                                                              4-1

 


          DFU basics          DFU basics          DFU basics





          Another important action for a system manager is to
          gather some overall disk information, such as number
          of files, free space statistics and fragmentation
          information. The REPORT command will generate such
          a disk report. To get individual disk space usage
          information the /USAGE qualifier can be used. This
          will work even if there is no disk quota enabled on
          the disk.

          At regular intervals a system manager may need to
          check a disk with ANALYZE/DISK. The DFU VERIFY command
          provides more or less the same functionality but many
          times faster. The /FIX qualifier provides some REPAIR
          options which (unlike ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR) do NOT
          lock the disk, and thus do not interfere with other
          disk operations. However, the disk can be rebuilt
          completely by using the /REBUILD qualifier.

          Occasionaly a user will delete the wrong file, leaving
          the system manager or operator with the tedious task
          of restoring the file from a backup set. The UNDELETE
          command may be able to recover the file if it has not
          yet been overwritten with a new one. Much care has
          been taken to make this command as safe as possible;
          therefore no disk corruptions will be the result of an
          UNDELETE. If DFU encounters a problem with a deleted
          file it will refuse to UNDELETE it.

          Another type of typical system manager problems deals
          with directories. The DFU command DIRECTORY can handle
          such problems. DIRECTORY can generate reports about
          empty directories (/EMPTY qualifier) or directories
          which contain files with a certain number of versions
          (/VERSION=n qualifier). Also, directories may become
          internally fragmented. This can be quickly solved with
          the /COMPRESS qualifier.

          A second problem with directories is in deleting a
          directory with many files. This may take several
          hours using a DCL DELETE *.* command. This problem
          is solved by using DFU's DELETE/DIRECTORY command
          which can delete large directories some 10 times

          faster than the normal DELETE command does. Also,
          using DELETE/DIR/TREE will delete a complete directory
          tree with just one command.

          The last 2 commands deal with individual files. SET
          allows settings of some special file attributes.
          Since VMS V6.0 this functionality is also provided
          by the DCL SET FILE/ATTRIBUTE command, but DFU's SET
          offers some more options. The DEFRAG command is an
          interface to the MOVEFILE function offered by VMS 5.5
          and higher. This allows a simple defragmentation of
          individual files.

          The next chapters gives a detailed description of each
          individual DFU command.

   5      ODS-5 features   5      ODS-5 features   5      ODS-5 features



          VMS 7.2 introduces an extension on the current ODS2
          file system, called the Extended File Specifications,
          or ODS-5. This feature is available only on Alpha
          systems. Also, VMS 7.2 adds support for 255 levels of
          subdirectories. This is often called deep-directory
          support. Both features are now fully supported by DFU
          V2.6. There is no need to perform any special action
          to execute DFU commands on ODS-5 disks. Nevertheless
          the following points are worth to be considered before
          using DFU on VMS 7.2 and ODS-5 disks:

          1  It is highly recommended to add the following
             command to LOGIN.COM :

                               $ SET PROCESS/PARSE=EXTENDED

             This allows easy usage of the new file naming scheme
             (such as lower-case character, multiple dots in a
             file name).

          2  File names can become large, either trough the
             file name, or because we can have 255 levels
             of subdirectories. A filename longer than 255
             characters will be abbreviated into a so-called
             DID-ed name.

          A DID-ed name looks like 'device:[x,y,z]file.ext'. As
          can be seen the directory string has been replaced by
          the file id (x,y,z) of the parent directory.

   6.1    Description   6.1    Description   6.1    Description

          The DEFRAG command can be used to defragment a single
          file or a group of files. You can also enter an
          indirect command file containing a list of files.
          This feature allows you to create an output file with
          SEARCH and use that as an input to DEFRAG.

          DEFRAG makes use of the file-primitive MOVEFILE
          function. Therefore files which are open, or which
          are marked NOMOVE will not be DEFRAGmented.

          o  DEVICEFULL: Device has not enough contiguous free
             space to move the entire file

          o  FILNOTACC: File has been set to NOMOVE.

          o  FILENUMCHK: You tried to move a reserved file (eg
             INDEXF.SYS).

          o  RMS Errors: Almost always caused by an invalid or
             wrong file specifcation.

          indirect command file (@file) which contains a list of

          generated with the SEARCH/OUTPUT command.

          Normally DEFRAG tries to create a contiguous file.
          If there is not enough contiguous free space the
          operation will fail. With the /BESTTRY qualifier
          DEFRAG tries to move the file with the contiguous-
          best-try method. This means a maximum of 3 fragments.
          You should only use this qualifier when a normal
          DEFRAG fails. If a DEFRAG/BESTTRY also fails this
          is an indication that the disk's free space is too
          fragmented. Run a REPORT to see what the largest
          contiguous free space is, and check the free space
          fragmentation index.

          _______          /DEVICE          /DEVICE          /DEVICE
          The device on which the files reside. The device name
          is added to the file name. If you generate a file
          list with the DFU SEARCH command you don't need this
          qualifier anymore. However you may have a list of

                             DFU> DEFRAG @x.x

          _________________________          /LBN=logical-block-number          /LBN=logical-block-number          /LBN=logical-block-number
          Forces a single file to be moved to the specified
          logical block number. Do not use this qualifier when
          processing a list of files.

          ___________          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS
          This qualifier displays the performance statistics:
          CPU time, Elapsed Time, I/O and PageFaults.

          ___________          /WRITECHECK          /WRITECHECK          /WRITECHECK
          Perform a writecheck on the resultant file. The
          default is /NOWRITECHECK. Note that a writecheck
          doubles the number of involved disk I/O's.

   7      DELETE   7      DELETE   7      DELETE



          This chapter describes the DELETE command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   7.1    Introduction   7.1    Introduction   7.1    Introduction

          The DELETE command is designed for 2 purposes:

          1  Delete a file by file id (with the /FILE qualifier).
             This functionality is needed to be able to delete
             files which no longer have a parent directory. This
             way 'lost' files and (sometimes) files marked for
             delete can be removed from a disk.

          2  A fast method to delete a complete directory or
             even a directory tree (with the /DIRECTORY and
             /TREE qualifier). First all entries of a directory
             are deleted without removing the directory entry ;
             this saves a lot of unnecessary directory updates.
             Finally the directory file itself is deleted, unless
             the /KEEP qualifier is used. This way a directory
             is cleaned up many times faster than with the DCL
             DELETE *.* command. On large directories DFU may
             be even 10 or more times faster than DCL. To delete
             a complete directory tree use the /TREE qualifier.
             The DCL command DELETE [.SUBDIR...]*.*;* will almost
             always fail to delete the intermediate subdirectory
             files forcing you to issue this command several
             times. The DFU DELETE command is smart enough to
             delete the files and the subdirectory files in
             the proper order; therefore only one command is
             sufficient to delete a complete directory tree.

                                                              7-1                                                              7-1                                                              7-1

          Introduction          Introduction          Introduction




             The /KEEP qualifier allows you to preserve the
             directory tree. The contents are deleted but the
             directory file(s) remains intact.

             If a file cannot be deleted for some reason (such
             as a file access conflict) the file will stay at its
             place together with the parent directory.

          provided.

          Make sure that the directory does not contain non-
          empty subdirectories. Note that the directory
          file itself will also be deleted, unless the /KEEP
          qualifier is used.

          Example:

                           $ DIR EXAMPLE

                           Directory MYDISK:[RUBBISH]

          /KEEP is only valid with the /DIRECTORY qualifier.
          /KEEP works for DELETE/DIR and DELETE/DIR/TREE.

          ______          /NOLOG          /NOLOG          /NOLOG
          Do not log succesfull deletes to SYS$OUTPUT. /LOG is
          the default.

          _________          /NOREMOVE          /NOREMOVE          /NOREMOVE
          Can only be used with /FILE. Default DELETE/FILE will
          try to remove the file from the parent directory.
          If the file's backlink no longer points to a valid
          directory this will generate an error. The /NOREMOVE
          qualifier overrules this behaviour allowing such files
          to be deleted.

          ___________          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS
          This qualifier displays the performance statistics:
          CPU time, Elapsed Time, I/O and PageFaults.

          directory file specified. DFU will first sort out
          the subdirectory tree and than delete the files in
          the proper order. Thus a complete directory tree is
          deleted with one command.

   8      DIRECTORY   8      DIRECTORY   8      DIRECTORY



          This chapter describes the DIRECTORY command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   8.1    Introduction   8.1    Introduction   8.1    Introduction

          The DIRECTORY command offers 7 major functions. 3
          functions deal with all directories on a disk, the
          other 4 functions are used for manipulating individual
          directories. These functions are activated by special
          qualifiers:

          o  Individual directory functions :

            1  /COMPRESS : Rebuild one or more directory files.
               Directories are alphabetically sorted lists of
               filenames and file id's. Because file names
               are randomly inserted and deleted, holes will
               occur in directory files. Such holes will only
               be reused if a file can be alphabetically fitted
               into it. As a result directory files will grow.
               Especially MAIL subdirectories suffer from this
               behaviour.

               To make matters worse directory files above 127
               blocks will no longer be cached by the file
               system. This will degrade performance on such
               directories dramatically. The COMPRESS function
               will rebuild the complete directory file. The
               /TEST qualifier can be used to preview the
               results of a possible COMPRESS command.


                                                              8-1                                                              8-1                                                              8-1

 


          DIRECTORY          DIRECTORY          DIRECTORY





            2  /CREATE/ALLOCATE=n : Create a directory with
               a preallocated size of 'n' blocks. Note that
               'n' will be rounded up to a multiple of the
               disk's cluster size. (This feature is also
               available on VMS 7.1/2 with the DCL command
               CREATE/DIR/ALLOC=n).

            3  /DUMP : Make a dump of the directory blocks and
               formats the output. This option is useful for
               debugging directory files which are suspected
               or corrupted. This function is equivalent
               to the previously undocumented VMS command
               DUMP/DIRECTORY, although the layout of the output
               is different.

            4  /RECOVER : Completely rebuild a directory. This
               option should only be used to recover corrupted
               directories. During the recovery procedure the
               directory will be inaccesible for some time.
               Therefore this command should NEVER be used on
               critical system directories. (DFU refuses this
               command on directory names containing the string
               'SYS' to avoid accidental usage).

          o  Disk-wide directory functions :

            1  /ALIAS : Scan all directories on the disk for
               alias file entries.

            2  /EMPTY : Scan the disk for empty directories

            3  /VERSION=n : Scan all directories on the disk for
               files which have at least 'n' versions.

          The diskwide function qualifiers can be used in
          one command; other combinations of qualifiers are
          not possible. Note that the diskwide directory
          functions can take several minutes to complete because
          a complete directory scan uses a lot of disk I/O
          (approximately 2 I/O's per directory).

          An indirect command file containing a list of files
          can be used as a parameter to /COMPRESS or /DUMP.
          Such a list can be generated with the SEARCH command.
          Example:

                           DFU> SEARCH disk/FILE=*.DIR/SIZE=MIN=50/OUT=x.x

          Caution: Care should be taken when compressing
          critical system directories. To be safe you should
          first use the /TEST qualifier before compressing
          the directory. Another problem may be caused by
          a systemcrash just when DFU is rewriting the new
          compressed directory (although the chance that
          this happens is very small). When this happens you
          can recover the files by executing the following
          procedure:

          1  Do a $SET FILE/NODIR of the corrupted directory

          2  Delete the directory and create a new one

          3  Do a $ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR ; this will move all the
             lost files to [SYSLOST].

          4  Move the files from [SYSLOST] to the newly created
             directory.

   8.2    Discussion of directory compression   8.2    Discussion of directory compression   8.2    Discussion of directory compression

          The DIRECTORY/COMPRESS function will improve
          performance on large directories. There are some
          options which can further enhance performance :

          o  /TRUNCATE: When a directory is compressed , the free
             space will be at the end of the directory. Therefore
             , if new files are added VMS is capable of using
             this space, and avoid a directory entension. The
             /TRUNCATE qualifier overrules this behaviour by
             immediately truncating the free space back to the
             disk.

                                                              8-3                                                              8-3                                                              8-3

          o  /FILL_FACTOR: Normally DFU tries to compress as
             much as possible. However, it may be better to
             deliberately create extra free space into each
             directory block. This can be done using the /FILL_
             FACTOR=n qualifier. Eg: a fill factor of 50% will
             result in approximately half of each block being
             free. Note that a fill_factor lower tha 100% may
             result in an error DFU-E_EXTERR; in that case a
             higher factor must be choosen.

          So, what strategy should be used when compressing
          directories?

          1  Inactive directories : use DIR/COMPRESS/TRUNCATE.

          2  Not very active directories : use DIR/COMPRESS
             (/TRUNCATE=n).

          3  Active directories, files added at the end (such
             as MAIL directories) : use DIR/COMPRESS without
             /TRUNCATE

          4  Active directories, files added in random
             alphabetical order : use DIR/COMPRESS/FILL_FACTOR=n,
             n between 50 and 75.

          The qualifier /FORMAT can be used with
          DIRECTORY/VERSION. This allows the build up of a
          command procedure directly from the output generated
          by the DIR/VERSION command. /FORMAT has the following
          restrictions :

          1  /FORMAT is only valid with the /VERSION and the
             /OUTPUT qualifier.

          2  The format string used must contain the !AS
             directive (in uppercase). The file found will be
             substituted at the !AS location

          The /ALIAS qualifier directs DFU to scan all
          directories for alias file entries on a disk. Normally
          only the system disk should contain alias files. This
          qualifier can be combined with /VERSION=n and /EMPTY.

          _______          /CREATE          /CREATE          /CREATE
          Create a new, empty directory. The allocated size will
          be 1 cluster unless /ALLOCATE is specified.

          _______          /DEVICE          /DEVICE          /DEVICE
          The device on which the files reside. The device
          name is added to the file name. If you generate a
          file list with the DFU SEARCH command you don't need
          this qualifier. However you may have a list of files
          produced from another source and thus need to append a
          device name to it. This qualifier can only be used in
          combination with /COMPRESS or /DUMP.

          _____          /DUMP          /DUMP          /DUMP
          Produce a block level dump of a directory. /DUMP will
          interpret the directory entries found in each block. A
          directory entry contains a size, version-limit, type
          and name field. Next the directory entry contains
          a list of versions and file ID's for this entry.
          /DUMP will produce a rather low level output of this
          information. Example :

                           DFU> DIR/DUMP C.DIR

          ______________          /FILL_FACTOR=n          /FILL_FACTOR=n          /FILL_FACTOR=n
          Specifies ,in percentage, the filling of directory
          blocks during a /COMPRESS operation. Fill factor may
          be between 50 and 100. Omitting this qualifier is the
          same as /FILL_FACTOR=100 (maximum compression). If
          the directory has not enough allocated space a low
          fill factor may result in failure of the Compress
          operation. DFU will issue a DFU-E-EXTERR error, and
          the directory file will not be modified.

          _____________________          /FORMAT=format-string          /FORMAT=format-string          /FORMAT=format-string
          Create an output file in a format described by the
          format string. The string must contain the !AS
          directive (this must be uppercase). At the !AS
          location the resultant filename will be filled in.
          The /OUTPUT qualifier is required.

          ________________          /OUTPUT=filename          /OUTPUT=filename          /OUTPUT=filename
          This qualifier redirects the output to a file. The

          ________          /RECOVER          /RECOVER          /RECOVER
          This qualifier rebuilds a corrupted directory. Do not
          use this command on critical or active directories.

          ___________          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS
          This qualifier displays the performance statistics:

          _____          /TEST          /TEST          /TEST
          The /TEST can only be used in conjunction with
          /COMPRESS. The qualifier will show the results of the
          /COMPRESS but will not compress the directory file.

          During a compress operation truncate the directory
          back to the blocksize specified. If blocksize is not
          specified, the file will be truncated back to the
          end-of-file block number. Truncation will always be
          rounded up to the next highest multiple of the disk's
          cluster size.

          __________          /VERSION=n          /VERSION=n          /VERSION=n
          The /VERSION qualifier directs DFU to scan all
          directories on the device to produce a list of files

          This chapter describes the REPORT command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

   9.1    Description   9.1    Description   9.1    Description

          The REPORT command function generates a report of the
          file and free space fragmentation of the disk. Also a
          graph may be generated by the /GRAPH qualifier; this
          visualises the free space distribution on your disk.
          The /USAGE qualifier will generate a diskspace usage
          report. This is especially useful if DISKQUOTA is not
          enabled on the disk.

          The default report contains information of the Volume,
          files and the bitmap. This output can be suppressed
          by the /NOVOLUME, NOFILE and NOBITMAP qualifiers.
          Also the /USAGE qualifier can be used by displaying
          information of a specific UIC or Identifier simply by
          specifying /USAGE=<uic> or /USAGE=<identifier>.

          The various items have the following meaning :

          1  The header count is calculated based on the size of
             INDEXF.SYS. If more headers are needed INDEXF.SYS
             has to be extended.

          2  The free headers gives the number of free entries in
             INDEXF.SYS before it has to extend.

                                                              9-3                                                              9-3                                                              9-3

          3  The INDEXF.SYS number of fragments and mapwords in
             use are very important figures to determine if the
             INDEXF.SYS file can be extended. The theoretical
             maximum number of mapwords is 155. This value may
             be less if there are ACL's on INDEXF.SYS. Each
             fragment, and therefore each retrieval pointer must
             be in the mapword area. As the size of a retrieval
             pointer depends on the physical size of a disk, it
             is not easy to say how many fragments INDEXF.SYS
             can store in the mapwords area. If the mapword
             area is full the INDEXF file can no longer extend,
             and creating new files may result in a SYSTEM-W-
             HEADERFULL error.

          4  Files which have exactly 1 retrieval pointer are
             considered to be contiguous. This doesn't mean that
             the CONTIGUOUS bit is set in the file header.

          5  The average fragments per file give some indication
             about the total file fragmentation.

          6  The file and free space fragmentation index
             classifies your disk as follows :

            o  0-1 : Excellent

            o  1-2 : Good

            o  2-3 : Fair

            o  3-4 : Poor

            o  >4 : Bad

             If your index is greater than 3 you should consider
             defragmenting the disk using Digitals DFO software,
             by performing an Image BACKUP / Restore, or of
             course by using DFU's DEFRAG/DISK command.

          7  The largest free extent is a useful figure for
             defragmentation purposes. You cannot defragment a
             file when its size is greater than this value.

          When using /GRAPH the disk's free space distribution
          is shown as a bitmap image. Each position in the graph
          represents a certain number of blocks (in the example
          above 3472 blocks). This bitmap image gives a quick
          impression about the free space distribution on the
          disk.

          If you use the /USAGE qualifier a sorted usage table
          will be added. Per Identifier / UIC the blocks
          used/allocated, and the number of file headers are
          shown. If Diskquota is enabled a third column will
          be included which shows the blocks used/permitted
          allowing to QUOTA.SYS. Normally quota should satisfy
          the following rule :

                            Quota used = blocks allocated + # of file headers

          ___________ __ ___________          /USAGE(=uic or identifier)          /USAGE(=uic or identifier)          /USAGE(=uic or identifier)
          The /USAGE qualifier will generate a diskspace usage
          report based on Identifiers/UIC. If diskquota is
          enabled on the disk the blocks used/permitted allowing
          to QUOTA.SYS will also be shown. /USAGE is very useful
          when diskquota is not enabled on the disk. When a UIC
          or identifier is specified only the information for
          this UIC or identifier will be displayed.

          This chapter describes the SEARCH command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   10.1   Introduction   10.1   Introduction   10.1   Introduction

          The search function allows very quick disk-wide
          searches for specific files. You can use almost any
          possible file attribute as a search qualifier.

          __________________________________________________________________

   10.2   Syntax and Output   10.2   Syntax and Output   10.2   Syntax and Output

          The command syntax for SEARCH is:

                           DFU> SEARCH device/qualifiers

          The output is displayed on your terminal. You can also
          sort the output with the /SORT qualifier. The output
          is shown in 2 or 3 columns eg:

                           DFU> SEARCH MYDISK/FILE=X.X/FRAGMENT
                            .
                            .
                           $1$DUA102:[USER.COMMAND]X.X;1             1/3               1/1
                            .
                            .

          The first column shows the full file name . The device
          name is included in the file name. The second columns
          shows the file size as actual/allocated size. The 3rd
          column is optional and will only be shown when the
          /FRAGMENT qualifier is used. It shows the number of
          fileheaders / number of file fragments.

                                                             10-1                                                             10-1                                                             10-1

   10.3   Volume Set processing   10.3   Volume Set processing   10.3   Volume Set processing

          SEARCH checks if the device to-be-searched is member
          of a volume set. If so, the complete volume set will
          be processed, starting with Relative Volume Number 1
          up to the last member in set. You can override this
          behaviour with the /NOVOLSET qualifier.

   10.4   Output formatting   10.4   Output formatting   10.4   Output formatting

          The qualifier /FORMAT can be used with SEARCH. This
          allows the build up of a command procedure directly
          from the output generated by the SEARCH command.
          /FORMAT has the following restrictions :

          1  /FORMAT is only valid with the /OUTPUT qualifier,
             and can not be used together with the /FULL or the
             /SORT qualifiers.

          2  The format string used must contain the !AS
             directive (in uppercase). The file found will be
             substituted at the !AS location

          Example:

                           DFU> SEARCH/OUTP=DEL.COM/FORMAT="$DELETE/CONF !AS"/FILE=*.LOG mydisk

   10.5   UIC and identifier processing   10.5   UIC and identifier processing   10.5   UIC and identifier processing

          Version V2.4 introduced an improved handling of UIC's.
          Previous versions of DFU only accepted a numeric UIC
          in the /OWNER qaulifier or an identifier in the /IDENT
          qualifier. V2.4 and later now accepts all valid UIC
          and identifier formats (numeric and alphanumeric) in
          the /OWNER and /IDENT qualifiers. Technically there is
          no longer any difference between these two qualifiers,
          but they will be left in for compatibility reasons.

          DESCRIPTION          DESCRIPTION          DESCRIPTION
          The SEARCH command is used for quick disk-wide
          searches for specific files. The qualifiers describe
          the file attributes used as the search criteria. You
          can combine almost all of the possible qualifiers,
          unless otherwise specified. Eg.:

                           DFU> SEARCH DISK1/SIZE=MIN=10/OWN=[1,4]/CREATED=SINCE=YESTERDAY

          is a valid command. Note that qualifiers will be used
          in a logical AND manner, that is, SEARCH will only
          display files which match all qualifiers and options
          specified.

          The /ACCESS qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their last ACCESS date (VMS 7.2 only).
          The possible options are :

          o  /ACCESS=BEFORE=date

                                                             10-3                                                             10-3                                                             10-3

          _______________          /ACE=identifier          /ACE=identifier          /ACE=identifier
          Search for files which have an ACE containing
          the specific identifier. Only ACE's of the format
          "IDENTIFIER=<identifier>,..." will be searched.

          __________          /ALLOCATED          /ALLOCATED          /ALLOCATED
          Default, SEARCH will use the actual file size.
          The /ALLOCATED qualifier forces SEARCH to use the
          allocated filesize. This qualifier is only meaningfull
          if you combine it with /SIZE.

          ________________          /APPEND=filename          /APPEND=filename          /APPEND=filename
          This qualifier redirects the output to be appended
          to an already existing file. If the output file does
          not exists it will be created. You can use /APPEND or
          /OUTPUT but not both.

          __________________________          /ATTRIBUTE=option(,option)          /ATTRIBUTE=option(,option)          /ATTRIBUTE=option(,option)
          The /ATTRIBUTE qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their last attribute change date (VMS
          7.2 only). The possible options are :

          o  /ATTRIBUTE=BEFORE=date

          o  /ATTRIBUTE=SINCE=date

          o  /ATTRIBUTE=NONE

          The /BACKUP qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their backup date. The possible options
          are :

          o  /BACKUP=BEFORE=date

          o  /BACKUP=SINCE=date

          o  /BACKUP=NONE

          The NONE option gives files which don't have a backup
          date recorded.The other 2 options can be used to
          get files which have a backup date before or after
          a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option can be
          combined in one command.

          ________________________          /BAKFID=backlink-file-id          /BAKFID=backlink-file-id          /BAKFID=backlink-file-id
          You can use this qualifier to look for a file with a
          specific backlink. Only the first part of the file id
          must be specified, that is, if the file id is (x,y,z)
          you must specify 'x' as the file id. You can use this
          qualifier to get files from a specific directory. If
          you use /BAKFID=0 you will get files not belonging to
          a directory (often temporary files).

          ________________________________          /CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)          /CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)          /CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)
          This qualifier is used to get files with specific
          file characteristics.The characteristics can have the
          following values:

          o  Directory : directory files

          o  Nobackup : files marked nobackup

          o  Contiguous : files marked as contiguous

          o  Erase : erase file before deletion

          o  Spool : spool files

          o  Badblock : files which contain suspected bad
             block(s)

          o  Badacl : files with a corrupted ACL

          o  Besttry : files marked contiguous-best-try

          o  Scratch : files marked as scratch files

          o  Nocharge : files not charged against quota

          o  Nomove : files marked NoMove

          o  Locked : files with the deaccess lock bit set

                                                             10-5                                                             10-5                                                             10-5

          o  Marked : files marked for deletion

          o  Noshelvable : files which can not be shelved

          o  Isshelved : files which are shelved

          The several characteristics can be combined in one
          command.If you want a logical OR behaviour in stead
          of the default AND behaviour, you can use the special
          option MATCH=OR eg:

                             SEARCH disk/CHAR=(NOMOVE,DIR,MATCH=OR)

          ________________________          /CREATED=option(,option)          /CREATED=option(,option)          /CREATED=option(,option)
          The /CREATED qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their creation date. The options are :

          o  /CREATED=BEFORE=date

          o  /CREATED=SINCE=date

          These 2 options can be used to get files which have
          a creation date before or after a specific date.
          The BEFORE and SINCE option can be combined in one
          command.

          _________________________          /EXCLUDE=(file1,file2...)          /EXCLUDE=(file1,file2...)          /EXCLUDE=(file1,file2...)
          This qualifier is used to exclude files from the
          search. You can use wildcard filenames ; you can also
          specifiy a list of files.

          ________________________          /EXPIRED=option(,option)          /EXPIRED=option(,option)          /EXPIRED=option(,option)
          The /EXPIRED qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their expiration date. The options are
          :

          o  /EXPIRED=BEFORE=date

          o  /EXPIRED=SINCE=date

          o  /EXPIRED=NONE

          The NONE option gives files which don't have a
          expiration date recorded.The other 2 options can be
          used to get files which have a expiration date before
          or after a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option
          can be combined in one command.

          ____________          /FID=file-id          /FID=file-id          /FID=file-id
          The /FID qualifier is a special function of SEARCH.
          It directs SEARCH to go directly to the specified
          file without processing the rest of the Index file.
          Therefore, you cannot combine this qualifierwith other
          search qualifiers such as /FILE. Normally a file-id
          consists is in the form (x,y,z) where x is the number
          of the file header within INDEXF.SYS y is the sequence
          number, and z is the Relative Volume Number. You only
          need to specifiy the x value in the /FID qualifier.

          ______________________          /FILE=(file1,file2...)          /FILE=(file1,file2...)          /FILE=(file1,file2...)
          This qualifier is used to search for files with a
          specific file name.You can use wildcard file names;
          also you can specify a list of files.

          _____________________          /FORMAT=format-string          /FORMAT=format-string          /FORMAT=format-string
          Create an output file in a format described by the
          format string. The string must contain the !AS
          directive (this must be uppercase). At the !AS
          location the resultant filename will be filled in.
          The /OUTPUT qualifier is required.

          _________________________________          /FRAGMENT=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr)          /FRAGMENT=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr)          /FRAGMENT=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr)
          This qualifier displays the number of fragments and
          file headers of each file found. You can further limit
          the files found by using the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM=
          options. For example:

                           DFU> disk/FRAG

          _____          /FULL          /FULL          /FULL
          If you use this qualifier, SEARCH will give a full
          output for each file found. This output is a look-
          alike of the output from DIRECTORY/FULL. You cannot
          combine this qualifier with /SORT or /SUMMARY.

          _____          /HOME          /HOME          /HOME
          This qualifier directs search to give output from
          the disk's home block. SEARCH uses the home block
          for calculating the free and used file headers within
          INDEXF.SYS.

          _____________________ __ ___          /(NO)IDENT=identifier or uic          /(NO)IDENT=identifier or uic          /(NO)IDENT=identifier or uic
          You can search for files owned by a specific
          identifier or UIC. Any valid UIC or identifier format
          may be used. Another way is the /OWNER_UIC qualifier;
          you cannot combine these 2 qualifiers in one SEARCH
          command. Issueing /NOIDENT directs DFU to search for
          files NOT owned by this IDENTIFIER, eg: DFU> SEARCH
          sys$sysdevice/NOIDENT=SYSTEM.

          _________________________          /LBN=logical-block-number          /LBN=logical-block-number          /LBN=logical-block-number
          The /LBN qualifier is a special function of SEARCH.
          This allows you to find a file which contains a
          specific LBN. This may be useful if you have bad
          blocks logged in the error log. You cannot combine
          /LBN with search qualifiers such as /FILE.

          ______________________________          /LIMIT=(MINIMUM=n,MAXAXIMUM=m)          /LIMIT=(MINIMUM=n,MAXAXIMUM=m)          /LIMIT=(MINIMUM=n,MAXAXIMUM=m)
          Searches DIRECTORY files which have a default version
          limit between n and m (including n and m). Either
          MINIMUM or MAXIMUM is required.

          __________________ __ __________          /(NO)OWNER_UIC=uic or identifier          /(NO)OWNER_UIC=uic or identifier          /(NO)OWNER_UIC=uic or identifier
          This qualifier is used to get files owned by a
          specific UIC or identifier. Any valid UIC or
          identifier format may be used. You cannot combine this
          qualifier with /IDENT. Specifying /NOOWNER directs
          DFU to search for files NOT owned by this UIC or
          identifier.

          _________________________          /MODIFIED=option(,option)          /MODIFIED=option(,option)          /MODIFIED=option(,option)
          The /MODIFIED qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their modification date. The options are
          :

          o  /MODIFIED=BEFORE=date

          o  /MODIFIED=SINCE=date

          These 2 options can be used to get files which have
          a modification date before or after a specific date.
          The BEFORE and SINCE option can be combined in one
          command.

          _________          /MULTIPLE          /MULTIPLE          /MULTIPLE
          This qualifier searches for files which have more than
          1 file header.

          _________          /NOSEARCH          /NOSEARCH          /NOSEARCH
          This qualifier can only be used in combination with
          /HOME. It is used to get the Homeblock info, without
          searching the entire disk.

          _________          /NOVOLSET          /NOVOLSET          /NOVOLSET
          The default behaviour of SEARCH is to process an
          entire volume set. You can override this behaviour
          with /NOVOLSET. This may be useful when doing a /LBN
          search.

          ____________          /OUTPUT=file          /OUTPUT=file          /OUTPUT=file
          This qualifier redirects the output from SEARCH to an
          output file.This file can later be used as input to
          the DEFRAG, DIRECTORY or SET command.

          _________________          /OVER_ALLOCATED=n          /OVER_ALLOCATED=n          /OVER_ALLOCATED=n
          Searches for files where the difference between the
          used and allocated size is at least 'n' blocks.

          _______          /PLACED          /PLACED          /PLACED
          Checks for files which have a placement control
          retrieval pointer.This is sometimes set by non-DEC
          disk defragmentation programs.

                                                             10-9                                                             10-9                                                             10-9

          The /SIZE qualifier is used to limit files found
          by their file size.You can either use minimum= or
          maximum= or use both options together. SEARCH will use
          the actual file size for selecting files, except when
          the /ALLOCATED qualifier is used.

          _____          /SORT          /SORT          /SORT
          This qualifier will sort the files found before
          being output. You can combine this with the /OUTPUT
          qualifier (the default output is SYS$OUTPUT).

          ___________          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS
          This qualifier displays the performance statistics:
          CPU time, Elapsed Time, I/O and PageFaults.

          ________          /SUMMARY          /SUMMARY          /SUMMARY
          This qualifier will limit the output to the total
          number of files found, with their size (and optional
          the fragmentation when /FRAG is used). You cannot
          combine /SUMMARY with /FULL.

          ____________          /TYPE=option          /TYPE=option          /TYPE=option
          The /TYPE qualifier has 2 options : /TYPE=ODS2 or
          /TYPE=ODS5. This qualifier can be used to search for
          files with either a ODS2 or an ODS5 file header. This
          qualifier is only usefull on ODS5 disk (VMS V7.2).

          _____________________________________          /VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=n,maximum=m)          /VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=n,maximum=m)          /VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=n,maximum=m)
          The /VERSION_NUMBER qualifier is used search for files
          within a range (n thru m) of file version numbers.
          Logfiles which are produced with the same name may
          pose problems when they reach the maximum version
          number (32767). Using /VERSION=MIN=32000 is a quick
          way to find such files.

   11.1   Introduction   11.1   Introduction   11.1   Introduction

          The SET command allows you to modify file attributes
          which can't be modified through DCL commands. Note
          that you should be careful about using this function;
          you may easily corrupt files. This much wanted
          functionality was introduced in VMS 6.0 with a new DCL
          command $SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES. Still DFU's SET has some
          options which are not in SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES (such as
          setting a BACKUP date).

          The new qualifier, /IGNORE=INTERLOCK, allows setting
          file attributes even on open or locked files.

          As of version V2.4 of DFU the /OWNER and /IDENT
          qualifier now accepts all valid UIC or identifier
          formats. See chapter 10.5 for details.

          The files to be modified. The attributes to be
          modified are specified with qualifiers. Wildcards area
          allowed in the filename. An indirect file can be used
          by using the @ sign. This allows processing of a file
          list produced by a DFU SEARCH command.

          Controls whether a request is issued before each
          individual SET operation to confirm that the operation
          should be performed on that file. When the system
          issues the prompt, you can issue any of the following
          responses:

                             YES      NO     QUIT

          You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase
          letters for word responses. Word responses can be
          abbreviated to one or more letters (for example, T,
          TR, or TRU for TRUE). Affirmative answers are YES,
          TRUE, and 1. Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and

          Sets or resets the directory attribute of a file.
          This qualifier allows you to set the directory bit
          of a file which was mistakingly reset by the 'SET
          FILE/NODIRECTORY' command. If it is done on a non-
          directory file, then access to that directory will
          give a 'BADIRECTORY' error.

          This qualifier will reset the end-of-file mark to
          the highest block allocated if no block has been
          specified. Otherwise the end-of-file mark will be set
          to the specified block.

          The following keywords are used as parameters for the
          ORGANIZATION qualifier: DIRECT, INDEXED, RELATIVE and
          SEQUENTIAL. This will allow you to modify the file
          organization type in the file header. Of course this
          won't change the real organization of the file.

          Modify the file ownership to an UIC or identifier.
          See also /IDENT. This allows modification of the file-
          ownership even if the file is open, eg. INDEXF.SYS.
          You cannot use both /IDENT and /OWNER_UIC.

          The following keywords are used as parameters for
          the RECATTRIBUTES qualifier: NONE, FORTRAN, IMPLIED,
          PRINT and NOSPAN. This will allow you to modify the
          file's record attributes in the file header. NONE,
          FORTRAN, IMPLIED and PRINT are mutually exclusive, but
          can be used in combination with NOSPAN. When NOSPAN
          is omitted SPAN is assumed (the default is to allow
          records to cross block boundaries).

   12     UNDELETE   12     UNDELETE   12     UNDELETE



          This chapter describes the UNDELETE command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   12.1   Introduction   12.1   Introduction   12.1   Introduction

          The UNDELETE function is designed to recover deleted
          files, if possible. UNDELETE operates in a safe mode
          such that it first checks if the deleted file header
          and diskblocks are still available. Only in that case
          will the file be recovered. Otherwise UNDELETE will
          leave the disk unmodified. UNDELETE has some powerfull
          options:

          o  Generate a list of recoverable files with the /LIST
             qualifier. This qualifier will not undelete any
             file, and therefore it does not lock up the disk.

          o  Undelete multiple files in one pass.

          o  Make file selections based on the owner with the
             /OWNER or /IDENT qualifier.

          o  Undeleted files which cannot be entered back in
             their original directory will be moved to the
             [SYSLOST] directory. This saves an additional
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR action.

   12.2   File specification syntax   12.2   File specification syntax   12.2   File specification syntax

          Because a deleted file no longer 'knows' its parent
          directory you must NOT enter a directory specification
          in the file name. Therefore , the syntax to undelete a
          specific file is :

                              DFU> UNDELETE <device:>/file=<filename.ext>

                            eg:

                              DFU> UNDELETE $1$DIA1:/file=FOO.BAR

          DFU will try to re-enter the file in its original
          directory; it that fails the file will be entered in
          the [SYSLOST] directory.

   12.3   How Undelete works   12.3   How Undelete works   12.3   How Undelete works

          The UNDELETE command operates as follows :

          1  Lock the volume. In the same manner as
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR and SET VOLUME /REBUILD Undelete
             locks the disk for other writers such that no
             modifications to the INDEXF, BITMAP or QUOTA file
             can be made.

          2  Search the INDEXF.SYS file if the requested file is
             still there. A check is made if it really is a valid
             deleted file header.

          3  Checks if the deleted file header and all possible
             extension headers are still valid.

          4  Checks if the blocks previously owned by this file
             are still free.

          5  If all these conditions are met DFU will display the
             file and asks for a confirmation.

          6  Rebuilds all of the deleted file headers and bitmaps
             in memory. If no errors are found all the file
             headers and bitmaps are written back to disk. The
             files original backlink is saved in a table in
             memory.

          7  If appropiate the blocks and headers are charged
             against diskquota.

          8  When all of INDEXF.SYS has been scanned the volume
             is unlocked.

          9  The file(s) is (are) entered in the original
             directory if possible, using the table build up in
             memory. If the enter command fails (probably because
             the original directory is gone) the file will be
             entered in [SYSLOST]. DFU will create this directory
             if needed.

          If the /LIST qualifier is used, DFU will just list the
          recoverable files without performing any action on the
          disk. The disk will not be locked.

          It is important to note that during the bitmap and
          file header processing any error will immediately
          terminate the recovery process, and unlock the disk.
          Files which have been recovered up to that point will
          still be entered in the appropiate directory. As no
          wrong information has been written back to the disk
          this should leave the disk in a proper state.

          NOTE: The blocks recovered will NOT be subtracted
          from the Volume's free block count. To get the
          actual freeblock count a SET VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE
          is necessary. Also a complete reMOUNT will reset the
          freeblock count.

          IMPORTANT: DFU takes care to recover only files whose
          original blocks are free. However these blocks may
          have been modified in the meantime by another file
          which also has been deleted. Therefore each recovered
          file must be checked manually to check its integrity.

          Normally DFU does not undelete files marked for
          delete. To recover files marked for delete you must
          use the /MARKED qualifier. This will specifically
          undelete files marked for delete. This allows the
          recovery of files which are deleted but still open,
          such as INSTALLed files, or even recovery of the
          system dump file SYSDUMP.DMP whenever such a file
          is accidentially deleted.

          This chapter describes the VERIFY command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   14.1   Introduction   14.1   Introduction   14.1   Introduction

          The VERIFY command makes an analysis of the disk,
          scanning for file and disk structure errors. VERIFY
          performs almost all of the checks normally done by
          a ANALYZE/DISK command. But VERIFY is several times
          faster than ANALYZE/DISK, and uses less resources.

          VERIFY checks and reports the following errors:

          o  Checks the logical information contained in the
             disk's HOME block

          o  Reports files marked for deletion

          o  Reports mismatches in the index file's bitmap

          o  Checks the VMS$COMMON.DIR backlink on system disks

          o  Checks all backlinks.

          o  Reports multiple allocated blocks

          o  Reports blocks incorrectly marked free and allocated

          o  Reports all lost files

          o  Checks for mismatches between blocks used and blocks
             charged in QUOTA.SYS. (Only done when diskquota is
             enabled)

                                                             14-1                                                             14-1                                                             14-1

   14.2   Basic repair actions   14.2   Basic repair actions   14.2   Basic repair actions

          The /FIX qualifier can be used to perform some basic
          repair actions. Unlike ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR this does
          not lock the disk! /FIX repairs the following errors:

          o  Deletes file marked for delete (if possible).

          o  Recovers lost files and directories into [SYSLOST].

          o  Recovers a very rare problem which will get
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR into a computable loop (This
             problem is fixed in VMS V6.2 or with the VERI02_061
             patch kit).

          o  Recovers a corrupted backlink for the Master File
             Directory 000000.DIR.

          o  Recovers a wrong backlink for VMS$COMMON.DIR files
             on the system disk

   14.3   Advanced repair actions   14.3   Advanced repair actions   14.3   Advanced repair actions

          The /REBUILD qualifier can be used to perform some
          more repair actions. This will however lock the disk
          (like a DCL $SET VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE command) for a
          short period of time (usually less than 30 seconds).
          /REBUILD repairs the following errors :

          o  Mismatches in the INDEXF.SYS bitmap (files reported
             with the NOBITSET and NOBITCLR errors)

          o  Blocks incorrectly marked allocated or free in the
             BITMAP.SYS.

          o  Mismatches in the diskquota file.

          Note that /REBUILD does NOT change the disk's free
          block count.

   14.4   Directory scanning   14.4   Directory scanning   14.4   Directory scanning

          The /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier will force DFU to
          also verify and repair (when using /FIX) directory
          problems. This qualifier directs DFU to scan all
          directories on the disk. This has some advantages :

          o  Better detection of some cases of 'lost' files.
             Combined with the /FIX qualifier DFU may be able
             to recover such files into the correct directory
             instead of moving such files to [SYSLOST].

          o  Detects and fixes file-id mismatches between
             directories and the INDEXF.SYS file.

          o  Using the /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier makes DFU fully
             compatible with ANALYZE/DISK.

          Please note that a complete directory scan may take
          several minutes to complete.

   14.5   Interpreting errors   14.5   Interpreting errors   14.5   Interpreting errors

          On a system (cluster) wide mounted disk there will
          probably be concurrent disk activity during the VERIFY
          command. Therefore VERIFY may report some errors which
          are not really errors. Try running VERIFY 2 or 3 times
          to see if the errors are reported again. To get a
          really consistent report from VERIFY you can use the
          /LOCK qualifier. This will write-lock the disk during
          the VERIFY run, so don't use this qualifier too often.
          (The /REPAIR qualifier of ANALYZE/DISK also write-
          locks the disk). Even if DFU ends ungracefully the DFU
          exit handler will always UNLOCK the disk.
