<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>DELETE device[:] or directory-file(s) </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>device</h3>
The device on which to perform the DELETE/FILE=file-id command.
<h3>directory-file(s)</h3>
The filespecification of the directory on which to perform the 
DELETE/DIRECTORY command. Wildcard file specifications may be used. DFU 
will automatically add .DIR to the filespecification if a filetype is 
not provided.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/DIRECTORY</h3>
Specify the directory file which must be deleted. Wildcards may be used 
but must be used very carefully. Make sure that the directory does not 
contain non-empty subdirectories. Note that the directory file itself 
will also be deleted, unless the /KEEP qualifier is used.

<p>
Example:

<pre>
$ DIR EXAMPLE 
 
Directory MYDISK:[RUBBISH] 
 
EXAMPLE.DIR;1 
 
$ DFU 
DFU&gt; DELETE/DIRECTORY EXAMPLE.DIR 
 
%DFU-I-CLEANUP, Deleting MYDISK:[RUBBISH]EXAMPLE.DIR;1... 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File DBGINI.COM;3 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File ICON.COM;1 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File I_FOOL.COM;1 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File LOGICALS.COM;51 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File LOGIN.COM;79 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File LOGOUT.COM;4 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File NOTE_COMPRESS.COM;3 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File SHOWCL.COM;3 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File SYMBOLS.COM;89 deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File TPUBUILD.COM;5 deleted 
%DFU-S-TOTAL, 11 file(s) deleted 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File EXAMPLE.DIR;1 deleted 
</pre>

<p>
<h3>/FILE=file-id</h3>
Specify a complete file-id (num,seq,rvn) of the file which must be 
deleted. This qualifier allows the deletion of lost files or files 
marked for delete. Example :

<pre>
$ DFU 
DFU&gt; VERIFY MYDISK: 
 
%DFU-S-CHKHOME, Home block info verified OK 
%DFU-I-IFSCAN, Scanning INDEXF.SYS... 
%DFU-E-INVBAKFID, file (86,17915,1) 0004CF04$BFS.;1 has invalid backlink 
%DFU-W-DELETED, file (537,2878,1) APPL_UTRYIT_BOOK.TMP;1 marked for delete 
 . 
 . 
 . 
 
DFU&gt; DELETE MYDISK/FILE=(86,17915,1) 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File 0004CF04$BFS.;1 deleted 
 
DFU&gt; DELETE MYDISK/FILE=(537,2878,1) 
%DFU-S-DELETED, File APPL_UTRYIT_BOOK.TMP;1 deleted 
 
</pre>

<p>
<h3>/KEEP</h3>
Preserve the directory tree; only delete the contents. /KEEP is only 
valid with the /DIRECTORY qualifier. /KEEP works for DELETE/DIR and 
DELETE/DIR/TREE.
<h3>/NOLOG</h3>
Do not log succesfull deletes to SYS$OUTPUT. /LOG is the default.
<h3>/NOREMOVE</h3>
Can only be used with /FILE. Default DELETE/FILE will try to remove the 
file from the parent directory. If the file's backlink no longer points 
to a valid directory this will generate an error. The /NOREMOVE 
qualifier overrules this behaviour allowing such files to be deleted.
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3>
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed 
Time, I/O and PageFaults.
<h3>/TREE</h3>
Can only be used with /DIRECTORY. The delete command will delete all 
subdirectories within the directory file specified. DFU will first sort 
out the subdirectory tree and than delete the files in the proper 
order. Thus a complete directory tree is deleted with one command.

<a name="chapter_8"><h1>Chapter 8<br>DIRECTORY</h1></a>

<p>
This chapter describes the DIRECTORY command with the related 
parameters and qualifiers.
<a name="hd7_1"></a>

<a name="heading_8.1"><h1>8.1 Introduction</h1></a>

<p>
The DIRECTORY command offers 7 major functions. 3 functions deal with 
all directories on a disk, the other 4 functions are used for 
manipulating individual directories. These functions are activated by 
special qualifiers:

<ul>
  <li>Individual directory functions :

  <ol start=1 >
    <li>/COMPRESS : Rebuild one or more directory files. Directories are 
    alphabetically sorted lists of filenames and file id's. Because file 
    names are randomly inserted and deleted, holes will occur in directory 
    files. Such holes will only be reused if a file can be alphabetically 
    fitted into it. As a result directory files will grow. Especially MAIL 
    subdirectories suffer from this behaviour. <br>To make matters worse 
    directory files above 127 blocks will no longer be cached by the file 
    system. This will degrade performance on such directories dramatically. 
    The COMPRESS function will rebuild the complete directory file. The 
    /TEST qualifier can be used to preview the results of a possible 
    COMPRESS command.
    <li>/CREATE/ALLOCATE=n : Create a directory with a preallocated size of 
    'n' blocks. Note that 'n' will be rounded up to a multiple of the 
    disk's cluster size. (This feature is also available on VMS 7.1/2 with 
    the DCL command CREATE/DIR/ALLOC=n).
    <li>/DUMP : Make a dump of the directory blocks and formats the output. 
    This option is useful for debugging directory files which are suspected 
    or corrupted. This function is equivalent to the previously 
    undocumented VMS command DUMP/DIRECTORY, although the layout of the 
    output is different.
    <li>/RECOVER : Completely rebuild a directory. This option should only 
    be used to recover corrupted directories. During the recovery procedure 
    the directory will be inaccesible for some time. Therefore this command 
    should NEVER be used on critical system directories. (DFU refuses this 
    command on directory names containing the string 'SYS' to avoid 
    accidental usage).
  </ol>
    <br>
  <li>Disk-wide directory functions :

  <ol start=1 >
    <li>/ALIAS : Scan all directories on the disk for alias file entries.
    <li>/EMPTY : Scan the disk for empty directories
    <li>/VERSION=n : Scan all directories on the disk for files which have 
    at least 'n' versions.
  </ol>
    <br>
</ol>

<p>
The diskwide function qualifiers can be used in one command; other 
combinations of qualifiers are not possible. Note that the diskwide 
directory functions can take several minutes to complete because a 
complete directory scan uses a lot of disk I/O (approximately 2 I/O's 
per directory).

<p>
An indirect command file containing a list of files can be used as a 
parameter to /COMPRESS or /DUMP. Such a list can be generated with the 
SEARCH command. Example:

<pre>
DFU&gt; SEARCH disk/FILE=*.DIR/SIZE=MIN=50/OUT=x.x 
DFU&gt; DIRECTORY/COMPRESS @x.x 
</pre>

<p>
Caution: Care should be taken when compressing critical system 
directories. To be safe you should first use the /TEST qualifier before 
compressing the directory. Another problem may be caused by a 
systemcrash just when DFU is rewriting the new compressed directory 
(although the chance that this happens is very small). When this 
happens you can recover the files by executing the following procedure:

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Do a $SET FILE/NODIR of the corrupted directory
  <li>Delete the directory and create a new one
  <li>Do a $ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR ; this will move all the lost files to 
  [SYSLOST].
  <li>Move the files from [SYSLOST] to the newly created directory.
</ol>

<p>
<a name="hd7_2"></a>

<a name="heading_8.2"><h1>8.2 Discussion of directory compression</h1></a>
The DIRECTORY/COMPRESS function will improve performance on large 
directories. There are some options which can further enhance 
performance :

<ul>
  <li>/TRUNCATE: When a directory is compressed , the free space will be 
  at the end of the directory. Therefore , if new files are added VMS is 
  capable of using this space, and avoid a directory entension. The 
  /TRUNCATE qualifier overrules this behaviour by immediately truncating 
  the free space back to the disk.
  <li>/FILL_FACTOR: Normally DFU tries to compress as much as possible. 
  However, it may be better to deliberately create extra free space into 
  each directory block. This can be done using the /FILL_FACTOR=n 
  qualifier. Eg: a fill factor of 50% will result in approximately half 
  of each block being free. Note that a fill_factor lower tha 100% may 
  result in an error DFU-E_EXTERR; in that case a higher factor must be 
  choosen.
</ul>

<p>
So, what strategy should be used when compressing directories?

<ol start=1 >
  <li>Inactive directories : use DIR/COMPRESS/TRUNCATE.
  <li>Not very active directories : use DIR/COMPRESS (/TRUNCATE=n).
  <li>Active directories, files added at the end (such as MAIL 
  directories) : use DIR/COMPRESS without /TRUNCATE
  <li>Active directories, files added in random alphabetical order : use 
  DIR/COMPRESS/FILL_FACTOR=n, n between 50 and 75.
</ol>

<p>
<a name="hd7_3"></a>

<a name="heading_8.3"><h1>8.3 Output formatting</h1></a>
The qualifier /FORMAT can be used with DIRECTORY/VERSION. This allows 
the build up of a command procedure directly from the output generated 
by the DIR/VERSION command. /FORMAT has the following restrictions :

<ol start=1 >
  <li>/FORMAT is only valid with the /VERSION and the /OUTPUT qualifier.
  <li>The format string used must contain the !AS directive (in 
  uppercase). The file found will be substituted at the !AS location
</ol>

<p>
Example:

<pre>
DFU&gt; DIR/VERSION=4/OUTPUT=PURGE.COM/FORMAT="$PURGE/KEEP=3 !AS" mydisk 
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>DIRECTORY device[:] or directory-file(s) </h3>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>device</h3>
The device on which to perform one of the diskwide directory functions.
<h3>directory-files(s)</h3>
The file specification of the directory on which to perform the 
/CREATE, /COMPRESS, /DUMP or /RECOVER function. Wildcard file 
specifications may be used. DFU will automatically add .DIR to the 
filespecification if a filetype is not provided.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ALIAS</h3>
The /ALIAS qualifier directs DFU to scan all directories for alias file 
entries on a disk. Normally only the system disk should contain alias 
files. This qualifier can be combined with /VERSION=n and /EMPTY.
<h3>/ALLOCATE=n</h3>
Used in combination with /CREATE. Creates the new directory with an 
allocated size of 'n' blocks.
<h3>/COMPRESS</h3>
Performs the directory compression unless /TEST is also specified. The 
output will show the results in terms of file sizes. Example:

<pre>
DFU&gt; DIR/COMP OWN$:[000000]MAIL 
 
%DFU-S-DONE, OWN$:[000000]MAIL.DIR;1: 31 files; was : 4/9, now : 3/3 blocks 
 
DFU&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
<h3>/CREATE</h3>
Create a new, empty directory. The allocated size will be 1 cluster 
unless /ALLOCATE is specified.
<h3>/DEVICE</h3>
The device on which the files reside. The device name is added to the 
file name. If you generate a file list with the DFU SEARCH command you 
don't need this qualifier. However you may have a list of files 
produced from another source and thus need to append a device name to 
it. This qualifier can only be used in combination with /COMPRESS or 
/DUMP.
<h3>/DUMP</h3>
Produce a block level dump of a directory. /DUMP will interpret the 
directory entries found in each block. A directory entry contains a 
size, version-limit, type and name field. Next the directory entry 
contains a list of versions and file ID's for this entry. /DUMP will 
produce a rather low level output of this information. Example :

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
<h3>/EMPTY</h3>
The /EMPTY qualifier will produce a list of empty directories. This 
qualifier can be combined with /ALIAS and /VERSION=n.
<h3>/FILL_FACTOR=n</h3>
Specifies ,in percentage, the filling of directory blocks during a 
/COMPRESS operation. Fill factor may be between 50 and 100. Omitting 
this qualifier is the same as /FILL_FACTOR=100 (maximum compression). 
If the directory has not enough allocated space a low fill factor may 
result in failure of the Compress operation. DFU will issue a 
DFU-E-EXTERR error, and the directory file will not be modified.
<h3>/FORMAT=format-string</h3>
Create an output file in a format described by the format string. The 
string must contain the !AS directive (this must be uppercase). At the 
!AS location the resultant filename will be filled in. The /OUTPUT 
qualifier is required.
<h3>/OUTPUT=filename</h3>
This qualifier redirects the output to a file. The output will also go 
to SYS$OUTPUT.
<h3>/RECOVER</h3>
This qualifier rebuilds a corrupted directory. Do not use this command 
on critical or active directories.
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3>
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed 
Time, I/O and PageFaults.
<h3>/TEST</h3>
The /TEST can only be used in conjunction with /COMPRESS. The qualifier 
will show the results of the /COMPRESS but will not compress the 
directory file.
<h3>/TRUNCATE=blocksize</h3>
During a compress operation truncate the directory back to the 
blocksize specified. If blocksize is not specified, the file will be 
truncated back to the end-of-file block number. Truncation will always 
be rounded up to the next highest multiple of the disk's cluster size.
<h3>/VERSION=n</h3>
The /VERSION qualifier directs DFU to scan all directories on the 
device to produce a list of files which have at least 'n' versions. 
This qualifier can be combined with /ALIAS and /EMPTY.

<a name="chapter_9"><h1>Chapter 9<br>REPORT</h1></a>

<p>
This chapter describes the REPORT command with the related parameters 
and qualifiers.
<a name="hd8_1"></a>

<a name="heading_9.1"><h1>9.1 Description</h1></a>

<p>
The REPORT command function generates a report of the file and free 
space fragmentation of the disk. Also a graph may be generated by the 
/GRAPH qualifier; this visualises the free space distribution on your 
disk. The /USAGE qualifier will generate a diskspace usage report. This 
is especially useful if DISKQUOTA is not enabled on the disk.

<p>
The default report contains information of the Volume, files and the 
bitmap. This output can be suppressed by the /NOVOLUME, NOFILE and 
NOBITMAP qualifiers. Also the /USAGE qualifier can be used by 
displaying information of a specific UIC or Identifier simply by 
specifying /USAGE=&lt;uic&gt; or /USAGE=&lt;identifier&gt;.
<a name="hd8_2"></a>

<a name="heading_9.2"><h1>9.2 Syntax and Output</h1></a>

The various items have the following meaning :

<ol start=1 >
  <li>The header count is calculated based on the size of INDEXF.SYS. If 
  more headers are needed INDEXF.SYS has to be extended.
  <li>The free headers gives the number of free entries in INDEXF.SYS 
  before it has to extend.
  <li>The INDEXF.SYS number of fragments and mapwords in use are very 
  important figures to determine if the INDEXF.SYS file can be extended. 
  The theoretical maximum number of mapwords is 155. This value may be 
  less if there are ACL's on INDEXF.SYS. Each fragment, and therefore 
  each retrieval pointer must be in the mapword area. As the size of a 
  retrieval pointer depends on the physical size of a disk, it is not 
  easy to say how many fragments INDEXF.SYS can store in the mapwords 
  area. If the mapword area is full the INDEXF file can no longer extend, 
  and creating new files may result in a SYSTEM-W-HEADERFULL error.
  <li>Files which have exactly 1 retrieval pointer are considered to be 
  contiguous. This doesn't mean that the CONTIGUOUS bit is set in the 
  file header.
  <li>The average fragments per file give some indication about the total 
  file fragmentation.
  <li>The file and free space fragmentation index classifies your disk as 
  follows :

  <ul>
    <li> 0-1 : Excellent
    <li> 1-2 : Good
    <li> 2-3 : Fair
    <li> 3-4 : Poor
    <li> &gt;4 : Bad
  </ul>
    <br>If your index is greater than 3 you should consider defragmenting 
    the disk using Digitals DFO software, by performing an Image BACKUP / 
    Restore, or of course by using DFU's DEFRAG/DISK command.
  <li>The largest free extent is a useful figure for defragmentation 
  purposes. You cannot defragment a file when its size is greater than 
  this value.
</ul>

<p>
When using /GRAPH the disk's free space distribution is shown as a 
bitmap image. Each position in the graph represents a certain number of 
blocks (in the example above 3472 blocks). This bitmap image gives a 
quick impression about the free space distribution on the disk.

<p>
If you use the /USAGE qualifier a sorted usage table will be added. Per 
Identifier / UIC the blocks used/allocated, and the number of file 
headers are shown. If Diskquota is enabled a third column will be 
included which shows the blocks used/permitted allowing to QUOTA.SYS. 
Normally quota should satisfy the following rule :

<pre>
 Quota used = blocks allocated + # of file headers 
</pre>

<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/APPEND=filename</h3>
This qualifier redirects the output to be appended to an already 
existing file. If the output file does not exists it will be created. 
You can use /APPEND or /OUTPUT but not both.
<h3>/GRAPH</h3>
This qualifier generates a graph table which visualizes the free space 
distribution on the disk. /NOGRAPH is the default.
<h3>/NOBITMAP</h3>
The /NOBITMAP qualifier suppresses the "Free space statistics" output.
<h3>/NOFILE</h3>
The /NOFILE qualifier suppressed the "File Statistics" output.
<h3>/NOVOLUME</h3>
The /NOVOLUME qualifier suppresses the "Volume info" output.
<h3>/OUTPUT=filename</h3>
This qualifier redirects the output to a file. The output will also go 
to SYS$OUTPUT.
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3>
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed 
Time, I/O and PageFaults.
<h3>/USAGE(=uic or identifier)</h3>
The /USAGE qualifier will generate a diskspace usage report based on 
Identifiers/UIC. If diskquota is enabled on the disk the blocks 
used/permitted allowing to QUOTA.SYS will also be shown. /USAGE is very 
useful when diskquota is not enabled on the disk. When a UIC or 
identifier is specified only the information for this UIC or identifier 
will be displayed.

<a name="chapter_10"><h1>Chapter 10<br>SEARCH</h1></a>

<p>
This chapter describes the SEARCH command with the related parameters 
and qualifiers.
<a name="hd9_1"></a>

<a name="heading_10.1"><h1>10.1 Introduction</h1></a>

<p>
The search function allows very quick disk-wide searches for specific 
files. You can use almost any possible file attribute as a search 
qualifier.
<a name="hd9_2"></a>

<a name="heading_10.2"><h1>10.2 Syntax and Output</h1></a>

<p>
The command syntax for SEARCH is:

<pre>
DFU&gt; SEARCH device/qualifiers 
</pre>

<p>
The output is displayed on your terminal. You can also sort the output 
with the /SORT qualifier. The output is shown in 2 or 3 columns eg:

<pre>
DFU&gt; SEARCH MYDISK/FILE=X.X/FRAGMENT 
 . 
 . 
$1$DUA102:[USER.COMMAND]X.X;1             1/3               1/1 
 . 
 . 
</pre>

<p>
The first column shows the full file name . The device name is included 
in the file name. The second columns shows the file size as 
actual/allocated size. The 3rd column is optional and will only be 
shown when the /FRAGMENT qualifier is used. It shows the number of 
fileheaders / number of file fragments.
<a name="hd9_3"></a>

<a name="heading_10.3"><h1>10.3 Volume Set processing</h1></a>

<p>
SEARCH checks if the device to-be-searched is member of a volume set. 
If so, the complete volume set will be processed, starting with 
Relative Volume Number 1 up to the last member in set. You can override 
this behaviour with the /NOVOLSET qualifier.
<a name="hd9_4"></a>

<a name="heading_10.4"><h1>10.4 Output formatting</h1></a>

<p>
The qualifier /FORMAT can be used with SEARCH. This allows the build up 
of a command procedure directly from the output generated by the SEARCH 
command. /FORMAT has the following restrictions :

<ol start=1 >
  <li>/FORMAT is only valid with the /OUTPUT qualifier, and can not be 
  used together with the /FULL or the /SORT qualifiers.
  <li>The format string used must contain the !AS directive (in 
  uppercase). The file found will be substituted at the !AS location
</ol>

<p>
Example:

<pre>
DFU&gt; SEARCH/OUTP=DEL.COM/FORMAT="$DELETE/CONF !AS"/FILE=*.LOG mydisk 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="hd9_5"></a>

<a name="heading_10.5"><h1>10.5 UIC and identifier processing</h1></a>
Version V2.4 introduced an improved handling of UIC's. Previous 
versions of DFU only accepted a numeric UIC in the /OWNER qaulifier or 
an identifier in the /IDENT qualifier. V2.4 and later now accepts all 
valid UIC and identifier formats (numeric and alphanumeric) in the 
/OWNER and /IDENT qualifiers. Technically there is no longer any 
difference between these two qualifiers, but they will be left in for 
compatibility reasons.

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
The SEARCH command is used for quick disk-wide searches for specific 
files. The qualifiers describe the file attributes used as the search 
criteria. You can combine almost all of the possible qualifiers, unless 
otherwise specified. Eg.:

<pre>
DFU&gt; SEARCH DISK1/SIZE=MIN=10/OWN=[1,4]/CREATED=SINCE=YESTERDAY 
</pre>

<p>
is a valid command. Note that qualifiers will be used in a logical AND 
manner, that is, SEARCH will only display files which match all 
qualifiers and options specified.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>/ACCESS=option(,option)</h3>
The /ACCESS qualifier is used to search files depending on their last 
ACCESS date (VMS 7.2 only). The possible options are :

<ul>
  <li>/ACCESS=BEFORE=date
  <li>/ACCESS=SINCE=date
  <li>/ACCESS=NONE
</ul>

<p>
<h3>/ACE=identifier</h3>
Search for files which have an ACE containing the specific identifier. 
Only ACE's of the format "IDENTIFIER=&lt;identifier&gt;,..." will be 
searched.
<h3>/ALLOCATED</h3>
Default, SEARCH will use the actual file size. The /ALLOCATED qualifier 
forces SEARCH to use the allocated filesize. This qualifier is only 
meaningfull if you combine it with /SIZE.
<h3>/APPEND=filename</h3>
This qualifier redirects the output to be appended to an already 
existing file. If the output file does not exists it will be created. 
You can use /APPEND or /OUTPUT but not both.
<h3>/ATTRIBUTE=option(,option)</h3>
The /ATTRIBUTE qualifier is used to search files depending on their 
last attribute change date (VMS 7.2 only). The possible options are :

<ul>
  <li>/ATTRIBUTE=BEFORE=date
  <li>/ATTRIBUTE=SINCE=date
  <li>/ATTRIBUTE=NONE
</ul>

<p>
<h3>/BACKUP=option(,option)</h3>
The /BACKUP qualifier is used to search files depending on their backup 
date. The possible options are :

<ul>
  <li>/BACKUP=BEFORE=date
  <li>/BACKUP=SINCE=date
  <li>/BACKUP=NONE
</ul>

<p>
The NONE option gives files which don't have a backup date recorded.The 
other 2 options can be used to get files which have a backup date 
before or after a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option can be 
combined in one command.
<h3>/BAKFID=backlink-file-id</h3>
You can use this qualifier to look for a file with a specific backlink. 
Only the first part of the file id must be specified, that is, if the 
file id is (x,y,z) you must specify 'x' as the file id. You can use 
this qualifier to get files from a specific directory. If you use 
/BAKFID=0 you will get files not belonging to a directory (often 
temporary files).
<h3>/CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)</h3>
This qualifier is used to get files with specific file 
characteristics.The characteristics can have the following values:

<ul>
  <li>Directory : directory files
  <li>Nobackup : files marked nobackup
  <li>Contiguous : files marked as contiguous
  <li>Erase : erase file before deletion
  <li>Spool : spool files
  <li>Badblock : files which contain suspected bad block(s)
  <li>Badacl : files with a corrupted ACL
  <li>Besttry : files marked contiguous-best-try
  <li>Scratch : files marked as scratch files
  <li>Nocharge : files not charged against quota
  <li>Nomove : files marked NoMove
  <li>Locked : files with the deaccess lock bit set
  <li>Marked : files marked for deletion
  <li>Noshelvable : files which can not be shelved
  <li>Isshelved : files which are shelved
</ul>
