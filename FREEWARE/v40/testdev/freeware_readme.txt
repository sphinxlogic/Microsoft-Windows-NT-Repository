TESTDEV, UTILITIES, (VAX & Alpha) Disk exerciser and read-performance measurer

 TestDev issues a specified number of read IO's to a disk and computes the
 average data access time and related statistics of the collected sample.
 It can be used to check the operation and performance of block-oriented
 IO caching products or as a benchmark between different physical devices.

 The main features are:

 o  Ability to perform random or sequential access scans.

 o  Ability to select logical or physical seek ranges.

 o  Ability to perform parallel (multi-threaded) IO's.
