Due to the package's size it is shipped as a ZIP archive.  As a result no demo
is directly available.  Check FREEWARE_README.TXT for details on simple access
to part of the package's documentation.  Once built the package provides a
simple demonstration procedure.

The Technical Overview includes detail at various levels on how to install the
package. Installation is basically a three step process.

    1. Restore the archive.

       $ SET DEFAULT device:[000000]
       $ UNZIP "-V" cd:[HTTPD_WASD]HTROOT52.ZIP

    2. Install the package.

       $ SET DEFAULT device:[HT_ROOT]
       $ @INSTALL

    3. Customize the package to suit your site's exact requirements.
