<H3>Please Note</H3>

<P>
 As of July 1997 High Frequency Radar Division (HFRD) underwent a change of
role and name.  It is now Wide Area Surveillance Division (WASD).  This package
has been renamed in accordance with that.

 This document is a technical overview of the implementation of the WASD
VMS HyperText Transport Daemon. It contains information on server startup,
configuration and CGI scripting. Previous versions contained brief
descriptions of the major code modules of the server, these have now been
removed to a document of their own (see below).

<P>
