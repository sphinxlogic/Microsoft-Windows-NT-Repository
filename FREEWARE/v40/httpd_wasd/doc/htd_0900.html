<H1>9 - Authentication and Authorization</H1>
</A>

<P>
 <B>Authentication</B> is the verification of a user's identity,
usually through a username/password combination.
<B>Authorization</B> is allowing a certain action to be applied to a
particular path based on authentication of the originator.

<P>
 Generally, authorization is a two step process. First authentication,
using a username/password database. Second authorization, determining what
the username is allowed to do for this transaction.

<P>
 Authentication environments can get complex very quickly, don't forget to
&quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot;, see <A HREF="htd_0900.html#114" TARGET="_self">9.3.1 - KISS</A>.

<A NAME="104">
<H3>Overview</H3>
</A>

<P>
 Server authorization is performed using a configuration file,
authentication database and optional authorization grouping database, and is
based on per-path directives. There is no user-configured authorization
necessary, or possible! In the configuration file paths are associated with the
authentication and authorization environments, and so become subject to the
HTTPd authorization mechanism. Reiterating ... WASD HTTPd authorization
administration involves those two aspects, setting authorization against paths
and administering the authentication and authorization databases.

<P>
 <B>AUTHORIZATION IS ALWAYS APPLIED TO THE PATH SUPPLIED WITH THE
REQUEST, not to the results of any rule mapping that may have occured!</B>
This means authorization paths may be administered without ambiguity. With
requests containing a script, authorization is performed on
<B>both</B> script and path components. First script access is
checked for any authorization, then the path component is independently
authorized. Either may result in an authorization challenge/failure.

<P>
 For the WASD HTTPd user authentication can be done via the server system's
<B>SYSUAF database</B>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">
(not recommended except when employing SSL or in the most secure of LAN
environments)
</FONT>,
 
see <A HREF="htd_0900.html#120" TARGET="_self">9.6 - SYSUAF-Authenticated Users</A> for further information.

<P>
 The <B>authentication database</B> name can be refered to as the
<I>realm</I>, and refers to a collection of username/passwords.  It can be
the system's SYSUAF database.

<P>
 The <B>authorization database</B> can be refered to as the
<I>group</I>, and refers to a collection of usernames and associated
<I>permissions</I>.

<P>
 Separate databases are not always necessary, permission information can be
stored in the same database as the password information. Paths are generally
authorized on a per-group basis. Path access can be also be restricted on an
internet host name/domain, internet address and/or authenticated username
basis. If only a small number of usernames are to be associated with a path it
is possible to list them all against the path and have permissions derived
directly from the authentication database (realm).

<A NAME="105">
<H3>Authentication Policy</H3>
</A>

<P>
 A <I>policy</I> regarding when authorization can be used may be
established for the server. This can restrict authentication challenges to 
&quot;https:&quot; (SSL) requests (see <A HREF="htd_1000.html#127" TARGET="_self">10 - Secure Sockets Layer</A>), thereby ensuring
that the authorization environment is not compromised by use in non-encrypted
transactions. Two HTTPd qualifiers provide this.
<UL>
<LI> <B>/AUTHORIZATION=SSL </B> restricts <B>all</B>
authentication/authorization transactions to the SSL environment.
<P>
<LI> <B>/SYSUAF=SSL </B> restricts only SYSUAF authenticated
transactions to the SSL environment.
</UL>

<P>
 Note also that individual paths may be restricted to SSL requests using
either the mapping conditional rule configuration or the authorization
configuration files. See <A HREF="htd_0800.html#100" TARGET="_self">Conditionals</A> and
<A HREF="htd_0900.html#112" TARGET="_self">Access Restriction List</A>.

<P>
 In addition two configuration parameters have a direct role in an
established authorization policy.
<UL>
<LI> <B>[AuthFailureLimit] </B> sets the maximum unsuccessful attempts
allowed before a username is then always refused authentication.  After this
limit is reached the cache must be purged to re-allow the user access, see
<A HREF="htd_0500.html#58" TARGET="_self">5.3.2.2 - Authentication</A>.
<P>
<LI> <B>[AuthRevalidateUserMinutes] </B> sets the number of minutes
between successive authentication attempts before the user is forced to reenter
the authentication data (via a browser dialog).  Zero disables this function.
</UL>

<A NAME="106">
<H3>Authentication Failures</H3>
</A>

<P>
 Details of authentication failures are logged to the HTTPd process log. 
<UL>
<LI> <B>%HTTPD-W-AUTHFAIL </B> indicates a failure to authenticate
(incorrect username/password).  The number of failures, the realm name, the
user name and the originating host are provided. Isolated instances of this are
only of moderate interest.  Consecutive instances may indicate a user thrashing
about for the correct password, but they usually give up before a dozen
attempts.
<P>
<LI> <B>%HTTPD-I-AUTHFAILOK </B> advises that a previous failure to
authenticate has now successfully done so.  This is essentially informational.
<P>
<LI> <B>%HTTPD-W-AUTHFAILIM </B> indicates the number of failures
have exceeded the [AuthFailureLimit], after which automatic refusal begins. 
This message should be of concern and the circumstances investigated,
especially if the number of attempts becomes excessive.
</UL>

<A NAME="107">
<H3>Authorization Scheme</H3>
</A>

<P>
 The term <I>authorization scheme</I> refers to the HTTP method of
authenticating the user.  The WASD HTTPd can employ one or other, or both
of the &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Digest&quot; schemes.  Both schemes use a
username/password mechanism, with Digest being preferable because the password
is transmitted encrypted, and with Basic only encoded (and therefore easily
readable).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>- NOTE -</B></CENTER><BR>
The Digest scheme has, to date, only been tested against NCSA X Mosaic 2.7-4b,
which seems to behave a little <I>flakey</I> when reloading documents, and
does not elegantly support stale nonces.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="108">
<H2><BR><U>9.1 - Permissions, Path and User</U></H2>
</A>

<P>
 <B>Both paths and usernames have permissions associated with
them.</B> A path may be specified as read-only, read and write, or
write-only (yes, I'm sure someone will want this!) A username may be
specified as read capable, read and write capable, or only write capable.  For
each transaction these two are combined to determine the maximum level of
access allowed. The allowed action is the logical AND of the path and username
permissions.

<P>
 The permissions may be described using the HTTP method names, or using the
more concise abbreviations R, W, and R+W.

<A NAME="109">
<H2><BR><U>9.2 - Authorization Configuration File</U></H2>
</A>

<P>
 Requiring a particular path to be authorized in the HTTP transaction is
accomplished by applying authorization requirements against that path in a
configuration file.  This is an activity distinct from setting up and
maintaining any authentication/authorization databases required for the
environment.

<P>
 By default, the system-table logical name HTTPD$AUTH locates a common
authorization configuration file, unless an individual rule file is specified
using a job-table logical name. Simple editing of the file changes the
configuration. Comment lines may be included by prefixing them with the hash
&quot;#&quot; character, and lines continued by placing the backslash character
&quot;\&quot; as the last character on a line.

<P>
 Configuration directives begin either with a &quot;[realm]&quot; or
&quot;[realm;group]&quot; specification, or with the forward-slash of a path
specification.  Following the path specification are HTTP method keywords
controlling group and world permissions to the path, and any
<B>access-restricting</B> request scheme (&quot;https:&quot;) and/or
host address(es) and/or username(s).
<UL>
<LI> <B>REALM - </B> Square brackets are used to enclose a
[realm;group] specification, introducing a new authentication grouping. Within
these brackets is specified the realm (and database) name, and then an optional
group (and database) name separated by a semi-colon. All path specifications
following this are authenticated against the specified realm database, and
permissions obtained from the group database (or authentication database if
group not specified), until the next [realm;group] specification.

<P>
 The following shows the format of an authentication database only (realm)
directive.

<PRE>  [authentication-database]
</PRE>

<P>
 This the format of a directive using both authentication and authorization
databases (both realm and group).

<PRE>  [authentication-database ; authorization-database]
</PRE>
<P>
<LI> <B>PATH - </B> Paths are usually specified terminated with an
asterisk wildcard. This implies that any directory tree below this is included
in the access control. Wildcards may be used to match any portion of the
specified path, or not at all. Following the path specification are control
keywords representing the HTTP methods or permissions that can be applied
against the path, and optional access-restricting list of host address(es)
and/or username(s), separated using commas. Access control is against either
or both the group and the world. The group access is specified first followed
by a semi-colon separated world specification. The following show the format
of the path directive, see the examples below to further clarify the format.

<PRE>  /root/path/  group-access-list,group-permissions ; \
               world-access-list,world-permissions
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>
 <B>The same path cannot be specified against two different
realms.</B> The reason lies in the HTTP authentication schema, which allows
for only one realm in an authentication dialog. How would the server decide
which realm to use in the authentication challenge? Of course, different parts
of a given tree may have different authorizations, however any tree ending in
an asterisk results in the entire sub-tree being controlled by the specified
authorization environment, unless a separate specification exists for some
inferior portion of the tree.

<A NAME="110">
<H3>Reserved Realms</H3>
</A>

<P>
 The following realm names (authentication database names) are reserved and
have special functionality.
<OL>
<LI> <B>EXTERNAL - </B> Any authentication and authorization will be
done in some way by an external CGI script.  None is attempted by the server.
<P>
<LI> <B>WORLD - </B> This refers to any request and is not
authenticated in any way, only the permissions associated with the path are
applied to the request.  The reserved username &quot;WORLD&quot; becomes the 
authenticated username.
<P>
<LI> <B>VMS - </B> Use the VMS system's SYSUAF database to
authenticate the username. For &quot;http:&quot; requests the username/password
pairs are transmitted encoded but not encrypted,
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">
so this is not recommended
</B></FONT>.
 
For &quot;https:&quot; requests, using the implicit security offered by SSL (see
<A HREF="htd_1000.html#127" TARGET="_self">10 - Secure Sockets Layer</A>) the use of SYSUAF authentication is considered
viable.

<P>
 By default accounts with SYSPRV authorized are always rejected to
discourage the use of potentially significant usernames (e.g. SYSTEM). Accounts
that are disusered, have passwords that have expired or that are captive or
restricted are also automatically rejected.

<P>
 See <A HREF="htd_0900.html#120" TARGET="_self">9.6 - SYSUAF-Authenticated Users</A> for further information.
</OL>

<A NAME="111">
<H3>Reserved Username</H3>
</A>

<P>
 The following username is reserved.
<OL>
<LI> <B>WORLD - </B> If a path is authorized using the WORLD realm
the pseudo-authenticated username becomes &quot;WORLD&quot;.  Any log will reflect
this  username and scripts will access a WWW_REMOTE_USER containing this value. 
Although not forbidden, it is not recommended this string be used as a username
in other realms.
</OL>

<A NAME="112">
<H3>Access Restriction List</H3>
</A>

<P>
 If a host name, protocol identifier or username is included in the path
configuration directive it acts to <B>further</B> limit access to
matching clients (path and username permissions still apply). If more than one
are included a request must match each. If multiple host names and/or
usernames are included the client must match at least one of each. Host and
username strings may contains the asterisk wildcard, matching one or more
consecutive characters. This is most useful when restricting access to all
hosts within a given domain, etc.
<UL>
<LI> <B>Host Names - </B> may be specified as either alphabetic (if
DNS name resolution is enabled, see [DNSlookup] configuration directive) or
numeric addresses. When a host restriction occurs there is never an attempt to
authenticate any associated username. Hence applying host restrictions very
effectively prevents an attack from outside the allowed addresses. The
reserved word <I>#localhost</I> refers to the host name the server is
executing on.
<P>
<LI> <B>Request Scheme - </B> (protocol) either &quot;http:&quot; or
secured via &quot;https:&quot; (SSL)
<P>
<LI> <B>User Names - </B> are indicated by a leading circumflex,
the &quot;~&quot; character (similar or username URL syntax).
</UL>
 For example

<PRE>  /web/secret/* *.three.stooges,~Moe,~Larry,~Curly,read
</PRE>
 restricts read access to Curly, Larry and Moe accessing from within the
three.stooges network, while

<PRE>  /web/secret/* https:,*.three.stooges,~Moe,~Larry,~Curly,read
</PRE>
 applies the further restriction of access via &quot;https:&quot; (SSL) only.

<P>
 Note that it more efficient to place <I>protocol</I> and
<I>host</I> restrictions at the front of a list.

<A NAME="113">
<H2><BR><U>9.3 - Authorization Configuration Examples</U></H2>
</A>
<OL>
<LI> In the following example the authentication realm is &quot;WASD&quot; and the
permissions group &quot;SOCIALCLUB&quot;.  The directive allows those
authenticated from the WASD realm and in the SOCIALCLUB group to read and
write, and the world to read.

<PRE>  [WASD;SOCIALCLUB]
  /web/socialclub/* r+w ; read
</PRE>
<P>
<LI> This example illustrates restricting access according internet address.
Both the group and world restriction is identical, but the group address is
being specified numerically, while the world access is being specified
alphabetically (just for the purposes of illustration). This access check is
done doing simple wildcard comparison, and makes numerical specifications
potentially more efficient because they are usually shorter. The second line
restricts that path's write access even further, to one username,
&quot;BLOGGS&quot;.

<PRE>  [WASD;SOCIALCLUB]
  /web/socialclub/* 131.185.45.*,get,post; *.dsto.defence.gov.au,get
  /web/socialclub/accounts/* 131.185.45.*,~BLOGGS,get,post; *.dsto.defence.gov.au,get
</PRE>
<P>
<LI> In the following example the authentication realm and group are a single
database, &quot;ADMIN&quot;. The first directive allows those in the ADMIN group
to read and write, and the world to read (&quot;get,post;get&quot;). The second
line restricts write and even read access to ADMIN group, no world access at
all (&quot;get,post&quot;).

<PRE>  [ADMIN]
  /web/everyone/* get,post;get
  /web/select/few/* get,post
</PRE>
<P>
<LI> With this example usernames are used to control access to the specified
paths. These usernames are authenticated from the COMPANY database.  The world
has read access in both cases.

<PRE>  [COMPANY]
  /web/docs/* ~Howard,~George,~Fred,r+w ; r
  /web/accounts/* ~George,r+w ; r
</PRE>
<P>
<LI> The following example shows a path specifying the local system's SYSUAF
being used to authenticate any usernames. Whenever using SYSUAF authentication
it is <B>strongly recommended to limit the potential hosts</B> that
can authenticate in this way by always using a host-limiting access
restriction list. The world get read access.

<H3><BR><U>9.3.1 - KISS</U></H3>
</A>

<P>
 WASD authorization allows for very simple authorization environments and
provides the scope for quite complex ones.  The path authentication scheme
allows for multiple, individually-maintained authentication and authorization
databases that can then be administered by autonomous managers, applying to
widely diverse paths, all under the ultimate control of the overall Web
administrator.

<P>
 <B>Fortunately great complexity is not generally necessary.</B>

<P>
 Most sites would be expected to require only an elementary setup allowing a
few selected Web information managers the ability to write to selected paths. 
This can best be provided with the one authentication database containing read
and write permissions against each user, with and access-restriction list
against individual paths.

<P>
 For example.  Consider a site with five departments, each of
which wishes to have two representatives capable of administering the
departmental Web information.  There is one authentication database, named
after the site:

<PRE>  HYPOTHETICAL
</PRE>
 In that database are twelve names, the first two the overall Web
administrators, capable of administering all authorized paths, another two
from each department makes up another ten:

<PRE>  WEB1       r+w
  WEB2       r+w
  JOHN       r+w
  PAUL       r+w
  GEORGE     r+w
  RINGO      r+w
  CURLY      r+w

  MOE        r+w
  SHEMP      r+w
  MAC        r+w
  MYER       r+w
</PRE>
 The authorization configuration file then contains:

<PRE>  [HYPOTHETICAL]

  #                       to revise web configuration files

</A>

<P>
 At this point it should be stressed that the HTTPd-specific (HTA)
authentication and group databases are identical in internal structure and
administration, it is merely the role they assume that differentiates them.
The role of the database is purely a function of where they are used in the
configuration file realm directive, the first mentioned becomes the
authentication database, any subsequent, second database assumes the role of
group database (otherwise that role is also assumed by the authentication
database).

<A NAME="116">
<H3>Authentication Database</H3>
</A>

<P>
 An authentication, or realm database contains usernames and associated
passwords.  Passwords are verified using this database. <B>Passwords
are always stored in encrypted form.</B>

<P>
 When using an HTTPd-specific database it can also be used to contain
per-user permissions, that control access to configured paths. In this role it
acts as both realm (authentication) and group (authorization) database.

<P>
 It is also possible for the system's SYSUAF database to be used for
authentication purposes. Of course HTTPd-specific permissions cannot be stored
in this database, but if using SYSUAF-authenticated usernames a VMS security
profile can be used to control access to served files, see
<A HREF="htd_0900.html#120" TARGET="_self">9.6 - SYSUAF-Authenticated Users</A>.

<P>
 Warning ... when using Digest authentication, an authentication database
cannot simply be renamed to represent a group-name change, as the database
name is encrypted as part of the MD5 Digest!

<A NAME="117">
<H3>Authorization Database</H3>

<P>
 An authorization, or group database, contains a collection of usernames

used for password verification (authentication).

<P>
 An authorization database is not always necessary.  If only a small number
of users need to be authorized against a given path they can be specified
individually using a &quot;~username&quot; format (see

When the /SYSUAF=ID qualifier is employed a VMS account must possess one of two
specific identifiers before it is allowed to be used for server authentication. 
Note that this mechanism can also allow privileged accounts to be so used
... deploy with discretion!
<OL>
<LI> <B>WASD_VMS_R</B>

<P>
 This identifier provides at most read access.
<P>
<LI> <B>WASD_VMS_RW</B>

<P>
 This identifier provides read and write access (path protections still
apply of course).
</OL>

<P>
 Other identifiers provide further control for the way in which the
authenticated account may be used.
<OL>
<LI> <B>WASD_VMS_HTTPS</B>

<P>
 Use of the authenticated account is restricted to &quot;https:&quot; (SSL)
requests.
<P>
<LI> <B>WASD_VMS_PWD</B>

<P>
 The account is allowed to change it's SYSUAF password (!!).  It is
recommended this facility only be employed with SSL in place. 

<P>
 Password modification is enabled by including a mapping rule to the
internal change script.

<PRE>  map /http/-/change/* /http/-/change/*
</PRE>

<P>
 The authorization configuration file must provide authenticated access.

<PRE>  [VMS]
  /httpd/-/change/vms/* https:,r+w
</PRE>

<P>
 Also see <A HREF="htd_0900.html#126" TARGET="_self">9.8 - User Password Modification</A>.
<P>
<LI> <B>WASD_VMS__&lt;group-name&gt;</B>

<P>
 This form allows a suitably named identifier to be created for
use in providing group-membership via the SYSUAF.  Note the double-underscore
separating the fixed from the locally specified portion.  Using these
identifiers it is possible to limit paths to SYSUAF-authenticated accounts
possessing the requisite identifier in manner similar to
non-SYSUAF-authentication groups.  An account possessing the WASD_VMS__TESTING
identifier is allowed write access to the path in the following example:

<PRE>  [VMS;TESTING]
  /web/project/testing/* r+w ; r
</PRE>
</OL>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>
 All four rights identifiers must exist for the /SYSUAF=ID facility to be
used (even though none may be granted to any account).  The identifiers may be
created using the AUTHORIZE utility with following commands:

<PRE>  $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
  $ MCR AUTHORIZE
  UAF&gt; ADD /IDENTIFIER WASD_VMS_R
  UAF&gt; ADD /IDENTIFIER WASD_VMS_RW
  UAF&gt; ADD /IDENTIFIER WASD_VMS_HTTPS
  UAF&gt; ADD /IDENTIFIER WASD_VMS_PWD
</PRE>

<P>
 They can then be provided to desired accounts using commands similar to the
following:

<PRE>  UAF&gt; GRANT /IDENTIFIER WASD_VMS_RW &lt;account&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
 and removed using:

<PRE>  UAF&gt; REVOKE /IDENTIFIER WASD_VMS_RW &lt;account&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
 Note that it is possible to create nil-access VMS accounts that may be used
solely for WASD server authentication.  Create a standard VMS account
in a group dedicated for this function, specifying /NOINTERACTIVE /NONETWORK
/NOBATCH /FLAG=DISMAIL.

<P>
 Be aware that, as with all successful authentications, and due to the
WASD internal authentication cache, changing database contents does not
immediately affect access.  Any change in the RIGHTSLIST won't be reflected
until the cache entry expires or it is explicitly flushed (see
<A HREF="htd_1100.html#142" TARGET="_self">11.4 - HTTPd Server Action</A>).

<A NAME="122">
<H3>SYSUAF and SSL</H3>
</A>

<P>
 When SSL is in use (see <A HREF="htd_1000.html#127" TARGET="_self">10 - Secure Sockets Layer</A>) the username/password
authentication information is inherently secured via the encrypted
communications of SSL. To enforce access to be via SSL add the following to the
HTTPD$MAP configuration file:

<PRE>  /whatever/path/you/like/*  "403 Access denied."  ![sc:https]
</PRE>
 or alternatively the following to the HTTPD$AUTH configuration file:

<PRE>  [REALM]
  /whatever/path/you/like/*  https:
</PRE>

<P>
 Note that this mechanism is applied <B>after</B> any path and
method assessment made by the server's authentication schema.

<P>
 The qualifier /SYSUAF=SSL provides a powerful mechanism for protecting
SYSUAF authentication, restricting SYSUAF authenticated transactions to the SSL
environment.  The combination /SYSUAF=(SSL,ID) is particularly effective.

<P>
 Also see <A HREF="htd_0900.html#105" TARGET="_self">Authentication Policy</A>.

<A NAME="123">
<H3>Security Profile</H3>
</A>

<P>
 It is possible to control access to files and directories based on the VMS
security profile of a SYSUAF-authenticated remote user. This functionality is
implemented using VMS security system services involving SYSUAF and RIGHTSLIST
information. The feature must be explicitly allowed using the server /PROFILE
qualifier. By default it is disabled.

<P>
 When a SYSUAF-authenticated user (i.e. the VMS realm) is first
authenticated a VMS security-profile is created and stored in the
authentication cache. A cached profile is an efficient method of implementing
this as it obviously removes the need of creating a user profile each time a
resource is assessed. If this profile exists in the cache it is attached to
each request authenticated for that user. As it is cached for a period, any
change to a user's security profile in the SYSUAF or RIGHTSLIST won't
be reflected in the cached profile until the cache entry expires or it is
explicitly flushed (see <A HREF="htd_1100.html#142" TARGET="_self">11.4 - HTTPd Server Action</A>).

<P>
 When a request has this security profile all accesses to files and
directories are assessed against it. When a file or directory access is
requested the security-profile is employed by a VMS security system service to
assess the access. If allowed, it is provided via the SYSTEM file protection
field. Hence it is possible to be eligible for access via the OWNER field but
not actually be able to access it because of SYSTEM field protections! If not
allowed, a &quot;no privilege&quot; error is generated.

<P>
 Of course, this functionality only provides access for the server, IT DOES
NOT PROPAGATE TO ANY SCRIPT ACCESS. If scripts must have a similar ability
they should implement their own scheme (which is not too difficult,

see <A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/src/misc/chkacc.c">HT_ROOT:[SRC.MISC]CHKACC.C</A>
)
based on the CGI variable WWW_AUTH_REALM which would be &quot;VMS&quot; indicating
SYSUAF-authentication, and the authenticated name in WWW_REMOTE_USER.

<A NAME="124">
<H3>Performance Impact</H3>
</A>

<P>
 If the /PROFILE qualifier has enabled SYSUAF-authenticated security
profiles,  whenever a file or directory is assessed for access an explicit VMS
security system service call is made.  This call builds a security profile of
the object being assessed, compares the cached user security profile and
returns an indication whether access is permitted or forbidden.  This is
addition to any such assessments made by the file system as it is accessed.

<P>
 This extra security assessment is not done for non-SYSUAF-authenticated
accesses within the same server.

<P>
 For file access this extra overhead is negligible but becomes more
significant with directory listings (&quot;Index of&quot;) where each file in the
directory is independently assessed for access.

<A NAME="125">
<H2><BR><U>9.7 - Controlling Server Write Access</U></H2>
</A>

<P>
 Write access by the server into VMS directories (using the POST or PUT
HTTP methods) is controlled using VMS ACLs. <B>This is in addition to
the path authorization of the server itself of course!</B> The requirement
to have an ACE on the directory prevents inadvertant mapping/authorization of
a path resulting in the ability to write somewhere not intended.

<P>
 Two different ACEs implement two grades of access.
<OL>
<LI> If the ACE grants <B>CONTROL</B> access to the server account
then only VMS-authenticated usernames with security profiles can potentially
write to the directory. Only potentially, because a further check is made to
assess whether that VMS account in particular has write access.

<P>
 This example shows a suitable ACE that applies only to the original
directory:

<PRE>  $ SET SECURITY directory.DIR -
    /ACL=(IDENT=HTTP$SERVER,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE+CONTROL)
</PRE>
 This example shows setting an ACE that will propagate to created files
and importantly, subdirectories:

<PRE>  $ SET SECURITY directory.DIR -
    /ACL=((IDENT=HTTP$SERVER,OPTIONS=DEFAULT,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE+CONTROL), -
          (IDENT=HTTP$SERVER,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE+CONTROL))
</PRE>
<LI> If the ACE grants <B>WRITE</B> access then the directory can be
written into by any authenticated username for the authorized path.

<P>

<H2><BR><U>9.8 - User Password Modification</U></H2>
</A>

<P>
 The server provides for users to be able to change their own HTA passwords
(and SYSUAF if required). This functionality, though desirable from the
administrator's viewpoint, is not  mandatory if the administrator is content to
field any password changes, forgotten passwords, etc.  Keep in mind that
passwords, though not visible during entry, are passed to the server using
clear-text form fields.

<P>
 Password modification is enabled by including a mapping rule to the
internal change script.  For example:

<PRE>  map /http/-/change/* /http/-/change/*
</PRE>

<P>
 Any database to be enabled for password modification must have a writable
authorization path associated with it.  For example:

<PRE>  [GROUP]
  /httpd/-/change/group/* r+w

  [ANOTHER_GROUP]
  /httpd/-/change/another_group/* r+w
</PRE>

<P>
 Use some form of cautionary wrapper if providing this functionality:

<PRE>
  &lt;H2&gt;Change Your Authentication&lt;/H2&gt;

  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;I&gt;
  Change the password used to identify yourself to the REALM Web environment for
  some actions.  Note that this &lt;U&gt;not&lt;/U&gt; an operating system password, nor has
  it anything to do with it.  Due to the inherent weaknesses of using
  non-encrypted password transmissions on networks &lt;FONT COLOR="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;U&gt;DO
  NOT&lt;/U&gt; use a password you have in use anywhere else, especially an operating
  system password!&lt;/FONT&gt; You need your current password to make the change.  If
  you have forgotten what it is contact &lt;A HREF="/web/webadmin.html"&gt;WebAdmin&lt;/A&gt;,
  preferably via email, for the change to be made on your behalf.
