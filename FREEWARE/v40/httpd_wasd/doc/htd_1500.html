<H1>15 - HTTPd Web Update</H1>
</A>

<P>
 The <B>Upd</B>ate facility allows Web documents and file
environments to be administered from a standard browser.  This capability is
available to Web administrator and user alike.  Availability and capability
depends on the authorization environment within the server.

<P>
 It <B>should be stressed</B> that this is not designed as a full
hypertext administration or authoring tool, and for document preparation
relies on the editing capabilities of the &lt;TEXTAREA&gt; widget of the
user's browser. It does however, allow <B>ad-hoc changes</B> to be
made to documents fairly easily, as well as allowing documents to be deleted,
and directories to be created and deleted.

<P> Consult the 
<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/httpd/-/updhelp.html">current <B>Upd</B>ate
documentation</A> for usage detail.

<P> Here is <A TARGET="_top" HREF="/upd/ht_root/">an example of the interface</A>.

<A NAME="211">
<H3>Update Access Permission</H3>
</A>

<P>
 If SSL is in use (see <A HREF="htd_1000.html#127" TARGET="_self">10 - Secure Sockets Layer</A>) then username/password
privacy of the authorization environment is inherently secured via the
encrypted communications. To restrict web update functionality to this secure
environment add the following to the HTTPD$MAP configuration file:

<PRE>  /upd/*  "403 Access denied."  ![sc:https]
</PRE>

<P>
 Of course, the user must have write (POST/PUT) access to the document or
area on the server (i.e. the <I>path</I>) and the server account have file
system permission to write into the <U>parent directory</U>.

<P>
 The server will report &quot;Insufficient privilege or object protection
violation ... /path/document&quot; if it does not have file system permission to
write into a directory.

<P>
 Also see <A HREF="htd_0900.html#125" TARGET="_self">9.7 - Controlling Server Write Access</A> for information on write
access control for the server account.
