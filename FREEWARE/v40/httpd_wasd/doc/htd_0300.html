<P>
 This chapter provides a quick guide to getting your WASD package
installed, configured and serving. This covers initial installation. As of v5.1
an installation DCL procedure simplifies the initial setup.
<OL>
<LI> <B>Unzip Package</B>

<P>
 Install the files following the guidelines in <A HREF="htd_0400.html#31" TARGET="_self">4 - Installation and Update</A>.
<P>
<LI> <B>INSTALL Package</B>

<P>
 Server installation if performed using the 
<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/install.com">INSTALL.COM</A>
DCL procedure, see <A HREF="htd_0400.html#32" TARGET="_self">4.1 - Installation DCL Procedure</A>.
<UL>
<P>
<LI> <B>Link Package</B>

<P>
 Link the supplied object files to produce VMS executables for the system's
version of VMS.
<P>
<LI> <B>Check Package</B>

<P>
 Using the installation procedure check the operation of the basic package
as recommended in <A HREF="htd_0400.html#35" TARGET="_self">4.3 - Quick-Check</A>.
<P>
<LI> <B>Directory Protections</B>

<P>
 This section checks for correct directory protection in the HT_ROOT:[000000]
tree and prompts to change it to WORLD:RE if it appears incorrect.
<P>
<LI> <B>Create Server Account</B>

<P>
 Using the installation procedure create the server account.  For further
information see <A HREF="htd_0500.html#42" TARGET="_self">5.1 - VMS Account</A>.
<P>
<LI> <B>Disk Quota</B>

<P>
 Check if quotas are enabled on the target disk.  Provide an ambit
allocation for the server account.  Review this at some stage.
<P>
<LI> <B>Copy Server Support and Configuration Files</B>

<P>
 Using the installation procedure copy the example server support and
configuration files as discussed in <A HREF="htd_0500.html#44" TARGET="_self">5.2 - Account Support Files</A>.
</UL>
<P>
<LI> <B>Configure Package</B>

<P>
 Following the execution of the INSTALL.COM procedure the package should
require only minor, further configuration.

<P>
 <B>Initially</B> two files may require alteration.
<OL>
<P>
<LI> The startup file, possibly to set the local HTTPD$GMT logical.  Consider
using the STARTUP_LOCAL.COM file for other site-specific requirements. 
Information is provided in <A HREF="htd_0500.html#44" TARGET="_self">5.2 - Account Support Files</A>.
<P>
<LI> The only configuration that should require immediate attention will be to
the mapping rules, see <A HREF="htd_0800.html#84" TARGET="_self">8 - Mapping Rules</A>.
</OL>
<P>

<P>
 <B>More generally</B> server runtime configuration involves
the considerations discussed in <A HREF="htd_0400.html#38" TARGET="_self">4.6 - Organizing Documents</A> along with the
following aspects:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Configuring the HTTP server run-time characteristics, see
<A HREF="htd_0600.html#67" TARGET="_self">6 - Server Configuration</A>. 
<P>
<LI> Mapping request paths to the VMS file system, and to other things such as
scripts, see <A HREF="htd_0800.html#84" TARGET="_self">8 - Mapping Rules</A>.
<P>
<LI> Customizing some messages (or all if non-English language environment),
see <A HREF="htd_0700.html#80" TARGET="_self">7 - Message Configuration</A>.
<P>
<LI> Establishing an authentication and authorization environment, see
<A HREF="htd_0900.html#103" TARGET="_self">9 - Authentication and Authorization</A>.
</UL>
<P>
<LI> <B>Start Server</B>

<P>
 Execute the startup procedure.  Get your browser and connect!
<P>
<LI> <B>Find Out What's Wrong :^(</B>

<P>
 Of course <I>something</I> will not be right!  This can happen with
the initial configuration and sometimes when changing configuration.  The
server provides information messages in it's run-time log, look in
<A TARGET="_top" HREF="/ht_root/log/server/">HT_ROOT:[LOG.SERVER]</A> 

<P>
 Remember, the basic installation's integrity can always be checked
as described in
<A HREF="htd_0400.html#35" TARGET="_self">4.3 - Quick-Check</A>.
This uses the configuration files from the [EXAMPLE] directory, so provided
these have not been altered the server should execute in
<I>demonstration mode</I> correctly.

<P>
 Can't resolve it? See <A HREF="htd_0400.html#40" TARGET="_self">4.7 - Reporting Problems</A>.
