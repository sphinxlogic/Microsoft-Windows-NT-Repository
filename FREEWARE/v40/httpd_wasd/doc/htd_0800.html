<H1>8 - Mapping Rules</H1>
</A>

<P>
 Mapping rules are used in four primary ways.
<OL>
<LI> To map a request <I>path</I> onto the VMS file system.
<P>
<LI> To process a request path according to specified criteria resulting in an
effective path that is different to that supplied with the request.
<P>
<LI> To identify requests requiring script activation and to parse the script
from the path portion of that request.  The path portion is then independently
re-mapped.
<P>
<LI> To conditionally map to different end-results based on one or more
criteria of the request.
</OL>

<P>
 Mapping is basically for server-internal purposes only. The only time the
path information of the request itself is modified is when a script component
is removed. At all other times the path information remains unchanged.

<P>
 <B>Hence, path authorization is always applied to the path
supplied with the request, not to the results of any rule mapping that may
have occured!</B> This means authorization paths may be administered
without any ambiguity introduced by any rule mapping that may occur.

<P>
 By default, the system-table logical name HTTPD$MAP locates a common
mapping rule file, unless an individual rule file is specified using a job-
table logical name. Simple editing of the mapping file changes the rules.
Comment lines may be included by prefixing them with the hash &quot;#&quot;
character. Although, there is no fixed limit on the number of rules there are
the processing implications of scanning a large, linear database. 

<P>
 Rules are given a basic consistency check when loaded (i.e. server
startup, map reload, etc.) If there is an obvious problem (unknown rule,
missing component, etc., path not absolute) a warning message is generated and
the rule is not loaded into the database. This will not cause the server
startup to fail. These warning messages may be found in the server process
log. 

<P>
 The server administration rule mapping facility allows arbitrary paths
to be checked against the rule database in real-time.  See
<A HREF="htd_1100.html#140" TARGET="_self">11.2 - HTTPd Server Reports</A>.

<P>
 Any changes to the mapping file may be (re)loaded into the running HTTPd 
server using the following command on the server system: 

<PRE>  $ HTTPD /DO=MAP
</PRE>

<P>
 Also see <A HREF="htd_0600.html#67" TARGET="_self">6 - Server Configuration</A> for daemon configuration. 

<A NAME="85">
<H3>Server Mapping Rules</H3>
</A>

<P>
 A server's currently loaded mapping rules may be interrogated.  See
<A HREF="htd_1100.html#137" TARGET="_self">11 - Server Administration</A> for further information.

<A NAME="86">
<H2><BR><U>8.1 - VMS File System Specifications</U></H2>
</A>

<P>
 The VMS file system in mapping rules is always assumed to begin with a
device or concealed device logical. Specifying a Master File Directory (MFD)
component, the [000000] is completely optional, although always assumed to be
implied. The mapping functions will always insert one if required for correct
file system syntax. That is, if the VMS file system mapping of a path results
in a file in a top-level directory an MFD is inserted if not explicitly present
in the mapping.  For example, both of the following paths

<PRE>  /dka100/example.txt
  /dka100/000000/example.txt
</PRE>
 would result in a mapping to

<PRE>  DKA100:[000000]EXAMPLE.TXT
</PRE>
 The MFD is completely optional when both specifying paths in mapping
rules and when supplying paths in a request.  Similarly, when supplying a path
that includes directory components the MFD is completely optional, as in

<PRE>  /dka100/dir1/dir2/example.txt
  /dka100/000000/dir1/dir2/example.txt
</PRE>
 both mapping to

<PRE>  DKA100:[DIR1.DIR2]EXAMPLE.TXT
</PRE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#ff0000"><B><U>Implication:</U></B></FONT>
 
When using logical names in file system mappings they must be able to be used
as concealed devices and cannot be logical equivalents of directory
specifications.  Concealed device logicals are created using the following
syntax:

<PRE>  $ DEFINE LOGICAL_NAME device:[dir1.dir2.]
  $ DEFINE LOGICAL_NAME /TRANSLATION=CONCEALED physical_device:[dir1.dir2.]

<OL>
<LI> <B>map <I>template result</I></B>

<P>
 If the URL path matches the template, substitute the <I>result</I> 
string for the path and use that for further rule processing.  Both template
and result paths must be absolute (i.e. begin with &quot;/&quot;).
<P>

<P>
 <B>The &quot;PASS&quot; directive is also used to
<I>reverse-map</I> VMS file specifications to the URL path format
equivalent.</B>

<P>
 <B>An HTTP status-code message</B> can be provided as a result.
The server then generates a response corresponding to that status code
containing the supplied message.  Status-code results should be enclosed in
one of single or double quotes, or curly braces.  See examples.  A
3<I>nn</I> status results in a redirection response with the message text
comprising the location. Codes 4<I>nn</I> and 5<I>nn</I> result in
an error message.  Other code ranges (e.g. 0, 1<I>nn</I>, 2<I>nn</I>,
etc.) simply cause the connection to be immediately dropped, and can be used
for that purpose (i.e. no indication of why!)
<P>

<H3>EXEC and SCRIPT, Script Mapping Rules</H3>
</A>

<A NAME="91">
<H3>EXEC+ and SCRIPT+</H3>
</A>

<P>
 Also see <A HREF="htd_1200.html#145" TARGET="_self">12 - Scripting</A>.

<P>
 The &quot;EXEC&quot; and &quot;SCRIPT&quot; directives have the variants
&quot;EXEC+&quot; and &quot;SCRIPT+&quot;. The variants behave in exactly the same
fashion and simply mark the rule as representing a CGIplus script environment.
See <A HREF="htd_1200.html#165" TARGET="_self">12.7 - CGIplus Scripting</A>. <B>Caution! </B> If changing rules
involving these variants it is advised to restart the server rather than
reload. Some conflict is possible when using new rules while existing CGIplus
scripts are executing.

<P>
 The &quot;EXEC&quot; rules maps CGI script <B>directories</B>.

<P>
 The &quot;SCRIPT&quot; rules maps CGI script <B>file names</B>. It
is a little different to the &quot;EXEC&quot; rule and an extension to the CERN
rules. 

<P>
 Both rules must have a <I>template</I> and <I>result</I>, and 
both must end in a wildcard asterisk.  The placement of the wildcards and the 
subsequent functionality is slightly different however.   Both template
and result paths must be absolute (i.e. begin with &quot;/&quot;).
<OL>
<LI> <B>exec <I>template result</I></B> 

<P>
 The &quot;EXEC&quot; rule requires the <I>template</I>'s asterisk to
immediately follow the slash terminating the directory specification
containing the scripts. The script name follows immediately as part of the
wildcard-matched string. For example:

<PRE>  exec /htbin/* /ht_root/script/*
</PRE>

<P>
 If the URL path matches the template, the result, including the first
slash-terminated part of the wildcard-matched section, becomes the URL format
physical VMS file specification the script to be executed. What remains of the
original URL path is used to create the path information. Process no further
rules. 

<P>
 Hence, the &quot;EXEC&quot; rule will match multiple script specifications
without further rules, the script name being supplied with the URL path. Hence
any script (i.e. procedure, executable) in the specified directory is
accessable, a possible security concern if script management is distributed.
<P>
<LI> <B>script <I>template result</I></B> 

<P>
 The &quot;SCRIPT&quot; rule requires the <I>template</I>'s 
asterisk to immediately follow the <I>unique string</I> identifying the 
script in the URL path.  The wildcard-matched string is the following path, 
and supplied to the script.  For example: 

<PRE>  script /conan* /ht_root/script/conan*
</PRE>

<P>
 If the URL path matches the template, the result becomes the URL format
physical VMS file specification for the DCL procedure of the script to be
executed (the default file extension of &quot;.COM&quot; is not required). What
remains of the original URL path is used to create the path information.
Process no further rules. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>- NOTE -</B></CENTER><BR>
The wildcard asterisk is best located immediately after the unique script 
identifier. In this way there does not need to be any path supplied with the 
script.  If even a slash follows the script identifier it may be mapped into a 
file specification that may or may not be meaningful to the script.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 

<P>
 Hence, the &quot;SCRIPT&quot; rule will match only the script 
specified in the <I>result</I>, making for finely-granular scripting at 
the expense of a rule for each script thus specified.  It also implies that 
only the script name need precede any other path information.

<P>
 It may be thought of as a more efficient implementation of the equivalent 
functionlity using two CERN rules, as illustrated in the following example:

<PRE>  map /conan* /script/conan*
  exec /cgi-bin/* /cgi-bin/*
</PRE>
</OL>

<A NAME="92">
<H2><BR><U>8.3 - Rule Interpretation</U></H2>
</A>

<P>
 The rules are scanned from first towards last, until a <I>pass</I>, 
<I>exec</I>, <I>script</I> or <I>fail</I> is encountered, when
processing ceases  and final substitution occurs.  <I>Map</I>ped rules
substitute the <I>template</I> with the <I>result</I> and continue to
the next rule. 

<P>
 Use of wildcards in <I>template</I> and <I>result</I>:
<UL>
<LI> The <B>template</B> may contain one or more asterisk
(&quot;*&quot;)  wildcard symbols.  These match zero or more characters up until
the character  following the wildcard (or end-of-string).  If no wildcard is
present then the  path must match the <I>template</I> exactly. 
<P>
<LI> The <B>result</B> may contain one or more asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) 
wildcard symbols.  It must not contain more wildcards than the 
<I>template</I>.  The <I>result</I> wildcards are expanded to 
replace the matching characters of the respective <I>template</I> 
wildcards.  Characters represented by wildcards in the <I>template</I> 
not represented by a corresponding wildcard in the <I>result</I> are 
ignored.  Non-wildcard <I>result</I> characters are directly inserted in 
reconstructed path.  Non-wildcard characters in the <I>template</I> are 
ignored.  If the <I>result</I> contains no wildcards it completely 
replaces the URL path.

<H2><BR><U>8.5 - Conditional Mapping</U></H2>
</A>

<P>
 The purpose of <I>conditional mapping</I> is to <B>apply</B>
rules only after certain criteria other than the initial path match are met. 
These criteria serve to create conditional mapping rules, and were introduced
in version 4.4.

<P>
<B>THIS OFFERS A POWERFUL TOOL TO THE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR!</B>

<P>
 Conditional mapping can be applied on the following criteria:
<UL>
<LI> authenticated remote user
<LI> client internet address
<LI> browser-accepted languages
<LI> browser-accepted character sets
<LI> browser-accepted content-types 
<LI> browser identification string
<LI> host and port specified in request header
<LI> HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
<LI> proxy/gateway host(s) request forwarded by
<LI> request scheme (protocol ... &quot;http:&quot; or &quot;https:&quot;)
<LI> server name
<LI> server port
</UL>

<P>
 <B>Note that path authorization is always applied to the path
supplied with the request, not to the results of any rule mapping that may
have occured!</B> This means authorization paths may be administered
without any ambiguity being implied by any rule mapping that may occur.

<P>
 Conditionals must follow the rule and are delimited by &quot;[&quot; and
&quot;]&quot;. Multiple, space-separated conditions may be included
within one &quot;[...]&quot;. This behaves as a logical OR (i.e. the condition
only needs one matched to be true). Multiple &quot;[...]&quot; conditionals may be
included against a rule. These act as a logical AND (i.e. all must have at
least one condition matched).  If a condition begins with a &quot;!&quot; it
acts as a negation operator (i.e. matched strings result in a false condition,
unmatched strings in a true condition). The result of an entire conditional may
also be negated by prefixing the &quot;[&quot; with a &quot;!&quot;.

<P>
 If a conditional, or set of conditionals, is not met the rule is completely
ignored.

<P>
 Matching is done by simple, case-insensitive, string comparison, using
the wildcards &quot;*&quot;, matching one or more characters, and &quot;%&quot;,
matching any single character.

<P>
 White-space (spaces and TABs), wildcards and the delimiting &quot;[&quot; and
&quot;]&quot;, are forbidden characters and cannot be used within condition
matching strings, nor can they be encoded for inclusion in any way (for
simplicity and speed of processing). These characters are uncommon in the
information being matched against, but if one does occur then &quot;match&quot; it
using a single character wildcard (&quot;%&quot;).

<P>
 While conditionals are powerful adjuncts to <I>smart</I> serving they
do add significant overhead to rule mapping and should be used with this in
mind.

<H2><BR><U>8.6 - Mapping User Directories (<I>tilde</I> character (&quot;~&quot;))
</U></H2>
</A>
 

<P>
 This server will map user directories using the same mechanisms as for 
any other.  No reference is made to SYSUAF.DAT, user support is accomplished 
via a combination of mapping rule and logical name.  This approach relies on a 
correspondance between the username and the home directory name.  Hence users 
are made known by the HTTPd using the name of their top-level directory.  As 
the naming of home directories using the username is a common practice this 
mechanism should suffice in the majority of cases.  Where there is no such 
correspondance individual rules could be used for each user.  User scripts can
also be supported using WASD's DECnet scripting environment.  See
<A HREF="htd_1200.html#187" TARGET="_self">12.8.4 - User Scripts</A> for further detail.

<P>
 The &quot;PASS&quot; rule provides a wildcard representation of users'
directory paths. As part of this mapping a subdirectory specifically for the
hypertext data should always be included. <B>Never</B> map users'
top-level directories. For instance if a user's account home directory was
located in the area USER$DISK:[DANIEL] the following rule would potentially
allow the user DANIEL to provide web documents from the home subdirectory
[.WWW] (if the user has created it) using the accompanying URL: 

<PRE>  pass /~*/* /user$disk/*/www/*

  http://host/~daniel/
</PRE>

<P>
 It is <B>recommended</B> that a separate logical name be created 
for locating user directories.  This helps hide the internal organisation of 
the file system.  The following logical name definition and mapping rule 
illustrate this point. 

<PRE>  $ DEFINE /SYSTEM /EXEC /TRANSLATION=CONCEALED WWW_USER device:[USER.]

  pass /~*/* /www_user/*/www/*
</PRE>

<P>
 Where users are grouped into different areas of the file system a logical 
search list may be defined. 

<PRE>  $ DEFINE /SYSTEM /EXEC /TRANSLATION=CONCEALED -
           WWW_USER -
           DISK1:[GROUP1.], -
           DISK1:[GROUP2.], -
           DISK2:[GROUP3.], -
           DISK2:[GROUP4.]
    
  pass /~*/* /www_user/*/www/*
</PRE>

<P>
 As logical search lists have specific uses and some complications (e.g.
when creating files) this is the only use for them recommended with this
server, although it is specifically coded to allow for search lists in document
specifications.

<P>
 If only a subset of all users are to be provided with WWW publishing 
access either their account directories can be individually mapped (best used 
only with a small number) or a separate area of the file system be provided 
for this purpose and specifically mapped as user space. 

<P>
 Of course, user mapping is amenable to all other rule processing so it is 
a simple matter to redirect or otherwise process user paths.  For instance, 
the published username does not need to, or need to continue to, correspond 
to any real user area, or the user's actual name or home area: 

<PRE>  redirect /~doej/* http://a.nother.host/~doej/*
  pass /~doej/* /www/messages/deceased.html
  pass /~danielm/* /special$www$area/danielm/*
  pass /~Mark.Daniel/* /user$disk/danielm/www/*
  pass /~*/* /www_user/*/www/*
</PRE>

<P>
 A user directory is always presented as a top-level directory (i.e. no 
parent directory is shown), although any subdirectory tree is accesssable by 
default.
