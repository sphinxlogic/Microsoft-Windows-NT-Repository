Xtron Installation Guide

The supplied executable was compiled on the following environment:
Linux 1.2.1, X11R6, GNU C 2.6.2.  It has also been tested to run under SunOS
4.1.2, Solaris 2.4 and HPUX 9.x.

To remake executable:

make clean
make

This SHOULD work.  If you move the executable, just make sure that the
location of the pixmaps are updated in the xtronrc file.
