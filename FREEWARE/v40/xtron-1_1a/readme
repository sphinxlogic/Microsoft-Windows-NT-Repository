Xtron is a simple one or two player version of the old classic TRON. The game 
is simple: avoid running into walls, your own tail, and that of your opponent.

The game starts in demo mode (two computer players).  To change to a human
player, simply click the human icon for either player 1/2 or both.  The
standard controls are as follows:

                     Player 1:          Player 2:
                       w - up             8 - up
                       s - down           2 - down
                       a - left           4 - left
                       d - right          6 - right

Player 2 may also use the standard arrow keys for control.  If you wish to
change the keys, edit the xtronrc file to make the appropriate changes.

If you move xtron about, make sure that the xtronrc file is updated with
where the pixmaps are stored or the program will not run.

See the CHANGES file as to how to change the computer player skill level...

Anyway, have fun and feel free to mail me <rhett@hotel.canberra.edu.au> if
you have any comments or suggestions.

I'll be able to send you latest updates etc...
