Okay, this is the updated version of xtron. Not a big update, but enough to
warrent a new version.

Changes:
--------

Colour: xtron is now designed mainly for colour machines (but should still run
on monochrome systems).  I'm using the Xpm libraries, so make sure that you 
have them on your system...most people do.  Thanks to Alex Brown 
(alex@rosella.canberra.edu.au> for the xpm2pixmap code.

Score Resets: I received a few suggestions that you should be able to reset
your score so I've made this possible by clicking on the appropriate player's
score button.

Enhanced Buttons: well, it's more they look prettier :) Things like when you 
click on the pause button, it stays down until you unpause the game.  All 
buttons should now be responsive (you click them and they move down etc.

Computer Player: Ahh, not really a whole lot smarter, just processing is a
little more efficient behind the scenes.  I will get around to making the 
computer a competative opponent, but I haven't had the time of late. :(
You can change the computer player's "look ahead" distance so that it
can be short or long sighted :) If you have it too short then it will only
turn at walls, too long and it turns a little too often.  The default
setting is 25 blocks ahead, but this can be changed in the xtronrc file.
Its a delicate balance, if anyone finds a more competative setting than 25,
let me know.

Screen Refresh:  Problem before with the screen redrawing itself...should
work correctly now.

Keyboard redefinitions: I seem to forget that not everyone uses US keyboards
so I've made it so you can customise the keyboard controls. This is done
through the resource file xtronrc.  Just change the appropriate keys and rerun
the program.  The arrow keys will also always work for player 2 as well as
any player defined configuration.

Misc: no longer use bitmaps, pixmaps instead.  This means that they need to
be loaded whenever the program is run.  The location of these files is
usually in the subdirectory pixmaps/  If you wish to change this, make sure
you update the xtronrc file to tell it where they are or it will not work.
Umm, Makefile is a little cleaner and compile errors removed.

1.1a:  changed where the xtronrc file can be found.  It can currently be found
in the current directory where the xtron executable is kept, in the 
/usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults/ and the home directory.  The file can now also
be called either xtronrc or .xtronrc for those who like to keep rc files 
hidden.

Thanks to all the responses...and yes I will get around to a network version
as soon as I have the time.

Anyway, have fun and feel free to mail me <rhett@hotel.canberra.edu.au> if
you have any comments or suggestions.

BTW: if there are any interested coders who would like to work on xtron, get
in touch...:)

Rhett.
