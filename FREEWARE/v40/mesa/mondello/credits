Credit where credit is due:

I'd just like to mention the names of a few people who made this possible,
since they at least deserve that.


Brian Paul      For writing Mesa (the OpenGL-alike) and hence making the world
                a better place for graphics progamming.
		(brianp@ssec.wisc.edu)

Robin Cutshaw   Robin (unknowingly) lent me his PCI access functions from
                XFree86 (xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xf86/etc/scanpci.c) to 
                help in finding the Mondello card.
		(robin@xfree86.org)

Tom Dye         Tom is the head of the Austin Design Center for Cirrus Logic
                and was nice enough to lend some of his hardware to the 
                University of Texas for us to work with.

Cirrus Logic    (see Tom Dye)

Goran Devic     For giving us his code for the Mondello card and being 
                exceptionally helpful in answering questions about the
                hardware.  (Goran works at Cirrus-Austin)

Don Fussell     For heading up this project.
 		(fussell@cs.utexas.edu)

Linux people    For writing such a great operating system.

Zeyd M. Ben-Halim and Ers S. Raymond for ncurses, from which I stripped some
of the code in the src-tk2 directory.
