
The Mondello only ever went to Rev B before the team moved onto the
Laguna-3D chipset.  The Rev B chipset had a few bugs remaining to be
worked out.

One of the bits in the z-buffer doesn't work.  This can be worked around,
but as a result, the z-buffer is only 15 bits deep.  

The PCI bus transfers are VERY slow.  I have been told that there are some 
bus arbitration problems with the Rev B chipset.  This, of course, slows 
down the hardware rendering considerably.  Presumably, this will be fixed in 
the next revision.  I know it is fixed in the current Laguna product.  

Some of the include files are in ../include/mondello.

The driver may sometimes exit in a not-so-nice way.  Typing reset;setfont
usually takes care of such problems.
