Cirrus Logic CLGD547x - Mondello 3-D accelerator driver for Mesa

This is the first installment in hopefully a series of drivers for Mesa
that interface directly to low-level 3-D hardware.  The Cirrus Logic 
Mondello card will never be released.  However, the technology behind the
card is being integrated into the upcoming Laguna-3D chipset. Hopefully, 
I (Peter McDermott) will have the time to rewrite this code for the Laguna-3D
whence it arrives on the market.

I hope that other people looking to interface 3-D hardware to Mesa will
look at this code to get some ideas as to where to head in their efforts.

If you are interested in interfacing 3-D hardware to Mesa and XFree86
(meaning you want to write code, not just talk about it) the XFree86-3D 
mailing list run by Steven Parker (sparker@taz.cs.utah.edu) may be joined
by sending a message to majordomo@mania.cs.utah.edu with the word subscribe
followed by your name in the message.  The has been very quiet lately,
but has the potential to become quite active as more 3D hardware comes onto
the market.

Please see the CREDITS file for thank-yous.  Please see the NOTES file for
miscellaneous information.

Good Luck!
