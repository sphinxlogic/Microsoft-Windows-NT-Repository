BAT V1.10 -- Submit multiple commands to a batch queue from DCL

This kit contains all the files necessary for installing the BAT
utility.  Requires VMS V5.0 or later.

BAT is designed to be invoked via a foreign command:

    $ BAT :== $disk:[directory]BAT.EXE

BAT lets you submit multiple commands to a batch queue easily and
quickly. For example, you can use:

    $ bat cc := cc/vaxc|mmk

or

    $ bat
    _Command: cc := cc/vax
    _Command: mmk
    _Command: ^Z
    $

to define CC for that batch job and then run MMK in the current
directory. BAT will automatically create the a temporary .COM file
that sets the default to the current directory and includes the
commands to be executed. The .COM file is then submitted to a batch
queue for processing.

BAT is written in BLISS. Complete sources are provided.
