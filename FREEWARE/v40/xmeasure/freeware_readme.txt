Xmeasure, UTILITIES, Measure pixel locations on displayed X objects

Xmeasure is a tool which provides X-Y cursor 
location information (in pixel units) for the 
Root Window OR a user selected window in both 
Simple X-Y and Delta X-Y modes. Mode selection 
is via the Option Menu located at the bottom 
edge of the tool.

To use:

Copy the file XMEASURE.DAT to your DECW$USER_DEFAULTS directory.
use the RUN command for the approriate EXE file for your environment.

Menubar Options Pulldown:

    Offset Mode - Defaults to NONE, Motif-35 and Motif-40 set the offset
    from the top of the selected window to 35 or 40, to compensate for
    the thickness of the Motif Menu Bar.

    MB2 Rel/Abs - Using the Delta XY mode, Relative (default) will 
    display delta from the location selected via MB1 when MB2 is pressed.
    Selecting Absolute mode displays actual pixel offset from top left
    of selected X object when MB2 is pressed.
