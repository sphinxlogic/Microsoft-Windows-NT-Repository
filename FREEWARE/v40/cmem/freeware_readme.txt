CMEM, LANGUAGES, Tool for debugging 'C' memory allocation routines

						CMEM V1.1 - November 1995
						OpenVMS VAX/Alpha V6.2

This package provides updated versions of the C run-time library routines
'malloc', 'calloc', 'realloc', and 'free'.  The new versions provide many
features to insure the integrity of the C dynamic memory pool.  Programmers
can use this information to track down routines which improperly access
dynamic memory.
