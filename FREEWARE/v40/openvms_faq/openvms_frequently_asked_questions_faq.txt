The term "VMS" is synonymous with "OpenVMS".  "Alpha", "AlphaGeneration" or 
"AXP" generally refers to any system or product based on or related to 
Digital's Alpha processor architecture.  OpenVMS manual names mentioned are
those as of V7.1 - names may be different in other editions of the
documentation set.

World-Wide Web Universal Resource Locator (URL) notation is used for FTP

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO1.  What is the scope of comp.os.vms?

The comp.os.vms newsgroup is the primary newsgroup for discussion of 
Digital's OpenVMS operating system and the computer systems on which it
runs.  Questions about layered products which run on OpenVMS are also
welcome, though many of them (in particular, language compilers and
database systems) have more specific newsgroups.  If a question has
some relationship to OpenVMS, it belongs here.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO2.  What other newsgroups carry VMS-related information?

The vmsnet.* hierarchy, run by DECUS, contains several newsgroups of
interest, including vmsnet.misc and vmsnet.alpha, the latter being mostly
devoted to Alpha topics.  There's also vmsnet.sources (and 
vmsnet.sources.d) to which sources for or pointers to freeware are posted.
See the separate "What is VMSNET" monthly posting for further details.

The comp.sys.dec newsgroup carries discussions about all Digital systems
as well as about Digital itself.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO3.  What is INFO-VAX?

INFO-VAX is a mailing list which is bidirectionally gatewayed to the
comp.os.vms newsgroup.  This means that postings to comp.os.vms get
automatically sent to INFO-VAX subscribers and messages sent to the INFO-VAX
list are automatically posted to comp.os.vms.  INFO-VAX can be a useful way
to participate in the newsgroup if you can't access the group directly
through a news reader.

An important point to keep in mind is that propagation delays vary, both
within the newsgroup and with INFO-VAX mailings.  It's possible that
postings may not be delivered for several days and some may appear out of
order.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO4.  How do I subscribe to or unsubscribe from INFO-VAX?

The address for subscription requests, as well as notes intended for the
moderator, is Info-VAX-Request@Mvb.Saic.Com.  Subscription requests are handled
automatically by a mail server.  This mail server ignores the subject line and
processes each line of the message as a command.  The syntax for subscribing
and unsubscribing and setting digest or non-digest modes is:
 
SUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX      (ADD is a valid synonym)
UNSUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX	(REMOVE, SIGNOFF, and SIGN-OFF are valid synonyms)
SET INFO-VAX DIGEST     (to receive in Digest format)
SET INFO-VAX NODIGEST   (to receive each message individually)
 
Case is irrelevant and attempts to fetch a copy of the mailing list will be
rejected (I consider the information to be confidential).  Any message not
understood by the mailserver will be forwarded to a human (allegedly) for
manual processing.
				[Mark.Berryman@Mvb.Saic.Com]

If you are on Bitnet, send a mail message containing the text 
"SUBSCRIBE INFO-VAX" to LISTSERV@(nearest listserv system).  To unsubscribe,
send a message containing the text "SIGNOFF INFO-VAX" to the *SAME* listserv
address. 

If you are on the Internet in the UK, send a message containing the
word SUBSCRIBE (or UNSUBSCRIBE) to info-vax-request@ncdlab.ulcc.ac.uk.

------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO5.  How do I submit a question or a response?

If you are using a news reader, post your question to comp.os.vms.  If you
want to submit through INFO-VAX, send the message to Info-VAX@mvb.saic.com.

Before posting, please use available local resources, such as the manuals,
HELP and this FAQ first.  Also make a point of reading the release notes for
the product you're using, generally placed in SYS$HELP.  Often you'll find
the answer and will save time and effort for all concerned.

When posting, please consider the following suggestions:

    1.  Include a valid e-mail address in the text of your posting or
        in a "signature" appended to the end.  Reply-to addresses in
	headers often get garbled.

    2.  If you are submitting a question, please be as specific as you
        can.  Include relevant information such as processor type, product
	versions (OpenVMS and layered products that apply) and a short,
	reproducible example of problems.  Say what you've tried so far,
	so that effort isn't duplicated.  Keep in mind that there's not yet 
	a telepathy protocol for the Internet - the more detailed your
	description, the better people can help you.

    3.  If responding to a posting, include in your reply only as much of
        the original posting as is necessary to establish context.  As
	a guideline, consider that if you've included more text than you've 
	added, you've possibly included too much.  Never include signatures 
	and other irrelevant material.

    4.  Be polite.  If the question isn't worded the way you think is
        correct or doesn't include the information you want, try to
	imagine what the problem might be if viewed from the poster's
	perspective.  Requests for additional information are often
	better sent through mail rather than posted to the newsgroup.

    5.  If you have a problem with Digital (or any vendor's) product,
        use the appropriate support channel.  Don't assume that
	newsgroup postings will get read or responded to by the appropriate
	developers.

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS1.   What is OpenVMS?  What is its history?

OpenVMS, originally called VMS (Virtual Memory System), was first conceived in
1976 as a new operating system for Digital's new, 32-bit, virtual memory line
of computers, eventually named VAX (Virtual Address eXtension).  The first VAX
model, the 11/780, was code-named "Star", hence the code name for the VMS
operating system, "Starlet", a name that remains to this day the name for the
system library files (STARLET.OLB, etc.).  VMS version X0.5 was the first
released to customers, in support of the hardware beta test of the VAX-11/780,
in 1977.  VAX/VMS Version V1.0 shipped in 1978, along with the first
revenue-ship 11/780s.

OpenVMS was designed entirely within Digital Equipment Corporation.  The
principal designers were Dave Cutler and Dick Hustvedt.  OpenVMS was conceived
as a 32-bit, virtual memory successor to Digital's RSX-11M operating system
for the PDP-11.  Many of the original designers and programmers of OpenVMS
had worked previously on RSX-11M, and many concepts from RSX-11M were carried
over to OpenVMS.

OpenVMS is a 32-bit, multitasking, multiprocessing virtual memory operating
system. Current implementations run on Digital's VAX and Alpha computer
systems.

For more details on OpenVMS and its features, read the OpenVMS Software
Product Description at:

  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/SPD/25-01-XX.txt

Additional information on the general features of various OpenVMS
releases, release dates, as well as the development project code
names of specific releases, is available at:

http://www.openvms.digital.com/openvms/os/openvms-release-history.html

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS2.   What is the difference between VMS and OpenVMS?

VMS and OpenVMS are two names for the same operating system.  Originally,
the operating system was called VAX-11/VMS; it changed to VAX/VMS at
around VAX/VMS V2.0.  When the VMS operating system was ported to the
Alpha platform, it was renamed OpenVMS, for both VAX and Alpha, in part
to signify the high degree of support for industry standards such as
POSIX, which provides many features of UNIX systems.  An OpenVMS license
allows you to install and run POSIX for OpenVMS at no additional charge;
all you need is the media and documentation which can be found on the
Consolidated Distribution and On-Line Documentation CD-ROMs.  For more
information on POSIX for VMS see question SOFT2.

What became confusing is that the OpenVMS name was introduced first
for OpenVMS AXP V1.0 causing the widespread misimpression that OpenVMS
was for Alpha AXP only, while "regular VMS" was for VAX.  In fact, Digital
officially changed the name of the VAX operating system as of V5.5,
though the name did not start to be actually used in the product until
V6.0.

The proper names for OpenVMS on the two platforms are now "OpenVMS VAX"
and "OpenVMS Alpha", the latter having superseded "OpenVMS AXP".

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS3.   How do I port from VMS to OpenVMS?

You already did.  Wasn't that easy?  (See question VMS2.)

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS4.   Which is better - OpenVMS or UNIX?

This question comes up periodically, usually asked by new subscribers who are
long-time UNIX users. Sometimes, it is ignored totally; other times, it leads
to a long series of repetitive messages that convince no one and usually carry
little if any new information.  Please do everyone a favor and avoid
re-starting this perpetual, fruitless debate.
					[leichter@lrw.com]

Seriously, OpenVMS and the better implementations of UNIX are all fine
operating systems, each with its strengths and weaknesses.  If you're
in a position where you need to choose, select the one that best fits
your own requirements, considering, for example, whether or not the
layered products or specific OS features you want are available.

See also questions VMS2 and SOFT2 for information on POSIX for OpenVMS which 
provides significant UNIX functionality on OpenVMS.
					[Steve Lionel]

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS5.   Is Digital dropping support for OpenVMS?

People who ask this question, most recently, have read about the May 1995
announcement of an association between Digital and Microsoft to provide
greater affinity between OpenVMS and Windows NT.  Some trade publications 
interpreted this announcement as signalling that Digital was going to drop
OpenVMS and move its customers onto Windows NT.  Nothing could be further from
the truth.

For more information, see:

    http://www.openvms.digital.com/

------------------------------------------------------------
[VMS6 removed, replaced by Y2K section]

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS7.   What OpenVMS CD-ROM products are available?

Beginning in December '96, the OpenVMS VAX "binaries-only" and "library
package" offerings will be enhanced to include the complete operating system
kit. In addition, all online documentation offerings will be enhanced to
include the operating system documentation as well as software layered
products documentation. The enhanced offerings are indicated by a plus sign
(+) in Table 1.

New Offerings (New Part Numbers Must Be Ordered)

Also beginning in December '96, the complete operating system kits will be
combined with layered product kits for OpenVMS Alpha and Digital UNIX[R]. The
combination of operating system plus layered products will ship quarterly, on
the current schedules. OpenVMS Alpha or Digital UNIX customers may request the
new part numbers indicated by an asterisk (*) in Table 1. [This means that
anything that ships with the operating system binaries kit ("H-kit"), such as
the Freeware CD, will be included with the Software Product Library
distribution.  Previously, you had to specifically order the OS kit in order
to get these extras. - SBL]

VMS8.   In what language is OpenVMS written?

OpenVMS is written in a wide variety of languages.

In no particular order, OpenVMS components are implemented using Bliss, Macro,
Ada, PLI, VAX and DEC C, Fortran, UIL, VAX and Alpha SDL, Pascal, MDL, DEC C++,
DCL, Message, and Document.  And this is certainly not a complete list.
However, the rumor is NOT true that an attempt was made to write pieces of 
OpenVMS in every supported language so that the Run-Time Libraries could not be
unbundled.  (APL, BASIC, COBOL and RPG are just some of the languages NOT
represented!)

There are a large variety of small and not-so-small tools and DCL command
procedures that are used as part of the OpenVMS build, and a source code control
system capable of maintaining over a hundred thousand source files across
multiple parallel development projects, and overlapping releases.

------------------------------------------------------------
VMS9.   How do I obtain or transfer a VMS license?

If you are a DECUS member and are considering acquiring and using 
a VAX-based system for hobbyist use, a (free) license for OpenVMS
VAX is available from US DECUS for V5.5-2 and V6.1.  In addition to
the license, a distribution CD-ROM kit is available with OpenVMS,
DECwindows, and assorted Freeware for a nominal fee (currently US$30).

For further information, link to:

  http://www.montagar.com/hobbyist

There is currently no hobbyist license for OpenVMS Alpha available.

Further information on DECUS and on DECUS membership is available at:

  http://www.decus.org/

To transfer a commercial OpenVMS license from one owner to another,
or to purchase a commercial license, you can contact Compaq Computer
Corporation at 1-800-DIGITAL (in North America), or your local or
regional sales office.

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA1.   What do the letters AXP stand for?

While there are many fanciful "definitions" which have circulated widely,
the truth is that AXP is not an abbreviation nor an acronym; the letters
do not mean anything.  They are just three letters chosen to form a
trademark.

When it came time to chose a "marketing name" for the Alpha AXP line,
Digital was in a quandary.  The internal "code name" for the project,
Alpha, was widely known and would seem the ideal choice, but it was already
in common use by a number of other companies and could not be trademarked.
A well-known "name search" firm was hired and was asked to come up with
two lists of possible names.  The first list was intended to evoke the
feeling of "extension to VAX", while the second list was to suggest
"not a VAX".  Unfortunately, none of the choices offered were any good;
for example, "VAX 2000" was found on the first list while the second list
contained "MONDO" (later to be used for a kids' soft drink).

Shortly before announcement, a decision was made to name the new line ARA,
for Advanced RISC Architecture.  However, a Digital employee in Israel
quickly pointed out that this name, if pronounced in the "obvious" manner,
sounded very much like an Arabic word with decidely unfortunate connotations.
Eventually, AXP was selected; the architecture would be referred to as
"Alpha AXP" whereas products themselves would use just "AXP".

Despite all this, everyone went on calling the new line "Alpha".  Digital
has recognized this by coining a new "AlphaGeneration" trademark to apply
to all products (hardware, software and services) related to the Alpha AXP
line.

Digital has phased out the use of the AXP name, using Alpha instead.
For example, OpenVMS AXP is now called called "OpenVMS Alpha".

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA2.   What are the OpenVMS differences between VAX and Alpha?

Very few.  As of OpenVMS V6.1, the VAX and Alpha platforms are very close
to "feature parity".  Most applications can just be recompiled and
run.  Some differences to be aware of:

    - The default double-precision floating type on OpenVMS Alpha
      is VAX G_float, whereas on VAX it is usually D_float.  D_float
      is available on Alpha, but D_float values are converted to
      G_float for computations and then converted back to D_float
      when stored.  Because the G_float type has three fewer fraction
      bits than D_float, some applications may get different results.
      IEEE float types are also available on OpenVMS Alpha.

    - Data alignment is extremely important for best performance on
      Alpha.  This means that data items should be allocated at
      addresses which are exact multiples of their sizes.  Quadword
      alignment will offer the best performance, especially for
      character values and those smaller than 32 bits.  Compilers
      will naturally align variables where they can and will issue
      warnings if they detect unaligned data items.

    - DEC C is the only C compiler Digital offers on OpenVMS Alpha.
      It is compatible with DEC C on OpenVMS VAX, but is somewhat
      different from the older VAX C compiler most people are familiar with.
      Read up on the /EXTERN_MODEL and /STANDARD qualifiers to avoid
      the most common problems.

    - The page size on Alpha systems is variable, but is at least 8K bytes.
      This can have some effect on applications which use the $CRMPSC
      system service as well as on the display of available memory
      pages.  The page size is available from $GETSYI(SYI$_PAGE_SIZE).

There are also a number of manuals which discuss migration to Alpha.

    - "A Comparison of System Management on OpenVMS AXP and OpenVMS VAX"
    - "Migrating to an OpenVMS AXP System: Planning for Migration"
    - "Migrating to an OpenVMS AXP System: Porting VAX MACRO Code"
    - "Migrating to an OpenVMS AXP System: Recompiling and Relinking"

These are part of the "AXP Migration Kit" (which is part of the "Programming
Kit" - which in turn is part of the "Standard Set" if ordering documentation.)
Check out the "Overview of OpenVMS Documentation" book on the Bookreader-based
doc set included on the OpenVMS AXP V6.1 distribution CD for part numbers of
both assorted "kits" and/or individual manuals.

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA3.   Are there Alpha systems on the net I can try out?

As of November 1, 1995, Digital's service of Internet-accessible Alpha 
"test drive" systems was suspended.  A revised service may appear in the
future.  For more information, write to Jack Lucier at 
lucier@kacie.enet.dec.com.

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA4.   How do I join Digital's Association of Software & Application
          Partners program?

The Association of Software & Application (ASAP) Partners is a Digital program
designed to provide members with a broad base of development support,
promotional tools, and services.  The ASAP program is open to software partners
throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and selected countries in Asia Pacific.

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA5.   Where can I find performance information about Alpha systems?

Digital makes a wide range of performance documents available through
its FTP and WWW Internet servers (see DOC2).  The specific WWW subject page
is http://www.digital.com/info/performance.html, for FTP look in
ftp://ftp.digital.com/info/performance.  Documents with "flash" in their
names are short summaries with performance charts, those with "brief" are
longer documents with more detail on the specific tests and configurations.

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA6.  Where can I get updated console firmware for Alpha systems?

Firmware updates for Digital Alpha systems are available from:

	ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/
	http://www.service.digital.com/alpha/server/firmware/

The files are structured similiar to those on the firmware CD, and are
separated by CD release.  For example, the contents of the V3.7
firmware CD are located at: 
	ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/v3.7/

The latest and greatest firmware (if released since the last firmware
CD) is located at:
	ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/interim/

Please send your comments and feedback to alpha_server@service.digital.com

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA7.   How do I boot an AlphaStation without monitor or keyboard?

The AlphaStation series will boot without a keyboard attached.  To use a
serial terminal as the console, issue the console command SET CONSOLE SERIAL -
after that, it will use the terminal.  Older Alpha workstations generally
can't be booted without a keyboard.

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA8.  Will OpenVMS run on a Multia?

No.  Not just an "unsupported" - it won't boot.

------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA9.  What is the least expensive system that will run OpenVMS?

The cheapest system, sold by Digital today, that will run OpenVMS is the
AlphaStation 255 4/233.  Other companies sell Alpha-powered systems, some
of which will run (and can be purchased with) OpenVMS.  There are also many
used DEC 3000 models available which are suitable.

------------------------------------------------------------
VAX1.   Please explain the back panel of the MicroVAX II

The MicroVAX-series console bulkhead was used with the KA630, KA650, KA655
processors.

There are three controls on the console bulkhead of these systems:

  Triangle-in-circle-paddle: halt enable. 
    dot-in-circle: halt (<break>) is enabled,
                   and auto-boot is disabled.
    dot-not-in-circle: halt (<break>) is disabled,
                   and auto-boot is enabled.

  Three-position-rotary: power-up bootstrap behaviour
    arrow: normal operation.
    face: language inquiry mode.
    t-in-circle: infinite self-test loop.

  Eight-position-rotary: console baud rate selection
    select the required baud rate; read at power-up.
 
Those versions of the console bulkhead that do not have an MMJ have a 9-pin
submini connector (DB9), and the pinout of this connector predates the PC
9-pin pinout -- the console pinout is consistent with the EIA232 pinout.
See MISC4 for details of the DB9 pinout.  For those bulkheads not equipped
with an MMJ, use the H8575-B adapter to convert the console connector to
MMJ.  See MISC1 for further details.

Also present on the bulkhead is a self-test indicator: a single digit. This
matches the final part of the countdown displayed on the console or
workstation, and can be used by a service organization to determine the nature
of a processor problem.  The particular countdown sequence varies by processor
type, consult the hardware or owner's manual for the processor, or contact the
local hardware service organization for information the self-test sequence for
a particular processor module. Note that self-tests 2, 1 and 0 are associated
with the transfer of control from the console program to the booting operating
system.

------------------------------------------------------------
VAX2.   What is the layout of the VAX floating point format?

The VAX floating point format is derived from one of the PDP-11 FP formats,
which helps explain its strange layout.  There are four formats defined:
F 32-bit single-precision, D and G 64-bit double-precision and H 128-bit
quadruple precision.  For all formats, the lowest addressed 16-bit "word"
contains the sign and exponent (and for other than H, some of the most
significant fraction bits).  Each successive higher-addressed word contains
the next 16 lesser-significant fraction bits.  Bit 15 of the first word is the
sign, 1 for negative, 0 for positive.  Zero is represented by a biased
exponent value of zero and a sign of zero; the fraction bits are ignored (but
on Alpha, non-zero fraction bits in a zero value cause an error.)  A value
with biased exponent zero and sign bit 1 is a "reserved operand" - touching
it causes an error - fraction bits are ignored.  There are no minus zero,
infinity, denormalized or NaN values.

For all formats, the fraction is normalized and the radix point assumed to be
to the left of the MSB, hence 0.5 <= f < 1.0.  The MSB, always being 1, is
not stored.  The binary exponent is stored with a bias varying with type in
bits 14:n of the lowest-addressed word.

  Type    Exponent bits    Exponent bias    Fraction bits (including hidden)
  ==========================================================================
   F           8                128               24
   D           8                128               56
   G          11               1024               53
   H          15              16384              113

The layout for D is identical to that for F except for 32 additional
fraction bits.

Example:  +1.5 in F float is hex 000040C0 (fraction of .11[base 2], biased
exponent of 129)

------------------------------------------------------------
VAX5.   Tell me about the system disk size limit on the VAXstation 3100.

System disks larger than 1.073 gigabytes (GB) -- 1fffff hexidecimal blocks --
are not supported on any member of the VAXstation 3100 series, and are not
reliable on any member of the series.

Various of the SCSI commands used by the boot drivers imbedded in the console
PROM on all members of the VAXstation 3100 series use "Group 0" commands,
which allow a 21 bit block number field, which allows access to the first
1fffff hexidecimal blocks of a disk.  Any disk references past 1fffff will
wrap -- this wrapping behaviour can be of particular interest when writing a
system crashdump file, as this can potentially lead to system disk corruptions
should any part of the crashdump file be located beyond 1.073 GB.

More recent systems and console PROMs use "Group 1" SCSI commands, which allow
a 32 bit block number field.

There was a similar limitation among the oldest of the MicroVAX 3100 series,
but a console boot PROM was phased into production and was made available for
field retrofits -- this PROM upgrade allows the use of the "Group 1" SCSI
commands, and thus larger system disks.  There was no similar PROM upgrade for
the VAXstation 3100 series.

Systems that are affected by this limit:
  o VAXstation 3100 series, all members.  No PROM upgrade is available.
  o MicroVAX 3100 models 10 and 20.  No PROM upgrade is available.
  o MicroVAX 3100 models 10e and 20e.  Only systems with VMB versions
    prior to V6.4 are affected.  PROM upgrade (once) available.

------------------------------------------------------------
VAX6.   How does OpenVMS VAX maintain system time?

VAX systems maintain an interval clock, and a hardware clock.

The VAX hardware clock is called the TOY ("Time Of Year") clock.  The register
associated with the clock is called the TODR ("Time Of Day Register").

The TOY clock -- as used -- stores time relative to January first of the
current year, starting at at 00:00:00.00.  It is a 100 Hz, 32-bit counter,
incremented every 10ms, and thus has a capacity of circa 497 days.

OpenVMS (on the VAX platform) stores system date information -- and in
particular, the current year -- in the system image, SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.EXE.
  
The TOY is used, in conjunction with the base date that is stored and
retrieved from the system image, to initialize the interval clock value that
is stored in EXE$GQ_SYSTIME.

Once the interval clock is loaded, the system does not typically reference the
TOY again, unless a SET TIME (with no parameters) is issued.  The interval
clock value is updated by a periodic IPL22 or IPL24 (depending on the specific
VAX) interrupt.  (When these interrupts are blocked as a result of the
activity of higher-IPL code -- such as extensive driver interrupt activity or
a hardware error -- the clock will "loose" time, and the time value reported
to the user with appear to have slowed down.)

Because the TOY has a resolution of 497 days, you need to issue a "SET TIME"
(with no parameters) at least once between January 1st and about April 11th of
each year.  The SET TIME is issued during various OpenVMS procedures such as
SHUTDOWN, and can be issued directly.  Issuing SET TIME resets the value
stored in the TOY, and updates the current year saved in the system image.

This usage is the reason that OpenVMS installation kits explicitly prompt for
the time during bootstrap, and why the time value can "get weird" if the
system crashes outside the 497 day window (if no SET TIME was issued to update
the saved values), and why the time value can "get weird" if a different
SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.EXE is used (alternate system disk, standalone BACKUP, etc).

On most (all?) VAX systems, the battery that is associated with the TOY clock
can be disconnected and replaced if (when) it fails -- TOY clock problems in
VAX systems do regularly get tracked back to a failed nicad or lithium battery
pack.

DOC10.  Where can I learn about how the VMS executive works internally?

The OpenVMS Internals and Data Structure book explains how the OpenVMS
executive works. The book covers the operating system kernel: process 
management; memory management; the I/O subsystem; and the mechanisms that 
transfer control to, from, and among these. It gives an overview of a particular
area of the system, followed by descriptions of the data structures related to
that area and details of the code that implements the area.

The first edition of the OpenVMS Alpha internals book describes Version 1.5. 
Although there have been several releases of  OpenVMS Alpha since Version 1.5 
(V6.1, V6.2, V7.0, and V7.1) and many details in the book are no longer 
accurate, it continues to provide a strong conceptual description of 
OpenVMS internals. 

This book has been split into five pieces, each to be updated separately.
The first such volume, published in early 1997, was "OpenVMS Alpha Internals 
and Data Structures: Scheduling and Process Control," which covers the 
Version 7.0 implementation of true multithreading and the changed scheduling 
model it implies.

The internals books are available through Digital Press, an imprint of
Butterworth-Heinemann. You can order by phone (from US and Canada, 
1-800-366-2655, or from elsewhere, 781-904-2500). You can also fax an order
to 1-800-446-6520 or 781-933-6333. The order form and additional information

DOC11.  Where can new users find tutorial information about OpenVMS?

First, see if your local site has information on this topic.  Each site can have
site-specific features and configuration.  Some sites will have site-specific
new user's documentation, covering various site-specific things that are
difficult or impossible for the general OpenVMS documentation to cover.

Various introductory manuals are available in the OpenVMS documentation set,
including the OpenVMS User's Guide.  Some of the OpenVMS manuals, including the

Y2K1.   Does OpenVMS have a problem with the year 2000?

There are Year 2000 (Y2K) ECO kits available for the following releases:

  OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2, V5.5-2H4, V6.2, and V7.1
  OpenVMS Alpha V6.2, V6.2-1H*, V7.1, and V7.1-1H*

No other Y2K ECO kits for other releases are currently planned.  OpenVMS
releases after these specified releases will have integrated Y2K support.
(These kits are currently available to customers with a support contract.)

For the official, most complete, and most current information on the status
of Y2K compliance of DIGITAL hardware and software products, including
OpenVMS and various OpenVMS layered products, please see:

  http://www.digital.com/year2000/

Information on the customer testing procedures that are recommended by
OpenVMS Engineering are also accessable via the above URL.


------------------------------------------------------------
Y2K2.  What happens with the C tm_year field in the year 2000?

The localtime() function and various other functions maintain the number
of years since 1900 in the "struct tm" structure member tm_year.  This
field will contain a value of 100 in the year 2000, and the yearly
incrementation is expected to continue.

The VAX C "two digit" documentation for this area is in error, the VAX C
Run-Time Library (RTL) returns a three-digit year.  

The VAX C RTL and the other integrated RTLs are covered under the OpenVMS
operating system Y2K evaluation.  For curent information on the Y2K status
of OpenVMS language compilers and layered products, see section Y2K1.


------------------------------------------------------------
Y2K3.  What happens with the year 2038 with C?

The C epoch typically uses a longword (known as time_t) to contain the number of
seconds since midnight on 1-Jan-1970.  At the current rate of consumption of
seconds, this longword is expected to overflow (when interpreted as a signed
longword) circa 03:14:07 on 19-Jan-2038 (GMT), as this time is circa 0x7FFFFFFF
seconds since the C base date.

One could see this longword time value used in any C program that manipulates
time using the standard C library routines, regardless of the particular
operating system platform.

There is currently no standard mechanism for dealing with this overflow (short
of promoting all longword integers to quadwords), as the format of the time_t
value is implementation-specific.  Some implementations and applications will
treat time_t as an unsigned longword value, while others treat it as a signed
longword value -- the format of time_t is specifically left up to the C compiler
implementation by the C standards.

Applications written in C will likely have to revisit something similar to the
current "Year 2000" evaluation process sometime prior to 2038.

The OpenVMS Y2K evaluation does not extend into 19-Jan-2038, or later.

For information on OpenVMS and 2038, please see the OpenVMS Y2K website.

------------------------------------------------------------
Y2K4.  Is the year 2000 a leap year?

The year 2000 is a leap year.  (That is, the year 2000 is a leap year
in the Gregorian calendar, the calendar that is currently used in most
parts of the world.)

The leap year algorithm that was created by Aloysius Giglio, Father
Christopher Clavius, and the Coucil of Trent for the Gregorian Calendar
dates back to the 16th Century.  The algorithm is simple, but effective:
the years that are evenly divisible by 4 are leap years, while the years
that are divisible by 100 are not, while the years that are divisible by
400 are.  Thus, 1800, 1900, and 2100 are not leap years, while 2000 is.

And whenever working with dates, please determine what the local calendar,
timezone, and daylight savings time rules are: the Gregorian calendar was
adopted in 1698 in some areas of the world, in 1752 in others, and in 1918
in yet others.  The specific rules vary both by geography and by date.

For further details on this, please see the DECwindows Calendar Help, or
please see the answer to DIGITAL SPR number 11-60903, dated 13-Oct-1983.


------------------------------------------------------------
Y2K5.  What is covered by the OpenVMS Y2K Evaluation?

All supported components of OpenVMS are covered by the OpenVMS Y2K
evaluation, including the language run-time libraries and the OpenVMS
system-integrated products such as shadowing and RMS journaling.

For information on other DIGITAL products, or for additional details on
the OpenVMS Y2K evaluation, please see http://www.digital.com/year2000/.

------------------------------------------------------------
Y2K6.  Do I need to consider Y2K?  Do I even need the Y2K ECO?

To answer this, you will need to trade off the risks of Y2K failures
with the time and money that will be spent performing a local Y2K
evaluation.  The performance of a Y2K evaluation is much like the
purchasing of insurance.

It is quite possible to create an entirely a Y2K safe environment
from tools and products that are not Y2K ready, just as it is also
possible to have serious Y2K problems in an environment based entirely
on Y2K ready products.  In other words -- short of knowing that the
product has catestrophic Y2K failures, and short of learning where
specific known Y2K problems lurk in the products -- you cannot really
determine with any certainty that your site is Y2K ready.

The only way to tell for certain that your site is Y2K safe is to
test your systems and your applications.  For some suggested testing
procedures, please see the OpenVMS Y2K website.

The OpenVMS operating system is in good shape in regard to Y2K, but
there are a few small areas of OpenVMS that do require an update for
Y2K readiness -- if you are certain that no local software is using
any these areas OpenVMS, then you will likely not require the update.
If you are not certain, then you have will likely need to test for
Y2K problems at your site, and you will also likely want to acquire
and install the update.  For details on the update process and on what
was found in OpenVMS, please see the information in the Y2K kits.

And you will obviously need to consider software products other than
OpenVMS when making your Y2K readiness determination, as well.

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT1.  What is an installed image?

The term "install" has two distinct meanings in OpenVMS.  The first relates to
"installing a product", which is done with either the SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL.COM
command procedure or the POLYCENTER Software Installation (PCSI) utility 
(PRODUCT command).  The second meaning relates to the use of the INSTALL
utility, which is what concerns us here.

The INSTALL utility is used to identify to OpenVMS a specific copy of an
image, either executable or shareable, which is to be given some set of
enhanced properties.  For example, when you issue the SET PASSWORD command,
the image SYS$SYSTEM:SETP0.EXE is run.  That image needs to have elevated
privileges to perform its function.

The other important attribute is /SHARED.  This means that shareable parts
of the image (typically read-only code and data) are loaded into memory
only once and are shared among all users on a system.  Executable images
can be installed /SHARED as well as shareable library images.  (The term
"shareable" has dual meanings here, too.  See the OpenVMS Programming
Concepts Manual for further details.)

It's important to note that there is no such thing as "installing a shareable
image with privileges".  The INSTALL utility will let you do it, but the
privileges you specify will be ignored.  To have a callable routine run with
enhanced privileges that are not available to its caller, you must construct
your routines as "user-written system services" and install the shareable
image with the /PROTECT qualifier.  See the OpenVMS Programming Concepts
Manual for more information on user-written system services.  Note also
that in many cases the need to grant privileges to an image can be replaced
with the use of the "Protected Subsystems" feature that grants a rights
identifier to an image.  See the OpenVMS Guide to System Security for
information on Protected Subsystems.

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT2.  Are there any known viruses for OpenVMS?

Viruses are very common on PCs because the PC operating systems such as MS-DOS
and MacOS do not implement any sort of scheme to protect the operating system
or the file system against hostile action by programs.  On these operating
systems, any running program can subvert the operating system and take over
the hardware, at which point it can do anything it wishes, including hiding
copies of itself in other programs or in the file system.

This is unlikely on VMS, Unix, MVS, and Windows NT, for two reasons.
First, the operating system runs in a privileged mode in memory that is
protected against modification by normal user programs.  Any old program
cannot take over the hardware as it can on PC operating systems.  Secondly,
VMS, Unix, MVS, and NT have file systems that can be set up so that
non-privileged programs cannot modify system programs and files on disk.  Both
of these protection schemes mean that traditional PC virus schemes don't work
on these OSes.

It is possible for VMS, etc., to be infected by viruses, but to do so, the
program containing the virus must be run from a user account that has
amplified privileges.  As long as the system administrator is careful that
only trusted applications are run from such accounts (and this is generally
the case), there is no danger from viruses.
					[winalski@gemgrp.enet.dec.com]

To protect against viruses and other attempts at system interference or
misuse, follow the recommendations in the "OpenVMS Guide to System  Security". 
You may also want to consider optional software products which can monitor
your system for intrusion or infection attempts.  Digital offers the 
following products in this area:

  DECinspect Intrusion Detector
  POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility
  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager

Rocksoft offers the Veracity data integrity tool (for info, send mail to
demo@rocksoft.com).

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT3.  How do I mount an ISO-9660 CD on OpenVMS?

ISO-9660 support was added in the following releases:

    OpenVMS VAX V6.0
    OpenVMS AXP V1.5
    OpenVMS VAX V5.5, use F11CD kit from InfoServer CD, or
                      Consolidated Distribution CD under InfoServer, or
		      Digital Customer Support - CSCPAT #1071012

Here's how to do it:

    $ MOUNT/MEDIA_FORMAT=CDROM  device-name[:] [volume-label]

Please refer to the OpenVMS MOUNT Utility Manual, especially the section
regarding the MOUNT qualifier /UNDEFINED_FAT. 

From the OpenVMS release notes:

  Because ISO-9660 media can be mastered from platforms that do not support
  semantics of files containing predefined record formats, you may encounter
  ISO-9660 CD-ROMs with files that contain records for which no record format
  was specified.

An example which works for most CD-ROMs is:

    $ MOUNT/MEDIA_FORMAT=CDROM/UNDEFINED_FAT=STREAM:2048 DUA0: FREEWARE

This /UNDEFINED_FAT qualifier states, "For any file whose file attributes are
'undefined', return file attributes of 'stream', maximum record length 2048".
					[dunham@star.enet.dec.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT4.  How do I extract the contents of a PCSI kit?

A growing number of OpenVMS products are being provided in PCSI
(POLYCENTER Software Installation) kits which are installed using the
PRODUCT INSTALL command.  These are alternatives to or replacement for
VMSINSTAL kits which were BACKUP savesets.  PCSI kits are not BACKUP
savesets and are structured differently from VMSINSTAL kits.

If you want to extract product files from a PCSI kit, create a directory
into which the kit should be expanded and use the following command:

    $ PRODUCT COPY prodname /SOURCE=[where-the-kit-is] -
      /DEST=[destination-directory] /FORMAT=REFERENCE

A PCSI kit file has a file specification of the following form:

    DEC-VAXVMS-FORTRAN-V0603-141-1.PCSI

In this example, "FORTRAN" is the "prodname".  PCSI will expand the kit
files into the directory you specify and subdirectories beneath such
as [SYSEXE], [SYSLIB], etc., reflecting the eventual destination of files
found there.  Most of the actual product files (images, etc.) will be in
the subdirectories.  In the top-level directory will be a file with the
file type PCSI$DESCRIPTION that specifies where various files should go.
For more details, see the POLYCENTER Software Installation Developer's 
Guide for OpenVMS, which can be found in the OpenVMS documentation on
the Consolidated Online Documentation CD-ROM.

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT5.  I've forgotten the SYSTEM password - what can I do?

If you need to break into an OpenVMS system because you do not have
access to any privileged passwords, such as the password to the SYSTEM
username, you  will need physical access to the system console, and you
will need to perform a conversational reboot.  Here are the steps:

  1.  Halt the system.  Exactly how this is done depends on the
      specific system model: Depending on the model, this can involve
      pressing the <HALT> button, entering <CTRL/P> on the console, or
      pressing the <BREAK> key on the console.

  2.  At the >>> console prompt, use a console command to boot into the
      SYSBOOT> utility.  (SYSBOOT allows conversational changes to system 
      parameters.)  The syntax for the conversational bootstrap varies by
      system model -- this typically involves specifying a flag of 1, for
      example:

        VAX:
          B/1
          B/R5:1
          @GENBOO

        Alpha:
          b -flags 0,1

      If your system has a non-zero system root (such as root SYSE, shown
      here), you will have to use a console command such as the following:

        VAX:
          B/E0000001
          B/R5:E0000001
          @<console media procedure name varies widely>

        Alpha:
          b -flags e,1
    
      If your system has a hardware password (various systems support
      a password that prevents unauthorized access to the console), you
      will need to know theis password and will need to enter it using
      the LOGIN command at the console.  If you get an "Inv Cmd" error
      trying to perform a conversational bootstrap, and you do not have
      the hardware console password for the console LOGIN command, you
      are stuck -- you will need to call for hardware service in order
      to reset the hardware console password.  The syntax used for the
      console password mechanism varies.

  3.  Once at the SYSBOOT> prompt, request that OpenVMS read the system
      startup commands directly from the system console, and that OpenVMS
      not record these parameter changes for subsequent system reboots:

        SET/STARTUP OPA0:
        SET WRITESYSPARAMS 0
        CONTINUE

  4.  At the $ prompt, the system will now be accepting startup commands
      directly from the console.  Type the following two DCL commands:

        SPAWN
        @SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP

      The result of these two commands will be the normal system startup,
      but you will be left logged in on the console, running under a
      privileged username.  Without the use of the SPAWN command, you
      would be logged out when the startup completes.

  5.  Use the following commands to reset the SYSTEM password:

        SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM:  ! or wherever SYSUAF.DAT resides
        RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
        MODIFY SYSTEM /PASSWORD=newpassword
        EXIT

      These steps will change the SYSTEM password to the specified new
      newpassword password value.

   Reboot the system normally -- the SYSTEM password should now be set to
   the value you specified in Step 5.

   Some people will suggest a method using the UAFALTERNATE SYSGEN parameter.
   This approach is not always reliable and is not recommended, as there can
   easily be an alternate user authorization file configured on the system.

   For further information on emergency startup and shutdown, as well as for
   the official OpenVMS documentation on how to change the SYSTEM password
   from the console in an emergency, please see the OpenVMS System Manager's
   Manual in the OpenVMS documentation set.

   You can also use the conversational bootstrap technique shown above (the
   steps through Step 3) to alter various system parameters.  At the SYSBOOT>
   prompt, you can enter new parameters values:

     SHOW MAXPROCESSCNT
     SET . 64
     CONTINUE

   The "." is a shorthand notation used for the last parameter examined.

MGMT6.  How do I connect a PostScript printer via TCP/IP?

Using UCX as the TCP/IP stack, it is possible to setup queues using the 
UCX$TELNETSYM in order to print to postscript printers.  This assumes 
however that the printer itself can convert whatever is passed to it into 
something intelligible.  As an example, if the printer has an IP address 
of 123.456.789.101 and jobs should be passed to port 9100 then :
$ INITIALIZE/QUEUE/ON="123.456.789.101:9100"/PROCESSOR=UCX$TELNETSYM  -
		my_ip_queue

The port number of 9100 is typical of HP JetDirect cards but may be 
different for other manufacturers cards.

As a better alternative, DCPS Version 1.4 will support IP queues using 
either Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS software or Cisco Multinet for 
OpenVMS.  The usage of this type of interface is documented in the 
Release Notes and the DCPS$STARTUP.TEMPLATE file.

MGMT7.  Why can't I do a SET TIME command?

Q: Trying to set the time with SET TIME on my system returns one of these 
messages:

%SET-E-NOTSET, error modifying time
-SYSTEM-F-IVSSRQ, invalid system service request

%SET-E-NOTSET, error modifying time
-SYSTEM-E-TIMENOTSET, time service enabled; enter a time service command to 
update the time

A: This occurs if the time on the local system is controlled by a time service 
software, for example the distributed time service software (DTSS) provided as 
part of the DECnet/OSI installation. The DTSS software communicates with one or 
more time servers to obtain the current time. It entirely controls the local 
system time (for DECnet/OSI, there is a process named DTSS$CLERK for this); 
therefore, the usage of the SET TIME command (and the underlying $SETTIM system 
service) is disabled.

The first message is displayed on systems running DECnet/OSI V6.1 and earlier.
On systems with newer DECnet/OSI (DECnet-Plus) software, the second (and more 
informative) message is given.

You shouldn't have to change the time manually - you should be doing this
through the time server - but if you insist...  you'll have to shutdown DTSS:

$ MCR NCL
NCL> DISABLE DTSS
NCL> DELETE DTSS

This will shutdown DTSS$CLERK. You may then change the system time as usual.
To restart the DTSS software, type

@SYS$STARTUP:DTSS$STARTUP

You'll need a lot of privs : (CMKRNL,SYSPRV,OPER,SYSNAM,PRMMBX,NETMBX,LOG_IO,
ALTPRI) and must be granted the NET$MANAGE identifer to shutdown and 
restart DTSS.

MGMT8. How do I change the timezone differential and time in batch?

To change the timezone differential and the time when the change to/from
Daylight Saving Time (DST) occurs, use SYS$MANAGER:UTC$CONFIGURE_TDF.COM. To
use this as batch job, please note:
  P1 = SET, set the time.
  P2 = signed timezone differential from UTC in minutes.
    -360 for standard time (for Chicago)
    -300 for DST (for Chicago)
  P3 = signed time change in minutes.  If +, enclose in quotes.
    -60 to go from DST to standard time
    "+60" to go from standard time to DST

Going from standard time to DST (for Chicago):

$ SUBMIT/AFTER="<date>+02:00" SYS$MANAGER:UTC$CONFIGURE_TDF -
    /PAR=(SET,-300,"+60")

Going from DST to standard time (for Chicago):

$ SUBMIT/AFTER="<date>+02:00" SYS$MANAGER:UTC$CONFIGURE_TDF -
    /PAR=(SET,-360,-60)

If you use this com file interactively, the times are given as signed
hour:minute, so that -360 minutes is given as -6:00.

Before and after the com file runs, check the system time and the logical
SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL.  The logical has the offset from UTC in seconds.

Current DST rules for some countries:
1. United States and Canada:
  DST begins on the first Sunday of April (2am => 3am)
  DST ends on the last Sunday of October (2am => 1am)
2. UK, France, Germany, Spain:
  DST begins on the last Sunday of March (2am => 3am)
  DST ends on the last Sunday of October (3am => 2am)
3. Australia:
  DST begins on the last Sunday of October (2am => 3am)
  DST ends on the last Sunday of March (2am => 1am)
4. Singapore:
  No DST change

MGMT9.  How do I change the node name of an OpenVMS System?

  The first step is to get a BACKUP of the system disk before making
  any changes -- use the system disk backup procedures as documented
  in the OpenVMS System Management Manual, making sure to use the
  procedures and commands appropriate for the system disk.

  Changing the node name involves a number of steps -- the node name
  tends to be imbedded in a number of different data files around the
  system.

    Update the SCSNODE in MODPARAMS.DAT, and then run AUTOGEN as
      far as the SETPARAMS phase.  (Do not reboot yet.)
    Modify the DECnet node name.  (NETCONFIG is the DECnet Phase
      IV tool, and NET$CONFIGURE is the DECnet-Plus tool.)
    Modify the IP node name.  (The UCX tool is UCX$CONFIG.)
    Modify the host node name on the various queues in the queue
      database.  (each queue has a host name, and it defaults to
      the SCS node name of the queue's host system.  See the command
      INIT/QUEUE/ON=node for information.)
    Modify the node name saved in any application databases, or any
      local node-conditional operations present in the site-specific
      system startup, etc.  (SEARCH for the node name, specifying
      all types of files.)
    Rename the SYS$NODE_oldnodename rightslist identifier to match
      the new name.  (Do not change the binary value of this
      identifier.)
    Reset any license PAKs that are restricted to the old node name
      to the new node name.
    Reboot the node or -- if in a VMScluster -- reboot the whole
      VMScluster.  (This tends to catch any errors immediately.)

  There are likely a few other areas where the nodename will be stored.

  If the system is configured in a VMScluster and you change *either*
  the SCSNODE or the SCSSYSTEMID -- but *not* both values -- then you
  will have to reboot the entire VMScluster.  (The VMScluster remembers
  the mapping between these two values, and will assume that a
  configuration problem has occured if a mismatched pair appears, and
  will refuse to let a node with a mismatched pair join the VMScluster.)

  I expect I may have missed one or two configuration tools (or more!)
  that are needed at your site -- the node name tends to get stored all
  over the place, in layered products, and in local software...

					[Steve Hoffman]

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT10. What is the correct value for EXPECTED_VOTES in a VMScluster?

The VMScluster connection manager uses the concept of votes and quorum
to prevent disk and memory data corruptions -- when sufficient votes are
present for quorum, then access to resources is permitted.  When sufficient
votes are not present, user activity will be blocked.  The act of blocking
user activity is called a "quorum hang", and is better thought of as a
"user data integrity interlock".  This mechanism is designed to prevent
a partitioned VMScluster, and the resultant massive disk data corruptions.

On each OpenVMS node in a VMScluster, one sets two values in SYSGEN: VOTES,
and EXPECTED_VOTES.  The former is how many votes the node contributes to
the VMScluster.  The latter is the total number of votes expected when the
full VMScluster is bootstrapped.

Some sites erroneously attempt to set EXPECTED_VOTES too low, believing
this will allow when only a subset of voting nodes are present in a
VMScluster.  It does not.  Further, an erroneous setting in EXPECTED_VOTES
is automatically corrected once VMScluster connections to other nodes are
established, meaning user data is at risk of severe corruption only during
the initial system bootstrap.

One can operate a VMScluster with one, two, or many voting nodes.  With
any but the two-node configuration, keeping a subset of the nodes active
when some nodes fail can be easily configured.  With the two-node
configuration, one must use a primary-secondary configuration (where the
primary has all the votes), a peer configuration (where when either node
is down, the other hangs), or (preferable) a shared quorum disk.

Use of a quorum disk does slow down VMScluster transitions somewhat --
the addition of a third voting node that contributes the vote(s) that
would be assigned to the quorum disk makes for faster transitions -- but
the use of a quorum disk does mean that either node in a two-node VMScluster
configuration can operate when the other node is down.

In a two-node VMScluster with a shared storage interconnect, typically each
node has one vote, and the quorum disk also has one vote.  EXPECTED_VOTES
is set to three.

Using a quorum disk on a non-shared interconnect is unnecessary -- the
use of a quorum disk does not provide any value, and the votes assigned
to the quorum disk should be assigned to the OpenVMS host serving access
to the disk.

For information on quorum hangs, see the OpenVMS documentation.  For
information on changing the EXPECTED_VOTES value on a running system,
see the SET CLUSTER/EXPECTED_VOTES command, and see the OpenVMS system
console documentation for the processor-specific console commands used
to trigger the IPC (Interrrupt Priority Level %x0C; IPL C) handler.
The IPC handler can be used to clear a quorum hang, and to clear disk
mount verification hangs.

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT11. Why doesn't OpenVMS see the new memory I just added?

When adding memory to an OpenVMS system, one should check for an existing
definition of the PHYSICALPAGES (OpenVMS VAX) or PHYSICAL_MEMORY (OpenVMS
Alpha) parameter in the SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT parameter database, use
a text editor to reset the value in the file to the new correct value as
required, and then perform the following command:

  $ @SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN GETDATA REBOOT FEEDBACK

This AUTOGEN command will reset various system parameters based on recent
system usage (FEEDBACK), and it will reset the value for the PHYSICALPAGES
parameter to the new value.  It will also reboot the OpenVMS system.
  
PHYSICALPAGES and PHYSICAL_MEMORY can also be used to deliberately lower
the amount of memory available for use by OpenVMS.  This ability can be
useful in a few specific circumstances, such as testing the behaviour of
an application in a system environment with a particular (lower) amount
of system memory available.

PHYSICALPAGES and PHYSICAL_MEMORY can be set to -1, to indicate that
all available memory should be used.

MGMT12. How do I write a BACKUP saveset to a remote tape?

How to do this correctly was described at DECUS a long time ago. On the
node with the tape drive, create SAVE-SET.FDL:

RECORD
        FORMAT                  fixed
        SIZE                    8192

Then create BACKUP_SERVER.COM:

$ !
$ ! BACKUP_SERVER.COM - provide remote tape service for BACKUP.
$ !
$ set verify
$ set noon
$ define mu $90$mua93:   ! or whatever your real tape drive is
$ set rms/network=16
$ mount/nounl/over:id/block=8192 mu:
$ convert/fdl=SAVE-SET sys$net mu:save-set.
$ dismount/unl mu:
$ set noverify

On the node where you want to do the backup, do:

$ BACKUP input-spec node::"TASK=BACKUP_SERVER" /BLOCK=8192

The only thing that doesn't completely work here is multi-reel savesets.
Since the tape is being written through RMS and the magtape ACP, BACKUP
won't see the reel switch and will split an XOR group across the reel
boundary. As far as I remember, BACKUP will be willing to read such a
multi-reel save set (directly, not over the net) since the XOR blocks
are simply ignored on read, but it definitely wouldn't be able to do a
recovery across the reel boundary.

Unfortunately BACKUP can't read tapes over the network because the RMS
file attributes on a network task access look wrong (variable length
records).

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT13. Tell me about SET HOST/DUP and SET HOST/HSC

The OpenVMS DCL commands SET HOST/DUP and SET HOST/HSC are used to connect to
storage controllers via the Diagnostics and Utility Protocol (DUP).  These
commands require that the FYDRIVER device driver be connected.  This device
driver connection is typically performed by adding the following command(s) into
the system startup command procedure:

    On OpenVMS Alpha:
      $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSMAN
      SYSMAN> IO CONNECT FYA0/NOADAPTER/DRIVER=SYS$FYDRIVER

    On OpenVMS VAX:
      $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
      SYSGEN> CONNECT FTA0/NOADAPTER

Alternatives to the DCL SET HOST/DUP command include the console >>> SET HOST
command available on various mid- to recent-vintage VAX consoles:

    Access to Parameters on an Embedded DSSI controller:
      >>> SET HOST/DUP/DSSI[/BUS:{0:1}] dssi_node_number PARAMS

    Access to Directory of tools on an Embedded DSSI controller:
      >>> SET HOST/DUP/DSSI[/BUS:{0:1}] dssi_node_number DIRECT

    Access to Parameters on a KFQSA DSSI controller:
      >>> SHOW UQSSP ! to get port_controller_number PARAMS
      >>> SET HOST/DUP/UQSSP port_controller_number PARAMS

These console commands are available on most MicroVAX and VAXstation 3xxx
series systems, and most (all?) VAX 4xxx series systems.  For further
information, see the system documentation and -- on most VAX systems -- see
the console HELP text.

EK-410AB-MG, _DSSI VAXcluster Installation and Troubleshooting_, is a good
resource for setting up a DSSI VMScluster on OpenVMS VAX nodes. (This manual
predates coverage of OpenVMS Alpha systems, but gives good coverage to all
hardware and software aspects of setting up a DSSI-based VMScluster -- and
most of the concepts covered are directly applicable to OpenVMS Alpha systems. 
This manual specifically covers the hardware, which is something not covered
by the standard OpenVMS VMScluster documentation.)

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT14. How do I install DECnet Phase IV on VMS 7.1?

On OpenVMS V7.1, all DECnet binaries were relocated into separate installation
kits -- you can selectively install the appropriate network: DECnet-Plus
(formerly known as DECnet OSI), DECnet Phase IV, and DIGITAL TCP/IP Services
(often known as UCX).

On OpenVMS versions prior to V7.1, DECnet Phase IV was integrated, and there
was no installation question.  You had to install the DECnet-Plus (DECnet OSI)
package on the system, after the OpenVMS upgrade or installation completed.

During an OpenVMS V7.1 installation or upgrade, the installation procedure
will query you to learn if DECnet-Plus should be installed. If you are
upgrading to V7.1 from an earlier release or are installing V7.1 from a
distribution kit, simply answer "NO" to the question asking you if you want
DECnet-Plus.  Then -- after the OpenVMS upgrade or installation completes --
use the PCSI PRODUCT INSTALL command to install the DECnet Phase IV binaries
from the kit provided on the OpenVMS software distribution kit.

If you already have DECnet-Plus installed and wish to revert, you must
reconfigure OpenVMS.  You cannot reconfigure the "live" system, hence you must
reboot the system using the V7.1 distribution CD-ROM.  Then select the DCL
($$$ prompt) option.  Then issue the commands:

    $$$ DEFINE/SYSTEM PCSI$SYSDEVICE DKA0:
    $$$ DEVINE/STSTEM PCSI$SPECIFIC DKA0:[SYS0.]
    $$$ PRODUCT RECONFIGURE VMS /REMOTE/SOURCE=DKA0:[VMS$COMMON]

The above commands assume that the target system device and system root are
"DKA0:[SYS0.]".  Replace this with the actual target device and root, as
appropriate.  The RECONFIGURE command will then issue a series of prompts. 
You will want to reconfigure DECnet-Plus off the system, obviously.  You will
then want to use the PCSI command PRODUCT INSTALL to install the DECnet Phase
IV kit from the OpenVMS distribution media.

Information on DECnet support, and on the kit names, is included in the
OpenVMS V7.1 installation and upgrade documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT15. How do I change the text in a user's UIC identifier?

The text translations of the numeric User Identification Code (UIC) are based
on identifiers present in the OpenVMS rightslist.  Documentation on this area
is included in the _Guide to OpenVMS System Security_ manual.

To control the identifiers shown for a user's UIC, you use AUTHORIZE. Each
user has an associated group identifier, and an identifier specific to the
user.  And each user should have a unique UIC.

To alter the text of a user or group identifier, use commands such as:

    $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE
    UAF> rename/ident oldgroupid newgroupid
    UAF> rename/ident olduserid  newuserid

If you should find yourself missing an identifier for a particular user, you
can add one for the user's UIC using a command such as:

    UAF> add/ident/value=uic=[group,user] newuserid

The UIC user identifier text is assigned when the username is created, and is
the text of the username.  The UIC group group identifier is assigned when the
first username is created in the UIC group, and the text is based on the
account name specified for the first user created in the group.  The value of
this identifier is [groupnumber, 177777]. To add a missing group identifier,
use an asterisk as follows:

    UAF> add/ident/value=uic=[group,*] newgroupid

You may find cases where an identifier is missing from time to time, as there
are cases where the creation of a UIC group name identifier might conflict
with an existing username, or a user identifier might conflict with an
existing group identifier.  When these conflicts arise, the AUTHORIZE utility
will not create the conflicting group and/or user identifier when the username
is created.

You can can add and remove user-specified identifiers, but you should avoid
changing the numeric values associated with any existing identifiers.  You
should also avoid reusing UICs or identifiers when you add new users, as any
existing identifiers that might be present on objects in the system from the
old user will grant the same access to the new user.  Please see the security
manual for details.

------------------------------------------------------------
MGMT16. What are the OpenVMS version upgrade paths?

   Note: See "OpenVMS Alpha Terminology" section, below.

   OpenVMS Alpha release upgrade (or update) paths:

     From V1.0, one can upgrade to V1.5.
     From V1.5, or V1.5-1H1, one can upgrade to V6.1.
     From V6.1, one can upgrade to V6.2.
     From V6.2, one can update to V6.2-1H1, V6.2-1H2, or V6.2-1H3.
     From V6.1, or V6.2, one can upgrade to V7.0.
     From V6.1, V6.2, V6.2-1H(1,2,3), or V7.0, one can upgrade to V7.1.
     From V7.1, one can update to V7.1-1H(1,2).

     Some typical OpenVMS Alpha upgrade (or update) paths are:
         V1.0 -> V1.5 -> V6.1 -> (V6.2, V7.0, or V7.1)
         V6.2 -> V6.2-1H3
         V1.5-1H1 -> V6.1 -> (V6.2, V7.0, or V7.1)
         V6.2-1H(1,2,3) -> V7.1
         V7.1 -> V7.1-1H(1,2)

     Note that OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 does not include support for hardware
     and/or configurations first supported in OpenVMS Alpha V6.2-1H1,
     V6.2-1H2, or V6.2-1H3; one must upgrade to OpenVMS VAX V7.1.

     One cannot update directly to a V6.2-1Hx Limited Hardware Release
     (LHR) from any release prior to the baseline V6.2 release.  The
     same prohibition holds for performing updates directly to V7.1-1Hx
     from any release prior to V7.1 -- this is not supported, and does
     not produce the expected results.  The LHR kits can, however, be
     directly booted and can be directly installed, without regard to
     any operating system that might be present on the target disk.

     OpenVMS Alpha updates for LHRs (through V7.1-1Hx) require the use
     of VMSINSTAL for the update.  These LHR releases use PCSI for the
     installation, but not for the update.  Non-LHR releases use PCSI
     for installs and upgrades.


   OpenVMS VAX release upgrade paths:

     From V5.0 through V5.4-3 inclusive, one can upgrade to V5.5.
     From V5.5, V5.5-1, or V5.5-2HW, one can upgrade to V5.5-2.
     From V5.5, V5.5-1, or V5.5-2, one can upgrade to V6.0.
     From V5.5-2, V5.5-2H4, or V6.0, one can upgrade to V6.1.
     From V6.0, or V6.1, one can upgrade to V6.2.
     From V6.1, or V6.2, one can upgrade to V7.0.
     From V6.1, V6.2, or V7.0, one can upgrade to V7.1.

     Some typical OpenVMS VAX upgrade paths are:
         V5.x -> V5.5 -> V6.0 -> V6.2 -> (V7.0, or V7.1)
         V5.5-2, or V5.5-2H4 -> V6.1 -> (V6.2, V7.0, or V7.1)

     Note that OpenVMS VAX V6.0 does not include support for hardware
     and/or configurations first added in OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2H4, one
     must upgrade to OpenVMS VAX V6.1.


   VMScluster Rolling Upgrades:

     Rolling Upgrades require multiple system disks.  Rolling upgrades
     permit the VMScluster to remain available while individual systems
     are being upgraded to a new OpenVMS release.

     VMScluster rolling upgrades for both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha
     may (will) have different, or additional upgrade requirements, and
     have requirements around which versions of OpenVMS can coexist
     in a VMScluster than what is listed here.

     See the _OpenVMS <platform> Version <Version> Upgrade and Installation
     Manual_, and the OpenVMS Software Product Descriptions
     (http://www.openvms.digital.com/openvms/spd/list.html) for further
     details on the rolling upgrade, and for support information.  The
     documentation for older releases of OpenVMS VAX includes various
     platform-specific manuals, manuals that include instructions that
     are specific to installing and upgrading on the platform.


   OpenVMS Alpha Terminology:

     update:    Typically used for Limited Hardware Releases (LHR)
                releases.  Performed via VMSINSTAL.  Applies only
                to the OpenVMS release that the LHR is based on,
                or to an intermediate LHR.  (eg: V7.1-1H2 applies only
                to V7.1-1H1 and to V7.1, not to any other releases.)
	        LHRs within a series are cumulative, containing all
	        files and features of previous LHRs in the same series.

     upgrade:   Performed via PCSI.  Upgrades can typically be applied
                to a release-specific (and documented) range of prior
	        OpenVMS releases.

     install:   Performed via PCSI.  With an installation, no existing
	version of the operating system is assumed present, nor
	are any files from any copy of the operating system might
	be present preserved, and the entire contents of the target
	disk are destroyed via a disk initialization.

     preserve:  Performed via PCSI.  Otherwise similar to an installation,
	this option skips the disk reinitialization.  User files

MGMT17. Why do I have negative number in the pagefile reservable pages?

Seeing a negative number in the reservable pages portion of the SHOW 
MEMORY/FULL command can be normal and expected, and is (even) documented 
behaviour.  A pagefile with a negative number of reservable pages is
overcommitted, which is generally goodness assuming that every process with
reserved pages does not try to occupy all of the reserved pagefile  space at
the same time. 

To understand how the pagefile reservation process works, think about  how a
traditional bank operates when accepting customer deposits and  making loans. 
It's the same idea with the pagefile space. There is  less money in the bank
vault than the total deposits, because much of  the money has been loaned out
to other customers of the bank.  And the behaviour parallels that of the
pagefile down to the problems that a  "run on the bank" can cause for banking
customers.  (Though there is  no deposit insurance available for pagefile
users.)

If all of the running applications try to use the reserved space, the system
manager will need to enlarge the pagefile or add one or more additional
pagefules.

To determine if the pagefile is excessively overcommitted, watch for "double
overcommitment" -- when the reservable space approaches the  negatation of the
available total space -- and watch that the total  amount of free space
available in the pagefile remains adequate.  If  either of these situations
arises, additional pagefile storage is required.

Additional pagefile information: Additional pagefiles can typically be 
created and connected on a running OpenVMS system.  New processes and  new
applications will tend to use the new pagefile, and existing  applications can
be restarted to migrate out of the more congested  pagefiles.  Pagefiles are
generally named PAGEFILE.SYS, and multiple  pagefiles are generally configured
on separate disk spindles to spread  the paging I/O load across the available
disk storage.  When multiple  pagefiles are present on recent OpenVMS
versions, each pagefile file  should be configured to be approximately the
same total size as the  other pagefiles.

For additional information on pagefile operations and related commands, see
the system management and performance management manuals in the  OpenVMS
documentation set.

MGMT18. Do I have to update layered products when updating OpenVMS?

The Software Public Rollout Reports for OpenVMS list the current and future
availability of Compaq's software products shipping on the Software Products
Library kits (CDROM consolidations) for OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX. 
Specifically, the required minimum versions for product support are listed.

Comprehensive Public Rollout Information, listing previous product versions as
well as currently shipping versions, has been compiled into a separate set of
reports.  The product information is grouped to show Operating System support.

You may or may not be able to use older versions of local applications,
third-party products, and various Compaq layered products with more recent
versions of OpenVMS.  User-mode code is expected to be upward compatible. 
Code executing in a privileged processor mode -- typically either executive or
kernel mode -- may or may not be compatible with more recent OpenVMS versions.

These reports are updated monthly.

MAIL1.  How do I send Internet mail?

There is no one answer to this question.  Internet mail is built upon the
TCP/IP protocols, which are not directly supported by VMS.  A number of
implementations of TCP/IP for VMS are available, from Digital, from a number
of other vendors, and even in a free "support it yourself" form.  The MAIL
program that comes with VMS does not directly support the mail format used on
the Internet, but various programs have been written that use MAIL's "foreign
protocol" facility to provide such support.  To send mail through a foreign
protocol by using an address syntax like IN%"fred@fred-host.xxx.com".  You
*must* include the quotation marks  Between them is the address in the format
used by mail programs that support the Internet directly.  The IN% - short for
INternet - names the foreign protocol.  On some systems, you use MX% or SMTP%
instead. (MX is a widely used, free, mail handler; see question  SOFT1. SMTP%
is used by Digital's UCX TCP/IP product)  Other systems may use some other
name.  If none of these prefixes work, ask your system manager for assistance.
					[leichter@lrw.com]

See also MAIL2.

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL2.  How do I get IN% or MX% added automatically to Internet addresses?

Get the MAILSHR_PATCH package (there's one each for VAX and Alpha) from the 
WKU FILESERV server (see question SOFT1.)

As of OpenVMS V6.2, this is not necessary - if the address has an @
in it (not in a quoted string), MAIL will look to see if the logical name
MAIL$INTERNET_TRANSPORT is defined.  If it is, it will use the translation
as the transport protocol, otherwise it will use SMTP (as is used by
UCX).  For example, if you wanted IN% added, you'd define 
MAIL$INTERNET_TRANSPORT as "IN".

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL3.  How do I automatically append a signature file to my mail messages?

OpenVMS 7.0 adds the ability to automatically append signature files - in
MAIL, use the SET SIGNATURE command to specify a signature file name.
For earlier versions, see the following paragraphs.

The basic MAIL utility which is shipped with VMS does not have an intrinsic
mechanism for adding signature files.  If you're using an enhanced mail
handling package (e.g PMDF), however, it may have provisions for adding
signature files to all messages it handles - check the documentation for
details.  In addition, it's common practice to use an editor to handle
addition of `quotation marks' (e.g. >) and signature files to mail messages
and news postings.  There are several implementations of this for different
editors available on the net; for one example, see the MAIL_EDIT package
available at 
  ftp://narnia.memst.edu/mail_edit_v1-4.zip
					[bailey@genetics.upenn.edu]

Define the logical MAIL$EDIT to a COM-file, which looks something like
the following:

$ IF P1 .NES. ""
$ THEN
$    COPY 'P1',<signaturefile> 'P2'
$ ELSE
$    COPY <signaturefile> 'P2'
$ ENDIF
$ DEFINE/NOLOG SYS$INPUT SYS$COMMAND
$ <editorname> 'P2'
$ EXIT

Where <signaturefile> is the name of the signature-file (including directory
and disk) and <editorname> is EDIT/EDT or EDIT/TPU (or your favorite editor).

MAIL4.  Do I have to use VMS MAIL?  I like my Unix mailer better.

Several Unix mailers have been ported to VMS, some by the vendors of specific
TCP/IP packages, some by users who have made them freely available.  See the
documentation for your TCP/IP package, and refer to question SOFT1 for
information about the availability of the free ports.
					[Jerry Leichter]

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL5.  How can I forward my mail?  Can I forward it to an Internet address?

You can use the SET FORWARD command within MAIL to specify where you want all
your mail forwarded to.  Use SHOW FORWARD to see your current forwarding.  To
cancel all forwarding, type SET NOFORWARD.

You can forward your mail to an Internet address, but you have to be careful
because of the way MAIL handles special characters, such as quotation marks.
First, determine the address you would use to send mail to the place you want
to forward to - say, IN%"fred@fred-host.xxx.com".  Take that string and
*double all the quotation marks*, producing IN%""fred@fred-host.xxx.com"".
Finally, wrap quotation marks around the outside and use the the result with
SET FORWARD:

	MAIL>SET FORWARD "IN%""fred@fred-host.xxx.com"""

If you do SHOW FORWARD, you should now see:

	Your mail is being forwarded to IN%"fred@fred-host.xxx.com".
					[leichter@lrw.com]

Note that the MAIL$INTERNET_TRANSPORT feature doesn't yet work with
SET FORWARD in that you'll still have to use the syntax above with the
quotation marks.

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL6.  How can I forward my mail to a list of addresses?

VMS MAIL does not support forwarding a message to more than one address.
(Older versions of MAIL allowed you to specify such forwarding, but it never
worked correctly.)

Many of the TCP/IP mail packages support forwarding to mailing lists, as does
the free MX mail handling system and the DELIVER mail "extender".  See the
documentation of your TCP/IP package and question SOFT1.
					[leichter@lrw.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL7.  MAIL keeps saying I have new messages, but I don't.  What do I do?

The count of new mail messages is kept separately from your mail folder
in SYS$SYSTEM:VMSMAIL_PROFILE.DATA.  It sometimes happens that this count
differs from what's in your mail folder.  If this happens, go into MAIL
and repeat the READ/NEW command until you see no new mail messages.  Then
enter the command one more time.  This will resynchronize the counters.

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL8.  How do I move all of my mail messages to another system?

If you are moving to another OpenVMS system, perhaps the best way is to select
each folder and do (in MAIL) a:

	EXTRACT/APPEND/ALL/MAIL mymail.mai

Move MYMAIL.MAI to the other system, then do this (in MAIL):

	SET FILE mymail.mai
	COPY/ALL foldername MAIL.MAI

This will place a copy of all of your messages in the given folder.  If
you wanted to maintain the separate folders, do separate EXTRACT commands
(above) specifying different .mai files, then repeat the SET FILE, COPY
for each one.

If you are moving to a non-OpenVMS system, the EXTRACT command above can
be used to create a file which you can then copy - how you import it into
your mailer is an exercise left to the reader.

------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL9.  How do I send or read attachments in VMS MAIL?

Is there any way to send or read mail with files as attachments from VMS?

Not directly with the OpenVMS MAIL facility, but there are 
several other options:

1. Install PINE, available commercially from Innosoft (www.innosoft.com) or
   free from Andy Harper (ftp://ftp2.kcl.ac.uk/zip).  With PINE you can
   both send and read,if you have the appropriate viewers, MIME mail.

2. If you're working from an X11 server use the OpenVMS version of Netscape
   Navigator.  This option is ok for sending mail, but is not optimal for
   reading it, since Netscape will use POP and remove messages entirely 
   the OpenVMS MAIL system, which is not generally what you want.

3. MPACK/MUNPACK.  To send a MIME mail, construct the message with
   attachments manually using MPACK.  You cannot send the resulting file
   directly through MAIL because an extra  blank header line will be
   inserted between your message and the OpenVMS MAIL headers, which will
   cause the message to appear as plain text in most mail programs.  Some
   TCP/IP stacks provide a work around for this problem, and if that
   doesn't work, you should generally be able to force the message directly
   into the SMTP port of your mail machine.  Examples of both methods are
   in: http://seqaxp.bio.caltech.edu/pub/SOFTWARE/mmail.com 

   To read a MIME mail message, open it in MAIL, extract it to a file, then
   use MUNPACK to break out and decode the attachments.

UTIL1.  How do I play an audio CD on my workstation?

If you've installed the DECwindows examples, you'll find
DECW$CDPLAYER.C, .DAT, .EXE, .UIL, and .UID.  Copy the .UID and .DAT
files to DECW$USER_DEFAULTS: (typically SYS$LOGIN:), define the logical name
DECW$CD_PLAYER to be the device name of your CD-ROM drive (eg. DKA400:),
give yourself PHY_IO and DIAGNOSE privileges, and run the .EXE.  You can
also install the image with these privileges.  See the source for
additional details - note that the comments regarding the need for
SYSGEN CONNECT are no longer applicable (at least as of VMS V5.5-2).

There's also SYS$EXAMPLES:CDROM_AUDIO.C and .EXE, a non-Motif program.

------------------------------------------------------------
UTIL2.  How do I access a MS-DOS floppy disk from OpenVMS?

The Digital Pathworks for OpenVMS product includes a utility called PCDISK
that can read and write MS-DOS format diskette.  A license for Pathworks
is as little as US$99 (QM-2CLAA-AA, File and Print Access license).

ProGIS in Germany sells a product called VMove which supports DOS files on
many different device types.  For more information, send mail to
info@progis.rmi.de.

Engineering Software has a product called VAKSAT which will
read/write/erase files on DOS diskettes. Available for both VAX and Alpha.
Contact ed@cityscape.co.uk for more information.

MadGoat PC Exchange (PCX) is a utility for copying files to and from
MS-DOS format diskettes under VMS, using an RX23 (3.5"), RX26 (3.5"),
or RX33 (5.25") diskette drive.  For 3.5" diskettes, high-density
disks can be read or written; double-density disks are read-only. Only
high-density disks are supported on the RX33.

UTIL3.  How do I play sound files on an AlphaStation?  DECsound doesn't work

The new AlphaStation systems use a different sound board (Microsoft Sound
System) than the earlier DEC 3000 AXP systems, and DECsound, as supplied by
DECwindows Motif, doesn't support this board.  Digital offers an optional
product, Multimedia Services for OpenVMS (SPD 64.24.00), which provides a
replacement DECsound for this card as well as many other features (an AVI and
MPEG player, video capture support, etc.)



------------------------------------------------------------
DCL1.   How do I run a program with arguments?

The RUN command does not accept arguments.  To pass arguments to a program,
you must use what is called a "foreign command".  For example:

	$ uudecode :== $disk:[dir]uudecode.exe
	$ uudecode filespec

The leading $ in the symbol definition is what makes it a foreign command. If
the device and directory is omitted, SYS$SYSTEM: is assumed.  

Under OpenVMS V6.2 and later, DCL supports automatic foreign command
definition via the logical name DCL$PATH:.  An example of a definition of this
logical name is:

    $ DEFINE DCL$PATH SYS$DISK:[],ddcu:[mytooldir],SYS$SYSTEM:

DCL will first look for a command in the DCL command table, and if no match is
found and if DCL$PATH is defined, it will then look for command procedures and
executable images with filenames matching the command specified, in the
directories specified via DCL$PATH.  The first match found is invoked, and
under OpenVMS, the DCL$PATH support will cause a command procedure to be
activated in preference to an executable image.

For more information on foreign commands or on automatic foreign command
support, see the OpenVMS User's Manual.

See also question PROG2.

If you want to create a detached process that takes arguments from a command
line, it must be run under the control of a command line interpreter (CLI)
(typically DCL).  This is done by placing the command line in a file,
specifying SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT.EXE as the image to run and the command file as
the input.  For example:

	$ OPEN/WRITE CMD TEMP_INPUT.COM
	$ WRITE CMD "$ MYCOMMAND arguments"
	$ CLOSE CMD
	$ RUN/DETACHED SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT /INPUT=TEMP_INPUT.COM

Various OpenVMS library calls (such as lib$spawn(), cli$dcl_parse(), and the C
library system() call) require access to a command line interpreter such as
DCL to perform requested actions, and will not operate if a CLI is not
available.

When a CLI is not available, these calls typically return the error status
SS$_NOCLI.  And as mentioned above, invoke the image LOGINOUT to cause a CLI
(such as DCL) to be mapped into and made available in the context of the
target process.

DCL2.   How can I redefine control keys in DCL?

The DCL DEFINE/KEY command allows you to define function and keypad
keys, but not control keys.  Also, keys you define with DEFINE/KEY are
not recognized inside applications.  Many applications which use the
SMG$ routines for input have a similar DEFINE/KEY feature.

The terminal driver line-editing control keys, including the use of DEL
for delete, are not modifiable.

------------------------------------------------------------
DCL3.   How can I clear the screen in DCL?

The simplest way is the TYPE/PAGE NLA0: command.

You can set up a symbol to clear the screen in your LOGIN.COM:

$ CLS :== TYPE/PAGE NLA0:

------------------------------------------------------------
DCL4.   How do I do a REPLY/LOG in a batch stream?

Your terminal must be enabled as an operator terminal before doing the
REPLY/LOG, but a batch stream doesn't have a terminal.  To make this
work, use the following sequence to enable the console as the operator
terminal; then the REPLY/LOG will be accepted:

  $ DEFINE SYS$COMMAND _OPA0:
  $ REPLY/ENABLE
  $ REPLY/LOG

DCL5.   How do I generate a random number in DCL?

Here's my random number generator for inclusion into the OVMS FAQ;
just do a GOSUB RAND and the global symbol RANDOM will contain a
randomly generated number.  The user/programmer can feed the generator
a ceiling value (__CEIL) or a new seed (__SEED).

$! RAND - returns a positive random number ("RANDOM") between 0 and 
$!        __CEIL - 1.
$ RAND:
$
$ IF F$TYPE(__SEED) .EQS. ""
$ THEN
$     ! seed the random number generator, ...
$     __NOW = F$CVTIME()
$     __HOUR = 'F$EXTRACT(11,2,__NOW)'
$     __MINUTE = 'F$EXTRACT(14,2,__NOW)'
$     __SECOND = 'F$EXTRACT(17,2,__NOW)'
$     __TICK = 'F$EXTRACT(20,2,__NOW)'
$
$     __SEED == __TICK + (100 * __SECOND) + (6000 * __MINUTE) + -
         (360000 * __HOUR)
$     ! the generator tends to do better with a large, odd seed, ...
$     __SEED == (__SEED .OR. 1)
$     ! clean up, ...
$     DELETEX/SYMBOL __NOW
$     DELETEX/SYMBOL __HOUR
$     DELETEX/SYMBOL __MINUTE
$     DELETEX/SYMBOL __SECOND
$     DELETEX/SYMBOL __TICK
$ ENDIF
$
$ IF F$TYPE(__CEIL) .EQS. "" THEN __CEIL = %X3FFFFFFF
$
$ __SEED == __SEED * 69069 + 1
$
$ RANDOM == (__SEED.AND.%X3FFFFFFF)/(%X40000000/__CEIL)

$ RETURN

DCL6.   What does the MCR command do?

The MCR command runs the specified image, with a default filespec of
SYS$SYSTEM:.EXE, and passes any (optional) command line arguments in the
same manner as a foreign command.  In other words:

	$ MCR FOO BAR

is equivalent to:

	$ FOO :== $FOO
	$ FOO BAR

It derives from the RSX operating system from which VMS evolved and is
still often used as a shortcut for activating images.  The MCR command is
different from the MCR command line interpreter, which is provided as part
of the optional VAX-11 RSX product that provides RSX emulation under VMS.

------------------------------------------------------------
DCL7.   How do I change the OpenVMS system prompt?

You can use the SET PROMPT command for this purpose.  SET PROMPT sets the DCL
prompt to the specified string.

When you want to display variable information, you will need to establish a
tie-in that provides the information to the SET PROMPT command as required.

If you wish to display the default directory for instance, you will have to
establish a tie between the SET DEFAULT command and the SET PROMPT commands,
as there is no direct way to get the default directory as the DCL prompt.  You
can easily acquire or create a set of DCL command procedures that perform the
SET DEFAULT and SET PROMPT for you.  These DCL command procedures often use a
command such as:

  $ set prompt='f$env("default")'

More advanced users could implement a system service or other intercept, and
use these tools to intercept the directory change and reset the prompt
accordingly.  (This approach likely involves some kernel-mode programming, and
requires write access to various undocumented OpenVMS data structures.)

There are related tools available from various sources, including the
following web sites:

  o ftp://ftp.hhs.dk/pub/vms/setpmt/

  o ftp://ftp.tmesis.com/sys_service_hook.src

  o James F. Duff has also made available a Macro32 tool known as
    TIME_PROMPT, a tool that sets the prompt to the current system time.

  o Many folks have contributed DCL procedures to perform this task.
    Visit the newsgroup archives for information and examples.

Information in this section has been acquired from various postings that
have discussed this topic in the comp.os.vms newsgroup in the past, and
examples from Arne Vajhoej, Brian Schenkenberger, James Duff, and others.

DCL8.   Can I do DECnet task-to-task communication with DCL?

Yes, you can do this with DCL.

The OpenVMS DECnet documentation shows various simple examples using the
task object and the TYPE command to trigger the execution of a DCL command
procedure on a remote node.  A slightly more advanced example of using DCL
for DECnet task-to-task -- a procedure that acts as both the client and as
the server as appropriate, and that uses a basic form of half-duplex
communications -- is included:

        $! x.com
        $
        $! This procedure must be in the user's login directory.
        $! Requires a self-referential (not reverential :-) proxy:
        $!    UAF> add/prox <LocalNode>::<CurrentUser> <CurrentUser>/default
        $! Author: Stephen Hoffman, OpenVMS Engineering, Compaq
        $
        $ goto 'f$mode()'
        $INTERACTIVE:
        $ open/read/write chan 0::"task=x"
        $ write chan "Hello"
        $ read chan parameter
        $ close chan
        $ write sys$output parameter
        $ exit
        $BATCH:
        $OTHER:
        $NETWORK:
        $ open/read/write chan sys$net
        $ read chan parameter
        $ write chan "''parameter' yourself!"
        $ close chan
        $ exit

  An example of a run of the above procedure:

        $ @x
        Hello yourself!
        $


DCL does not include support asynchronous I/O, thus a predetermined protocol
or a predetermined "turn-around" command sequence must be implemented in
order to avoid protocol deadlocks -- cases where both tasks are trying to
write or both tasks are trying to read.  The task that is writing messages
to the network must write (or write and read) a predetermined sequence of
messages, or it must write a message that tells the reader that it can now
start writing messages.  (This is the essence of a basic half-duplex network
protocol scheme.)

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE1.  How can I undelete a file?

OpenVMS doesn't have an "undelete" function.  However, if you are quick
to write-protect the disk (or if you can guarantee that no new files get
created or existing files extended), your data is still on the disk
and it may be possible to retrieve it.  The FLORIAN tool available from
the WKU Fileserver claims to be able to do this (see question SOFT1.)
Other alternatives here include the DFU tool, available on the OpenVMS
Freeware CD-ROM distribution.

If you are setting up a user environment for yourself or for others, it
is quite easy to use DCL to intercept the DELETE command, using a symbol:

  $ DEL*ETE :== @SYS$LOGIN:MYDELETE.COM

The DELETE symbol will cause the procedure to be invoked whenever the user
enters the DELETE command, and it can copy the file(s) to a "trashcan"
subdirectory before issuing a "real" DELETE on the files.  Other procedures
can retrieve the file(s) from the "trashcan" subdirectory, and can (and
should) clean out the "trashcan" as appropriate.  (Realize that this DELETE
symbol can interfere with DELETE/GLOBAL and other similar DCL commands.)

					[Steve Hoffman]

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE2.  Why does SHOW QUOTA give a different answer than DIR/SIZE?

DIR/SIZE doesn't take into account the size of file headers which are
charged to your quota.  Also, unless you use DIR/SIZE:ALL, you'll see only
the "used" size of the file, not the allocated size which is what gets
charged against your quota.  Also, you may have files in other directories.
					[Steve Lionel]

$ DIR/SIZ=ALL/GRAND [username...]

Grand total of D1 directories, F1 files, B1/B2 blocks.

$ DIR/SIZ=ALL/GRAND [-]username.DIR

Grand total of 1 directory, 1 file, B3/B4 blocks.

$ SHOW QUOTA
  User [username] has B5 blocks used, B6 available,
  of B7 authorized and permitted overdraft of B8 blocks on disk

If the user has no files in other directories and all file-headers are
only 1 block, then the following should apply:

  B5=B2+B4+F1+1

If the diskquota is out of synch, then the system-manager can make a rebuild.
					[Arne Vajhøj]

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE3.  How do I make sure that my data is safely written to disk?

If your application must absolutely guarantee that data is available,
no matter what, there's really no substitute for RMS Journalling.  However,
you can achieve a good degree of data integrity by issuing a SYS$FLUSH RMS
call at appropriate times (if you're using RMS, that is.)  If you're
using a high-level language's I/O system, check that language's documentation
to see if you can access the RMS control blocks for the open file.  In
C you can use fflush followed by fsync.  Note that fsync, which was
undocumented for VAX C but is documented for DEC C, takes a file descriptor
as an argument, not a *FILE.

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE4.  What are the limits on file specifications and directories?

A file specification has an aggregate maximum size of 255 characters at
present.  The node and device specification may be up to 255 characters each -
file name and file types may be up to 39 characters each.  File versions are
from 1 through 32767, though 0 (latest version), -0 (oldest version) and -n
(n'th previous version) can be used in most contexts.  A file specification
may not have more than 8 directories and subdirectories - while it is possible
to create subdirectories of greater depth, accessing them is problematic in
most cases and this should be avoided. 

Application developers should use OpenVMS-supplied routines for parsing
file specifications - this ensures that changes in what is allowable will
not tend to break your application.  Consider that various parts of the
file specification may contain quoted strings with embedded spaces and
other punctuation!  Some routines of interest are SYS$FILESCAN, SYS$PARSE
and LIB$TRIM_FILESPEC.  For further information, see the OpenVMS Guide to
File Applications.

FILE5.  What is the largest disk volume size OpenVMS can access?

One Terabyte (2**31 blocks of 2**9 bytes).  Prior to the release of V6.0, the
OpenVMS file system was limited to disk volumes of 8.5 GB (2**24 blocks) or
less.

On some systems, there are restrictions in the console program that limit the
size of the OpenVMS system disk.  Note that data disks are not affected by
console program limits.  For example, all members of the VAXstation 3100
series are limited to a system disk to 1.073 GB or less due to the console,
though larger data disks are possible.

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE6.  What is the maximum file size, and the RMS record size limit?

RMS can store individual files of a size up to the maximum supported
volume size.  Under OpenVMS V6.0 and later, the volume size and the RMS
maximum file size limit is 2**31 * 512 bytes -- one terabyte (1 TB).

The RMS formats -- sequential, relative, and indexed -- are limited by
the one terabyte maximum volume size.  RMS relative files are further
limited to a number of records that will fit in 32 bits -- 4 billion
records.   Sequential and indexed formats do not have a record limit.

------------------------------------------------------------
FILE7.  How do I write recordable CDs on OpenVMS?

Creation of CD-ROMs using recordable CD media (CD-R) under OpenVMS
typically involves one of two approaches: the use of the optional
CD-R (`Scribe') capabilities available for the InfoServer or other
"offline" hardware packages, or the use of a host-based package such
as the CDWRITE13_VMS utility, an OpenVMS port of a Linux tool.

OpenVMS has no integrated support for recording CD-R media.

OpenVMS can read both ODS2 and ISO9960 format CD-ROMs.

InfoServer hardware configurations are no longer availble from DIGITAL,
but may potentially be acquired through other means.

The CDWRITE13_VMS package is one example of a host-based package that
can be used to create CD-R media.  The contact for CDWRITE13_VMS is
Dr. Eberhard Heuser-Hofmann.  One website that discusses this package
is located at:

  http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/9999/vmscdwri.html

Also see the newest linux-cdwrite package, XCDROAST.

PROG1.  How do I call <routine_name> from <language_name>?

Most OpenVMS system services and RTL routines pass string arguments by
descriptor.  Languages which support native string data types create
descriptors automatically; those which do not (eg., C) require that you set
them up explicitly.
					[eric@tardis.HQ.ileaf.com]

There is a lot of information available on how to call system services
and Run-Time Library routines, including examples in numerous languages.
The best references are:

	Your language's User Manual
	OpenVMS Programming Environment Manual
	OpenVMS Programming Concepts Manual
	OpenVMS Programming Interfaces: Calling a System Routine
	OpenVMS Calling Standard

In addition, if you are a subscriber to the Digital Software Information
Network (available to those with a software support contract), the DSIN
database contains hundreds of worked examples of calling system services
and RTL routines, including the one that seems to trip up almost everyone,
SMG$CREATE_MENU.

					[Steve Hoffman]

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG2.  How do I get the arguments from the command line?

If you're writing a program and want to accept arguments from a foreign
command, you can use LIB$GET_FOREIGN to get the command line and parse
it yourself, or if you're programming in C, use the normal argc/argv
method.

To write an application which uses the normal DCL verb/qualifier/parameter
syntax for invocation, see the description of the CLI$ routines in the
OpenVMS Callable Utility Routines Reference Manual.

It is possible to write an application which can be used both ways; if a 
DCL verb isn't used to invoke the image, the application parses the command 
line itself.  One way to do this is to call CLI$GET_VALUE for a required
parameter.  If it is not present (or you get an error), call 
LIB$GET_FOREIGN to get the command line and do the manual parse.

See also question DCL1.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG3.  How do I get a formatted error message in a variable?

Use the SYS$PUTMSG system service with an action routine that stores
the message line(s) in the variable of your choice.  Be sure the action
routine returns a "false" (low bit clear) function value so that SYS$PUTMSG
doesn't then try to display the message (unless you want it to.)  See the
description of $PUTMSG in the System Services Reference Manual for an
example of using an action routine.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG4.  How do I link against SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.STB on an Alpha system?

LINK/SYSEXE is the OpenVMS Alpha equivalent of linking against SYS.STB.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG5.  How do I do a SET DEFAULT from inside a program?

The problem is that SYS$SETDDIR only changes the default directory - NOT
the default disk. The default disk is determined by the logical SYS$DISK.
If you want to change the default disk within a program, then call
LIB$SET_LOGICAL to change the logical SYS$DISK. You will need to call both
LIB$SET_LOGICAL and SYS$SETDDIR to change both default disk and the default
directory!
					[Arne Vajhøj]	

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG6.  How do I create a shareable image transfer vector on an Alpha system?

This is something that was greatly simplified for OpenVMS Alpha.  You don't
need to create a separate transfer vector module; just use the SYMBOL_VECTOR
statement in a linker options file.  For example, if your shareable image
has two routines named FOO and BAR, the linker options file should contain
the following line:

	SYMBOL_VECTOR=(FOO=PROCEDURE, BAR=PROCEDURE)

The Linker manual has more details on this.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG7.  How do I turn my Fortran COMMON into a shareable image on Alpha?

You need to add SYMBOL_VECTOR=(<common-name>=PSECT) to your options file.  On
OpenVMS VAX all OVR/REL/GBL psects were automatically exported into the
shareable image's Global Symbol Table.  On OpenVMS Alpha you have to tell the
linker that you want this done by means of the PSECT keyword in the
SYMBOL_VECTOR options file statement.

This has several advantages over OpenVMS VAX.  First, you don't have to worry 
about the address of the psect when you try to create a new, upwardly 
compatible version of the shareable image. Second, you can control which
psects, if any, are made visible outside the shareable image.

By default, COMMON PSECTs in DEC Fortran for OpenVMS Alpha (as well as most
other OpenVMS Alpha compilers) are NOSHR.  On VAX, the default was SHR which
required you to change the attribute to NOSHR if you wanted your COMMON
to be in a shareable image but not write-shared by all processes on the
system.  If you do want write-sharing, use: 
	CDEC$ PSECT common-name=SHR
in the Fortran source code (the CDEC$ must be begin in column 1) or a linker 
options file PSECT_ATTR statement to set the COMMON PSECT attribute to SHR.

For further information, see the Linker manual.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG8.  How do I convert between IEEE and VAX floating data?

In OpenVMS V6.1 there is a routine CVT$CONVERT_FLOAT, documented in the
LIB$ Run-Time Library Reference Manual, which can perform conversions
between any two of the following floating datatypes: VAX (F,D,G,H),
little-endian IEEE (single, double, quad), big-endian IEEE (single, double,
quad), CRAY and IBM System\370.

DEC Fortran (all platforms) has a feature which will perform automatic
conversion of unformatted data during input or output.  See the DEC Fortran
documentation for information on "non-native data in I/O" and the
CONVERT= OPEN statement keyword.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG9.  How do I get the argument count in a Fortran routine?

On VAX, many programmers would use a MACRO routine which accessed the
AP register of the caller to get the address of the argument list and
hence the argument count.  This was not guaranteed to work on VAX, but
usually did.  However, it doesn't work at all on OpenVMS Alpha, as there
is no AP register.  On Alpha systems, you must use a language's built-in
function to retrieve the argument count, if any.  In Fortran this is
IARGCOUNT, which is also available in DEC Fortran on OpenVMS VAX.

Note that omitting arguments to Fortran routines is non-standard and is
unsupported.  It will work in many cases - read the DEC Fortran release
notes for additional information.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG10. How do I get a unique system ID for licensing purposes?

Many software developers desire to use a unique hardware ID to "lock" a
given copy of their product to a specific system.  Most Digital VAX and
Alpha systems do not have a unique hardware-set "system ID" that can be
used for this purpose.  Digital does not use hardware IDs in its licensing
methods and many users consider a hardware-based licensing scheme to be
a negative attribute when considering software purchases.

Digital uses a software-based system called the License Management Facility
or LMF.  This provides for software keys (Product Authorization Keys or PAKS)
which support capacity and user-based license checking.  Digital sells
the DEC LMF PAK Generator for OpenVMS (SPD 31.68.03) for use by software
vendors.

However, if a hardware-based method is required, the most common method is
based on an Ethernet adaptor hardware address.  Sample source code for
implementing this is available at:

  http://www.partner.digital.com/www-swdev/pages/Home/TECH/faqs/ovms/ovms.html

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG11. What is an executable, shareable, system or UWSS image?

   Executable code in OpenVMS typically resides in an image -- an
   image is a file -- the file extension is typically .EXE -- that
   contains this code.  Common types of images include executable
   images, shareable images, system images, and protected (UWSS)
   images.

   Executable images are programs that can be directly executed.
      These images can grant enhanced privileges, with an INSTALL
      of the image with /PRIVILEGE, or can grant enhanced access
      with the specification of a subsystem identifier on the ACL
      associated with the image.

   Shareable images contain code executed indirectly, these images
       are referenced from executable images and/or from other
       shareable images.  These images can not grant enhanced
       privileges, even with the use of INSTALL with /PRIVILEGE
       or a subsystem identifier.  These shareable images can be
       dynamically activated (a LINK that occurs at run-time) via
       the LIB$FIND_IMAGE_SYMBOL run-time library (RTL) routine.
       (See `protected images' for information on `privileged
       shareable images'.)

   System images are intended to run directly on the VAX or Alpha
       hardware -- these are normally used for the kernel code
       that comprises an operating system. 

   Protected images -- also refered to as User-Written System Services
       (UWSS), or as privileged shareable images -- are similiar in
       some ways to a standard shareable images, but these images
       include a `change mode' handler, and execute in an `inner'
       processor mode (privileged mode; executive or kernel), and
       code executing in inner modes has implicit SETPRV privilege.
       Must be INSTALLed with /PROTECT.  Note that inner-mode code
       has restrictions around calling library routines, around
       calling various system services, and around calling code
       located in other protected or shareable images.

   Loadable images and device drivers are images that can be used
   to add code into the OpenVMS kernel.  Pseudo-device drivers
   are a particularly convenient way to add executable code, with
   associated driver-defined data structures, into the kernel.
   The pseudo-device driver includes the UCB and DDB data structures,
   and a calling interface with support for both privileged and
   unprivileged access to the driver code via sys$qio[w] calls.

   A cookbook approach to creating OpenVMS shareable images is
   available at the (admittedly overly long) URL:

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG12. How do I do a file copy from a program?

There are several options available for copying files from within a program. 
Obvious choices include using lib$spawn(), system(), sys$sndjbc() or
sys$creprc() to invoke a DCL COPY command.  Other common alternatives include
using the callable convert routines and the BACKUP application programming
interface (V7.1 and later).

					[Steve Hoffman]

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG13.  What is a descriptor?

A descriptor is a data structure that describes a string or an array.  Each
descriptor contains information that describes the type of the data being
referenced, the size of the data, and the address of the data.  It also
includes a description of the storage used for the data, typically static
or dynamic.   Descriptors are passed by reference.

The following are examples of creating and using descriptors in C:

    #include <descrip.h>
    #include <lib$routines.h>
    #include <stsdef.h>
    int RetStat;
    char TxtBuf[TXTSIZ]
    struct dsc$descriptor StaticDsc =
      { 0, DSC$K_DTYPE_T, DSC$K_CLASS_S, NULL };
    struct dsc$descriptor DynDsc = 
      { 0, DSC$K_DTYPE_T, DSC$K_CLASS_D, NULL };
    int DynDscLen = 255;
    $DESCRIPTOR( ConstDsc, "This is a string" );

    /* finish setting up a static descriptor */
    StaticDsc.dsc$w_length      = TXTSIZ;
    StaticDsc.dsc$a_pointer     = (void *) TxtBuf;

    /* finish setting up a dynamic descriptor */
    RetStat = lib$sget1_dd( &DynDscLen, &DynDsc );
    if ( !$VMS_STATUS_SUCCESS( RetStat ) )
      return RetStat;

    /* release the dynamic storage */
    RetStat = lib$sfree1_dd( &DynDsc );
    if (!$VMS_STATUS_SUCCESS( RetStat ))
      return RetStat;

Static descriptors reference storage entirely under application program
control, and the contents of the descriptor data structure can be modified
as required (by the application).  OpenVMS routines do not modify the
contents of a static descriptor, nor do they alter the address or length
values stored in the static descriptor.  (The term "static" refers to the
descriptor data structure, and not necessarily to the storage referenced
by the descriptor.)

Dynamic descriptors reference storage under the control of the run-time
library, and the contents of a dynamic descriptor data structure -- once
initialized -- can only be modified under control of run-time library
routines.  The dynamic storage referenced by the dynamic descriptor is
allocated and maintained by the run-time library routines.  Various
OpenVMS routines do alter the contents of the descriptor data structure,
changing the value for the amount and the address of the storage associated
with the dynamic descriptor, as required.  Routines can obviously access
and alter the contents of the storage referenced by the descriptor.

OpenVMS languages that include support for strings or arrays are expected
to use descriptors for the particular structure.  Most OpenVMS languages,
such as Fortran and BASIC, use descriptors entirely transparently.  Some, 
like DEC C, require the programmer to explicitly create and maintain the
descriptor. 

For further information on string descriptors, see the _OpenVMS Programming
Concepts_ manual, part of the OpenVMS documentation set.

					[Steve Hoffman]

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG14.  How many bytes are in a disk block?

A disk block is the minimum unit of disk storage allocation in OpenVMS.

Under OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha, the disk volume block size is
consistent, with each block containing 512 bytes.

The minimum disk allocation granularity actually permissible (in the
ODS-2 and ODS-5 volume structures commonly used on OpenVMS) is determined
on a per-volume basis, and is typically based on a combination of the
total number blocks on the disk volume and the total size of the volume
storage bitmap.  The allocation granularity is known as the volume cluster
factor -- the cluster factor is the number of blocks in a disk cluster,
and it is the smallest number of blocks that can be allocated on a
particular disk volume.

Prior to OpenVMS V7.2, the  maximum permissible size of the bitmap
requires larger cluster factors as volume sizes increase.  Starting
with V7.2, the bitmap can be larger, and cluster factors as small as
one block can be used.

The number of bytes in a file can be determined by multiplying the
number of blocks allocated for the file times the number of bytes in
a block.  For sequential files (only), the FFB (XAB$W_FFB, in the
File Header XAB) value can be used to find out how much of the last
(XAB$L_EBK) block is used.  FFB and EBK are meaningful only for
sequential files, and only in a limited context -- partial block
allocations are not permitted.  For other file formats, the EOF marker
is not meaningful.

Disk allocations always occur only in units of the cluster factors,
which can be from one block up to (potentially) clusters of eighteen
blocks or more, depending on the volume cluster factor.

OpenVMS assumes that the device driver and the underlying storage device
will present the file system with addressable units of storage of 512
bytes in size, or the appearance of same.  Various third-party CD-ROM
devices, for instance, support only 2048 byte blocks, and such devices
are incompatible with the standard OpenVMS device drivers.

To determine the number of bytes required for a file from DCL, one
option uses the f$file_attributes item EOF, multiplied by the size
of a block in bytes (512).  This does not account for the unused
space in the last block of a sequential file, but it also does not
have to differentiate sequential files from other files.

					[Steve Hoffman]

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG15. How many bytes are in a memory page?

A memory page is the minimum unit of memory allocation in OpenVMS.
With OpenVMS VAX, the memory page size matches the disk block size:
it is always 512 bytes.

With OpenVMS Alpha, the memory page size is variable, and it can range
from 8192 bytes (8 kilobytes) up to 64 kilobytes.  The current system
page size can be determined using the sys$getsyi or f$getsyi PAGE_SIZE
item.  Programs with hardcoded constants for the memory page size (or
page alignment) should always assume a page size of 64 kilobytes.

On OpenVMS Alpha, a 512 byte area of memory -- equivilent in size to
an OpenVMS VAX memory page -- is refered to as a pagelet.

					[Steve Hoffman]

------------------------------------------------------------
PROG16. How do I create a process under another username?

Many server processes can operate within the context of the target user
using privileges, using calls such as sys$chkpro and (more commonly in
this context) sys$check_access as needed to determine if access would be
permitted for the specified user within the current security model.

With OpenVMS V6.2 and later, the persona system services (SYS$PERSONA_*)
can be used to assume the persona of the specified user -- these allow the
server to operate as the specified user, in a controlled fashion.  The
persona services can be used as a "wrapper" around a sys$creprc process
creation call, as well -- this will create a seperate process entirely
under the assumed persona.

Information on the persona system services is included in the OpenVMS
V6.2 new features documentation, and in the OpenVMS V7.1 and later system
services documentation.  These system services exist and are supported in
OpenVMS V6.2 and later releases.

Typical mechanisms for creating a process under another username include:

    o personna services around a sys$creprc call.  See above.
    o via DECnet task-to-task, using explicit specification of
      username and password, or using a DECnet proxy.
      This creates a network-mode job under the target user.
      The network-mode job might do little more than a RUN/DETACH
      of an image passed in via task-to-task -- task-to-task
      communications are fully available using strictly DCL-to-DCL
      processing, or using a compiled language and DCL, etc.)
    o the username argument on the sys$sndjbc call.
      This creates a batch-mode job under the target user.
      The batch-mode job might do little more than a RUN/DETACH
      of an image passed in via a parameter.
    o the UIC argument on the sys$creprc call.
      This mimics the UIC of the target user, and is certainly not
      the prefered mechanism for this task.
    o Via pseudo-terminals...

There are likely a few other mechanisms around...  There are various tools
available from DECUS and other sources that allow various forms of user
impersonation, as well.  These tools will require version-dependent kernel
code and enhanced privileges for some of (or all of) their operations.

On a workstation, you go into "Customize" menu of the session manager utility
and select "Security".  When the pop-up box appears, you can put
node/user/tranport to allow who can launch an application to the display on
that workstation.

        You need a checklist of sorts:

      1) Make sure  that  you've  specified  the X-windows "display"
         correctly  on  the remote side.  For DECNET it's  something
         like NODE::0.0, for TCP/IP it's Node.Domain:0.0, etc.  On a
         unix system, define the DISPLAY environment variable so:

	    # setenv DISPLAY myvax.domain:0.0

      2) If you've verified 1) and things still aren't working, make
         sure the Security settings on  the  VMS side will allow the
         connection:  Pull  down the "Options" menu in  the  Session
         Manager, select "Security..."  near  the  bottom.   If  you
         don't  find  your  host  (and  username) listed on the left
         under "Authorized Users", go to the  right side of the menu
         and   fill   in  the  three  fields,  "Node",   "Username",
         "Transport".  Then click on the Add botton, then the  Apply
         and  OK  buttons  to  add  the  new  host  to  the security
         database.

          a) There are  various  transports: LOCAL, DECNET, LAT,
             TCPIP,  etc.   Select  the one appropriate  to  the
             client machine's connection to the VMS machine.

	  b) If the connection is DECNET, do *NOT* add :: to the
             node name!

          c) If the connection is TCPIP, "Username" _must_ be an
             asterisk (*) because the  TCP/IP protocol used does
             not provide the remote username.

          d) If the connection is TCPIP, it's best to use a full
             domain name, e.g.,  Node.Subd.Domain.  However, you
             _may_  have  to use the IP address  itself,  rather
             than  the  domain  name  (EWS  requires  this).   I
             generally  add two entries for each TPCIP host, the
             first using the  domain  name,  the  second  the IP
             address.

          e) There are a  various  3rd  party vendors who supply
             TCP/IP  packages for VMS, including but not limited
             to  TGV  (Multinet)  and  Wollongong  (Pathway  ?).
             Multinet  (and  DEC's  own  UCX) call the transport
             "TCPIP", Wollongong, at least in some incarnations,
             uses "WINTCP".  You need to use the appropriate
             vendor's package transport name  in the "Transport"
             field.

      3) If things _still_  aren't  working, make sure the transport
         you  want  has  been activated for DECwindows.  This  is  a
         system manager job, but you can do the ground work yourself
         before bothering the sysmgr.  Do the following:

	    $ DIR SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM

         If that file exists, then do:

	    $ SEARCH SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM -
            $_    DECW$SERVER_TRANSPORTS

         You sould find something like:

	    $ decw$server_transports == "DECNET,LOCAL,LAT,TCPIP"

         If the transport you want,  e.g., TCPIP, isn't listed, have
         your  system  manager  make  the  appropriate  changes  and
         restart DECwindows.  If the file doesn't exist, the  sysmgr
         will  have  to  create  it  by  copying  the  corresponding
         .TEMPLATE file  to  .COM  and  uncommenting  the  line that
         defines decw$server_transports.

          a) If you're wanting  to  use  TCP/IP to connect, make
             sure  TCP/IP is available on the VMS host.   TCP/IP
             is _not_ native to VMS.  You  need  to  be  running
             either Digital's UCX or a 3rd party vendor's TCP/IP
             product.   If  you're  not,  none of the above will
             help.

There is a log file created in SYS$MANAGER which tells you which transports
are loaded, and also tell you what connect attempts were rejected, including
showing what the presented credentials were.  This file is
SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_ERROR.LOG, although the 0 could be another number if
you have multiple servers on the workstation.  I have found this file to be

DECW2.  How do I create a display on another workstation?

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=net_transport /NODE=remote_node

for LAT the command might look like this:

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=LAT /NODE=REMOTE_NODE

for DECnet:

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=DECNET /NODE=NODE

for TCP/IP

$ SET DISPLAY /CREATE /TRANSPORT=TCPIP /NODE=128.12.4.122

Note that LAT is typically used for X terminals but can be used from
OpenVMS to OpenVMS systems on OpenVMS Alpha V6.1 (if you have setup the X
server to allow the LAT transport - check the docs).  LAT will be supported
on OpenVMS VAX as a transport for DECwindows in a future OpenVMS VAX
release.

DECW4.  How do I get a log of a DECterm session?

If you are working from a Decterm, you can use the AutoPrint feature. Choose
the "Printer..." menu item from the "Options" menu, set the printing
destination to the name of the file you want, and set "Auto Print Mode".
You are now free to continue.

It should be noted that ALL the characters and escape sequences are captured,
but if you display the log file on a DECterm you will get EXACTLY what you had.

DECW5.  Problem - the DELETE key deletes forward instead of backward!

This has to do with Motif's virtual bindings.  When a Motif application starts
up, it looks at the vendor string returned in the display connection
information and attempts to match the string to a table of virtual bindings.

You can override the default bindings in your decw$xdefaults.dat file. Here is
the entry you would make to get the default VMS bindings.

DECW6.  Problem - On a DEC2000-300, Motif doesn't start

Check for a GQ device by doing a SHOW DEVICE G at the DCL prompt.  If there is
no GQA0 device:

a) VMS failed to find the appropriate IRQ information for the Compaq QVision
   and did not autoconfigure it.  Run the correct ECU (for OSF and VMS) and
   reboot.

b) You do not have a Compaq QVision video card.  This card should have Compaq
   printed on it, and identifies itself as a CPQ3011 or a CPQ3111.  If it is 
   not one of these 2 devices (as of 7/1/94 and version 6.1) then VMS does not
   support it.

If there is a GQA0 device:

a) There may have been a severe error in the DECwindows startup. Type the
   contents of SYS$MANAGER:DECW$SERVER_0_ERROR.LOG for any information on
   errors starting the server.

b) The sysgen parameter WINDOW_SYSTEM is not set to 1.  This is a common way
   used by system managers to disable server startup.

c) You may not have a valid Motif license.    To check for the Motif license,
   type LICENSE LIST DW-MOTIF/FULL and examine the information displayed.
   Make sure that it is present, valid and active.

DECW7.  Problem - My LK401 keyboard unexpectedly autorepeats

There are several modes of failure:

a) Pressing 2 and 3 keys at the same time causes one key to autorepeat when
   released.  Check the hardware revision level printed on the bottom of the
   keyboard.  If the revision level is C01, the keyboard firmware is broken. 
   Call field service to replace the keyboard with any revision level other 
   than C01.

b) Pressing certain keys is always broken.  Typical sympypoms are: delete 
   always causes a autorepeat, return needs to be pressed twice, etc.  This is
   frequently caused by having keys depressed while the keyboard is being
   initialized.  Pressing ^F2 several times or unplugging and replugging the
   keyboard frequently fix this problem.  There is a patch available to fix 
   this problem [contact the CSC for information - a CSCPAT number will be 
   included here when available. - Ed.]

c) A key that was working spontaneously stops working correctly. This may be
   either (a) or (b) or it may be bad firmware.  Ensure that you have the most
   recent firmware installed on your CPU.  An old version of the DEC 3000 
   firmware had a bug that could cause this symptom.
					[kleinsorge@star.enet.dec.com]

------------------------------------------------------------
DECW8.  Problem - My LK411 sends the wrong keycodes or some keys are dead

Check the firmware revision on the keyboard.  Hardware revision B01 introduced
an incompatability with the device driver which causes the keyboard to not be
recognized correctly.  There is a patch available to fix this problem:
[AXPDRIV06_061] - the fix is also included in OpenVMS V6.2.  The rev A01 
keyboard, and the LK450 should work without problems.

DECW9.  How do I set the title on a DECterm window?

If you are creating a new DECterm window, check 
HELP CREATE /TERMINAL /WINDOW_ATTRIBUTES.

If you want to change the title of an existing window, use the following
control sequences, where <esc> is the ANSI escape code, value decimal 27, and
<text> is what you want to display:

To set the DECterm title, send <esc>]21;<text><esc>\
To set the icon label, send    <esc>]2L;<text><esc>\

For example, DCL to display "My DECterm" in title bar:
$ ESC[0,8]=27
$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "''ESC']21;My DECterm''ESC'\"
					[p_lee@decus.ch]

You can also change the title and the icon using the Options-Window...

DECW10. How do I customize DECwindows, including the login screen?

To customize various DECwindows Motif characteristics including the defaults
used by the SET DISPLAY command, the DECwindows login screen background logo
used (the default is the Digital logo), various keymaps, the FileView
defaults, session manager defaults, the DECwindows login processing,
DECwindows log file processing, and various other DECwindows attributes, see
the example file:

  SYS$STARTUP:DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.TEMPLATE

This example template file is typically copied over to the filename
SYS$COMMON:[SYS$STARTUP]DECW$PRIVATE_APPS_SETUP.COM and then modified to meet
site-specific requirements.

Additionally, various X tools such as xsetroot, bitmap and xrdb -- some these
can be useful in customizing the appearance of an application or of the
DECwindows Motif display -- are provided in the DECW$UTILS: area.

------------------------------------------------------------
DECW11. Why doesn't XtAppAddInput() work on OpenVMS?

XtAppAddInput() does work on OpenVMS.  The MIT definition of the X Windows
call XtAppAddInput() includes platform-specific arguments.

On platforms where C is the typically the primary programming language for
the platform, the file descriptor mask is one of the arguments to the
XtAppAddInput() call.

On OpenVMS, the platform-specific arguments to this call include an event
flag and an IOSB, as these are the traditional OpenVMS constructs used to
synchronize the completion of asynchronous operations.  While it would be
easier to port non-OpenVMS C code that calls XtAppAddInput() over to
OpenVMS if the arguments included the C file descriptor, this would make
the call unusable from other OpenVMS languages, and would make it extremely
difficult to use OpenVMS features such as ASTs and sys$qio calls.

One restriction on the event flag: the event flag chosen must be from event
flag cluster zero.  When using the traditional lib$get_ef and lib$free_ef
calls to allocate and deallocate event flags, you must first explicitly
call lib$free_ef to free up some event flags in event flag cluster zero.
Please see the event flag documentation for specific details on these calls
and for specific event flags that can be freed in event flag cluster zero.

Here is some example code that covers calling this routine on OpenVMS:

    m->InputID = XtAppAddInput(
        m->AppCtx,
        m->InputEF,
        m->InputIosb,
        the_callback, 1 );
    if ( !((int) m->InputID ))
        {
        XtAppErrorMsg(
            m->AppCtx,
            "invalidDevice",
            "XtAppAddInput",
            "XtToolkitError",
            "Can't Access Device",
            (String *) NULL,
            (Cardinal *) NULL );

MISC3.  Can I reuse old keyboards, mice and monitors with a PC?

Older DIGITAL keyboards (with RJ modular jacks), older DIGITAL mice (with RJ
modular jacks, or with a DIN connector with pins in a configuration other than
the PC-standard DIN connector pin orientation), and older video monitors (with
RGB synch-on-green video signaling) all use signaling formats and/or
communications protocols that differ from the PC standards, and are neither
interchangable nor compatible with typical PC peripheral device controllers. 
LK201, LK401, VSXXX, VR260, VR290, etc., are incompatible with most PC
systems.

Newer DIGITAL keyboards (with DIN plugs), newer DIGITAL mice (with PC-pin DIN
plugs), and newer video monitors (multi-synch) are often interchangeable with
`industry standard' PC systems, and can often be used with most PC peripheral
device controllers. LK461, LK471, PC7XS-CA, VRC16, VRC21, etc., are compatible
with most PC systems.

Rule of thumb: if the peripheral device component was sold for use with the
DEC 2000 (DECpc 150 AXP), an AlphaServer series, an AlphaStation series, or
more recent system, it will probably  work with a PC peripheral controller. 
If the peripheral device component was sold for use with an VT420 or older
terminal, most VAX, most VAXstation, and most Alpha systems with names in the
format `DEC <four-digit-number>', it probably won't work on a PC.

Note that the above is a general guideline, and should not be read to indicate
that any particular peripheral device will or will not work in any particular
configuration, save for those specific configurations the device is explicitly
supported in.

------------------------------------------------------------
MISC4.  What is the pinout for the MicroVAX DB9 connector?

The MicroVAX DB9 console connector pinout predates the PC-style DB9
pinout, and uses a then-common (older) standard pinout, and uses the
following EIA-232-standard signals:

  1: Protective Ground
  2: Transmited Data
  3: Received Data
  4: Request To Send
  5: Data Terminal Ready
  6: Data Set Ready
  7: Signal Ground
  8: Shorted to pin 9 on 2000 series, otherwise floating
  9: Shorted to pin 8 on 2000 series, otherwise floating

The H8571-B converts the (non-2000-series) MicroVAX DB9 to MMJ
DECconnect.  The MicroVAX 2000 and VAXstation 2000 requires a
BCC08 cable (which has the 8-9 short) and the H8571-D for use
with DECconnect.

More recent DIGITAL systems use either the DECconnect MMJ or
the PC DB9 pinout.

The PC DB9 connector is the H8571-J.

DIGITAL VAX and Alpha systems are available via the URL:

------------------------------------------------------------
MISC6.  What does "failure on back translate address request" mean?

The destination node is running DECnet-Plus, and its naming service
cannot locate a name to assocate with the source node's address.
In other words, the destination node cannot determine the name of
the source node.

Use the DECNET_REGISTER mechanism (on the destination node) to register
or modify the name(s) and the address(es) of the source node.  Check
the source node namespace, as well.

Typically, the nodes involved are using a LOCAL namespace, and the
node name and address settings are not coherent across all nodes.
Also check to make sure that the node is entered into its own LOCAL
namespace.  This can be a problem elsewhere, however.  Very rarely,
a cache corruption has been known to cause this error.  To flush the
cache, use the command:

NCL> flush session control naming cache entry "*"

Also check to see that you are using the latest ECO for DECnet-Plus
for the version you are running.

DECnet-Plus can use the following namespaces:
  o DECdns: DECnet-Plus distributed name services.
  o LocalFile: a local file containing names and addresses.
  o DNS/Bind: the IP distributed name services.
  o The UCX local host file.

I have written and installed on INFO.CS.PUB.RO an 'Archie' clone for VMS
software. Telnet to that machine, and login as VMSARCI.
It contains now listings for over 30 ftp servers with >14 GB of VMS software.
The most useful commands are LIST, which generates a list of scanned ftp
servers, and FIND <string>, whichs looks for a file containing "string"
in the name; the search modes are only "substring" [default] and "exact",
and regex search is not supported (so FIND EMACS will work, but FIND *EMACS*
or FIND *EMACS*.* will not). The search is case-insensitive.
Those of you that know other ftp servers with VMS software that I haven't
found, please let me know. (The program that build the databases can
recursively scan whole servers- as FTP.WKU.EDU, or just some directories-
as NIC.SWITCH.CH /pub/vms)
Sorry, this service is VERY SLOW [by Western standards], because it runs
on a quite-busy oldie-but-goodie VAXStation 3400 with 20Mb and a RF71, and
the Internet link is only 256 Kpbs (sometimes unavailable).

Perl 5 (object oriented, blah blah) is available for VMS. 
The primary development ftp site is:

    ftp://genetics.upenn.edu/perl5/

But this site is mirrored by more than 47 CPAN sites around the world. Each 
CPAN site is accesible via a cgi-bin script at the perl homesite:

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN/

(PERL can also be found on the OpenVMS Freeware CD)

Charles Lane maintains a web page on how to write cgi-bin scripts in perl 5 for 
VMS at:

    http://duphy4.physics.drexel.edu/duphy4/cgi_info.htmlx

and I maintain a web page on how to obtain and compile perl5 for VMS at:

    http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/perl/VMS.html

SOFT2.  Where can I find the UNIX <whatever> tool for OpenVMS?

POSIX:
  POSIX-compliant, Digital-supported versions of POSIX routines and
  utilities:

    lex, yacc, grep, tar, uuencode, uudecode, rcs, man, cpio, make,
    awk, ar, mail, etc., the POSIX shell, the POSIX C programming
    interface, etc.

    POSIX utilities can be used from within the POSIX shell, and
    via the DCL `POSIX/RUN POSIX$BIN:tool.' command.

    POSIX is a separately-installed package, and is licensed with
    OpenVMS V5.5 later.  The POSIX installation kit is included
    on the consolidated distribution CD-ROM kit, and installation
    kits are also available separately.

C: 
  Common C system and library routines are present in the DEC C run-time
  library, which is available for V5.5 and later, and is shipped in V6.1
  and later.  DEC C is the upgrade for VAX C, DEC C and VAX C can coexist
  on the same system OpenVMS VAX system, and both compilers can be enabled
  via the "C" license PAK.

    Also see SYS$EXAMPLES:, and (if either is installed) the DECW$EXAMPLES:
    and UCX$EXAMPLES: areas.

X Windows:
  Various Digital-supported X Windows utilities:

    xwd, xev, mosaic WWW browser, xrdb, bmtoa and atobm, xpr, ico, etc.

    In DECW$UTILS: in DECwindows Motif V1.2-3 and later.  Also see
    DECW$EXAMPLES: for example X and C programs.

Miscellaneous tools and examples:
  Various unsupported OpenVMS tools and code examples:

    DWAUTH (X Windows SYSUAF authorize-like tool), various versions	
    of grep, fgrep, yacc, vmstar, uuencode, gawk, etc.  html tools,
    the mx SMTP mail exchange package, X windows flight simulator,
    the mxrn X windows news reader, the OSU HTTPD WWW server, a WWW
    gopher browser, etc. are all on the FreeWare V2.0 CD-ROM.

IP tools:
  DEC TCP/IP (UCX) contains tools such as ping, uuencode, smtp, snmp,
  rcp, nfs, tnfs, etc.  OpenVMS V6.2 and UCX V3.3 and later can be used
  together in support of the /FTP, /RCP, /RLOGIN, /TELNET, and /TN3270
  qualifiers on various DCL commands.

    Also see the various C examples in UCX$EXAMPLES:
