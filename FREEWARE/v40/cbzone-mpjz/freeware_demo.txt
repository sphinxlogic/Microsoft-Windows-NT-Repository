CBzone 2.0C port under OpenVMS VAX & AXP          April 1995
========================================

You need DEC C either on VAX or AXP. You can rebuild CBzone with VAX C but
it crashes very often; It seems very stable with DEC C on both VAX & AXP.

Ressource file CBZONE.DAT must be moved either under your SYS$LOGIN or under
SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] directory (with World read access).

You need to define CBZONE_DIR logical name which points to a directory where
you may have CBZONE.HELP and CBZONE.MOTD files and CBZONE.HIGHSCORES file.

Sound is not actually implemented under OpenVMS , sorry, but some sound files
are here if you want to try ...

VAX & AXP OBJS and exes are provided (VAX VMS 6.1, AXP VMS 6.1, DEC C 4.0
both).

Old compile and link procedures are under [.OLDPROCS] directory

Thanks to Martin P.J. Zinser for providing a new universal MAKE.COM procedure
and for some protability enhancements in sources of cbzone.

Score file: when using MAKE.COM for building Cbzone, you have a shared score
file under CBZONE_DIR: you only must check protections of CBZONE.HIGHSCORES
file (W:RWE). If you prefer a private score file , you can compile with old
procedures and copy CBZONE.HIGHSCORES in SYS$LOGIN:CBZ.SCORE

You can run CBZONE via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure

Sources are available under [.SRC] directory in CBZONE-MPJZ.ZIP file
