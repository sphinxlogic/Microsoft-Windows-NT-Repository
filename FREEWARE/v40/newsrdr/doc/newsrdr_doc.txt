          Preface

          There are several USENET news-related utilities
          available for VMS, some of which provide full local
          storage of news and UUCP protocol support, and some
          of which provide emulation of various network news
          readers available for UNIX systems.

          With the advent of NNTP, it becomes easier to gain
          access to USENET news by using one local system to
          store news and using "remote" news readers on other
          systems.

          The NEWSRDR utility provides an interface to USENET
          news that should be more familiar to VMS users.
          NEWSRDR attempts to follow the conventions of the VMS
          MAIL utility in its presentation and command structure
          whenever possible.

          __________________________________________________________________

          Intended Audience

          This manual is intended for all users of the NEWSRDR
          utility and system managers responsible for installing
          and setting up NEWSRDR.

          Document Structure

          This document consists of two parts. The first briefly
          describes how to use NEWSRDR. The second describes all
          of the NEWSRDR commands in detail.

          Related Documents

          The reader is assumed to know something about USENET
          news, and should probably have as a reference Internet
          RFC 1036, Standard for Interchange of USENET Messages,
          which explains the structure of USENET news articles.
          The system manager should also have RFC 977, Network

   1      Using NEWSRDR



          NEWSRDR is designed to be executed as a VMS "foreign"
          command. To set up the command symbol, you need to
          know where the NEWSRDR executable image is located for
          the command:

                           $ NEWSRDR :== $disk:[dir]NEWSRDR

          Once the symbol is set up, you can invoke NEWSRDR with
          the command:

                           $ NEWSRDR

          The NEWSRDR command can take up to two qualifiers:
          /[NO]UPDATE and /NEWGROUP_ACTION. The default for
          /UPDATE is /UPDATE=FULL, which causes NEWSRDR to
          obtain information from the NNTP server about all
          available newsgroups. You can specify /UPDATE=PARTIAL,
          which has the same effect as the UPDATE/PARTIAL
          command, or /NOUPDATE, to have no updates occur at
          all.

          Use the /NEWGROUP_ACTION qualifier to override your
          NEWGROUP_ACTION setting in your NEWSRDR profile (see
          SET NEWGROUP_ACTION for more information). Possible
          values are /NEWGROUP_ACTION=NONE, SUBSCRIBE, and
          PROMPT. The default behavior is to honor the NEWGROUP_
          ACTION setting in your profile.

          You can also specify /UPDATE=BOTH, which causes a
          full update to occur, immediate followed by a partial
          update. This may be needed at some sites where the
          news server's "active" file is not kept up-to-date
          with the low-bound article number for its newsgroups.
          If you get extraneous "new articles" messages with the
          default NEWSRDR update behaviour, using /UPDATE=BOTH
          should eliminate those extraneous messages.

                                                              1-1

 


          Using NEWSRDR




          __________________________________________________________________

   1.1    Using NEWSRDR for the First Time

          If you have never used NEWSRDR before, NEWSRDR will
          inform you that it cannot find a NEWSRDR profile and
          that it will create one for you. Your NEWSRDR profile
          contains information about which editor you use for
          composing messages, which article headers you wish to
          see when reading articles, and which newsgroups you
          are subscribed to. It is by default placed in your
          login directory and is called NEWSRDR_PROFILE.NRPF.

          To start reading news, the first thing you will need
          to do is to subscribe to one or more newsgroups. If
          you already know what newsgroups are available and
          which ones you want to subscribe to, you can use the
          SUBSCRIBE command right away to subcribe to those
          groups:

                           News> SUBSCRIBE newsgroup [,newsgroup...]

          You can use wildcards in the newsgroup names to
          subscribe to a collection of newsgroups with a single
          command.

          If you want to look at the list of available
          newsgroups, use the command:

                           News> DIRECTORY/GROUP/ALL

          Once you have subscribed to the newsgroups you are
          interested in, you should next use the EXIT command to
          leave NEWSRDR and save your subscription information
          in your profile. When you next start NEWSRDR, you'll
          be ready to begin reading news.

   1.1.1  Cancelling a Subscription

          The UNSUBSCRIBE command (format the same as for
          SUBSCRIBE, above) is used to cancel a subscription
          to a newsgroup.

   1.2    Reading New News

          Once you have subscribed to some newsgroups,
          information about which articles you have seen in
          those newsgroups is stored in your NEWSRDR profile.
          The command

                           News> READ/NEW

          is used to start reading news articles you have not
          yet seen. This command is executed by default if
          you simply press RETURN at the first NEWSRDR command
          prompt, much like VMS MAIL.

          News articles are presented in a page-by-page format,
          also like VMS MAIL. At the bottom of each page, the
          number of remaining lines in the article and the
          message "Press RETURN for more..." will appear. Simply
          pressing the RETURN key will cause the next page of
          the article to be displayed. If you wish to skip to
          the next unseen article, you can use the READ/NEXT/NEW
          (or just NEXT) command. At the end of each article,
          just pressing RETURN will have the same effect as
          entering READ/NEXT/NEW.

          ___________________________

   1.2.1  Redisplaying an Article

          The CURRENT command is used to redisplay the article
          you are currently viewing from the beginning. If the
          article is encoded with the ROT13 cipher (sometimes
          done for articles containing potentially sensitive
          or offensive material), you can read the encoded text
          with the command CURRENT/ROTATE.




                                                              1-3

          ___________________________

   1.2.2  Following a Thread

          You can use the READ command to follow a discussion
          thread within a newsgroup. While reading an article,
          enter

                           News> READ/THREAD

          to cause NEWSRDR to scan forward through the
          newsgroup, displaying those articles that reference
          the current message, or that contain the same subject
          as the article you are currently reading. Once
          started, just press RETURN to continue reading the
          thread. When there are no more articles with matching
          subject lines, the current article is set back to
          the first article in the thread, so you can continue
          reading where you left off.

          ___________________________

   1.2.3  Relaxed vs. Strict Threading

          By default, NEWSRDR uses a "relaxed" form of
          threading, based both on the References: header
          and subject-line matching. This is the best form
          of threading to use when a newsgroup is gatewayed
          to a mailing list, since replies coming from the
          mailing list will generally not have References:
          headers in them. If you want NEWSRDR to use only the
          References: header to determine threading ("strict"
          threading), specify the /STRICT qualifier on the
          commands that take the /THREAD qualifier (READ/THREAD,
          DIRECTORY/THREAD, SET SEEN/THREAD).

          ___________________________

   1.2.4  Reading by Subject

          If you wish to read articles on a group of topics,
          you can use the READ/SUBJECT command to specify one or
          more wildcard patterns to match subject headers. For
          example the command,

                           News> READ/SUBJECT=(*DEC*,*VAX*)

          1-4

 


                                                    Using NEWSRDR





          would cause NEWSRDR to scan forward through the
          newsgroup, displaying those articles whose subject
          headers contain "DEC" or "VAX".

          Once the first matching article is displayed, just
          pressing the RETURN key will page through the article
          and continue the subject scan using the same patterns.
          If you don't want to see an entire article, use the
          command

                           News> READ/SUBJECT

          to move ahead to the next matching article. Once all
          matching articles have been found, the patterns are
          cleared and the current article is set back to where
          you were before doing the first READ/SUBJECT.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.3    Skipping Articles

          If you have just subscribed to a particularly busy
          newsgroup, you may wish to skip over all the articles
          already posted to the newsgroup and read only those
          that are posted from now on. The command

                           News> SET SEEN [/ALL] [article-range...]

          can be used to mark articles in a newsgroup as "seen",
          so they will not show up when you use READ/NEW. You
          can specify /ALL to mark all available articles as
          seen, or you can specify the articles to be marked by
          number (or use a dot to refer to the current article).
          A range of articles can be specified by giving the
          number of the first and last article in the range
          separated by a hyphen (such as "23-45"; a dot (".")
          can be used to refer to the current article, if there
          is one, and the keywords FIRST and LAST can be used to
          refer to the first and last available articles in the
          newsgroup. Multiple numbers or ranges can be given by
          separating them with commas.

                                                              1-5

 


          Using NEWSRDR





          You can also use SET SEEN to skip over a collection
          of articles related to one topic. When reading an
          article, the command

                           News> SET SEEN/THREAD

          can be used to skip all further articles in the
          newsgroup with subject text that contains the subject
          of the article you're currently reading.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.4    Marking Articles for Later Reference

          If you have read an article or a group of articles
          that you want to come back to later, you can mark the
          articles "unseen" with the SET UNSEEN command:

                           News> SET UNSEEN [/ALL] [article-range...]

          If you don't specify /ALL or any article numbers, the
          current article is marked "unseen".

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.5    Permanently Ignoring Topics or Authors

          If you wish to follow a newsgroup but are not
          interested in a particular topic being discussed in
          the newsgroup, you can use the SET IGNORE command
          to permanently ignore articles with subject lines
          containing particular text:

                           News> SET IGNORE [/GLOBAL] /SUBJECT="pattern"

          The pattern you specify can contain VMS wildcards.
          Any articles in the newsgroup with subjects matching
          the pattern will automatically be skipped and marked
          "seen". If you wish to ignore matching articles in any
          newsgroup, use the /GLOBAL qualifier.

          If you wish to ignore articles posted by a particular
          person, rather than about a particular subject, use
          the /FROM qualifier on SET IGNORE:

                           News> SET IGNORE [/GLOBAL] /FROM="pattern"

          1-6

 


                                                    Using NEWSRDR





          Any article with a From line matching the specified
          pattern will be ignored.

          You can also ignore articles that are cross-posted
          to newsgroups you aren't interested in by using the
          /NEWSGROUPS qualifier, or ignore articlees based on
          Message-ID by using the /MESSAGE_ID qualifier.

          ___________________________

   1.5.1  Removing Ignore Settings

          Ignore settings are kept in your NEWSRDR profile.
          After a particular thread or author has died down, you
          may wish to remove the ignore settings for a newsgroup
          with the SET NOIGNORE command:

                           News> SET NOIGNORE [/GLOBAL] [/FROM="pat"] [/SUBJECT="pat"]

          You can find out what the ignore settings are for the
          current newsgroup with the SHOW IGNORE command.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.6    Reading Specific Articles

          To read a particular article in a particular
          newsgroup, you first have to select the newsgroup with
          the GROUP command:

                           News> [GROUP] groupname

          (Note that the word GROUP is optional.) You can then
          use the READ command, specifying the number of the
          article you wish to read:

                           News> [READ] articlenumber

          (Note that the word READ is optional.) If you are not
          sure of the article number, you can use the DIRECTORY
          command to obtain a listing of articles, including
          the article number, address of the article poster, and
          subject of the article:

                                                              1-7

 


          Using NEWSRDR





                           News> DIRECTORY [/SEEN] [/UNSEEN] [article-number]

          If you specify an article number on the DIRECTORY
          command, the directory listing begins with the
          specified article. Otherwise, the directory listing
          begins with the article you are currently reading, or,
          if you haven't read any articles, the first article in
          the newsgroup.

          Directory listings are presented in a paged format
          just like news articles.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.7    Saving Articles

          You can save the text of any article or range of
          articles into a VMS file with the EXTRACT command:

                           News> EXTRACT [/[NO]APPEND] [file-spec] [article-range...]

          If you omit the file-spec, the file name defaults to
          the current newsgroup name (with special characters
          translated to underscores), and /APPEND is turned on
          by default. You can specify a single article by number
          or an entire range or articles (see the description of
          SET SEEN, above, for a description of article ranges).
          Multiple numbers or ranges can be specified, separated
          by commas. If you do not specify any article number
          at all, the current article is copied to the file.
          You must specify a file-spec if you want to specify an
          article range.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.8    Printing Articles

          You can send any article or range of articles to a
          print queue with the PRINT command:

                           News> PRINT [article-range...]

          You can specify a single article by number or an
          entire range or articles (see the description of SET
          SEEN, above, for a description of article ranges).
          Multiple numbers or ranges can be specified, separated

          1-8

 


                                                    Using NEWSRDR





          by commas. If you do not specify any article number at
          all, the current article is added to the print job.

          A single print job is maintained by NEWSRDR for all
          articles to be printed. The print job is released when
          you exit NEWSRDR or you use the PRINT/NOW command. You
          can cancel a pending print job with the PRINT/CANCEL
          command.

          The PRINT command has several options for controlling
          the print job; see the complete command description
          for further information.

          ___________________________

   1.8.1  Specifying PRINT Defaults

          You can define a default print queue with the SET
          QUEUE command:

                           News> SET QUEUE queue-name

          This will direct subsequent print jobs to the
          specified queue, rather than to SYS$PRINT.

          You can also define the default form to be used for
          print jobs with SET FORM:

                           News> SET FORM form-name

          Use SET NOFORM to revert to using the queue's form
          default.

          Both of these settings can be overridden by using
          the appropriate qualifiers on the PRINT command. The
          settings are saved in your NEWSRDR profile.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.9    Posting Articles

          The POST command is used to post an article to one or
          more newsgroups:

                           News> POST [/EDIT] [/[NO]SUBJECT="subject"] [groupname...]

          If you omit the "groupname", the article is posted to
          the current newsgroup. The /EDIT qualifier is used to

                                                              1-9

 


          Using NEWSRDR





          invoke a text editor to compose the article (see the
          description of the SET command, below). The /SUBJECT
          qualifier can be used to specify or omit a subject
          line for the article. If you do not use the /SUBJECT
          qualifier, you will be prompted for a subject line.

          Once you have been prompted for the text of your news
          article, or if editing, you have saved the article
          text with the text editor, you will be asked if you
          really want to post the article. If you answer "yes",
          or just press the RETURN key, the article will be
          posted. If you answer "no", the article will not be
          posted.

          If you decide not to post an article, or the article
          posting fails for some reason, you will be given the
          opportunity to keep the file containing the article
          text you entered.

          ___________________________

   1.9.1  Followup Articles

          A followup article is a reply to a specific article
          which can either be posted or mailed to the author of
          the original article. You must be reading an article
          to send a reply. REPLY (or FOLLOWUP) command is used
          to compose and send replies:

                           News> REPLY [/MAIL] [/POST] [/EDIT] [/NOEXTRACT] [/[NO]SUBJECT="text"]

          By using the /POST and /MAIL qualifiers, you can post
          your reply to the newsgroup, send it by mail, or both.
          If you do not specify /MAIL or /POST, the reply is
          posted. The /EDIT and /SUBJECT qualifiers mean the
          same as for the POST command. If you use an editor to
          compose the reply, the text of the original article
          is automatically placed in the reply (prefixed with
          greater-than signs) before the editor is invoked. The
          /NOEXTRACT qualifier can be used to prevent this from
          occurring.

          ___________________________

   1.9.2  Cancelling an Article

          If you post an article that you wish you hadn't, you
          can have the article removed from the news system by
          using the CANCEL command:

                           News> CANCEL [artnum]

          You must either specify the article number or be
          reading the article you wish to cancel in order to
          issue the CANCEL command.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.10   Sending Mail Messages

          You can use the MAIL (or SEND) command to send
          messages to other users, which has much the same
          format as the SEND command in VMS MAIL:

                           News> MAIL [/EDIT] [/TO=(address...)] [/SUBJECT="subj"] [fspec]

          The only difference between this command and the VMS
          MAIL SEND command is the use of the /TO qualifier to
          specify the destination(s) of the mail message. If you
          omit the /TO qualifier, you will be prompted for the
          address(es) of the recipient(s).

          Note that mail addresses within NEWSRDR are NOT the
          same as for VMS MAIL, but are addresses used by your
          Internet mailer. For example, if you use PMDF's "IN%"
          prefix to direct mail to Internet addresses from
          VMS MAIL, you would not use that prefix in NEWSRDR;
          NEWSRDR will tack the prefix onto the address for you
          automatically when sending your message through VMS
          MAIL. You also need to use quotation marks around
          addresses only if you specify them with the /TO
          qualifier on the MAIL command.

                                                             1-11

   1.11   Profile Settings

          NEWSRDR has several settings which you can change
          with the SET command. These settings are saved in your
          NEWSRDR profile, preserved between NEWSRDR sessions.
          You can display the current settings with the SHOW ALL
          command, which will also display the node name of the
          news server and the name of the current newsgroup.

   1.11.1 Personal Name

          Just as VMS MAIL allows you to set up a "personal
          name" which is included with your address on your
          outgoing mail, NEWSRDR allows you to do on news
          articles you post:

                           News> SET PERSONAL_NAME "your name"

          You may use any name you like as your personal name.

          ___________________________

   1.11.2 Article Headers

          News articles are generally accompanied by large
          numbers of header lines which identify various
          aspects of the articles, some of which you may not
          be interested in. The command

                           News> SET HEADERS [NO]headername...

          is used to turn on or off the display of particular
          header lines when you read subsequent articles.
          The header names you can specify are: FROM, DATE,
          NEWSGROUPS, SUBJECT, MESSAGE_ID, PATH, REPLY_
          TO, SENDER, FOLLOWUP_TO, EXPIRES, REFERENCES,
          DISTRIBUTION, ORGANIZATION, KEYWORDS, APPROVED, LINES,
          and XREF. Specifying NO in front of a header name
          turns off its display in subsequent messages.

   1.11.3 Automatic Editing, Editor Name

          If you would like to use a text editor every time you
          compose an article or mail message, you can use the
          SET EDIT command to enable automatic editing:

                           News> SET [NO]EDIT [/EDITOR=(editorname,CALL)]

          If you use SET EDIT, the text editor will
          automatically be invoked for every POST, REPLY, and
          MAIL command, unless you use the /NOEDIT qualifier.
          You can turn off automatic editing with the SET NOEDIT
          command.

          In either case, you can specify which text editor
          you would like to use with the /EDITOR qualifier.
          Any callable editor may used; TPU (a.k.a. EVE) is the
          default. VMS comes with one other callable editor:
          EDT. The DEC Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE), if
          installed on your system, can also be used. There may
          also be other callable editors available at your site.

          If the editor you wish to use is not callable, you can
          instead set up a command procedure to be spawned as a
          subprocess which will invoke the editor:

                           News> SET [NO]EDIT [/EDITOR=("@command-procedure",SPAWN)]

          The command procedure must be of the form shown in
          Figure CMD-1.

          ___________________________

   1.11.4 Signature

          Some people like to have a standard "signature" be
          included at the end of each article they post. This
          signature usually contains the person's name, E-mail
          address, company name, and a disclaimer of some kind.
          The SET SIGNATURE command allows you to specify the
          name of a file to be used as a signature for articles
          you post and mail messages you send:

                                                             1-13

 


          Using NEWSRDR





                           News> SET [NO]SIGNATURE file-spec

          The specified file should contain no more than
          eight lines of text, each line containing no more
          than 80 characters. The contents of the file will
          automatically be appended to every article you post
          and every mail message you send through NEWSRDR. Use
          the SET NOSIGNATURE command to disable the inclusion
          of a signature file.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.12   Subprocesses

          NEWSRDR provides SPAWN and ATTACH commands for
          creating and moving among subprocesses. These commands
          are patterned after their counterparts in VMS MAIL.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.13   Keypad Keys

          NEWSRDR provides a DEFINE/KEY command for defining
          keys to perform NEWSRDR commands. This command is
          also patterned after its counterpart in VMS MAIL.
          In addition, you can create a file containing a
          collection of DEFINE/KEY commands to be loaded each
          time NEWSRDR is executed. The file should be placed in
          your SYS$LOGIN directory and should be called NEWSRDR_
          KEYDEFS.NRKEY. Alternatively, you can place the key
          definitions in another file and assign the name of
          that file to the logical name NEWSRDR_KEYDEFS.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.14   Setting Your Reply-To Address

          Typically, when you post an article, the "From"
          address that is entered in the article is used to
          address E-mail for replies that are mailed directly
          to you. If you prefer to have replies sent to a
          different E-mail address, you can define a logical
          name containing your preferred E-mail address:

                           $ DEFINE NEWSRDR_REPLY_TO "username@hostname"

          1-14

 


                                                    Using NEWSRDR





          No syntax checking is performed on this address, so
          you must specify your address carefully. Also, please
          note that some systems do not use the Reply-To header
          to address replies.

          Note: Your system manager can prevent you from using
          this feature.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.15   Header Caching

          Some NEWSRDR commands, such as READ/THREAD, require
          access to article headers for their operation. To cut
          down on network and news server load, and generally
          improve performance over multiple uses of these
          header-intensive commands, article headers are cached
          in memory by NEWSRDR when they are retrieved from the
          server. By default, up to 128 sets of headers may be
          cached at once. However, you can control the header
          cache size by defining the logical name NEWSRDR_
          HEADER_CACHE_SIZE to be the maximum number of sets
          of headers you wish to have cached. For example:

                           $ DEFINE NEWSRDR_HEADER_CACHE_SIZE 256

          This will cause NEWSRDR to hold up to 256 sets of
          article headers.

          Please note that the header cache works on a per-group
          basis only. This means that it works best when you
          do all your work in one group at a time, rather than
          jumping around to different newsgroups, reading a few
          articles at a time.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.16   Moving Your NEWSRDR Profile

          By default, NEWSRDR expects your profile to be called
          NEWSRDR_PROFILE.NRPF and to be located in your login
          directory. You can alter this by defining the logical
          name NEWSRDR_PROFILE to be the full file specification
          for your NEWSRDR profile:

                                                             1-15

 


          Using NEWSRDR





                           $ DEFINE NEWSRDR_PROFILE file-spec

          Add the logical name definition to your login command
          procedure to have it take effect each time you log in.

          __________________________________________________________________

   1.17   Using a NEWSRC File

          By default, all information about newsgroups you
          subscribe to and the articles you have seen in
          those groups is kept in your NEWSRDR profile. You
          may additionally have that information stored in a
          "newsrc" file. There are two main reasons for using a
          newsrc file:

          1  You use another news reader besides NEWSRDR and you
             want to be able to use either and maintain the same
             subscription/article information for both. Most
             other news readers use a newsrc file by default.

          2  You want to be able to control the order in which
             you visit newsgroups during your NEWSRDR session.

          You specify the use of a newsrc file with the SET
          NEWSRC command:

                           News> SET NEWSRC [file-spec] [/SUBSCRIBED_ONLY]

          If you omit the file-spec, it defaults to
          SYS$LOGIN:XX.NEWSRC. Specifying the /SUBSCRIBED_
          ONLY qualifier causes NEWSRDR to include only the
          newsgroups you subscribe to in the newsrc file; by
          default, all newsgroups are listed (for compatibility
          with other news readers). Use the SET NONEWSRC to
          disable the use of a newsrc file.

          NEWSRDR reads in your newsrc file after reading your
          NEWSRDR profile, and updates the subscription and
          article information. On exiting, NEWSRDR updates the
          newsrc file after updating your NEWSRDR profile. It
          will not overwrite an existing newsrc file, but will
          instead create a new version.

          ___________________________

   1.17.1 Specifying Newsgroup Order

          The newsrc file is a plain text file which can be
          modified with any VMS text editor. You can specify
          the order in which NEWSRDR visits newsgroups by
          rearranging the lines in the newsrc file. Be careful
          not to change the contents of the lines as you
          rearrange them; only news reader programs should make
          such changes.

          _______________________________________________________

          DESCRIPTION
          This command is implemented by passing the entire
          command to the VMS Screen Management (SMG) routines
          for processing by SMG$DEFINE_KEY. NEWSRDR does no
          processing on the command.

          Key definitions are not remembered between NEWSRDR
          sessions. To have keys defined automatically each time
          you run NEWSRDR, create a file containing DEFINE/KEY
          commands called NEWSRDR_KEYDEFS.NRKEY, located in
          SYS$LOGIN. Alternatively, you can call the file
          something else and define the logical name NEWSRDR_
          KEYDEFS to point to that file.

          QUALIFIERS

          and /NOTERMINATE. The default is /ECHO.

          /IF_STATE=state-list
          Specifies one or more states, any one of which must be
          set in order to enable the specified key definition.
          If you omit this qualifier, the current state is
          used. To specify more than one state, separate the
          state names with commas and surround the list with
          parentheses.

          /[NO]LOCK_STATE
          Causes the state specified by the /SET_STATE qualifier
          to be permanently retained when the defined key is
          pressed. The state is retained until changed by using
          another key that sets a state. If omitted or negated,
          the specified state is retained only until you press
          another key.

          /[NO]SET_STATE=state
          Establishes a state that is set when the defined
          key is pressed. A state name can be any alphanumeric
          string. The state lasts for one further keypress only,
          unless /LOCK_STATE is specified. If you omit or negate
          this qualifier, the state remains unchanged when the
          defined key is pressed. You cannot specify both /SET_
          STATE and /TERMINATE.

          /[NO]TERMINATE
          Determines whether the specified command string is
          executed when the defined key is pressed. If not
          terminated, you must press RETURN for the command
          to be executed. The default is /NOTERMINATE.

          /GROUP
          See the description for the DIRECTORY/GROUP command.

          /EXCLUDE=(keyword=(pattern...)...)
          Causes articles matching the specified exclusion
          criteria to be omitted from the listing. Valid values
          for keyword are FROM and SUBJECT.

          /FROM=(pattern...)
          Specifies one or more patterns to be matched against
          each article's From header. Only those articles
          matching one of the specified patterns are listed.

          /KEYWORD=(keyword...)
          Specifies one or more keywords. Only those articles
          with Keywords headers containing the specified
          keyword(s) are listed.

          /SUBJECT=(pattern...)
          Specifies one or more patterns to be matched against
          each article's Subject header. Only those articles
          matching one of the specified patterns are listed.

          /SEEN
          Specifies that seen articles should be included in the
          listing. If neither /SEEN nor /UNSEEN is specified,
          all articles are listed.

          /STRICT
          Used with the /THREAD qualifier, specifes that
          "strict" rules be used to determine threading. See
          Section 1.2.3 for more information.

          /THREAD
          Causes the articles to be listed in thread-order. Base
          notes of threads are displayed normally; subsequent
          notes in the thread are displayed with the article
          numbers indented.

          /UNSEEN
          Specifies that unseen articles should be included
          in the listing. If neither /SEEN nor /UNSEEN is
          specified, all articles are listed.

          /WIDTH=(keyword...)
          Alters the format of the DIRECTORY display. Possible
          values for keyword are:

          FROM=n     Sets the width of the From-address column.

          SUBJECT=n  Sets the width of the Subject column.

          By default, DIRECTORY uses approximately 20 columns
          for other fields and spacing and divides the rest of
          the terminal width evenly between the From column and
          the Subject column. Note that it is possible to exceed
          the terminal width by specifying large values for this
          qualifier; this may produce unexpected results.

          taken from the current newsgroup name. For example, an

          _______________________________________________________

          DESCRIPTION
          This command can be used to save articles into a
          file for future reference. One or more articles can
          be extracted into a file, but all articles must be
          in the current newsgroup. Using /APPEND causes the
          articles to appended to the specified file (which must
          already exist). Otherwise, a new file is created for
          the extracted articles.

          This command could be used from a batch job to
          periodically pick up any new articles from the news
          server and place them in your news archive (or a
          particular file). For example:

                           News> EXTRACT/HEADERS=FULL/GROUP=*/IGNORE/MARK/NEW

          This command would select all unseen articles from
          all the newsgroups you are subscribed to, extract them
          into their default files, and mark them as seen once
          they have been extracted.

          _______________________________________________________

          QUALIFIERS
          /[NO]APPEND
          Causes the articles to appended to the file. The
          default when file-spec is present on the command is
          /NOAPPEND; when file-spec is omitted, the default is
          /APPEND.

          /GROUP=(pattern,...)
          Selects articles from the specified newsgroup(s). A
          wildcard pattern may be specified; when wildcards are
          used, only subscribed newsgroups matching the pattern
          are selected. If this qualifier is not used, articles
          are selected only from the current newsgroup.

          /[NO]HEADERS[=FULL]

          the header lines to be omitted. Use /HEADERS=FULL
          to include all article headers, overriding the SET
          HEADERS/EXTRACT settings.

          /[NO]IGNORE
          Causes EXTRACT to honor ignore criteria (set with
          the SET IGNORE command) when selecting articles
          for extraction. By default, ignore criteria are not
          honored.

          DESCRIPTION
          This command sends the specified article by E-mail
          to the specified user or users. The complete article,
          including all headers, is treated as the text of the
          message. You can edit the text before it is sent, if
          desired.

          QUALIFIERS
          /[NO]EDIT
          Specifying /EDIT causes a text editor to be invoked
          so the message text can be edited before being sent.

          The default action for this qualifier is determined
          by the current SET EDIT setting (see the SET command
          description for more information).

          /[NO]SELF
          Specifying /SELF causes a copy of the message to be
          sent to your username in addition to the intended
          recipients. Specifying /NOSELF prevents the extra copy
          from being sent. If omitted, the default is taken from
          the SET COPY_SELF setting in VMS MAIL.

          /[NO]SUBJECT[="subject-text"]
          The /SUBJECT qualifier can be used to specify the
          subject for the message on the command line. Use
          /NOSUBJECT to omit a subject from the message
          altogether. If not specified, you are prompted for
          a subject line.

          /[NO]SIGNATURE
          The /SIGNATURE qualifier can be used to indicate
          that your "signature" file should or should not be
          included automatically at the end of the message when
          it is sent. The default action for this qualifier is
          determined by the current SET SIGNATURE setting.

          /TO=("user-spec"...)
          The /TO qualifier can be used to specify the
          destination users for the message. If the user-spec
          includes an at-sign ("@"), the message will be sent
          via your Internet mail system; otherwise, it will be
          sent via regular VMS MAIL. Specify multiple addresses
          by separating them with commas and enclosing the list
          in parentheses. If omitted, you are prompted for the
          destination address list.

          You can use this command to explicitly select the
          current newsgroup, to be able to extract articles from
          the newsgroup, etc. Note that some NEWSRDR commands
          (DIRECTORY, READ) implicitly set the current newsgroup
          for you.

          _______________________________________________________

          DESCRIPTION
          This command is similar to the SEND command in the VMS
          MAIL utility, with three small differences:

          1  You can specify the destination users on the command
             line with the /TO qualifier.

          2  The destination usernames are assumed to be
             Internet-style names and are automatically sent
             through the system's Internet mail system.

          3  After composing or editing the text of your message,
             you are asked for confirmation before the message is
             sent.

          DESCRIPTION
          This command is used to compose and post news
          articles. If you do not specify a file either with the
          file-spec parameter or the /FILE qualifier, and you
          are not using a text editor to compose the article,
          you are prompted for the article text one line at a
          time. Once you have entered the text of the article,
          you are asked to confirm the posting. If you do so,
          the article is transmitted to the NNTP server to be
          entered into the news system.

          _______________________________________________________

          QUALIFIERS
          /APPROVED

          address on it.

          /DISTRIBUTION=(dist-name ...)
          This qualifier can be used to restrict the
          distribution of the article to a particular area.
          If not specified, no restrictions are placed on the
          article's distribution. Typical distribution names are
          "usa", "na", "ny", etc.

          /[NO]EDIT
          Specifying /EDIT causes a text editor to be invoked
          so the article text can be edited before being sent.
          The default action for this qualifier is determined
          by the current SET EDIT setting (see the SET command
          description for more information).

          /EXPIRES=date-time
          Sets the expiration time on the article by adding

          format; use quotation marks if the date-time string
          contains any blanks.

          /FILE=file-spec
          Specifies a file whose contents should be posted as
          the text of the article. This qualifier can be used
          instead of the file-spec parameter to specify the
          article text file, if you do not wish to enter the
          name of the newsgroup to which the article should be
          posted. If omitted, you are prompted for the article
          text.

          /FOLLOWUP_TO=(group ...)
          This qualifier can be used to redirect any followups
          to this article to be posted to the specified
          newsgroup(s). By default, followups are posted to the
          same newsgroup(s) as the posted article.

          /KEYWORDS=(keyword...)
          Adds a Keywords: header to the article, listing the
          specified keywords. Unless quoted, the keywords are
          converted to lower case.

          /[NO]SIGNATURE
          The /SIGNATURE qualifier can be used to indicate
          that your "signature" file should or should not be
          included automatically at the end of the article when
          it is posted. The default action for this qualifier is
          determined by the current SET SIGNATURE setting.

          /[NO]SUBJECT[="subject-text"]
          The /SUBJECT qualifier can be used to specify the
          subject for the article on the command line. Use
          /NOSUBJECT to omit a subject from the article
          altogether. If not specified, you are prompted for
          a subject line.

          /SUMMARY="summary-text"
          Adds a Summary: header to the article, with the
          specified text.

          DESCRIPTION
          This command adds the specified article(s) to
          the current pending print job. If no print job is
          pending, a new job is created. Using /NOW (or /PRINT)
          causes the current pending print job to be closed
          and submitted to the print queue; using /CANCEL
          discards the print job without printing it. If you
          specify attributes on the PRINT command that are
          incompatible with the current pending print job (such
          as a different value for /QUEUE), the current print
          job is closed and printed and a new job is opened
          before the articles are copied.

          _______________________________________________________

          QUALIFIERS
          /AFTER=time
          Requests that the job not be printed until the
          specified date/time.

          /[NO]BURST[=keyword]
          Controls whether a burst page is printed at the start

          ONE; if omitted, ALL is assumed. Note that either

          Indicates that you should be notified by a broadcast
          message when the job has been printed. May be
          specified on the PRINT and PRINT/NOW commands.

          /NOW
          Closes the pending print job and submits it for

          QUALIFIERS
          /NEXT
          When used without /NEW, causes the next available
          article in the newsgroup to be displayed, even if you
          have seen it. When used with /NEW, causes the next
          article you have not yet seen to be displayed.

          /PREVIOUS
          Causes the next-lowest-numbered article in the
          newsgroup to be displayed.

          /NEW
          When used without /NEXT, causes the first article in
          the newsgroup you have not yet seen to be displayed.
          When used with /NEXT, causes the next unseen article
          after the article you are currently reading (if any)
          to be displayed.

          /FIRST
          Causes the first available article in the newsgroup to
          be displayed.

          /LAST
          Causes the last available article in the newsgroup to
          be displayed.

          /GROUP=group-name
          Makes the specified group the current group and
          selects articles from that group. If omitted, articles
          are selected from the current group.

          When used with the READ/NEXT/NEW command, no group
          name is specified. In this case, the /GROUP qualifier
          instructs NEWSRDR to move on to the next subscribed
          newsgroup before searching for new articles, skipping
          any unread articles in the current newsgroup. If no
          new article are found in any other newsgroup, the
          NEWS-W-NONEW message will be displayed, even if there
          are new articles in the current newsgroup.

          /STRICT
          Used with the /THREAD qualifier, specifies that strict
          threading rules should be applied. See Section 1.2.3
          for more information.

          /SUBJECT=(pattern ...)
          /SUBJECT
          Causes NEWSRDR to scan forward through the newsgroup
          until it finds an article matching one of the
          specified wildcard patterns. If no patterns are
          specified, the search is continued using the patterns
          last specified. If there are no more matching
          articles, NEWSRDR displays a message and clears the
          patterns, resetting the current article back to the
          first matching article.

          /THREAD
          Causes NEWSRDR to scan forward through the newsgroup
          until it finds another article with the same subject.
          Continued use of READ/THREAD can be used to view all
          articles on one subject, following the thread of
          conversation. If there are no more articles in the
          thread, NEWSRDR displays a message and the current
          article is reset back to the first article you read in
          the thread.

          The /NEW qualifier can be used with READ/THREAD to
          view only unseen articles in the thread.

          _______________________________________________________

          DESCRIPTION
          This command is used to compose and post and/or mail a
          follow-up article to the article currently being read.
          Just as for the MAIL and POST commands, you can use a
          text editor to compose the message, or be prompted for
          the message text. Once you have finished entering the
          message, you are asked to confirm the sending of the
          reply. Once confirmed, the follow-up message is sent
          to the NNTP server to be entered into the newsgroup
          and/or sent through the Internet mailer to the author.

          For posted replies, if you do not specify one or more
          group names on the REPLY command, the "Followup-
          to:" header in the original article determines the
          newsgroups to which the follow-up is posted. If there
          is no "Followup-to:" header, the follow-up article
          is automatically entered into the same newsgroup(s)
          as the original article. If the "Followup-to:" header
          specifies the word "poster," then the reply will not
          be posted and will instead be treated as a mailed
          reply.

          For mailed replies, the "Reply-to:" header in the
          original aritcle determines the destination of the
          reply message. If there is no "Reply-to:" header, the
          address in the "From:" header is used instead.

          _______________________________________________________

          QUALIFIERS
          /APPROVED
          Adds an Approved: header to the article, with your
          address on it.

          /DISTRIBUTION=(dist-name ...)
          This qualifier can be used to restrict the
          distribution of the article to a particular area.
          If not specified, no restrictions are placed on the
          article's distribution. Typical distribution names are
          "usa", "na", "ny", etc.

          Command Descriptions
          REPLY




          /[NO]EDIT
          Specifying /EDIT causes a text editor to be invoked
          so the article text can be edited before being sent.
          The default action for this qualifier is determined
          by the current SET EDIT setting (see the SET command
          description for more information).

          /EXPIRES=date-time
          Sets the expiration time on the article by adding
          an Expires: header. Specify the date and time in VMS
          format; use quotation marks if the date-time string
          contains any blanks.

          /[NO]EXTRACT
          If a text editor is used to compose the follow-up
          message, the current article text is automatically
          extracted with greater-than signs placed in front of
          each line of text, to be used as part of the reply.
          You can use the /NOEXTRACT qualifier to prevent this
          extraction from occurring. Note that /EXTRACT has no
          effect if you do not use a text editor for composing
          the follow-up.

          /FOLLOWUP_TO=(group ...)
          This qualifier can be used to redirect any followups
          to this article to be posted to the specified
          newsgroup(s). By default, followups are posted to the
          same newsgroup(s) as the posted article.

          /KEYWORDS=(keyword...)
          Adds a Keywords: header to the article, listing the
          specified keywords. Unless quoted, the keywords are
          converted to lower case.

          /MAIL
          Specifies that the reply is to be mailed to the author
          of the original message. If neither /MAIL nor /POST
          is specified, /POST is assumed. A reply may be both
          mailed and posted.

          /POST
          Specifies that the reply is to be posted as a follow-
          up article. If neither /MAIL nor /POST is specified,
          /POST is assumed. A reply may be both mailed and
          posted.

          /[NO]SELF
          For mailed replies, specifying /SELF causes a copy of
          the message to be sent to your username in addition to
          the intended recipients. Specifying /NOSELF prevents
          the extra copy from being sent. If omitted, the
          default is taken from the SET COPY_SELF setting in
          VMS MAIL.

          /[NO]SIGNATURE
          The /SIGNATURE qualifier can be used to indicate
          that your "signature" file should or should not be
          included automatically at the end of the article when
          it is sent. The default action for this qualifier is
          determined by the current SET SIGNATURE setting.

          /[NO]SUBJECT[="subject-text"]
          The /SUBJECT qualifier can be used to specify the
          subject for the message on the command line. Use
          /NOSUBJECT to omit a subject from the message
          altogether. If not specified, the subject of the
          message is determined as follows:

          o  If there is no subject line in the original message,
             or the subject line is the text "(none)", no subject
             is added to the message.

          o  If the subject line in the original message begins
             with "Re:" (upper or lower case), it is copied
             verbatim to the new message's subject line.

          o  Otherwise, the new subject line is the original
             subject line with "Re:" added at the beginning.

          /SUMMARY="summary-text"
          Adds a Summary: header to the article, with the
          specified text.

          /TO=("user-spec"...)
          The /TO qualifier can be used to specify the
          destination users for the message, when the reply
          is to be mailed. If the user-spec includes an at-sign
          ("@"), the message will be sent via your Internet mail
          system; otherwise, it will be sent via regular VMS
          MAIL. Specify multiple addresses by separating them
          with commas and enclosing the list in parentheses. If
          omitted, the destination address is obtained from the
          Reply-To header in the article (or the From header, if
          there is no Reply-To header).

          DESCRIPTION
          This command controls how the READ/NEW series of
          commands behave when they run out of articles in a
          newsgroup and jump to the next newsgroup that has
          unseen articles. The default is AUTO_READ_NEW, which
          causes the first unseen article in the new group to be
          displayed automatically. If you set NOAUTO_READ_NEW,
          when the group change occurs you are returned to the
          News> command prompt.

          DESCRIPTION
          This command sets the default field widths for the
          From and Subject fields in DIRECTORY listings. By
          default, the two fields split the available screen
          width evenly. You can set a specific width (including
          zero) for one or both fields. If you set a specific
          width for one field, the remaining available screen
          width is used for the other.

          Specifying no qualifiers resets the widths back to the
          even-split default.

          DESCRIPTION
          This command is used to turn on or off the automatic
          use of a text editor for message composition. The
          setting can be overridden on the POST, MAIL, and REPLY
          commands with the /[NO]EDIT qualifier.

          _______________________________________________________

          QUALIFIERS
          /EDITOR=(editor [,type])
          This qualifier can be used to specify the editor to
          be used, which can be either callable or spawned as
          a subprocess. If type is CALLABLE, then editor must
          be the name of a callable editor. NEWSRDR can use any
          callable editor for message composition that meets the
          following calling standard:

          o  The callable editor's shareable library name must
             be xxxSHR.EXE, where "xxx" is the name by which the
             editor will be called. The library must reside in
             SYS$SHARE or must have an exec-mode logical pointing
             to the library elsewhere.

          Command Descriptions
          SET EDIT




          o  The shareable library must contain an entry point
             which called xxx$EDIT, which must take the input
             file-spec and output file-spec, both character
             strings passed by descriptor, as the first two
             arguments. If there are optional arguments, the
             xxx$EDIT routine must not rely on having more than
             two arguments present.

          The Digital-supplied editors TPU, EDT, and TECO, and
          the (layered product) DEC Language-Sensitive Editor
          (LSE) all follow this calling standard.

          NEWSRDR uses LIB$FIND_IMAGE_SYMBOL to map the editor
          into the process's virtual address space at runtime.

          If type is SPAWN, then editor must be a command string
          for invoking a command procedure that follows of the
          form in Figure CMD-1.

          DESCRIPTION
          By default, NEWSRDR sends messages directly via VMS
          MAIL when the destination address does not appear to
          be a network-type mail address. With SET FORCE_MAIL_
          PROTOCOL, you can force all addresses to be handled
          by your network mail handler (called a "foreign mail
          protocol" in VMS MAIL terminology).

          This feature may be useful if your network mailer
          includes support for per-user aliases and other
          features in which a network mail address might appear
          to NEWSRDR to be a local address.

          This command is used to add or remove an ignore
          criterion (sometimes called a "kill file") for a
          single newsgroup or for all newsgroups. The criterion
          can be based on the author of the article (/FROM), the
          subject of the article (/SUBJECT), or the Newsgroups
          header of the article (/NEWSGROUPS). Any articles
          matching the criterion will automatically be marked as
          seen and will not be displayed when READ/NEW is used.

          Use SET NOIGNORE to remove an erroneous ignore
          criterion or when the subject or author you wish to
          ignore is at a more reasonable activity level.

          Ignore criteria are stored in your NEWSRDR profile and
          are retained between NEWSRDR sessions.

          This command should be used sparingly and with
          caution.

          /FROM=pattern
          Bases the criterion on the author (From line) of an
          article. The pattern may contain VMS wildcards. Any
          From line matching the wildcard pattern, or containing
          the specified text if no wildcards are used, will be
          ignored. You may specify only one ignore criterion per
          command.

          /MESSAGE_ID=pattern
          Bases the criterion on the Message-ID header of an
          article. The pattern may contain VMS wildcards. Any
          Message-ID line matching the wildcard pattern, or
          containing the specified text if no wildcards are
          used, will cause the article to be ignored. You may
          specify only one ignore criterion per command.

          /NEWSGROUPS=pattern
          Bases the criterion on the Newsgroups header of an
          article. The pattern may contain VMS wildcards. Any
          Newsgroups line matching the wildcard pattern, or
          containing the specified text if no wildcards are
          used, will be ignored. You may specify only one ignore
          criterion per command.

          PARAMETERS
          action
          The action to be taken on discovery of a new
          newsgroups. This can be one of NONE, PROMPT, or
          SUBSCRIBE. See the description section for details.

          _______________________________________________________

          DESCRIPTION
          The default action, NONE, has NEWSRDR announce the
          presence of each new newsgroup, with no further
          action. Setting the PROMPT action has NEWSRDR prompt
          you interactively for whether you would like to
          subscribe to each new newsgroup. The SUBSCRIBE
          action has NEWSRDR subscribe you to new newsgroups
          automatically, with no prompting.

          This setting can be overridden for a single NEWSRDR
          session with the /NEWGROUP_ACTION qualifier on the
          NEWSRDR command. For example, if your news server has
          recently added a large number of newsgroups and your
          NEWGROUP_ACTION setting is SUBSCRIBE or PROMPT, you
          could avoid the additional effort of unsubscribing or
          replying to all the prompts by taking the following
          steps:

          1  Press <CTRL/Y> to break out of NEWSRDR and use the
             command

          DESCRIPTION
          This command enables or disables the use of a newsrc
          file. Newsrc files are described in Section 1.17. They
          are plain text files, typically used by other news
          readers, that describe the newsgroups you subscribe
          to and which articles you have seen. Using a newsrc
          file increases NEWSRDR's compatibility with other
          news readers and allows you to control the order in
          which newsgroups are visited during NEWSRDR sessions
          by ordering the newsgroups in the newsrc file as you
          desire.

          _______________________________________________________

          QUALIFIERS
          /[NO]PURGE
          Controls whether NEWSRDR automatically purges old
          versions of your newsrc file. The default is to
          purge old versions and to rename the new version
          back to version 1 (just as for your NEWSRDR profile).
          Use /NOPURGE to keep the old versions. If you use
          /NOPURGE, you may want to control the number of
          versions kept in your directory with the DCL command
          SET FILE/VERSION_LIMIT=n.

          /[NO]SUBCRIBED_ONLY
          By default, the newsrc file will list all available
          newsgroups. This is to maintain compatibility with
          most other news readers. However, the full list can
          take up a substantial amount of disk space. Specifying
          /SUBSCRIBED_ONLY causes NEWSRDR to save information
          only about the newsgroups you are subscribed to. This
          may reduce compatibility with other news readers, but
          saves on disk space and still provides the opportunity
          to modify the newsgroup visiting order for NEWSRDR
          sessions.

          _______________________________________________________

          SPAWN

          Creates a subprocess of the current process. The
          context of the subprocess is copied from the current
          process. You can use the SPAWN command to leave
          NEWSRDR temporarily, perform other functions, and then
          return to NEWSRDR.

          _______________________________________________________

          PARAMETERS
          command
          Specifies the DCL command string that executes in the
          context of the created subprocess. When the command
          completes, the subprocess terminates and control is
          returned to the parent process. If this parameter is
          not specified, a subprocess is created that transfers
          control to DCL command level.

          _______________________________________________________

          QUALIFIERS
          /INPUT=filespec

                                                            SPAWN




          subprocess. If you specify a command string along with
          an input file, the command string is processed before
          the commands in the input file. Once processing is
          complete, the subprocess is terminated.

          /[NO]LOGICAL_NAMES
          Specifies that the logical names of the parent process
          are to be copied to the subprocess. When you do not
          want the subprocess to use the logical names of the
          parent process, enter the qualifier /NOLOGICAL_NAMES.
          The default is /LOGICAL_NAMES.

          /OUTPUT=filespec
          Identifies the output file to which the results of
          the SPAWN operation are written. Whenever you use the
          /NOWAIT qualifier, you should also use the /OUTPUT
          qualifier to specify a new output destination. Doing
          so prevents output from being displayed while you
          are specifying new commands. If you omit the /OUTPUT
          qualifier, output is written by default to the current
          SYS$OUTPUT device.

          /PROCESS=subprocess-name
          Specifies the name of the subprocess to be created.
          The default name of the subprocess is "USERNAME_n".

          /[NO]SYMBOLS
          Determines whether the system passes DCL global
          and local symbols to the subprocess. The default is
          /SYMBOLS.

          /[NO]WAIT
          Controls whether the system waits until the subprocess
          is completed before allowing more commands to be
          specified. The /NOWAIT qualifier allows you to
          specify new commands while the specified subprocess
          is running. If you specify /NOWAIT, you should also
          use the /OUTPUT qualifier to direct the output stream
          to a file, rather than displaying it on your terminal.

          automatically for you at the start of a NEWSRDR
          session, but if you have spent a long time in NEWSRDR,
          this command should be used. A message is displayed
          for each newsgroup in which unseen articles are found.

          Information about all active newsgroups is provided,
          unless you specify the /PARTIAL qualifier.

          Only information about newsgroups to which you
          are subscribed is obtained. This qualifier should
          generally not be used, since the information from a
          full update is needed for some other NEWSRDR commands
          to work properly.
