WASD Scripts
------------

  *  CONAN is used to access VMS Help and text libraries.

  *  HYPERSHELF is used to navigate BNU or Bookreader shelves.

  *  HYPERREADER is the book reader (BNU and Bookreader format).

  *  HYPERSPI is a system performance monitor (of sorts!)


INSTALLATION
------------

Unbundled from the WASD VMS Hypertext Services package for use by the OSU
(DECthreads) server.  Ported using OSU v3.3a  Installation steps:

  *  link executables ... @BUILD LINK

  *  copy executables and support procedures ... @INSTALL

  *  add general and per-script mapping rules as described below

  *  HyperSPI has additional requirements,
     see HYPERSPIREADME.TXT in this same directory.

Runtime files (documentation, images, etc.) are located in the [.RUNTIME]
subdirectory.  The following general mapping rule should be added to
HTTP_PATHS.CONF  Of course they may be relocated if desired provided the rule
reflects the new location.

  pass /wasd/runtime/* /www_root/script_code/wasd/runtime/*

The CGISYM.EXE utility is used to create the required CGI DCL symbol
environment (similar to CGI_SYMBOLS.EXE and SET_DCL_ENV.EXE without the
non-required CGILIB.C and SCRIPTLIB.C functionality).

The HyperReader, HyperShelf and Conan scripts can all respond with a "HTTP/1.0
304 Not Modified" against requests with "If-Modified-Since:" header lines.  The
SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL logical is used to generate the GMT times used in the
calculations.  If this logical is not correctly maintained (as in many VMS v6.n
systems) an invalid time error may be reported by the script.  In the relevant
script support procedure simply uncomment the indicated line to define the
HTTPD$GMT logical which provides a work-around.


CONAN
-----

Add the following rule before mapping the scripts:

  map /conan* /htbin/conan*

To make the server's default help script conan comment out the "helpgate" rule
and add (leave the above rule in place):

  #map /help* /htbin/helpgate/help* 
  map /help* /htbin/conan*

In addition map all paths required for help or text library access (if not
already provided for other requirements), for example:

  pass /sys$common/syshlp/* /sys$common/syshlp/*
  pass /sys$common/syslib/* /sys$common/syslib/*


HYPERREADER
-----------

Add the following rules before mapping the scripts:

  map /hypershelf* /htbin/hypershelf*
  map /hyperreader* /htbin/hyperreader*

Mapping entries will be required for ALL paths to books, shelves, etc.
The following two rules are useful for BNU-style ODL CDs (V7.n):

  pass /disk$axpdoc* /disk$axpdoc*
  pass /disk$vaxdoc* /disk$vaxdoc*

To access the default DECW$BOOKSHELF library:

  http://host/hypershelf

To access a BNU library specify it's location:

  http://host/hypershelf/sys$common/decw$book/library.decw$bookshelf
  http://host/hypershelf/sys$common/decw$defaults/user/library.odl
  http://host/hypershelf/where-ever/library.odl

To directly access a book:

  http://host/hypershelf/sys$common/decw$book/bookreader.decw$book
  http://host/hypershelf/where-ever/book.bkb


HYPERSPI
--------

See the HYPERSPIREADME.TXT in this same directory.

The [.RUNTIME]HYPERSPIEXAMPLE.GIF image gives some idea of what the
script-processed data looks like via a browser (before you go to all the
trouble of setting it up ;^)
