DCC, LANGUAGES, Disciplined ANSI C Language Checker

This product checks that a C source file complies with the precepts of
Disciplined C, a set of rules aiming at elevating ANSI C to the rank of
high level language (as opposed to portable assembly language), and making
as much semantics as possible flow from the design to the source code. This
is achieved mainly via quasi-compulsory types/constants naming and 'const'
qualifier use.

The product also detects most of the pitfalls of the C language, helps the
programmer organize his program modules and write them so that they are well
encapsulated and more portable, and finally gives some much-needed compile-time
checking tools.

dcc is quite fast (from 5 to 10 times faster than a compiler), and is itself
written in Disciplined C.

Its updates are available via anonymous ftp at 'ftp.supelec.fr', subdirectory
'pub/lang/dcc'. Have a try at it !
