Welcome to 'dcc' !

It is a good tool to improve one's C coding style (if necessary), especially
when developping a new application; it also checks that a C source file
contains no pifalls and is ANSI C conformant.

Just use the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM menu to have a try at it (in non-interactive
mode). The source file being tested is named "trydcc.c", and you can edit it at
will (as well as the header file "trydcc.h").

To test dcc in interactive mode, type "dcc -zcc trydcc" in a Decterm-like
window (but don't do it first, because the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM sets up the appli-
cation environment).

You can add/remove dcc options in the dcc command line. The list of available
options is obtained using the command 'dcc' without parameter.

You can add default dcc options via the environment variable (symbol) DCCDFLTS
(DCC DeFauLTS); to do so, use the DCL command  DCCDFLTS :== "...", for example :

	DCCDFLTS :== "+zepl -zsam +zmsg1000 +zae"

The TSTDCC.COM file tests dcc on its own source files; it should detect no
error nor warning.

The TSTDIFFTRY.COM file does a 'diff' between the current results of checking
'trydcc' and results obtained at Supelec and stored in the RESTRYDCC.TXT file.

The DCREADME.TXT file explains more about dcc, especially how to install it
into the system; you will then have to redefine the 'dccdir' logical name. The
'dccsysincldir' logical name value is hopefully right for your system; it tells
dcc the directory where system header files ('stdio.h' etc.) can be found.
