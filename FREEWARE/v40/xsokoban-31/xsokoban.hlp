1 XSOKOBAN
Pushing objects around...

SYNOPSIS

 $ xsokoban [-s -r -c -m -nn -display <disp> {-w |-walls} {-rv | -reverse}
            {-f | -font} <fn> {-b | -bitdir} <path> {-fg | -foregound} <color>
            {-bg | -backgound} <color> {-bd | -border} <color> 
            {-pr | -pointer} <color> -xrm <arg> ] 

2 DESCRIPTION
The goal of  xsokoban
is to push all the round objects into the score area of each level
using the mouse or the arrow keys. The arrow keys move the player in
the corresponding direction, pushing an object if it is in the way and
there is a clear space on the other side. The mouse buttons each have a
distinct function.

If the left mouse button is pressed on a clear square, the player will
move to that location via the optimal path if such a path exists;
otherwise, the game will beep.

If the middle button is pressed on an object that is adjacent to the
player, the object will be pushed one step.  If the middle mouse button
is pressed on an empty space, the player will move the closest object
that is on a straight line with the destination, such that the object
can be pushed in that direction, and the player is not directly between
the destination and the object.  Before pushing the object, the player
is moved optimally to start the push.

Either the left or middle mouse buttons may be used to "drag" an object
from an initial to a final position. If a straightforward way exists
for the man to push the object without moving any other objects, the
man will execute appropriate moves and pushes to get the object to
the desired destination.

The right button mouse undoes the last user action, and may be used any
number of times.


The rest of the functions are bound to the keyboard:

   ?
Display a help screen.
    8
   q
Quit the game.
     
   s
Save and quit.
     
   u
Undo the last action. Same as right mouse button.
     
   U
Restart a level.
      
   ^R
Redraw the screen.
      
   h,j,k,l
Move the man just like the arrow keys, as in vi (1).

   S
View the score file.

Scores in xsokoban
are saved in the score file if they are of high
enough rank. A score is ranked according to how many scores are better
than it; there are no scores superior to a rank 1 score, only one score
superior to a rank 2 score, and so on. If two scores are identical, the
first one entered is ranked higher.

2 OPTIONS
       
    -s [level]
Print the scores on standard output. The optional level will restrict
the printout to scores on just that level.
      
    -c 
Create a new score file (can be ran only by the owner of the game).
       
    -m
Merge score files.
       
    -r
Restore a saved game.
      
    -nn
Start at level nn, 
provided that levels below it are completed. 

    -display <display>
Run the game on the named display.

   {-w | -walls}
Use fancy walls. (This is the default unless an option bitmap set is used)

   {-rv | -reverse}
Use reverse video.

   {-f | -font} <fontname>
Use the named font instead of the default 9x15 font.

   {-b | -bitdir} <path>
Use the bitmaps found in <path> instead of the defaults.

   {-fg | -foreground} <color>
Use the named color as the foreground color. (default is BlackPixel())

   {-bg | -background} <color>
Use the named color as the background color. (default is WhitePixel())

   {-bd | -border} <color>
Use the named color as the border color. (default is foreground color)

   {-pr | -pointer} <color>
Use the named color as the mouse pointer foreground. (default is foreground)

   -xrm <arg>
<arg> is an X Resource specification.

2 SPECIAL_BITMAPS
In order to define your own bitmaps for xsokoban
you only need to know the names of which files it is looking for.
The standard bitmap files are:

   man.xbm
-- The player bitmap.

   goal.xbm
-- The goal area bitmap.

   wall.xbm
-- The standard wall bitmap.

   object.xbm
-- The object that gets pushed.

   treasure.xbm
-- The bitmap for the object when it is on the goal.

   saveman.xbm
-- The bitmap for the player when it is on the goal.

To use the fancy walls option, you need the following additional files.

   lonewall.xbm
-- a wall with connections on no sides.

   southwall.xbm
-- a wall with only northern connections

   northwall.xbm
-- a wall with only southern connections

   eastwall.xbm
-- a wall with only western connections

   westwall.xbm
-- a wall with only eastern connections

   llcornerwall.xbm
-- a wall with northern and eastern connections

   ulcornerwall.xbm
-- a wall with southern and eastern connections

   lrcornerwall.xbm
-- a wall with northern and western connections

   urcornerwall.xbm
-- a wall with southern and western connections

   north_twall.xbm
-- a wall with connections on all BUT northern side

   south_twall.xbm
-- a wall with connections on all BUT southern side

   east_twall.xbm
-- a wall with connections on all BUT eastern side

   west_twall.xbm
-- a wall with connections on all BUT western side

   centerwall.xbm
-- A wall will connections on all four sides.

2 BUGS
Auto bitmap resizing code doesn't take into account font sizes.

Feedback on user error is poor (only beeps).
