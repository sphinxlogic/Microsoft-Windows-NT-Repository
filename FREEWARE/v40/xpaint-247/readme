Release notes for XPaint 2.4.7
------------------------------

NOTE: This version of XPaint is released and maintained by Torsten Martinsen
(bullestock@dk-online.dk). It is based on XPaint 2.1.1, which was written by
David Koblas. Please do NOT send bug reports etc. to David Koblas.

To compile this program, you will need:

	- an ANSI C compiler (such as GCC),
	- the Xpm library, version 3.4c or later

To compile with support for TIFF images, you must have the TIFF library,
version 3.2 or later. 

To compile with support for JPEG images, you must have version 6 of the JPEG
library from The Independent JPEG Group, released 2-Aug-95. Newer versions
should also work.

To compile with support for PNG images, you must have the PNG library.

The TIFF/JPEG/PNG libraries can be downloaded from
ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/{tiff,jpeg,png}. libpng requires zlib, which is also
in the png subdirectory.

KNOWN BUGS

The 'Water Colour Brush' tool does not work well on colour mapped visuals with
256 colours. The reasons are:
	1) It is too slow. This could perhaps be fixed.
	2) All entries in the colour map are used up in rather quickly.
	3) The limited number of colours give rise to round-off errors
	   when computing the new pixel colours.

Undo/Redo exhibits some weirdness in certain circumstances.

Selecting a region enables the 'Last Filter' menu item.
