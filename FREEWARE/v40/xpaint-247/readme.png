Note that the writing of alpha-channel images in PNG format is still not
supported.  This is mainly laziness (or busy-ness) on my part, but I have
to get some other things done. :-)  I'll get back to it one of these days...
The PNG debug messages are now optional, at least.

Problems with the PNG support can be reported to me.  More generic XPaint
problems should probably go to Torsten.  Note that the original author,
David Koblas, is no longer involved; don't pester him with anything.
