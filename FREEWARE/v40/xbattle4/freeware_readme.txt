XBATTLE4, GAMES, Multi-user battle strategy game under X

    Xbattle  is a   concurrent  multi-player battle  strategy   game  that
    captures the dynamics  of a  wide  range of military  situations.  The
    game board is a matrix of game squares (or hexagons- see "-hex" option
    below) which can be  occupied by troops  of various colors  or shades.
    The number of troops in a square is indicated by the size of a colored
    troop square (or  circle, with "-hex") within the  game   square.  The
    troops are commanded by clicking the mouse near the edge of the square
    in the direction that the movement is to take place.  The command will
    be acknowledged by the appearance of a command vector, and thereafter,
    in each  update cycle, a certain  proportion  of  the troops will move
    from the source  square  to the destination  square until  the  source
    square is exhausted.  Command vectors can be set in several directions
    at  once, in which case  the movement is   divided evenly between  the
    vector directions, and the  command  remains  active until  cancelled.
    Thus a  trail of squares can be  set up as  a supply   line that  will
    deliver troops steadily at  its endpoint.   The command vector remains
    active even if the  number of troops  in that square is zero, although
    the command vector will then be displayed at half length.  The game is
    concurrent, so that  commands  are given continuously  by  all players
    without waiting for  turns.  Different  combinations of options create
    radically different games.
