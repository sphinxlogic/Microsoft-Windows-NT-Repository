protocol types, IEEE 802.2 SAPs, and IEEE Protocol IDs, and FDDI Extended
Service Frame IDs.

Address and protocol assignments used in Digital products under development
are shown here. Such assignments will be included in revisions of this
document as products are released. All address, protocol type, and protocol
ID values in ranges assigned to Digital that are not shown as assigned in
this document are reserved for future use and may be assigned at a later time.


Chapter 1   Introduction

This is the Digital registry of LAN addresses, multicast addresses, Ethernet
protocol types, IEEE 802.2 SAPs, and IEEE Protocol IDs, and FDDI Extended
Service Frame IDs. The values shown here apply to all LAN types that conform
to the IEEE general structure, i.e., IEEE 802.3 (CSMA/CD), including Ethernet),
802.4 (Token Bus), 802.5 (Token Ring) and ANSI FDDI. For more information
about these, refer to the applicable standards documents:

                   Station Management (SMT)

  1.1   Notation  canonical form

  The order of transmission of bits within each byte differs for various LANs:
  for IEEE 802.3 and 802.4, the least significant bit is transmitted first;
  for IEEE 802.5 and FDDI, the most significant bit is transmitted first.* This
  transmission order applies to all date "after" the MAC header; in particular
  it applies to the SAP and Protocol ID fields.

  The destination Address and Source Address fields in the MAC are treated
  differently: these are viewed as bitstrings where the first bit transmitted
  is always the Multicast bit.

* More precisely, in FDDI the most significant 4 bits of the byte are trans-
  mitted first; FDDI uses an encoding scheme in which transmission occurs in
  4-bit units.

  Clearly this combination of two different rules and the variety of transmis-
  sion order can lead to confusion in the use of address value assignments. To
  reduce this problem, IEEE has defined (in IEEE 802.1A - Overview and Archi-
  tecture) the "canonical" representation for addresses and other values. All
  values given in the registry are written in canonical form.

  The canonical form is written as a sequence of hexidecimal byte values sep-
  arated by hyphens. The byte transmission order is from left to right. The
  bits within each byte are interpreted as follows:

    o For MAC addresses, the first bit transmitted (i.e., in the first byte,
      the Multicast bit) is written as the Least Significant Bit of the can-
      onical form.

    o For all other values (i.e., SAP and Protocol ID), the Least Significant
      Bit of the value is written as the Least Significant Bit of the canonical
      form.

  An example of a canonical form MAC address, and its interpretation for vari-
  ous LANs, is shown below. In this example, the IEEE 802.x line shows the
  bits as transmitted (left to right) in the MAC header address fields. For
  the FDDI, it shows the FDDI PHY symbols as transmitted (left to right).

    Canonical:    AC-DE-48-00-00-80
    IEEE 802.x:   00110101 01111011 00010010 00000000 00000000 00000001
    FDDI:         3 5  7 B  1 2  0 0  0 0  0 1

  The second example shows a Protocol ID from a SNAP frame. As before the
  IEEE 802.x lines show the bits as transmitted (left to right) and the FDDI
  line he symbols as transmitted (left to right).

    Canonical:    AC-DE-48-00-80
    IEEE 802.3:   00110101 01111011 00010010 00000000 00000001
    IEEE 802.4:   00110101 01111011 00010010 00000000 00000001
    IEEE 802.5:   10101100 11011110 01001000 00000000 10000000
    FDDI:         A C  D E  4 8  0 0  8 0

  Implementors developing IEEE 802.5 or FDDI products should carefully study
  these rules, and the details given in IEEE 802.2A, to ensure that addresses,
  SAP values, and Protocol IDs are used correctly.

Currently DIGITAL adheres to the following IEEE SNAP Protocol Identification
Assignments.

5.1  Cross-company Assignments (Universally Administered)

     Last revision date: 21 November 1990

  The cross-company assigned (Universally Administered) Protocol Identification
  codes are :

  00-00-00-xx-xx    Ethernet protocol type mapping according to Internet
                    standard RFC 1042
  00-00-F8-xx-xx    Alternate Ethernet protocol type mapping protocol. This
                    Protocol ID is used by bridges in place of the 00-00-00
                    Protocol ID when the corresponding Ethernet protocol type
                    is listed for alternate translation an a table in the
                    bridge. This is done for protocols (such as AppleTalk)
                    where both Ethernet format and RFC 1042 format frames are
                    used, but not in conformance with RFC 1122 (Host Require-
                    ments).

                    NOTE: This range of Protocol IDs "SHALL NOT" be used on
                          IEEE 802.3 (CSMA/CD) LANs.

Chapter 6   FDDI Extended Service Frame IDs

  Extended Service Frames are defined in the ANSI FDDI (SMT) standard. SMT
  frames are used for FDDI layer management functions and allow for
  communication between cooperating FDDI SMT entities on a single FDDI ring.
  The Extended Service Frame class is used in SMT for proprietary extensions,
  experimental functions, etc., within the framework of the services provided
  by the SMT frames.

  In order to allow Extended Service Frames (ESF) to be defined by various
  parties without the risk of conflicks, the data portion of each ESF begins
  with an "ESF ID". This field serves essentially the same purpose as the
  Protocol ID in SNAP frames. The first 3 bytes are the OUI of the organization
  that defined the particular frame, and the remaining 3 bytes are assigned as
  desired by the organization. ESF IDs assigned by DIGITAL will have DIGITAL's
  OUI as the first 3 bytes, and the remaining 3 bytes will be used as a frame
  type. This eliminates the need for a separate frame type field, and
  simplifies processing of received ESF frames.

6.1  CAUTION  - ESF ID unconventional encoding rule

    As defined by the SMT standard, ESF IDs are *not* represented in canonical
    form in the SMT frame. Instead, they are encoded in the bytewise bit-

    Implementers must pay particular attention to this issue, to avoid
    incorrectly encoding ESF IDs or misinterpreting received ESF frames.

    For more details on the rules for encoding SMT frames, refer to the FDDI
    SMT standard (Chapter 4 in the Rev 5.1 version).

Chapter 7   802.5 Token Ring functional addresses

  The so-called "functional addresses" are a special case form of the standard
  IEEE 802 multicast (group) addresses. Th theory IEEE 802.5 supports normal
  multicast addressing, but actual implementations to not, and instead support
  only the very limited capabilities of functional addressing.

  Functional addresses have the form of locally administered addresses, but
  they are administered by IBM. Most are used for functions that are specific
  to the 802.5 token ring. A few relate to general functions that on other LAN
  types are supported by real multicast addresses.

7.1 CAUTION - Reversed notation of functional addresses

    IBM writes functional addresses in byte wise reversed notation, i.e.,
    interpreting the first address bit sent as the high order bit of the
    octet in the written form. This is the reverse of the canonical form
    as described in Chapter 1, and is a source of potential confusion and
    "serious" bugs.

    In the functional address lists in the remainder of this chapter,
    addresses are given first in the canonical form, and then also in
    the IBM notation. The canonical form is with hyphens, as usual; the
    IBM notation is shown with colons as separator, which is the IEEE 802
    recommended way for showing addresses in this form. (IBM generally writes
    them without any separator.)

7.2  General format of functional addresses

  All functional addresses are of the form 03-00-xx-xx-xx-xx (C000xxxxxxxx in
  reversed notation). In other words, they are locally administered group
  addresses. The remaining bits of the first two octets are zero. The next
  bit (17th bit)  is also zero to indicate a functional address. (If this
  bit is one, it indicates an 802.5 token ring specific multicast address
  of a different form, which fortunately does not seem to be actually used.)
  In the remaining 31 bits, a single bit is set.

  As a result, a total of 31 distinct functional addresses exists. Implemen-
  tations can filter functional addresses by checking the first 17 bits, and
  matching the remaining 31 bits against a mask (i.e., AND operation),
  accepting the frame if the function bit in the address is set in the mask.
