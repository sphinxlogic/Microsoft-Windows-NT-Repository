General Description:
--------------------

This program was created to enable me to download large files from the Internet
and then transfer them to my home DOS PC via a networked MAC. 

GSPLIT is a simple mechanism that allows you to transfer large files from from
a DEC machine to a non-networked PC using floppy disks. It copies the original
file to subfiles xxxxxxxx.001 through xxxxxxxx.0nn where nn is the number of
floppy disks needed. The subfiles can then be copied one at a time to diskettes,
either on a local floppy drive or a networked drive. An optional DOS batch file
can be created and copied to  your PC to re-generate the original file. (see
details below) 


Specifications:
---------------

- Choice of .7, 1.44, or 2.88 Megabyte formatted floppies

- Maximum size of source file (approximately):
 
            Floppy Size        Max Source
            -----------        ----------
                .7 Mb           45 Mb
               1.44Mb           91 Mb
               2.88Mb          183 Mb

- Maximum number of subfiles: 64


Operation:
----------

Source and output file directories may be specified. Your local directory is
default for source and output files if they are not specified.

You will have the option of creating a DOS batch file that can be
downloaded to your PC to re-generate the original file. It will have the name
XXXXJOIN.BAT, where XXXX is the first four letters of the source file.

If you do not use the batch file, you can re-join the subfiles by using the
DOS command line 'COPY /b xx.001+xx.002+xx.003.......+xx.0nn filename.fff'
where nn is the last subfile index, and fff is the original file suffix.
For a large disk set the batch file saves a lot of typing, but requires more
temporary hard disk space to run because of the intermediate files it creates.
The batch file will, however, automatically delete the temporary files.


Notes:
------

1. GSPLIT itself will work with any size file name, but it is strongly
recommended that it be kept to the old DOS format: 8.3 (or less) if you are
going to re-constitute the file on a DOS PC.

2. GSPLIT will use a minimum number of dikettes, but will not fill them 100%.
This is done intentionally to leave a small space for overhead files as
encountered when using a MAC with DOS formatted diskettes. You should also have
room enough to be able to copy the batch file to any one of the disk set.

3. Be sure that any file transfers are done in BINARY mode.

I hope this program proves to be as useful to you as it has been for me.
