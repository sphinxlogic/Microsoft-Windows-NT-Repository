http://zippy.sonoma.edu/kendrick/nbs/

December, 1997


WHAT IS 3D PONG?

  3D Pong is an X-Window game for 1 or 2 players.  It's a 3D game based
  on the first arcade game, "Pong."  Like "Pong," it's a game played with
  a ball and paddles.  The object is to hit the ball and get it in the
  other player's goal.  Use your paddle to deflect the ball and keep it
  from getting in your goal.

  3D Pong has three game modes:

    1. Two player - requires two X servers
    2. One player - against a computer player
    3. Handball - one player against gravity

ACM47, GAMES, An aerial combat simulator for X11 mono/multi-user

ACM Flight Simulator,  revision 4.7


What is ACM?
------------

ACM is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation.  My main design
objective was to provide source code that could be easily compiled and
executed on a wide variety of platforms.  To that end, acm is written entirely
in C, exploiting the programming features of Unix, X11, and the BSD socket
interface.

Players engage in air to air combat against one another using heat seeking
missiles and cannons.

ACM is implemented as two programs.  The first, named "acm", is a small
program that, when invoked, starts a flight session on a given workstation.
The second component, named "acms", is a server process that manages the
multiplayer environment.  It also manages the flight simulation and
display management that is required.  Most players will prefer to run the
acms process on a back-end server system on their local area network.  Players
at client workstations can then invoke the acm program to begin play.

ADVENTURE, GAMES, The original Adventure game

Adventure is the original magic / exploration simulation game. It hit
the streets back in the mid 1970s and no doubt was responsible for the
loss of countless software engineering hours. For a classic piece of
nostalgia and entertainment...

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.

This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther.  Most of the
features of the current program were added by Don Woods (DON @ SU-AI).
The current version was done by Kent Blackett and Bob Supnik.

ALTRIS, GAMES, 4 Tetris games under X Window

TETRIS GAMES
  I guess I could not control myself.  I made 4 versions of the game after
Q. Alex Zhao's tetris.3.1.2.tar.Z found at ftp.x.org in /contrib/games .
Every effort will be made to keep these current with his latest version.

altetris:	Just like Zhao's version except its altered. One has access to
		more polyominoes including diagonal polyominoes.
alwelltris:	Welltris version of above. Slide the polyominoes down the
		3-D well.
altertris:	Triangular version of altetris. (altritris did not look right)
		Polyiamonds bounce off walls.
alhextris:	You guessed it ... a hexagon version of altetris. Polyhexes
		bounce off walls. (Built independent of xhextris).


Problems (I am open to ideas and fixes):
  All above games require X and UNIX.
  I guess the last 3 need some improvement in the graphics.
  I tried to port them to VMS, but gave up.  (*)
  I looked into a alboxtris, maybe I will try again if I have the time.

DISK$FREEWAREV4_1:[ARCHIE]FREEWARE_README.TXT;3
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
ARCHIE, UTILITIES, Utility to search files available at FTP sites

[Last changed 04/14/92 v1.3.2]

 Enclosed you'll find a Prospero client for the archie service.  It'll
let you query the archie databases without actually using an
interactive process on the remote server's machine (e.g., archie.ans.net),
resulting in a MUCH better response time.  It also helps lessen the
load on the archie server itself.

 What's Archie?  It's a system that will let you check a database containing
thousands of entries for the files that're available at FTP sites around
the world.

 This is a third child of Clifford Neuman's Prospero project.  It's really
the Archie client that's included in the prospero stuff, but I've taken out
everything that's unnecessary for this client to work.  (Aka, you don't
have to build all of Prospero to get the Archie client.)  Khun Yee Fung
wrote an archie client in Perl, George Ferguson has written a client
for use with XWindows, based in part upon this code.  Also, Scott
Stark wrote a NeXT-Step client for the NeXT.

 Using the Archie Prospero interface in its true form will probably be of
interest---check out the file `Prospero' for an example of its interface.
If you find it intriguing, you should probably get the full prospero kit
from the University of Washington on cs.washington.edu in pub/prospero.tar.Z.

 Suffice to say, there are now a number of ways to query Archie without
bogging a server down with your logins.

 Check out the man page (or archie.doc, if you're using VMS or DOS)
for instructions on how to use this archie client.  VMS users please
note that you have to put quotes around args that are capital letters;
for example,  $ ARCHIE "-L"  to list the available servers.

 Please check to make sure you don't have "archie" aliased or modified
in some way to do a telnet or rlogin (which you may've done before
this command-line ability came into being).

 If Archie consistently hangs (at different times of day with
different queries), it's possible that your site has UDP traffic on
ports > 1000 blocked, for security reasons.  Type `make udptest' to
check---if it prints out the date, the Archie server is probably down;
if it doesn't print out the date, either Widener's computer is down
(God forbid ;-) ) or you do indeed have UDP blocked.  See your system
administrator in this case.  If the problem persists and haven't the
vaguest, then write me describing the situation and what machine/OS
you're using.

 Write to archie-group@cs.mcgill.ca with questions about Archie itself.
 Write to info-prospero@isi.edu about the Prospero protocol.
 Write to brendan@cs.widener.edu with questions about this specific package.

BAT V1.10 -- Submit multiple commands to a batch queue from DCL

This kit contains all the files necessary for installing the BAT
utility.  Requires VMS V5.0 or later.

BAT is designed to be invoked via a foreign command:

    $ BAT :== $disk:[directory]BAT.EXE

BAT lets you submit multiple commands to a batch queue easily and
quickly. For example, you can use:

    $ bat cc := cc/vaxc|mmk

or

    $ bat
    _Command: cc := cc/vax
    _Command: mmk
    _Command: ^Z
    $

to define CC for that batch job and then run MMK in the current
directory. BAT will automatically create the a temporary .COM file
that sets the default to the current directory and includes the
commands to be executed. The .COM file is then submitted to a batch
queue for processing.

BAT is written in BLISS. Complete sources are provided.

$ battaliondatadir :== "BATTALION_DIR:"

Logical names:

$ define/trans=conc BATTALION_DIR disk:[toto.battalion.]

Installation of data files:

$ cre/dir  disk:[toto.battalion]
$ backup/log [.BATTALION_DATA...]*.*;* battalion_dir:[000000...]*
$ set prot=(w:re)  battalion_dir:[000000...]*.*

Binaries provied where built under OpenVMS VAX 6.1 with DECW/Motif 1.2, Mesa
2.2 and DEC C 5.0 , and under OpenVMS Alpha 6.2 with DECW/Motif 1.2-4, Mesa 2.2
and DEC C 5.2

Rebuild:
------
On VAX, you need MESA 2.2 library to rebuild with COMPILE_VAX_MESA.COM and
and DEC C 5.2

Rebuild:
------
On VAX, you need MESA 2.2 library to rebuild with COMPILE_VAX_MESA.COM and
LINK_VAX_MESA.COM procedures. You need to copy LIBMESAGL.OLB_VAX and
LIBMESAGLU.OLB_VAX object libraries under [.SOURCE] directory or alter
option files.

On Alpha, you can rebuild with Open3D (however my version of Open3D crashes
when running battalion) with COMPILE_AXP_OPEN3D.COM and LINK_AXP_OPEN3D.COM
procedures, or use MESA 2.2 library with COMPILE_AXP_MESA.COM and
LINK_AXP_MESA.COM procedures. You need to copy LIBMESAGL.OLB_AXP and
LIBMESAGLU.OLB_AXP object libraries under [.SOURCE] directory or alter
option files.

When using MESA, you need to alter compile procedures to define GL logical name
pointing Mesa include files (however, on Alpha you can point to SYS$LIBRARY if
Open3D is installed).

BISON, UTILITIES, GNU bison -- parser generator (alternative to yacc)

aug-1995 Sheldon Bishov, bishov@star.enet.dec.com

The source for files was Free Software Foundation, ftp from
anonymous@prep.ai.mit.edu

To build, unzip file, set default to the source directory, and enter command:
    $ @build VAXC  ! VAX/VAXC
or
    $ @build DECC  ! Alpha/DECC; not tested on VAX/DECC

To (optionally) load help into user library, set default to the source
directory and enter the following commands:
    $ library/help/create bison.hlb
    $ library bison.hlb/help bison.hlp
    $ @install_help bison.hlb

Other requirements for installation:

Assign a rooted directory logical gnu_bison; for example,

$ assign /trans=concealed WORK215:[TOOLS.BISON-A2_3.] gnu_bison

Either build bison.exe using the information in *readme*.* and install.;
files, or use the version from the [.VAX] or [.ALPHA] subdirectory. 
Move the .exe file to the gnu_bison:[000000] directory. Then be sure to
move a copy of the file bison.simple and (for VAX only) vmshlp.obj to
this same directory.  Note that the VAX version was built under OpenVMS
V6.1, the Alpha version under OpenVMS V6.2.

If you use a name for the executable file other than bison.exe, edit
the bison.cld file.  For example if you want to use the name bison.exe_vax,
change the "IMAGE" line to: 
	IMAGE	GNU_BISON:[000000]BISON.EXE_VAX

Read other *readme*.* files, and install.; for further installation 
instructions.

To process bison input files, and compile the code generated by bison,
you can use build-bison.com.  P1 is the name of the file, without the 
.bison or other extension.  A sample input file, calc.bison, is provided
in the source directory.  When built it functions as a simple 
(non-graphical) calculator.

Following changes in code:

build.com: Update cc_option

build-bison.com: New procedure, makes easier build of .exe using bison

install_help.com: new procedure for optional installation of help file.

vmsgetargs.c: Remove redundant extern int declarations

 If you use this program, why not drop me a line and let me know!

 This program fakes a normal hayes modem connected to a terminal server
 into calling you back.

 For security reasons, auto answer is disabled at the start of the sequence.
 If a failure is detected, the program logs out the user, leaving the modem
 at a terminal server prompt (with auto-answer turned off).  The terminal
 server's inactivity timer should be set to eventually drop DTR and reset
 the modem to memory defaults.

 After the call is reconnected, the modem parameters are returned to normal.

 This program has been tested on Hayes 9600, and Hayes ULTRA modems.  Your
 mileage (and AT commands) may vary.

 The program should be set up as a foreign command.  I have a command 
 called "HOME.COM":

              $!This is home.com
              $ callback :== $sys$login:callback.exe
              $ callback 9w 555-1212
              $ @sys$login:login.com

 So a login of "username/login=home" will call me back and then run the
 normal login file.

CALLMON, UTILITIES, Procedure Call Monitor for OpenVMS Alpha

CallMon is a low-level debug utility for developers.

With CallMon, an application can monitor all calls to a selected set
of procedures, taken from any shareable image (including the various
OpenVMS run-time libraries).

The calls are intercepted whether they are come from the application
or  from  the  OpenVMS  run-time libraries. For instance, if CallMon
intercepts all calls to LIB$GET_VM, the application will be notified
each  time  LIB$GET_VM  is called either from the some module of the
application, from an OpenVMS library routine in some shareable image
or even from another routine in LIBRTL.EXE.

CallMon  is  especially useful to implement higher level tools which
need  to  monitor  the  activity of some library routines. A typical
usage  of  CallMon  may  be  the  monitoring  of  the virtual memory
allocation  (intercepting  calls  to  routines  like  LIB$GET_VM and
LIB$FREE_VM).

To intercept a routine, the application must provide:

    - the name of the routine to intercept (a character string)
    - the address of a user-written pre-processing routine
    - the address of a user-written post-processing routine

Later,  whenever  the  intercepted  routine is called, the following
steps are taken:

    - the user-written pre-processing routine is called,
    - the original intercepted routine is called,
    - the user-written post-processing routine is called.

The  user-written  procedures  have  access to the original argument
list and returned value. The interception can be activated, modified
and  deactivated  at any time. All hooks into the code are performed
"on the fly" in the virtual address space of the process.

Interface definition files are provided for the C and Ada languages.
However, CallMon can be used from any other language.

Note that CallMon is designed for OpenVMS Alpha only. CallMon uses a
lot  of features which are specific to the Alpha architecture and to
the  structure  of OpenVMS on Alpha platforms. There is currently no
version of CallMon for VAX platforms.

This  OpenVMS  Freeware  CD contains the version 1.0 of CallMon. You
will find the following items in the [CALLMON] directory:

    - CALLMON.PS : CallMon documentation in PostScript form
    - CALLMON.OLB : CallMon object library
    - CALLMON.H and CALLMONMSG.H : Interface files for C
    - CALLMON_.ADA and CALLMONMSG_.ADA : Interface files for Ada
    - [.SRC]*.* : CallMon source files (written in C and Macro-64)
    - CALLMON$RESIDENT.COM : Utility procedure (see documentation)

Several  example  programs  written in C and Ada are provided. Their
source  files are located in the subdirectory [.SRC]. The correspon-
ding executable images are provided in the main directory.

CARDREADER011, MISCELLANEOUS, VMS Card Reader and mail back print symbiont

 				 CARDREADER_SMB
 			A VMS CARDREADER/MAILBACK symbiont

Version 1.0 6/2/93

Author:  Robert Eden                robert@cpvax.tu.com
 	 Comanche Peak S.E.S        eden@fallout.lonestar.org 
         Glen Rose Tx, 76043        
         (817) 897-0491

        This program is a VAX/VMS server symbiont to provide a
        queue on the VAX that acts as a cardreader.  A second queue is
        also available to mail output back to the original user.

 	Any file sent to a queue assigned to device CARDIN gets run 
 	through DEC's INPSMB image. Login errors are sent to
 	the CLUSTER operator(s)' console by the symbiont and logged
 	normally by IMPSMB.

 	Any file sent to a queue assigned to device MAILOUT gets sent
 	as a mail message to the username owning the job.  This 
 	is used so the output from the batch job submitted to CARDREADER
 	can be returned as a mail message.

        This symbiont can connect to up to 16 queues, but only 1
        is active at any one time.  (Hey, I'm lazy.) (Why would
 	anyone want more than 1 cardreader and 1 mailback queue
 	anyway).

 	Login failure notification is sent to the CLUSTER operator console(s).

 	To Build:
 		$ FORTRAN 	CARDSMB.FOR
 		$ LINK/NOTRACE  CARDSMB.OBJ
 		$ copy cardsmb.exe sys$system

 		(notrace prevents a lot of errors from JOB CONTROL should
 		 the program terminate abnormally)

 	To setup:
 	 	$ INIT/QUEUE/PROC=CARDSMB/ON=CARDIN  CARDREADER
 	 	$ INIT/QUEUE/PROC=CARDSMB/ON=MAILOUT MAILBACK


 	To Test PRINT the following file to the CARDREADER queue:
 	 	$ JOB username /QUEUE=SYS$BATCH/PRINT=MAILBACK
 	 	$ PASSWORD password
 	 	$
 	 	$ dir
 	 	$
 	 	$ eoj

	The file will be processed by CARDREADER, and be SUBMITed to
	SYS$BATCH.  After it executes, the log file will be mailed
	back to "username".

 	If you end up using this program, please drop a note to me at
        the above addresses so I get a warm fuzzy and can make you aware
	of updates/changes.

CARIBBEAN STUD Poker port under OpenVMS                     December 1997
=======================================

A card game under X11

Installation:
------------

You need to  install ressource file CARIBBEANSTUD.DAT either under SYS$LOGIN
(personal install) or under SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] (system-wide
installation). You can alter some ressources before installation:

   Default bankroll              200
   Table minimum                 10
   Number of Players             1       (1-6)
   Current Jackpot               34000000
   Minimum Jackpot               3000000

VAX & Alpha executables are provided into the kit, as well as object files.

Rebuild:
-------

You need DEC C++ 5.2 or higher to rebuild. Compile with COMPILE_DECCXX.COM
procedure. You link with LINK_AXP.COM or LINK_VAX.COM procedures.

Porting notes:
-------------

DEC C++ 5.2 doesn't use C++ exceptions. It was necessary to modify the source
to run without exceptions. On VAX, a link problem (XmuFillRoundedRectangle
symbol was undefined !!) was resolved by using an alternate XMU library (an old
DECUS X11R4 Xmu library).

Enjoy !!

CBZONE-MPJZ, GAMES, Tank battle under X Window


      Cbzone is a version of Battlezone derived from the Fortran
    sources written by Justin S. Revenaugh.  This version is more
    flexible in that the number of opponents is user selectable.

      Input to the the game is primarily through the mouse, although
    some keyboard commands are accepted.  Mouse left button will
    fire a salvo; mouse right button will switch between low/high
    sensitivity (sensitivity determines how sensitive the joystick is to
    pointer motion).  On a three button mouse, the middle button will
    center the joystick and stop your tank.  This facility can be done
    on a two button mouse by hitting both buttons at the same time.
    Directional control of the tank is by moving the mouse to
    different portions of the screen.  The joystick in the lower right
    hand of the screen will correspond to your tanks current movement
    and rotation.

      Scores are only eligible for the high score list if they
    are played with the default options with the exceptions that
    the delay can be 0-5 and quiet mode can be on.

DISK$FREEWAREV4_1:[CLUSTER]FREEWARE_README.TXT;2
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
CLUSTER_TOOLS, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Unsupported Cluster management tools/hacks
 
BYEBYENODE.MAR
 
  This is a quick hack to force a remote system out of the cluster. It can
  be used when a remote system hangs for example at high IPL (bewteen 3
  and 6), or when the SMIserver does not respond.

  It uses an internal routine in the connection manager. There is one
  problem with this approach, and that is that this routine (CNX$DISC_REMOVE)
  is not available in any symboltable which we can include in the link.
  So what we do is use MATCHC to find the sequence of instructions around
  the place where we expect the code, and issue an error if we can't find it.
  If we got the address, we JSB to it and let that routine do the dirty work.
  The net result will be that the remote node will CLUEXIT.

  This is strictly a HACK, and as such it may fail at any time. Use at
  your own risk. (I included a check to prevent removal of the node from
  which this program runs, although it was fun to get a system in a state
  in which the only clusternode was removed from the cluster and in longbreak,
  without quorum....). It was tested on VMS V5.5 thru T6.2-FT1.
 
COPY_SHADOW_DUMP.MAR
 
  This program is created to retrieve a system dump from a Phase II
  shadowed systemdisk. The problem is that the bugcheck code writes
  to the member we booted from (normally), but as far as shadowing
  is concearned the disks are the same. A merge copy which may start
  after a crash may not be able to correct the blocks of the dumpfile
  on all the disks of the shadowset. Suppose that a dumpfile starts
  at the end of the disk, and ends at the beginning of it. When a
  system crashes we will start writing at the end of the disk, and
  it is very well possible that when we reach the part of the dumpfile
  at the beginning of the disk that that part has already been merged
  by a merge copy. The net result is inconsistent data as far as the
  dumpfile is concearned. This can of course be corrected by dismounting
  members of the shadowset except the master, and remount the members
  after which a full shadowcopy will correct things. This may have a
  rather high impact, which most customers don't want on their live
  systems. Another way to correct things is to trigger a merge copy on
  the fly. That's certainly possible but it involves kernel-mode hacking
  which is always error-prone. What we do here is look for the retrieval
  pointers of the dumpfile (they are already stored in memory by SYSINIT)
  and look which shadowset member is the master. We then copy all blocks
  mapped by the dumpfile from the master member to an output file.

  This version supports both the Alpha- and VAX architectures.
 
FORCE_MERGE.MAR
 
  This program is created as a hack to force a merge copy on a
  Phase II shadowset. It uses a routine inside the SHdriver for the
  dirty work. We call this entrypoint with the correct parameters.
  We also disable writelogging because we want a full merge copy to occur.

1.0	GENERAL INFORMATION
---------------------------


1.1 >>>> WHAT IS OPENCMU				[11-OCT-1994]
------------------------

The OpenCMU software provides a full TCP/IP network transport for VAX systems
running the VMS operating system. This allows a VMS system to participate in
the world wide Internet network and take advantage of the wealth of information
and software available on it.

OpenCMU includes the following components as standard:

   o  TELNET for interactive access to other systems on the internet

   o  TELNET Server for allowing interactive login to the system running
      OpenCMU

   o  FTP for transferring files directly to and from other systems on the
      internet

   o  FTP Server for allowing file transfer to and from the system running
      OpenCMU. An ANONYMOUS login facility is included.

   o  FINGER for identifying users logged on on other systems on the internet

   o  FINGER Server for allowing others to finger users logged in to the system
      running OpenCMU

   o  TALK for interactive converstations with other users on the internet (a
      sort of network PHONE)

   o  TALK Server for allowing other users to talk to anyone logged on to the
      system running OpenCMU.

   o  LPD for processing incoming print file requests and status from clients.

   o  LPRSMB for submitting files to printers attached to other systems on the
      internet.

   o  IPNCP for monitoring and controlling the TCP/IP system

   o  UNIXSHR - A TCP/IP socket library

   o  DECW$TRANSPORT_CMU - shareable DECwindows transport for running X11
      applications over OpenCMU TCP/IP.


Support is provided for:

   o  IP over ethernet

   o  IP Over X.25

   o  IP Over DECnet

   o  IP over Serial lines (SLIP)


At this time, there is no support for:

   o  Compressed SLIP

   o  PPP

   o  Rlogin, Rexec, Rsh


Also Supported:

   o  Electronic mail is supported via the Freeware packages MX and NETLIB (see
      elsewhere in this FAQ for details).

   o  Domain Name Service is supported through the freeware DOMAIN package

1.2 >>>> OBTAINING THE OPENCMU SOFTWARE			[11-OCT-1994]
---------------------------------------

The OpenCMU software is entirely free of charge and may be obtained through
your local DECUS representative. The last relevant symposium tape that contains
the OpenCMU software is the Fall 1992 tape, in directory [VAX92B.CMU] and on
DECUS CDROM #12.

A number of sites on the Internet maintain up to date anonymous FTP directories
containing the OpenCMU software. These can be accessed using the FTP program or
a mail server such as FTPMAIL that can transfer files from an anonymous FTP
account back to the requestor via e-mail.

The following systems maintain up to date OpenCMU kits:

   Master Sites:

	SiteName		Directory	Maintainer
        SACUSR.MP.USBR.GOV	[.CMUIP]]	Henry Miller <HENRYM@SACTO.MP.USBR.GOV>
				[.TEKIP.FTP]
				[.TELNET]

   Mirror Sites:

	SiteName		Directory	Maintainer
	FTP.KCL.AC.UK		[.CMU-TCPIP]	Andy Harper <UDAA055@KCL.AC.UK>

	FTP.CSUS.EDU		pub/cmuip	???

	DMC.COM			[.VMS.CMUIP]	???

	marduk.iib.uam.es	/pub/VMS/cmutek-ip J.R.Valverde <sistema@biomed.iib.uam.es>

The first time you obtain OpenCMU, you will very likely not have an existing
network facility and hence will be unable to obtain the software across the
network. In this case, you should contact your local DECUS representative for a
copy of the software on a suitable media.

Subsequently, you can pick up new versions and patches using the network from
many of the sites listed above. Announcements about these are made to the
OpenCMU mailing list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3 >>>> PREREQUISITES					[11-OCT-1994]
----------------------

Before installing OpenCMU on your system, take note of the following
requirements.

Hardware Requirements:

   A Digital VAX system.
   NOTE: Digital ALPHA systems are NOT currently supported.

   A Network connection.
   OpenCMU supports the following types of network interface:
    * Ethernet
    * Serial line (using SLIP)
    * X.25 Synchronous interface (using IP tunnelling)

   A network link to the outside world.
   The network interface must be connected to a network with at least one other
   network aware system connected to it. Consult your local site management or
   network service providers for details of how to connect to the rest of the
   IP world (the `Internet').

   Each interface to the network MUST be allocated its own unique IP address
   (your service provider will supply this) and a subnet mask.

   Although optional, it is highly likely that access to an IP router and a
   Domain Name Server will be required. Ask your service provider for the IP
   addresses of each of these.


Minimum VMS:

   The latest version of OpenCMU requires VMS 5.2 and upwards.

   There are versions of OpenCMU available that run on earlier versions of VMS.
   Poke around some of the FTP sites listed elsewhere to see what's available
   as some sites do not carry old versions.

1.5 >>>> THE OPENCMU MAILING LIST/NEWSGROUP		[11-OCT-1994]
-------------------------------------------

An electronic mailing list and news group exists for exchanging information
about the OpenCMU software. This is the preferred way to exchange information
about problems, and their solutions, and to announce updates to the software.
By subscribing, you gain access to a wealth of practical information from other
users and the relevant OpenCMU experts.

The address of the electronic mailing list, to which all enquiries or
announcements are directed, is:

2.0	COMMONLY ASKED `SETUP' QUESTIONS
----------------------------------------

2.1 >>>> SETTING UP DEC WINDOWS OVER OPENCMU		[11-OCT-1994]
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: This summary applies to the LATEST version of OpenCMU. There may be minor
differences applying it to earlier versions.

 +===========================================================================+
 | Example of the installation of dec$transport_cmu of OpenCMU V6.6-5A       |
 +===========================================================================+
 
1.  Copy DECW$TRANSPORT_CMU.exe to sys$common:[syslib]decw$transport_cmu.exe
   ( Note:  Although the change of $ to _ is required (see 5.3 upgrade and 
   installation procedures section 10.4, p.10-)7, I didn't do so. But it works)
 
2.  Set protections on the file as -- S:rwed,O:rwed,g:rwed,w:re
 
3.  Add the following record in IP_STARTUP.COM if it is not
    already there:

       $ install create sys$share:decw$transport_cmu.exe /open/share/header/prot
 
4.  Customize decw$private_server_setup.com to have the following line:

       $ decw$server_transports == "DECNET,LOCAL,LAT,CMU"
 
    Eg. Copy decw$private_server_setup.template to *.com in Sys$common:[sysmgr]
        directory and add one record as follows;
 
       $do_default: 
  >>>  $ decw$server_transports == "DECNET,LOCAL,LAT,CMU"
       $ exit  
 
5.  Reboot workstation. If IP is already setup and running, it should be
    sufficient to merely restart DECwindows via the following command:

       $ @sys$manager:decw$startup restart
 
6. Security Entry on VAX/VMS+CMU
 
     If you are using VAX/Station(VMS+CMU) and you want to create a window on 
   the VAX/Station (i.e. you want to use it as a "server"), it is required to 
   customize security by adding as  "authorized user"  the OpenCMU transport for 
   the users and machines desired.
 
   (Select security in the setup menubar of VAX/Station and add following entry
      NODE:      IP-address or domain-name  (Eg. 134.160.1.1)
      USER nam   ? or *                     (Eg. *)
      Transport: CMU                        (Eg. CMU)
 
     If you want use your VAX only as a client or your VAX is not workstation,
   it is not necessary to define the security entry.

6.1  Security entry on UNIX workstation (eg. SUN + X11 Release 4)

     If you want to communicate with a UNIX workstation running X11R4, it is 
    also required to define the security entry of the hostname on the UNIX.
    There are two ways to define the security entry 
      (1) Write hostname in   /etc/X*.hosts  file. (* is display number)
      (2) Define hostname by "xhost" command. (this works only in the local
          terminal. This does not work on the telneted terminal)
    You can get more information by "man X" and "man xhost" command in UNIX.

    X11 Release 4 entire kit and its patch are available for anonymous 
    ftp from expo.lcs.mit.edu in pub/R4 directory 

7.  Then you can create a X-window from UNIX or on UNIX
 
      Eg. 1 (create a X-terminal on VAX/Station from SUN [SUN OS 4.0.3+X11R4] )
 
      (%  xhost  hostname              (authorize hostname, see 6.1))
       %  setenv DISPLAY hostname:0    (define display)
       %  xterm &                      (Create a X-terminal of sun on VAX/VMS)
 
      Eg. 2  (create a DEC-terminal on SUN from VAX/Station)
 
       $ set disp/cre/node="hostname"/tran=CMU
       $ cre/term/det
  
PS: And another one of Bruce's unsolicited tips:
 
   (Following is applied only for X11-server [i.e. VAX/Station] )
    After you bring up the transport with DECWindows, do a
    NETSTAT to see if the transport was initialized to wait for
    incoming connections.  You should see a TCP port at port 6000
    in the LISTEN state.  If not, you've done something wrong.
 
     Example
 
      $ IPNCP
      IPNCP> netstat
       1 TCP connection found
       IDX  Address       Local Host    Port    Foreign Host    Port  State
         2  0004C188         0.0.0.0  23.112         0.0.0.0     0.0  LISTEN
       0 UDP connections found
							<HENRYM@SACUSR.MP.USBR.GOV>
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 >>>> SETTING UP A SLIP CONNECTION			[11-OCT-1994]
-------------------------------------

Ensure that the SLIP Driver (SLDRV.EXE) is in the CMUIP_ROOT:[SYSLIB]
directory.

To create a slip line include the following in your INET$CONFIG:

   Device_Init:SLDRV:dev:NONE:ip-address:ip-mask

Where:
	DEV is the terminal line to use eg. TXA1 ...
	ip-address is the Ip-address of the line.
	ip-mask is the IP-mask of the line.


Here is an example line:

   Device_Init:SLDRV:TXA0:NONE:123.123.123.123:255.255.0.0

        Defines a slip port on TXA0 having an IP address of
        123.123.123.123

Then kill and restart IPACP:

   IPNCP
   IPNCP> netexit
   IPNCP> Startup/ipacp

As far as I know there is no dynamic SLIP available.
However there is a new IPACP/IPNCP in the works that will allow you to
add/enable/disable SLIP lines on the fly.

2.2 >>>> MORE ON SETTING UP SLIP			[11-OCT-1994]
--------------------------------

The information below has been culled mostly from personal experience (i.e.,
it works for me).  All IP addresses have been changed.  The reason for this is
that OpenCMUIP SLIP doesn't require a password -- if you know the IP address of
the SLIP interface, and the phone number to dial, you can get in.  Also, any
explanations given below are not necessarily completely correct; I've tried to
put everything in simple terms that I understand.  Those caveats given, here
goes... 

First, in INET$CONFIG, you need to have *two* separate interfaces: one 
that talks to the SLIP "network", and one that talks to the Ethernet 
"network".  These two interfaces each have their own addresses.  If 
they "overlap" (this will be defined later), the interface to the more 
general network must come *last*.

Example: in my configuration (remember: *all* ip addresses have been 
changed; OpenCMUIP SLIP doesn't bother to ask for a password for 
connection purposes, so anyone who knows the phone number of your 
modem and the IP address of your SLIP interface can connect through 
your system), I have a VAX with an Ethernet interface at IP address 
128.97.101.101.  We use subnetting here at UCLA, and our network mask 
is 255.255.255.0.  This means that my VAX can directly connect to any 
computer whose address is 128.97.101.x, where x is in the range 0-255 
(although I believe the first and last are off limits).  To get to any 
computer with an address not in this range, I need to go through a 
gateway.  In my case, the gateway is at 128.97.101.105.  Note that I 
can directly connect to this computer.  This is, of course, important.  
So, I need a line in INET$CONFIG that says something like

Device_Init:ETHER:ESA0:00-00-00-00-00-00:128.97.101.101:255.255.255.0

and further down, one that reads 

Gateway:GATEWAY.PHYSICS.UCLA.EDU:128.97.101.105:0.0.0.0:0.0.0.0:

Now, I want to start a SLIP interface with a modem attached to the 
device TTA2.  I am assigned the address range 128.97.101.120 through 
128.97.101.127.  This is a total of eight addresses, but again, the 
first and last are not usable for reasons I don't understand (I think 
the operative terms are "network address" for the .0 one and 
"broadcast address" for the .127 one).  At this point, the six 
remaining addresses belong to *me*, and are mine to assign as I wish.  
I choose to assign the first one to the SLIP interface itself:

slip.physics.ucla.edu = 128.97.101.121

I have a computer at home (say it's a PC).  I choose to assign this 
the next address:

mypc.physics.ucla.edu = 128.97.101.122

These names must be established with the network administrator, but I 
am free to dole out the addresses to whomever I choose.

Note that by the rules above, the ethernet connection can speak 
directly to mypc.  This is incorrect, since that must go through the 
SLIP interface.  This is what I have called overlap above.  The range 
of SLIP addresses (.120 - .127) lies within that of Ethernet addresses 
(.0-.255).  We therefore need a way to tell OpenCMUIP to use the SLIP 
interface for the addresses .120-.127, and the Ethernet interface for 
all the others.  We do this simply by placing the SLIP device 
definition first, so that the Device_Init lines now look like:

Device_Init:SLDRV:TTA2:slip.physics.ucla.edu:128.97.101.121:255.255.255.248
Device_Init:ETHER:ESA0:00-00-00-00-00-00:128.97.101.101:255.255.255.0

The only new thing here is the mask on the SLIP interface.  That mask 
has all bits set to 1 except the last three.  This means that there 
are eight addresses (2^3) that the SLIP interface can access, which 
work out to .120-.127.  If OpenCMUIP wants to connect to one of these 
addresses, it does it through the SLIP interface.  If it wants to talk 
to anything else with an address of 128.97.101.x, it does it through 
the Ethernet interface.  Any other address is contacted via the 
gateway (which itself is contacted via the Ethernet interface).

The only other thing to do is to set the IP_Forwarding flag.  This 
allows OpenCMUIP to transmit packets from one interface to the other.  
without this, you couldn't use SLIP to get to the outside world: 

Variable:IP_Forwarding:1
 
That should be it.  Restart OpenCMUIP, and all should be well.  One other 
thing: many SLIP packages on the PC/Mac side expect to give the system 
some kind of password upon connection, and will fail if they don't 
receive a response from the VAX.  This needs to be turned off, since 
the VAX won't do a thing other than just sit there.

2.4 >>>> HOW TO SET UP ANONYMOUS FTP			[11-OCT-1994]
------------------------------------
Note: following information taken from the FTP client release notes, with minor
editing to add additional info.


2.4.1 RPI Modifications

2.4.1.1	V2.7-5, 20-JUN-1989, Madison

> All FTP_ANON logical names should now be placed in the logical name
  table FTP_NAME_TABLE, to get them out of the system name table.  To
  do this, add the following lines to your IP_STARTUP.COM:

  $ CREATE/NAME_TABLE/EXEC/PROT=(S:RWED,O:RWED,G:R,W:R)-
    	/PARENT=LNM$SYSTEM_DIRECTORY FTP_NAME_TABLE
  $ FTPDEF := DEFINE/TABLE=FTP_NAME_TABLE/EXEC/NOLOG

  then use FTPDEF to define the FTP_ANON... logical names, for example:

  $ FTPDEF FTP_ANONYMOUS_DIRS USER$:[ANONYMOUS...]
  $ FTPDEF FTP_ANON_LOAD_THRESHOLD "0.5"
  $ FTPDEF FTP_ANON_PRIME_DAYS "2,3,4"  ! Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

> Added system load checking on anonymous logins if LAV0 device is
  available.  To enable, define the following logical names in FTP_NAME_TABLE:

    FTP_ANON_LOAD_THRESHOLD 	some floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0.
    FTP_ANON_PRIME_DAYS	    	day-numbers -- indicate "prime time" days
    FTP_ANON_PRIMETIME_START	time-of-day -- indicates start of "prime time"
    FTP_ANON_PRIMETIME_END  	time-of-day -- indicates end of "prime time"
    FTP_ANON_TIME_ZONE	    	any character string indicating local time zone

  The only required logical is FTP_ANON_LOAD_THRESHOLD.  If that logical name
  exists and the LAV0 device exists, the load checking code is used.  The
  code does the following:

    If FTP_ANON_PRIME_DAYS is defined, it is translated.  The comma-separated
    list of numbers (where 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc.) is used to identify
    the days in which "prime time" is effective.  If it does not exist,
    "prime time" is assumed to be in effect Monday through Friday.
    Note: Use ONLY numbers 1 through 7, and NO SPACES in the string.  Surround
    the string with quotation marks when defining!

    If FTP_ANON_PRIMETIME_START is defined, it is translated and converted
    into a system date-time value using LIB$CONVERT_DATE_STRING.  If not,
    then 09:00 is used as the start of "prime time".

    If FTP_ANON_PRIMETIME_END is defined, it is translated and converted
    into a system date-time value using LIB$CONVERT_DATE_STRING.  If not,
    then 17:00 is used as the end of "prime time".

    If the current time is between the prime-time start and end times,
    then the current load averages are read from the LAV device.  The
    current load is computed using the following formula:
    	    	    load = M15 * (P15 / 4.0)
    where M15 is the average load over the last 15 minutes, and P15 is
    the average priority over the last 15 minutes.  Thus, the average load
    is normalized against typical interactive priority to guard against
    low-priority batch jobs preventing guest login access.

    If the load is greater than or equal to the LOAD_THRESHOLD value, then
    the guest login is denied with a reason of "system too busy".
    If the threshold is not exceeded, then the guest login is accepted, but
    the user is warned to minimize access during prime time (with the
    start and end times displayed along with the time zone information
    [if FTP_ANON_TIME_ZONE is defined]).

    If the current time does not fall within prime time, no load checking
    is performed.

2.4.1.2   V2.7-4, 09-JUN-1989, Madison

> Added special messages to FTP server during guest (anonymous) login.
  Modified the logging of anonymous sessions slightly.

2.4.1.3   V2.7-2, 03-APR-1989, Madison

> The FTP server presents a somewhat more informative banner on connection--
  includes system name and version of FTP.

> The code that handled directory changes was really ugly, even though
  it had been modified to fix the infinite-loop problem from V2.6.  I
  replaced the code with some which makes use of available VMS system
  services, simply to satisfy my own sense of aesthetics.

> Enhanced the Anonymous FTP support provided by OpenCMU.  The enhancements
  include:

    * ANONYMOUS is never allowed privileges regardless of the contents of
      its UAF record.

    * All ANONYMOUS FTP sessions create logs.  Each session creates a
      file SYS$MANAGER:ANON_FTP_LOG.LOG.  You can put them elsewhere by
      defining ANON_FTP_LOG system-wide to a different location.  The
      password given to ANONYMOUS is logged along with the remote host's
      name and address, as well as RETR, LIST, NLST, CWD, and CDUP commands.
      The log files need not be accessible to the ANONYMOUS userid (and
      probably should not be).

      NOTE: It appears that the anonymous log file is ONLY created in
      SYS$MANAGER if the ANON_FTP_LOG logical name is explicitly defined. By
      default, no log file gets created.  Use:

	$ define/system ANON_FTP_LOG sys$manager:ANON_FTP_LOG.LOG
         
    * You can restrict the directories to which ANONYMOUS has access by
      defining the system-wide logical name FTP_ANONYMOUS_DIRS to
      a search list of device/directory specifications.  Any RETR,
      LIST, or NLST will check against this list before going through normal
      system access checks.  This prevents ANONYMOUS from gaining access
      to people's files via WORLD access.  If you do not define
      FTP_ANONYMOUS_DIRS, the extra access checks do not take place.
      You can use [directory...] notation to allow access to the entire
      subdirectory tree below the specified directory.

The steps needed to set up a controlled Anonymous FTP are:

    1. Create a UAF record for ANONYMOUS.  Set it /NOINTER/NOBATCH/NONETWORK
       to prevent logins or DECnet use.  Set /FLAG=DISMAIL to prevent mail
       from reaching it.  Assign it a UIC that is unique and outside any
       existing group.  Give it a default device and directory.

Example: UAF> ADD ANONYMOUS/PASS=JUNK/NOINTERACTIVE/NOBATCH/NONETWORK-
    	    	/FLAG=DISMAIL/UIC=[666,666]/DEV=USER$DISK/DIR=[PUBLIC]

    2. Put the definition of FTP_ANONYMOUS_DIRS in your system startup
       sequence.  Make sure it is defined before allowing Anonymous access.
       Make sure that the default device/directory in the UAF is accessible
       (not strictly necessary, but easier on the users).

Example: $ DEFINE/SYSTEM FTP_ANONYMOUS_DIRS -
    	    	USER$DISK:[PUBLIC...],-	    ! public files
    	    	USER$DISK:[NEWS...],-	    ! news archives
    	    	USER$DISK:[MAIL]    	    ! mail archives

    3. Create the directories to which ANONYMOUS will have access.  Do not
       permit ANONYMOUS to own any of the files or be in the same group
       as the owner of the files.  Set WORLD:R protection on all files
       and directories to be accessible, or use an ACL to grant access 
       specifically to ANONYMOUS.

  While these modifications were meant to enhance the security of Anonymous FTP,
  neither the author nor his employer (nor anyone else for that matter)
  guarantees that the software is secure.

2.5 >>>> SETTING UP OPENCMU WITH OPENVMS 6.0 AND 6.1	[11-OCT-1994]
----------------------------------------------------

Following the upgrade to OpenVMS 6.0 or 6.1, OpenCMU 6.6-5A can be made to work
by issuing the following sequence of commands:

 $ @sys$update:register_privileged_image register cmuip_root:[sys$ldr]ipdriver.exe
 $ @sys$update:register_privileged_image register cmuip_root:[sysexe]ipacp.exe
 $ @sys$update:register_privileged_image register cmuip_root:[sysexe]lpd.exe

Failure to do this will likely result in error messages similar to:

 "System version level mismatch"

and the network will fail to come up.

3.0 KNOWN PROBLEMS
------------------

3.1 >>>> WHY IS FTP SO SLOW				[11-OCT-1994]
---------------------------

The version of FTP supplied with the master 6.6-5 kit suffers from a number of
bugs. One of these causes excessive error rates and retransmissions resulting
in a low throughput rate.

It is STRONGLY recommended that the 6.6-5A patch kit be applied. This greatly
improves the performance.

See also the freeware MGFTP software (described in more detail in the
`Software' section elsewhere).
							<A.Harper@kcl.ac.uk>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 >>>> WHY DOES FTP CRASH WITH `EXCEEDED QUOTA'	[11-OCT-1994]
-------------------------------------------------

FTP (client or server) can fall over with an `exceeded quota' message if the
SYSGEN parameter `MAXBUF' is not set correctly.  The latest recommendation is
for the minimum value to be 2300. In practice, however, a much larger figure of
8300 is recommended.

Note that transferring files with large records, exceeding MAXBUF, may still
cause problems.
							<A.Harper@kcl.ac.uk>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 >>>> WHY DOESN'T THE NFS SERVER WORK		[11-OCT-1994]
----------------------------------------

The NFS server broke with version 6.6-5 of OpenCMU.  At this time, there is no

3.4 >>>> WHY DOES TELNET SOMETIMES HANG IN `RWAST'	[11-OCT-1994]
--------------------------------------------------

TELNET clients prior to version 5.0 could, under certain conditions, lock up a
process in an RWAST state. All users are strongly recommended to upgrade to
Version 5.0-1 of TELNET in which this problem, and others, are solved.
							<A.Harper@kcl.ac.uk>

3.5 >>>> WHY DOES TELNETTING INTO OPENCMU HANG		[11-OCT-1994]
----------------------------------------------

When telnetting into a OpenCMU host, the system does not prompt for a username
until an extra carriage return appears. There are three known, unrelated,
causes for this problem.

First, a bug in earlier versions of the CMU telnet software is known to cause
unexpected hangs. To fix this, All users should install the latest patches to
OpenCMU (6.6-5A) and the telnet client.

Second, some PC telnet clients are known to contain problems that prevent them
successfully interworking with CMU telnet. PC-NFS telnet versions 4.x and 5.x
suffer from this problem.  To fix, avoid these clients - there are plenty of
reasonable alternative telnet clients around.

Finally, it may be the case that some PC telnet's do not correctly negotiate
the telnet options when the call is connected. One or other end can wait
indefinitely for the opposite end to continue. At this time, no clear solution
is known but the problem can sometimes be alleviated by adding the following to
the CMU INET$CONFIG file:

      Variable:TELNET_NEG_TIMEOUT:0

This causes telnet not to wait for negotiations to timeout, and can speed up
those logins which appear to hang for a long time.

3.6 >>>> NAMRES GIVES DOMAIN REFERRAL EXCEEDED MESSAGES	[11-OCT-1994]
-------------------------------------------------------

The name resolver can produce the message `Maximum domain referral limit
exceeded' and fail to resolve a name into its address. This is often indicative
of incorrect configuration of the name resolver.  Ensure that the following
lines are included in the NAMRES$CONFIG file:

   Variable:TIMEOUT:5
   Variable:REFMAX:10
   Variable:RECURSE:1

You might want to also add:

   Variable:NS_RETRANS:2


(NOTE: in table 3-8 of the last official manual, the last variable, labelled
TIMEOUT, should be labelled RECURSE. TIMEOUT is given correctly as the second
entry in the table).

Restart the name resolver if necessary:

   $ IPNCP
   IPNCP> NAMRES EXIT
   ....
   IPNCP> STARTUP /NAMRES

3.7 >>>> IPACP ISSUES STATUS CODES TO OPCOM		[11-OCT-1994]
-------------------------------------------

When the IPACP process (which coordinates the IP traffic) has problems, it can
issue system status codes to OPCOM. Here is a typical sequence:

   %%%%%%%%%%%  OPCOM  16-AUG-1993 10:49:23.75  %%%%%%%%%%%
   Message from user SYSTEM on XYZZY
   IPACP: XE status error.  Status = 00000A00

   %%%%%%%%%%%  OPCOM  16-AUG-1993 10:49:23.83  %%%%%%%%%%%
   Message from user SYSTEM on XYZZY
   IPACP: XE retried 5 times.

   %%%%%%%%%%%  OPCOM  16-AUG-1993 10:49:23.89  %%%%%%%%%%%
   Message from user SYSTEM on XYZZY
   IPACP: XE $QIO read error (dev_inact), RC=000020D4


To determine the exact problem, it is first necessary to translate the status
codes (00000A00  and  000020D4) into the more usual text form. The DCL lexical
function F$MESSAGE will translate them for you.  Here is a little command file
to make it easier:


   $! SHOWMSG.COM
   $! Usage: @SHOWMSG 20D4
   $	WRITE SYS$OUTPUT F$MESSAGE(%X'P1')


Typically, the messages are indicative of a problem with the ethernet itself or
with the ethernet controller; the status messages may help to determine the
root cause.

The message texts from OpenCMU are not part of the standard system message
files. For a translation of the error code into the text to be possible, the
user must have issued a SET MESSAGE command on the file  NETERROR.EXE.  The
installation of OpenCMU should have placed this in the SYS$MESSAGE directory.

If not, locate the file called NETERROR.OBJ in the CMUIP_ROOT:[*...] tree and
relink it to form the NETERROR.EXE, using this command:

   $ LINK/SHARE=SYS$COMMON:[SYSMSG]NETERROR NETERROR.OBJ


Following this, the message texts can be made available to F$MESSAGE using:

   $ SET MESSAGE SYS$MESSAGE:NETERROR

[Note: if, for any reason, NETERROR.OBJ does not exist in the directory tree, 
it can be found in the second saveset of the OpenCMU kit - CMUIP066.B]

3.8 >>>> IPACP CRASH DUE TO QUOTA EXCEEDED		[11-OCT-1994]
------------------------------------------

For systems with a high IP load, IPACP may occasionally crash with a quota
exceeded. This does not refer to disk quota, but to one of the process quota
limits. Usually, the quota in question is BYTLM.

To increase the BYTLM for the IPACP, modify the IP_STARTUP.COM procedure and
change the value of the /BUFFER_LIMIT qualifier on the RUN command that starts
the IPACP process. Then shut down and restart IPACP.

At the current time, there appears to be a memory leak in IPACP which has the
effect of gradually reducing the available BYTLM over time. When this gets
close to zero, IPACP will hang (as it retries) and then crash soon afterwards.
It is therefore desirable to give IPACP more BYTLM than the typical load might
suggest. If this sort of crash is experienced, increase the BYTLM by 50% and
restart it.

3.9 >>>> FTP OF BACKUP SAVESETS GIVES CRC ERRORS	[11-OCT-1994]
------------------------------------------------

One major use of FTP is in transferring BACKUP savesets to/from other systems.
Often this leads to the recipient having difficulties unpacking that saveset;
in particular, using BACKUP to list or unpack it results in a stream of
messages similar to `CRC error' to the user's terminal and to OPCOM. This
article summarizes why the error occurs and how to correct it.

When BACKUP creates a saveset, it writes the file with a fixed length record
format - the length being that specified with BACKUP's /BLOCK qualifier. For
example:

    BACKUP/BLOCK=8192 * s.bck/save
         Creates a file with fixed length records of 8192.

When FTP is used, in binary mode, the data is sent correctly but the record
structure changes; typically, it is created with 512 byte records. Thus, when
BACKUP is used to list or unpack the file contents, it finds that the record
length of the file does not match the size used originally (this value is
stored in the BACKUP saveset header as well as in the file header).

If both ends of the FTP session support the special STRUC VMS mode of transfer,
then it should be used and the file will transfer correctly. If this structure
is not supported, the record structure becomes corrupted and must be manually
`fixed up' before BACKUP can be used.

There are three ways in which this can be done.

 1.	Use the VMS CONVERT utility to alter the record structure:

	   $ CONVERT/FDL=SYS$INPUT  file.bck  file.bck
	   RECORD
	     FORMAT FIXED
             SIZE nnnn
	   ^Z

	Where 'nnn' is the record size used on the original BACKUP command.

	NOTE: a new copy of the file is made.


 2.	Use the public domain utility called FILE (courtesy of Joe Meadows):

	   $ FILE/RECORD_SIZE=nnn file.bck

	Where 'nnn' is the record size used on the original BACKUP command.

	NOTE: this utility does NOT make a copy of the file; instead it patches
	the file header directly. It is wise to make a backup copy before using
	this technique!!!



3.	Use the public domain utility called FIX_SAVESET (author unknown):

	   $ FIX_SAVESET file.bck

	This utility scans the file, on the assumption that it is a backup
	saveset; picks out the original record length from the backup saveset
	header stored in the file; and finally, patches the file header record
	size back to this length. A new copy of the file is not made.


Both the FILE and FIX_SAVESET utilities are available from a number of public
archives using anonymous FTP. Here are some possibilities:

Finally, to summarize the correct method of transferring a BACKUP saveset using
FTP:

  1.	If both ends support STRUC VMS, then

	a.	ftp> SET STRUC VMS
	b.	ftp> GET file

	File will be stored locally with the correct attributes.

  2.	If STRUC VMS is not supported by one or both ends, then

	a.	ftp> BINARY

	Once file arrives on the VMS system:

4.0 >>>> PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE THAT SUPPORTS OPENCMU
-----------------------------------------------------

In this section is described a number of network applications which are known
to work with the OpenCMU transport.

Volunteers are always required to port other network applications to the latest
OpenCMU release. If you port anything, please notify the FAQ maintainer and the
OpenCMU mailing list. Also, please try to persuade the original author of any
ported application to include your OpenCMU changes in the official release.
This will greatly reduce the amount of work needed to track the latest releases
of software.



4.1 >>>> TCP/IP TRANSPORT INTERFACE LIBRARIES		[10-OCT-1994]
---------------------------------------------

There are a number of different TCP/IP transports available for OpenVMS. These
include:

   UCX			Digital's own TCP/IP
   OpenCMU		The Carnegie-Mellon University implementation
   Multinet		TGV Inc.
   Pathway Access	The Wollongong group
   TCPware		Process Software

For historical reasons, each package has a slightly different application level
interface, which makes writing portable TCP/IP applications harder than it
should be. The software in this section provide interfaces to one or more of
the available transports, providing a consistent interface for applications
irrespective of which TCP transport is in use. All adopt the widely recognized
`socket' interface used by BSD unix and others but in some cases the syntax
used is different. Using an interface with the same syntax as BSD sockets
should make it much easier to port programs between VMS and unix systems, and
any other systems that come along.

Some of the applications described in this section require a specific socket
library interface, so it may be necessary to install two or more of them on a
given system to get all the applications to run.

In terms of portability, the best socket libraries are `SOCKIT' and the
`SOCKETSHR/NETLIB' combination, as these interface to two or more of the
commonly available transports.

4.1.1 >>>> NETLIB					[10-OCT-1994]
-----------------

Summary:
	A vendor independent TCP/IP programming interface.

Description:
	NETLIB solves the problem by providing a vendor-independent programming
	interface that sits between the application and the particular version
	of TCP/IP installed on the system. Thus, applications can be written in
	terms of NETLIB routines and will run over any transport supported by
	NETLIB.

Transports Supported:
	NETLIB supports OpenCMU; also, Multinet, TCPware, UCX and TWG's Win/TCP
	and Pathway Access. Anyone writing network applications should be
	strongly encouraged to use the NETLIB interface. 

Interface Type:
	Similar to BSD sockets in concept but not in syntax. See SOCKETSHR
	package.

4.3 >>>> NEWS APPLICATIONS				[10-OCT-1994]
--------------------------

Usenet news is a world wide distributed news system. Messages generated on one
system are passed around the world rapidly, to all other systems. To simplify
the management of news, messages are divided into `newsgroups', each newsgroup
concentrating on one general topic. Using an appropriate newsreader, a user can
`subscribe' to a particular set of newsgroups and read all the related messages
in a manner similar to mail. There are some 3000+ different user groups
currently.

There are a number of parts to the news system. Firstly, software is required
to gather batches of news from an upstream `feed' site and insert it into a
local news database; Second, software is required to allow users to read the
news database, possibly modifying it by sending new messages.

The news database can be on the same system as the user, or the news database
can be on a remote system, accessible through a client-server mechanism. The
user's news reader program becomes a client, using the network to access a news
server.

4.4. >>>> WORLD WIDE WEB APPLICATIONS			[10-OCT-1994]
-------------------------------------

The world wide web is a distributed hypertext system that literally encompasses
the world. A document can be loaded from a remote server which contains
hypertext links to other documents anywhere in the world. Documents can be
text, graphics, sound, binary etc.

World Wide Web servers accept requests from clients to download documents, and
world wide web clients accept those documents and format them for the user's
display. A single display can be composed of a mix of text and graphics etc.

World Wide Web uses the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to specify document
format and remote links.

World Wide Web links specify the location of the document (site, directory and
filename) as well as the protocol used to access them (ftp, wais, gopher, html
etc.). So world wide web combines the functionality of a number of client
types.

4.4.3 >>> HTTP_SERVER					[10-OCT-1994]

Summary:
	A World Wide Web server conforming to the standard HTTP (HyperText
	Transfer Protocol) mechanism.

Description:
	HTTP_SERVER provides a VMS system with the ability to act as a World
	Wide Web server using the HTTP protocol. It will accept requests from
	HTTP clients (such as MOSAIC - see elsewhere in this document) and
	return the necessary information. A full description of the World Wide
	Web system is outside the scope of this summary but it is, in essence,
	a distributed hypertext system capable of mixing text, images,
	graphics, animation and sound into a single on-screen display, with
	each element being on different systems anywhere in the world. The HTML
	language is used to specify the links.

Pre-Requisites:
	None; the server contains all the necessary interfaces to work with
	OpenCMU, as well as with UCX and Multinet.

Author:
	Thanks go to David Jones for writing and maintaining this software.

4.5 >>> FILE TRANSFER APPLICATIONS			[10-OCT-1994]

File transfer is another major application run over the network. It allows
files to be transferred between two different systems using a simple set of
commands. It is most often used for retrieving files from one of the many
public domain archive sites around the world.

OpenCMU comes prepackaged with an FTP client and server but it is worth
considering the alternatives listed here.
							<A.Harper@kcl.ac.uk>


4.5.1 >>>> MADGOAT FTP					[10-OCT-1994]
----------------------

Summary:
	An alternative FTP client and server.

Description:
	The File Transfer program (or FTP) is an important part of the TCP/IP
	applications set. It allows files to be moved between two systems. 
	MGFTP is a file transfer program which can be used over any of the
	available TCP/IP transports, including OpenCMU.

	This client is more functional than the one provided with OpenCMU and is
	recommended. Useful enhancements include:
	  * Logging of server transactions to a file in each user's home
	    directory
	  * User control over how the server is used on an account
	  * Anonymous FTP has per-directory messages
	  * FTP client has automatic anonymous login
	  * FTP client can have aliases defined to connect/fetch from specific
	    systems/files

Pre-Requisites:
	The NETLIB interface is required.

Author:
	MGFTP is based on the OpenCMU FTP client and server, written by many
	people.

	Thanks go to Matt Madison and Hunter Goatley, of MadGoat software, and
	to Darrell Burkhead, for writing and maintaining MGFTP and making it
	available as freeware.

4.5.2 >>>> C-KERMIT					[10-OCT-1994]
-------------------

Summary:
	File transfer over the current terminal connection to a host.

Description:
	The KERMIT program is a widely used way of tranferring files over
	serial lines between systems. The user's terminal temporarily becomes a
	client and the user's host session temporarily becomes a server. The
	KERMIT protocol allows switching between terminal mode and file
	transfer mode, as well as sending or requesting files to be transferred.
	In the past, kermit has been able to set up terminal sessions, and run
	the file transfers, only over serial line connections. More recent
	versions have allowed the terminal connections, and hence the file
	transfers, to take place over telnet links by having direct TCP/IP
	support built in.


	The latest version of C-kermit supports direct TCP/IP connections and
	will work over the OpenCMU package.

Pre-Requisites:
	The OpenCMU version requires a socket library specific to the transport
	on which it runs. For OpenCMU, the required socket library is LIBCMU.

	Columbia University and many contributors around the world.

4.5.2 >>>> FSP						[27-OCT-1994]
--------------

Summary:
	File transfer over a lightweight UDP based protocol.


Description:
	FSP is a simple file transfer protocol based around UDP rather than
	TCP protocols.  It is designed to impose minimal load on the server
	and does not require the user to log in or identify themselves.
	Essentially, the client throws UDP packets at a server asking for
	a portion of a file or info about a file, and keeps throwing the same
	request at it until the server responds. Thus an FSP transfer is, in
	principle, resilient to server failure as it will retry until the
	server comes back on-line. It is said that FSP is what anonymous FTP
	should have been.

	This package is a port of the unix FSP client and server to VMS, and
	directly supports UCX, Multinet and CMU. It also supports the vendor
	independent SOCKETSHR library.


Pre-Requisities:
	Either:
	    LIBCMU	For direct CMU support

	Or:
	    SOCKETSHR	For vendor independent TCP/IP support (recommended)
	    NETLIB	(required by SOCKETSHR)

4.6 >>>> NETWORK ARCHIVE SEARCH APPLICATIONS		[10-OCT-1994]
--------------------------------------------

There are many many sites around the world that allow public access to parts of
the file system that contain freely available software. With so many sites and
so many packages available, it can often be difficult to locate the appropriate
site that holds the required software.

ARCHIE was designed to ease this problem. A large number of sites are
responsible for indexing all the other sites in the world and keeping track of
what each contains. The ARCHIE mechanism allows a user to supply a keyword to
the nearest archie host and have it return a list of software locations that
contain the keyword somewhere in the directory/filename path. This usually
results in a large list of potential places to search, which can then be
interrogated using an FTP utility.
							<A.Harper@kcl.ac.uk>


4.6.1 >>>> ARCHIE					[10-AUG-1994]
-----------------

Summary:
	A client used to interrogate the world-wide archive software database.

Description:
	ARCHIE is a client for interrogating ARCHIE servers. Such servers
	maintain up to date information about what software is available on
	various FTP archives around the world and permit the client to ask
	where a particular item can be found. Given a keyword, ARCHIE will try
	to find all archives that contain files with the keyword as part of the
	name. Once located, FTP can be used to retrieve the item from the
	nearest archive.

	ARCHIE is configurable to use any one of a number of nearby archie
	servers with one selected at compile time as the default.

Pre-Requisites:
	For OpenCMU usage, a socket library interface is required. There are
	two parallel versions or archie. One runs over the LIBCMU package, and
	the other runs over the SOCKETSHR package. Check the readme files with
	the software to see which is applicable.

	Unknown. Many contributors.

4.7 >>>> GOPHER APPLICATIONS				[10-OCT-1994]
----------------------------

GOPHER is a protocol for requesting information from a remote system. GOPHER
servers run on these systems to handle the incoming requests and GOPHER clients
are necessary to interact with a user and generate the requests. Information is
presented to the user in a menu format and allows information of many different
types to be downloaded, viewed and/or saved.  One GOPHER server can send back a
pointer to a file of information that exists on a completely different system.
This provides a generalised world wide browsing system

NOTE: To a large extent, the functionality of GOPHER has been superceded by the
World Wide Web but there are still a large number of gopher servers around.
							<A.Harper@kcl.ac.uk>


4.7.1 >>>> GOPHER					[10-OCT-1994]
-----------------

Summary:
	A gopher client and server for VMS

Description:
	The gopher client allows a user to request documents from any gopher
	server in the world. The gopher server allows a site to serve documents
	to the rest of the world.

Pre-Requisites:
	The gopher client requires NETLIB, and will run over any of the
	supported TCP/IP transports. The gopher server specifically requires
	either UCX or MULTINET. There is no version for OpenCMU.

4.8 >>>> FINGER APPLICATIONS				[10-OCT-1994]
----------------------------

The FINGER protocol allows a client to `finger' another user on another system
to find out basic information. For instance, fingering a system will give
details of who is currently logged on. Fingering an individual username will
give selected personal details (real name, location and any immediate plans).

Note - some sites consider finger to be a security risk and do not run either
the server or the clients. Thus it may not be possible to `finbger' some
systems.

CMP-Disk, Storage_Management, Realtime Compressing virtual disk

Need to store a lot of archival information online and lack the space?
This utility can save factors of 3:1 in storage space for any VMS
file structure.

This area contains a compressing VMS disk for Vax or Alpha
(cmphighc.zip), Alpha versions of disk drivers for remote virtual
disk over DECnet and host processes, and for files stored on
somewhat encrypted files on local disks. The remote disk can be used
for remote backup or access and will attempt to recover if the net
link fails. 

Also present are some other odds and ends, and the SPD for a
user undelete (reliable, this one) and enhanced VMS security module
called SAFETY from the author.

You are requested to read this also.

The compressing disk works by taking a compressed image of an entire
disk in a utility. The virtual disk driver (called dtdriver) and
server program communicate to present the compressed image to the
system as a readonly disk whose storage occupies normally 1/2 or
less of the blocks the original disk does. For databases, the savings
can be even more impressive. The containers can be accessed across
DECnet from many sites at once if desired.

Either of two algorithms may be used...a blindingly fast one, for
slow VAXen normally, or the zlib (zip) one which compresses better
but is slower. Build it for the one you want.

COMPRESS_VMS, UTILITIES, A better VMS compress/uncompress tool


The following text comes directly from the distribution.


VMS COMPRESS

This is the UNIX compress/uncompress program, ported to VMS 5.2 by Doug Tody
of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories.

To build and use VMS compress:

    o	Type @make in the source directory to build the executable,
	compress.exe.

    o	Define the following symbols, replacing the sample executable
	pathname shown by the actual pathname on your system.

	compress	:== "$disk:[dir]compress.exe compress"
	uncompress	:== "$disk:[dir]compress.exe uncompress"

	Note that the compress.exe executable contains both the compress
	and uncompress programs.

Usage:

	compress foo.h		# compress file "foo.h"

	uncompress foo.h	# uncompress file "foo.h_z"
or
	uncompress foo.h_z

Since VMS does not like multiple "." fields in filenames and VMS filenames
are case insensitive, the usual UNIX compress convention of adding a ".Z"
suffix to the compressed file does not work, and a "_z" suffix is used
instead.

Since the compress program is C code and uses the VAX C stdio library to
open the output file, all files created by the program are of type Stream_LF.
This is fine for text files, but will probably be wrong when compressing
and later uncompressing a binary file.  As a workaround to avoid this
problem, the "-c" switch has been modified in the VMS version to allow
concatenation to an existing disk file (rather than writing to the standard
output as in the UNIX version).

For example,

	uncompress -c outfile file_z

will uncompress file "file_z", writing the uncompressed output to the
existing file "outfile".   This should be a zero length file of the
desired VMS/RMS file type.  For example, to uncompress to a 512 byte fixed
format file (the usual binary file), you could create the zero length
file as follows:

	$ create/fdl = sys$input outfile
	record
		carriage_control none
		size 512
		format fixed
	<ctrl/z>
	$

and then uncompress to the file as in the example above.
	

Caveats:
	A Stream_LF file is created in a normal uncompress operation.
	Ideally the program should preserve the file type in a compress-
	uncompress sequence of operations.

	The file modes and times are not preserved as they are in the UNIX
	version.  This feature could be added but I didn't need this feature
	so didn't bother.




Old README from UNIX version.
-------------------
Compress version 4.0 improvements:
	o compress() speedup (10-50%) by changing division hash to xor
	o decompress() speedup (5-10%)
	o Memory requirements reduced (3-30%)
	o Stack requirements reduced to less than 4kb
	o Removed 'Big+Fast' compress code (FBITS) because of compress speedup

		btoa - convert binary to ascii for mailing
		atob - convert ascii to binary with checksum
		tarmail - tar, compress, btoa, and mail files
		untarmail - restore "tarmail" files

		WARNING: These last few programs are not compatible 
		with the original ones from the net.  The encoding
		has changed.  See btoa.c for more info.

The "usermem" script attempts to determine the maximum process size.  Some
editing of the script may be necessary (see the comments).  If you can't get
it to work at all, just create file "USERMEM" containing the maximum process
size in decimal.

The following preprocessor symbols control the compilation of "compress.c":

	o USERMEM		Maximum process memory on the system
	o SACREDMEM		Amount to reserve for other proceses
	o SIGNED_COMPARE_SLOW	Unsigned compare instructions are faster
	o NO_UCHAR		Don't use "unsigned char" types
	o BITS			Overrules default set by USERMEM-SACREDMEM
	o vax			Generate inline assembler
	o interdata		Defines SIGNED_COMPARE_SLOW
	o M_XENIX		Makes arrays < 65536 bytes each
	o pdp11			BITS=12, NO_UCHAR
	o z8000			BITS=12
	o pcxt			BITS=12
	o BSD4_2		Allow long filenames ( > 14 characters) &
				Call setlinebuf(stderr)

The difference "usermem-sacredmem" determines the maximum BITS that can be
specified with the "-b" flag.

memory: at least		BITS
------  -- -----                ----
     433,484			 16
     229,600			 15
     127,536			 14
      73,464			 13
           0			 12

The default is BITS=16.

The maximum bits can be overrulled by specifying "-DBITS=bits" at
compilation time.

WARNING: files compressed on a large machine with more bits than allowed by 
a version of compress on a smaller machine cannot be decompressed!  Use the
"-b12" flag to generate a file on a large machine that can be uncompressed 
on a 16-bit machine.

The output of compress 4.0 is fully compatible with that of compress 3.0.
In other words, the output of compress 4.0 may be fed into uncompress 3.0 or
the output of compress 3.0 may be fed into uncompress 4.0.

The output of compress 4.0 not compatable with that of
compress 2.0.  However, compress 4.0 still accepts the output of
compress 2.0.  To generate output that is compatable with compress
2.0, use the undocumented "-C" flag.

Check the Makefile, then "make".

README3.0 from UNIX version
----------------------------
Enclosed is compress version 3.0 with the following changes:

1.	"Block" compression is performed.  After the BITS run out, the
	compression ratio is checked every so often.  If it is decreasing,
	the table is cleared and a new set of substrings are generated.

	This makes the output of compress 3.0 not compatable with that of
	compress 2.0.  However, compress 3.0 still accepts the output of
	compress 2.0.  To generate output that is compatable with compress
	2.0, use the undocumented "-C" flag.

2.	A quiet "-q" flag has been added for use by the news system.

3.	The character chaining has been deleted and the program now uses
	hashing.  This improves the speed of the program, especially
	during decompression.  Other speed improvements have been made,
	such as using putc() instead of fwrite().

4.	A large table is used on large machines when a relatively small
	number of bits is specified.  This saves much time when compressing
	for a 16-bit machine on a 32-bit virtual machine.  Note that the
	speed improvement only occurs when the input file is > 30000
	characters, and the -b BITS is less than or equal to the cutoff
	described below.

Most of these changes were made by James A. Woods (ames!jaw).  Thank you
James!

Version 3.0 has been beta tested on many machines.

To compile compress:

	cc -O -DUSERMEM=usermem -o compress compress.c

Where "usermem" is the amount of physical user memory available (in bytes).  
If any physical memory is to be reserved for other processes, put in 
"-DSACREDMEM sacredmem", where "sacredmem" is the amount to be reserved.

The difference "usermem-sacredmem" determines the maximum BITS that can be
specified, and the cutoff bits where the large+fast table is used.

memory: at least		BITS		cutoff
------  -- -----                ----            ------
   4,718,592 			 16		  13
   2,621,440 			 16		  12
   1,572,864			 16		  11
   1,048,576			 16		  10
     631,808			 16               --
     329,728			 15               --
     178,176			 14		  --
      99,328			 13		  --
           0			 12		  --

The default memory size is 750,000 which gives a maximum BITS=16 and no
large+fast table.

The maximum bits can be overrulled by specifying "-DBITS=bits" at
compilation time.

If your machine doesn't support unsigned characters, define "NO_UCHAR" 
when compiling.

If your machine has "int" as 16-bits, define "SHORT_INT" when compiling.

After compilation, move "compress" to a standard executable location, such 
as /usr/local.  Then:
	cd /usr/local
	ln compress uncompress
	ln compress zcat

On machines that have a fixed stack size (such as Perkin-Elmer), set the
stack to at least 12kb.  ("setstack compress 12" on Perkin-Elmer).

Next, install the manual (compress.l).
	cp compress.l /usr/man/manl
	cd /usr/man/manl
	ln compress.l uncompress.l
	ln compress.l zcat.l

		- or -

	cp compress.l /usr/man/man1/compress.1
	cd /usr/man/man1
	ln compress.1 uncompress.1
	ln compress.1 zcat.1

The zmore shell script and manual page are for use on systems that have a
"more(1)" program.  Install the shell script and the manual page in a "bin"
and "man" directory, respectively.  If your system doesn't have the
"more(1)" program, just skip "zmore".

Here is the README file from the previous version of compress (2.0):

>Enclosed is compress.c version 2.0 with the following bugs fixed:
>
>1.	The packed files produced by compress are different on different

>		various machines.  This has been fixed.
>
>		This version is NOT compatible with the original vax posting

CVS, Software, VMS version of Concurrent Versioning System (build ctl tool)

You heard that right, folks.  We are porting CVS *to* VMS (not often
one hears that, about *any* program).

CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  It handles multiple
developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control
various operations, and can work over a wide area network.  The
following tasks are not included; they can be done in conjunction with
CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and software other
than CVS: bug-tracking, build management (that is, make and make-like
tools), and automated testing.

Download CVS 1.8.85 (including binaries for AXP/VMS) from
    ftp://ftp.cyclic.com/pub/cvs/cvs-1.8.85

The next release of CVS, CVS 1.9, is likely to be very similar to
1.8.85 (particularly with respect to the VMS-specific parts), although
of course if anyone finds any serious bugs we'd love to know about
them and fix them before the release.  Please send any correspondence
to bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu (I'll try to monitor this newsgroup, but
in general I only read it occasionally).

Here are some excerpts from the README.VMS file, which should clarify
the state of the VMS port:

                             CVS port to VMS

DISCLAIMER: This port must be considered experimental.  Although
previous versions have been in use at one large site since about
October, 1995, and the port is believed to be quite usable, various
VMS-specific quirks are known and the port cannot be considered as
mature as the ports to, say, Windows NT or unix.  As always, future
progress of this port will depend on volunteer and customer interest.

This port is of the CVS client only.  Or in other words, the port
implements the full set of CVS commands, but cannot access
repositories located on the local machine.  The repository must live
on another machine (a Unix box) which runs a complete port of CVS.

Most (all?) work to date has been done on OpenVMS/AXP 6.2.  Other VMS
variants might work too.

. . .

Please send bug reports to bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu.

. . .

Wildcard expansion is not yet implemented (i.e. CVS COMMIT *.c won't
work.)  I have found GPL'd routine which does shell globbing, but I
have not tried to put it in yet.

Log messages must be entered on the command line using -m.  I wanted to start
up TPU for editing log messages, but apparently SYS$SYSTEM:TPU.EXE requires
some command table parsing through DCL, and cannot be directly invoked using C
within CVS.  [I did get LSEDIT to launch, but it wasn't interested in argv at
all.]

You can use -e or define the logical EDITOR to cause CVS to try other editors
if you want to test what's available on your system.  I haven't tested this,
but if you install vi or emacs, chances are it will probably work.  Just make
sure the .EXE files are in a directory listed in VAXC$PATH.

CVTLIS V3.2, UTILITIES, Convert .LIS files back to source files

                                 CVTLIS V3.2
                   Copyright © 1994,1998, Hunter Goatley.
                            All rights reserved.

CVTLIS converts .LIS files from the VMS Source Listings on CD back to the
appropriate source files.  The following file types are recognized:

	Language	Type		Output file type
	---------	----		----------------
	MACRO-32	(VAX)		.MAR
	AMACRO-32	(Alpha)		.MAR
	BLISS-32	(VAX)		.B32
	BLISS-32E	(Alpha)		.B32E
	BLISS-64	(Alpha)		.B64
	MACRO-64	(Alpha)		.M64
	VAX C		(VAX)		.C
	DEC C		(VAX/Alpha)	.C
	SDL		(VAX/Alpha)	.SDL
	CDU		(VAX/Alpha)	.CLD
	MESSAGE		(VAX/Alpha)	.MSG
	VAX PL/I	(VAX)		.PLI
	DEC PL/I	(Alpha)		.PLI
	VAX Pascal	(VAX)		.PAS
	DEC Pascal	(VAX/Alpha)	.PAS

CVTLIS is written in BLISS and will compile and run on both OpenVMS VAX
and OpenVMS Alpha.

CVTLIS is highly dependent on the .LIS format produced for the source
listings CDs.  Fortunately, most of the VMS programmers follow rigorous
source code formats, so this program will successfully convert most
listing files.

To build an executable, either execute @LINK.COM or go to the [.SOURCE]
subdirectory and rebuild it using MMK.

To use CVTLIS, define a foreign symbol to run the program and supply a
.LIS file name on the command line:

	$ cvtlis :== $dev:[dir]cvtlis.exe
	$ cvtlis [v61.dcl]recallsub.lis

DCC, LANGUAGES, Disciplined ANSI C Language Checker

This product checks that a C source file complies with the precepts of
Disciplined C, a set of rules aiming at elevating ANSI C to the rank of
high level language (as opposed to portable assembly language), and making
as much semantics as possible flow from the design to the source code. This
is achieved mainly via quasi-compulsory types/constants naming and 'const'
qualifier use.

The product also detects most of the pitfalls of the C language, helps the
programmer organize his program modules and write them so that they are well
encapsulated and more portable, and finally gives some much-needed compile-time
checking tools.

dcc is quite fast (from 5 to 10 times faster than a compiler), and is itself
written in Disciplined C.

Its updates are available via anonymous ftp at 'ftp.supelec.fr', subdirectory
'pub/lang/dcc'. Have a try at it !

Included with DCLCOMPLETE is a companion program called PIPE that is
needed to handle Piped and multiple commands.  To use DCLCOMPLETE
and PIPE do the following:

        $MACRO DCLCOMPLETE              !You might want to use /LIS 
        $MACRO PIPE                     !on these also

        $LINK PIPE                      !You might also want /MAP
        $PIPE :== $yourdisk:[pipedirectory]PIPE.EXE

        $                               !you have CMKRNL privs
           when used in conjunction with DCLcomplete.  E.G. the string
                "<PF1 string> \?" 
           will be echoed
                "<PF1 string> \<PF1 string> ?" 
           ^R should restore the screen correctly.
        2. When using the PIPE program to pipe output to another program,
           if one of the subprocess terminates incorrectly the program
           will wait indefinitely for the final subprocess to terminate.
           You will need to ^Y and cleanup "stray" subprocesses.

Note 4:
        DCLCOMPLETE requires CMKRNL privilege inorder to work.
        Although the authors have made good faith attempts to see
        if there are any problems with the program CMKRNL programs
        are inherently dangerous.  Furthermore the tests have been
        carried out in limited environments.  In otherwords, the
        programs here seem to work for us and we don't know of any
        problems (other than those stated) but if it doesn't work
        for you...you're on your own.  Proceed with caution.

The following information is extracted from DCL_CHECK's help file.
There is much more information in the help file.
The HELP utility can access the DCL_CHECK help file using the command

    $ HELP /LIBRARY=<device>:[<directory>]DCL_CHECK

or through DCL_CHECK with this command

    $ @<device>:[<directory>]dcl_check help

DCL_CHECK

        The DCL_CHECK procedure detects a variety of DCL coding errors and
        displays  diagnostic  messages  that  allow  you  to  correct  the
        problems. See "Diagnostics" for a list of the types of errors that
        DCL_CHECK can detect. See "Problems" for information on the limits
        of DCL_CHECK.

        When  you  execute  DCL_CHECK  with  "HELP" as the first parameter,
        DCL_CHECK invokes the DCL Help utility.  If you provide additional
        parameters, they are passed to the Help utility.

        To exit the Help utility, press Return one or more times until the
        prompt "enter name of file:"  is displayed.

INSTALLATION

        To install DCL_DIET you must put the files

            DCL_DIET.COM and
            DCL_DIET.HLB

        into the same directory.  You then execute DCL_DIET as an indirect
        command procedure.  See "Format" for additional information.
                                         
Topic? Format

FORMAT

        DCL_CHECK  is  a  DCL  command  procedure.   It is executed by the
        following DCL command:

            $ @[<disk>:][<directory>]DCL_CHECK.COM [<input> [<list>]]
            $ @[<disk>:][<directory>]DCL_CHECK.COM HELP [<topic>...]

        <disk>  and/or  <directory>  may  be omitted; the current defaults
        will be used.

        The   file   DCL_CHECK.HLB  must  be  in  the  same  directory  as
        DCL_CHECK.COM if you use the HELP function in DCL_CHECK. The files
        may be in any directory to which you have read access.

        If  you  use DCL_CHECK frequently, you may wish to assign a symbol
        in your LOGIN.COM file to execute DCL_CHECK.  For example, if  the
        DCL_CHECK.COM  and  .HLB files are in you LOGIN default directory,
        you might put the following in your LOGIN.COM:

            $ DCL_CHECK :== "@SYS$LOGIN:DCL_CHECK"

        Alternatively,  if  you  put  DCL_CHECK.COM  and  DCL_CHECK.HLB in
        SYS$SYSTEM, you might put the following in your SYS$SYLOGIN (which
        is normally SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM):

            $ DCL_CHECK :== "@SYS$SYSTEM:DCL_CHECK"

Topic? Modifications

Modifications

        You  can  modify  or  "customize" DCL_CHECK by editing the command
        procedure, DCL_CHECK.COM. However, DCL_CHECK.COM is a "compressed"
        version  of  the  procedure.   To  save  disk  space  and  improve
        performance,  all  comments  and  unnecessary  spacing  have  been
        removed  from  DCL_CHECK.COM.  This makes it difficult to read and
        understand the procedure.

        It  should  be  much easier to edit the file DCL_CHECK.COM_SOURCE,
        which contains commands  and  is  formatted  to  facilitate  human
        reading.   You can re-create a "compressed" version of the command
        procedure by using DCL_DIET.COM.

DELIVER, Utilities, Handle incoming mail messages automatically 

DELIVER is an adjunct to VMS MAIL which makes it possible for incoming
mail  messages  to  be  handled  and  processed automatically based on
information provided in a user-supplied file.  Different  actions  can
be  taken  based  on  a message's address, subject or contents.  These
actions include delivering the message, forwarding the message or even
invoking  a DCL command script to perform some complex operation.  Any
actions taken occur immediately upon receipt of the message; the  user
does not need to log in for DELIVER to operate.

DELIVER is modelled after the MAILDELIVERY facility of the  MMDF  mail
system.   DELIVER  is,  however, completely distinct from MMDF and the
formats of .MAILDELIVERY files for MMDF and  MAIL.DELIVERY  files  for
DELIVER are dissimiliar.

SET_DEF helpers, UTILITIES, Great DCL Set Default helpers

You should first define a logical MISC to point to the directory where you will
be storing these files.  Then create the appropriate symbols that are documented
in the following comments.

EX: define misc rd$user:[brivan.common.misc]


You may want to type the command files and read the descriptions to see all of
the options available for the program.


New Features:	SET_DEF.COM has been updated to store a user specified number of
		"last" symbols.  You will be able to type 'LAST3' to goto the
		3rd saved directory.  To set the number of saved directories,
		type: 'SDF/SET=20' to save 20 directories.  All of the saved
		directories can be listed by typing: 'sdf/list'

		NOTE:	To make this change, the symbol SDF  must be defined
			with SDF= in the definition.



SET_DEF.COM   -	Will change the directory and the prompt to match the directory.
		It will also setup the symbols 'LAST' to point to the (oddly
		enough) last directory so that all you have to type is LAST to
		go back to where you came from.

		Create the symbol "SDF:==@misc:SET_DEF SDF="


DOWN.COM      -	Will allow you to easily change your directory to a lower level.
		Such as typing 'DOWN wo' will change your directory to a lower
		level directory starting with 'wo'.  If there are more than one
		directory starting wil wo, it will list them with a associated
		number.  You will then be able to type 'DOWN wo/2' to go to the
		2nd list directory.  DOWN.COM uses SET_DEF.COM.

		Create the symbol "DOWN :== @misc:DOWN DOWN="


FIND_DIR.COM  -	Will find a driectory down a tree of sub-directories.  It will
		then define a symbol and a logical so it will be easier to get
		there again.  Such as if you have a sub-directory [.work] and
		you type 'FIND work' (no pun intended) it will start at the root
		directory and scan down the list until it finds the [.work]
		directory.  Then it will define a symbol WORK that looks like
		'WORK == @MISC:SET_DEF par= disk:[brivan.common.misc.WORK]'. 
		Now all you have to do is type: 'WORK' to set your default
		there.  It will also define a logical called work to point to
		that directory.

		Create the symbol "FIND :== @misc:FIND"


DEF_DIR.COM   -	Will define a logical to point to your current directory.  If
		your current directory is disk:[bubba.stimy.stuff].  Typing
		'DEF_DIR it' will define a logical 'IT' to point towards
		disk:[bubba.stimy.stuff].  So, all you need to is type 'SDF it'
		to get back there.  You may want the logical defined in the
		SYSTEM table (if you have priv's).  So, using the above example,
		type "DEF_DIR/system it" will define IT in the SYSTEM table.

		Create the symbol "DEFDIR :== @misc:DEF_DIR params="


ACROSS.COM    - Will maintain a datafile with all directories in it.  This will
		allow you to change to any directory on any disk easily.  Such
		as 'ASDF stuf' will change your default to any directory
		starting with stuf.  Just like the DOWN.COM file, it will list
		all directories if it finds more than one.  This program has
		LOTS-O-OPTIONS to make it work the way you want it to.  It also
		uses SET_DEF.COM.  The first thing to do with this program is "$
		ASDF/init" to gather directory information.

		Create the symbol "ASDF :== @misc:across params="


DISK_STAT.COM -	Will display the space of all disks.  It will keep track of the
		last time DISK_STAT was run, and show you the changes.  You will
		need to type DISK_STAT.COM to get all of the available commands
		for this program.  You can issue the command 'DS/page' to
		constantly monitor your disk space.  It can be used in
		conjunction with the '/interval=' qualifier to adjust the update
		rate.

		Create the symbol "DS :== @misc:disk_stat par="

DISKBLOCK, UTILITIES, Editor and performance tester for ODS2 ODS5 and Foreign disks

  DISKBLOCK is a low level disk block editing tool.
  It can be used to read, modify and write LBNs on a disk or VBN's in a file.
  It can also carry out read, write and seek performance measurements.

  Diskblock ingores all locking activity on the selected Disk or File, it
  can access and modify ODS2 and ODS5 data structures such as file headers 
  and it can read, write and test individual shadow set members independently!

  There is a buffer which holds a copy of the block which you read, 
  you can modify the contents of this buffer using EXAMINE and DEPOSIT
  commands and then REWRITE it to the same block, WRITE it to a different
  block or SELECT a new disk or file and WRITE the buffer to any block.

  When you SELECT a disk, diskblock will attempt to map the Index File
  If it is successful then any command which requires an LBN (READ, WRITE,
  COPY etc...) will also accept a FID and operate on the appropriate file
  header.  This will work even if the disk is mounted /FOREIGN.

  There are commands to SAVE and RESTORE the buffer so that you can keep 
  a copy of the original block and undo changes if they do not work as you
  expect.

  There is a CHECKSUM command to enable you to recalculate the checksums
  for ODS2 and ODS5 file headers and home blocks.

  There is a DIRECTORY command which will find the header for a 
  file (even if the disk is mounted /foreign)

  There is a COPY command which will enable you to treat any block on a 
  disk as a file header and copy the LBNs described by its mapping pointers 
  to a new file (even if the disk is mounted /foreign).
  
  There is a SEARCH command which will search the entire disk/file 
  (or any range of blocks) for a particular string or integer or file
  header.

  There is a TEST command which will carry out performance testing.  You
  may specify queue lengths, I/O sizes, read/write ratios and seek types 
  and Diskblock will report throughput and bandwidth to the disk.

  Because of its potential to corrupt disks you should only
  use Diskblock in extreme desperation or on a disk which you have
  backed up.  
  
  You need LOG_IO privilege to run DISKBLOCK.

  Diskblock has an extensive help file with further information.

HSCLOAD010, system_management, HSC and HSJ disk load balancing tool

HSCLOAD010 is a useful tool for system managers concerned with the performance 
impact of data channel contention on HSC's and cache imbalances on HSJ's. This
tool uses a list of how disks are cabled (which CAN be obtained from HSC's
during the install) and the actual disk usage obtained from DECps or F$GETDVI to
determine the optimal loading given the wiring constraints. This information
can be used to perform either manual loading or automatic loading using PREFER.
Reports that are produced include a list of disks sorted by actual i/o's
performed and a list of HSC requestors showing the number of disks connected
and the before/after effects of load balancing on the total requestor load.
Command files to automatic set/clear/force the preferred paths are created when
the procedure is run. This kit is installable using vmsinstal. See the 
Postscript Install Guide and Users Guide for details.

           Message file:   (type your filespec here)
           Subject:        (type subject of message)

   DISTRIBUTE.COM will read the message file,  looking  for  distribution
   information.  Addresses are recognised by being enclosed in "(*D:" and
   ")" brackets; any other text is ignored.  For example,  your  document
   might contain:

           To:     Ronnie          (*D: WHITEH::REAGAN)
                   Maggie          (*D: NMBA10::THATCHER)
                   Mike            (*D: KREMLN::GORBACHEV)
                                   (*D: ENDLIST)

   The "ENDLIST" entry is not strictly  necessary;  it  tells  DISTRIBUTE
   that  there  are  no  more addresses.  This can result in a worthwhile
   timesaving, since otherwise DISTRIBUTE would have to  read  until  the
   end of the document looking for further addresses.

   After having constructed the complete address  list,  DISTRIBUTE  will
   send  the  document to all intended recipients.  If Nmail is installed
   on your system then it will be used---you can  use  the  normal  Nmail
   commands to check on the progress of your message.

DOCTOR, UTILITIES, Modify existing postscript files.

DOCTOR is a collection of seven tools under one umbrella:

       DOCTOR/GLOSSARY
       DOCTOR/MESSAGE
       DOCTOR/ONLINE
       DOCTOR/PS
       DOCTOR/SDML
       DOCTOR/TAG_COUNT
       DOCTOR/XREF

Each working on different files used or produced by VAX DOCUMENT.

DOCTOR is an unsupported product. 

__________________________________________________________________

1 DOCTOR's components

  The utility consists of several more or less independent
  parts, each working on some sort of file produced by the
  VAX DOCUMENT typesetting software. Only the part that
  works on PostScript files can also be used for other
  PostScript files, as long as they adhere to the Adobe
  specified minimal conformant file structure. 

  The types of files that can be handled by the DOCTOR are:

  o  PostScript files

  o  XREF cross reference files of VAX DOCUMENT

  o  SDML source files of VAX DOCUMENT

  o  MSG message files of the VMS Message utility to produce
     SDML files

__________________________________________________________________

2 DOCTORing SDML files: Sorting glossary entries

  Using the DOCTOR/GLOSSARY qualifier invokes the glossary item sort 
  utility. It will accept the input of any properly coded SDML source 
  file with <GTERM> entries and sorts these in ASCIIbetical order with some
  small corrections on its collating sequence. Under a properly coded file, 
  it is understood that only a single <GLOSSARY> - <ENDGLOSSARY> block exists 
  in the .SDML file. Multiple glossaries inside a single file are not
  supported by DOCTOR.

  The glossary does not need to be the only part of the file: it may be 
  embedded in a larger SDML file. Only the glossary part is sorted. Text 
  preceding or following the glossary section remains untouched.

__________________________________________________________________

3 DOCTORing VMS Message source files

  When a software product is coded and one uses the VAX/VMS error message 
  utility to produce error messages on SYS$ERROR when the software detects 
  an error (like the %DOCTOR messages you get from DOCTOR), the best place 
  to describe the reason of the error message occurring, and what the user 
  could possibly do to prevent it next time, is to write this information 
  immediately when the message is defined. That's when you know best which 
  message is added, why it was added and what you could do about it.

  The DOCTOR/MESSAGE utility will format a properly coded source file with 
  VAX/VMS message definitions and embedded comments in such a way that the 
  comments of the file are reformatted into a <MESSAGE_SECTION> section, 
  ready for inclusion into the User's Guide message appendix of the
  documentation that describes the software to which these error messages 
  belong.

  Note:
       If you use DOCTOR/MESSAGE/HELP then the produced .SDML file is 
       compatible for processing with the HELP.MESSAGE doctype.

  The produced SDML file can be <INCLUDE>d into a VAX DOCUMENT source 
  that is processed for the SOFTWARE family doctype.

4 DOCTORing SDML files for Bookreader output

  VAX DOCUMENT can be used to build books for printing on paper, but also 
  for using them as online books using the DECwindows Bookreader on either 
  VMS or ULTRIX.

  Unfortunately, the Bookreader product imposes a more strict use of some of 
  the tags, available in DOCUMENT, due to its unique features of "pop up" 
  elements (tables, figures, examples) that appear when you click on a "hot
  spot".

  Because any part of the document must be accessible from the table of 
  contents, a symbol must be attached to them so an implicit reference is 
  made from the table of contents to the section pointed at.

  DOCTOR/ONLINE will go through your SDML files and add symbols where there 
  are none, and also add references to pop up elements, where none is written 
  in the text.  If you specify a profile file, all elements will also be
  searched, as will any file referenced in a <INCLUDE> tag.  

__________________________________________________________________

5 DOCTORing PostScript files

  PostScript files are produced by a wide variety of products, such as 
  VAX DOCUMENT, DECwrite, DECpaint or MS-Word. With the arrival of laser 
  printers lots of documentation is produced in the PostScript format and
  printed. Several problems can then occur:

  o  A file print is halfway ready when the system crashes or the job gets 
     aborted for all the right and wrong reasons.

  o  Only a section of a document is interesting to print.

  o  Some products, like VAX DOCUMENT, do not produce blank pages when a 
     section ends on an odd page. This causes double sided printers to skip 
     a page and print the following section on the wrong side of the page 
     (recto pages on verso pages and vice versa).

  o  The same file is needed, but one would like a different standard page 
     layout (e.g. with DRAFT written over the page) as defined in the prologue 
     of the PostScript file.

  o  The PostScript file contains figures that were inserted as encapsulated 
     PostScript and you would like to remove those from the file or to create 
     them as separate files to re-use those figures.

  o  A PostScript document should be re-ordered in page output to allow for 
     saddle stitching of double sided printed sheets (4 pages/sheet, like a 
     magazine with page sheets folded in the middle).

  The DOCTOR utility does all this in an easy manner, provided the 
  PostScript file that must be inspected adheres to Adobe's minimal 
  conformant coding style. This is assumed to be true if the first line of 
  the PostScript file contains %!PS-Adobe, possible followed by a version 
  number.

Replacing the prologue:

  The prologue contains definitions and a general page layout applicable to all 
  pages. Hence, you can add or replace certain features to give the printed 
  pages a different look, without modifying any of the text that is part of 
  the document itself. You can create your own prologue, either based on the 
  original one, or entirely homewritten, to replace the prologue that comes 
  with the input file. This way you can produce effects like writing "DRAFT" 
  diagonally across all pages, or print a faint logo on each page or border 
  the text in a frame.

  To allow some simple modification, the qualifier /CHANGE_PROLOG has been 
  implemented. You can specify three items on each page:

  o  A bold printed text at the top of each page (a header)

  o  A bold printed text at the bottom of each page (a footer)

  o  A faintly grey printed text diagonally across the page.
     The grey scale can be set manually.


Extracting ranges:

  Using the /EXTRACT  qualifier you can specify to copy only a range of 
  pages from the input file into the output file. 


Removing or re-using figures:

  A PostScript file contains text and possibly figures. Those figures are 
  very often made separately (using a drawing package) and then inserted 
  into the text body by the text formatting tool such as VAX DOCUMENT's 
  <FIGURE_FILE> tag or DECwrite's "LINK TO PICTURE" option.

  Occasionally there is a need to either remove the figures from the 
  PostScript file (to allow the remainder to be converted back to plain 
  ASCII text file) or to re-use those figures in other documents.

  Removing figures:

    For some time now several tools are available to convert a PostScript 
    file back into its plain ASCII text file.  This can come in handy if the 
    sources to produce the PostScript file are lost or part of the document 
    could be used in another file. These PostScript-to-ASCII converters
    sometimes cannot handle embedded figures. DOCTOR enables you to remove
    that code before conversion it attempted.


  Extracting figures:

    When you want to extract figures from a document into individual figure 
    files, this function will result in DOCTOR scanning the PostScript source 
    file and to extracting each included figure to become a separate .EPS 
    file. This file can then be used in other documents or presentations.


Saddle stitch printing:

  When one wants to use a printer that allows for printing on both sides of a 
  sheet of paper, it may be advantageous to print the pages on half format 
  (allowing two pages on a single sheet side) and then fold the pages in the
  middle to make a signature (like a magazine), ready for saddle stitching.

  When the book is very thick, one may decide to divide the book into several 
  of these signatures and then stitch them together.

  In both cases this requires the output order of the pages in the PostScript 
  file to be modified. Rather than the usual sequential order of page 1, 2, 3 
  etc, we now need the first and the last page to be printed after each other 
  (and on the same sheet side if printing is setup for two pages/sheet). And 
  then page 2 and the one-but-last page on the backside of the sheet.

__front_sheet_1_________back_sheet_1_________front_sheet_2__      back sheet 2

  SADDLE only works for printing 4 pages on a sheet (two on each side). There 
  is no support for 4 or more pages printed on a single side of a sheet of 
  paper.

Minimal conformant files:

  Adobe Inc. defined a "Document Structuring Conventions Specification" for 
  PostScript files that utilities such as VAX DOCUMENT and DECwrite should 
  adhere to. Only then other utilities such as DOCTOR can inspect those files
  and manipulate them. DOCTOR's output is also conformant to these styles, so 
  one could use DOCTOR on its own files recursively.

6 DOCTORing SDML files: hierarchy of files within a book

  A complex document written for VAX DOCUMENT processing can consist of many 
  elements. The text may all be written in a single source file, or 
  distributed over many others, that are all <INCLUDE>d into the final 
  printable document. Besides text, other tools and utilities can provide
  additional graphical or tabular data. Often a complex document is 
  built using a profile file where this profile specifies the names of the 
  other SDML files that are part of the complete document.

  When several people work on such a compound document, it is easy to loose 
  track of the number of files that are referenced from the main, the root, 
  source file.

  Here, the DOCTOR/SDML utility, can assist you in the process. Given any
  top level root file that is coded in VAX DOCUMENT, it will produce one or
  several of:

  o  An organizational hierarchy of how the document is composed of individual 
     elements (that in turn may also be composed of smaller elements).

  o  A DEC/MMS description file that lists all the dependencies between the 
     individual components in order to rebuild the final printable document 
     in any of the supported destinations: LN03, PostScript, Bookreader,
     Line_printer or Mail.

  o  A list of all occurrences of the <X> and <Y> tags that are written in 
     those VAX DOCUMENT source files, annotated with the exact line number 
     of the file in which they were found.


Listing all included files:

  When a document is processed to the final output, the VAX DOCUMENT command 
  line indicates the top level source SDML file to be processed.  When one of 
  VAX DOCUMENT's three components (Tag Translator, Text Processor and
  Device Converter) encounter any of the tags (or their equivalents),
  the specified files will be opened and included into the final printable 
  output.

Producing MMS description (rebuild) files:

  Because once the hierarchy list is made, the DOCTOR also knows which files 
  depend on which other ones, it is an easy task to produce a description file 
  that can be read by DEC/MMS to rebuild the document if one of the elements
  is modified.

  Because DEC/MMS does not know how to build an LN03 or PostScript file from an
  SDML file, the DOCTOR/SDML also inserts all the required MMS rules and 
  suffixes to allow DEC/MMS to retrieve the sources from a CMS library and to
  rebuild it using a proper VAX DOCUMENT command.

Using DOCUMENT/GRAPHICS:

  A special mention must be made for the use of DOCUMENT /GRAPHICS produced 
  graphics. This utility, that is delivered with VAX DOCUMENT V2.0 onwards, 
  is a DECwindows oriented graphics editor, that will produce one or several 
  different output graphics: PostScript, sixel or BRF-bookreader files. In 
  addition it can output another .SDML file that only contains <FIGURE_FILE>
  tags. This enables the author to completely decouple text and graphics 
  components of the document. The only thing written in the text file will be

       <FIGURE>(figure caption\figure_symbol)
       <INCLUDE>(figurefile.SDML)
       <ENDFIGURE>

  whereas the figurefile.SDML will be created by the DOCUMENT/GRAPHICS editor 
  and contains the required <FIGURE_FILE> tags with the correct size of the 
  figure, which may differ for each destination.

  When DOCTOR/SDML/MMS is required to produce an MMS file, it will also add 
  the action rule to invoke the graphics editor DOCUMENT/GRAPHICS=RENDER to 
  recreate any such .SDML file from a graphics meta-file with file type .GRA.
  However, this will only work, if the MMS description file is invoked by 
  MMS while running on a DECwindows display (terminal or workstation), as the
  DOCUMENT/GRAPHICS utility will only work when it has this environment
  available - even if it will not display a single window. 

Retrieve all index entries:

  When a document is written and it contains many index entries, your chances 
  are good that some index entries that were supposed to be identical, but on 
  different pages, are actually printed as two entries in the index.  Usually 
  because you mistyped an entry of the <X> or <Y> tag.

  Finding those typo's is tedious: you need to get the book printed, then look 
  in the index, find the errors, look at that page, determine which file it 
  comes from and finally go into the editor and find the entry.

  The DOCTOR allows all this to be done much easier, without the overhead of 
  rebuilding the entire book each time you think you found all the errors. 
  (Usually the fixing of index entries take several repeated loops of
  correcting the tag entries).

  By specifying DOCTOR/SDML/INDEX the DOCTOR produces the hierarchy list, but, 
  while scanning through all the SDML source files, it also copies each and 
  every occurrence of the <X> and <Y> tags into a separate file, specified by
  the /INDEX= qualifier.

  The result looks something like the following example. This may look odd, 
  but it is very useful.

       Example Output of DOCTOR/SDML/INDEX
       __________________________________________________________________

        <X>(DOCTOR<XS>installation)       <comment>(    34 DOCTOR.SDML)
        <X>(DOCTOR<xs>invocation)       <comment>(    58 DOCTOR.SDML)
        <X>(CONFORM)       <comment>(    16 DOCTOR_MSG.SDML)
        <X>(CREATED)       <comment>(    25 DOCTOR_MSG.SDML)
        <Y>(IDENT - See DOCTOR)       <comment>(    34 DOCTOR_MSG.SDML)

       __________________________________________________________________

  The fact that all lines start with tag <X> or <Y>, allows you to use the 
  DCL command SORT to sort the file into alphabetical order. (It is produced 
  in order of the files referenced by the DOCTOR).

       $ SORT  input_file   output_file

  This will position typo's near each other and easy to spot when the sorted 
  file is printed. It is also easy to load all the required SDML source files 
  into your editor buffers once, and then move from buffer to buffer[1] to 
  correct the errors. Since you do not add any lines, but simply re-type an 
  entry, the line numbers that precede the file specification that is given 
  in the <COMMENT> on the same line, allows you to use a goto line command[2] 
  to quickly move to the indicated line to find the incorrect tag entry.

  Once all these entries have been corrected in the SDML files, you can run 
  DOCTOR/SDML/INDEX once more on it and inspect the new output to spot any 
  typo's you missed. If there are none, you can use the produced index file
  to make a dummy book by processing the index file by itself. Of course the 
  final output will contain non-sense page numbers, but at least it is 
  processed and built in substantially less time than redoing the entire 
  document.  When the processed and printed index also looks correct,
  then you reprocess the entire book. If you're still not satisfied, you 
  should make additional changes to the incorrect tag entries.

7 DOCTORing SDML files: Counting tags used

  This is a very simple utility that counts all the tags encountered in an 
  SDML file. A tag is defined as any contiguous text string consisting of 
  alphabetic, numeric or underscore characters, surrounded by the opening 
  and closing angle brackets: <LIKE_THIS>. For this reason, the utility 
  also detects and counts all user defined tags.

  The utility is invoked through DOCTOR/TAG_COUNT, and takes a single SDML 
  file as an input parameter. It automatically also searches through all files 
  referenced by the input file specified: if a profile is given, all elements 
  of the book are also searched, as are the <INCLUDE> files.

  Note:
     This utility counts any tag-like construct, as it does not 
     interpret or validate them.  This also means it counts all 
     tags within <COMMENT> blocks and/or <LITERAL> blocks. When
     within these blocks <INCLUDE> or <ELEMENT> or <INCLUDES_FILE> 
     tags are encountered, DOCTOR/TAG will attempt to lookup the 
     files referenced by these tags. It will give a warning if 
     those files do not exist, but continues processing.

8       DOCTORing XREF files


  When a large document is built using DOCUMENT, often references are used 
  to point to other parts of the document. After a while, and certainly if 
  several authors work on a document, you start losing track of what 
  symbols are defined for what tables, sections and other referable items. 
  Even if a naming convention is used.

  For this reason DOCTOR/XREF has been built. It will work on any document 
  of which the cross reference .XREF file exists. This is always true for 
  documents built through a profile. Single file documents do not have an 
  .XREF file - the Tag Translator keeps all data gathered in Pass 1 in 
  memory and uses it to resolve references during Pass 2: no need for a 
  file. You must break up this file into parts and add a profile file to 
  it, in order to use DOCTOR/XREF.

  Using DOCTOR/XREF on a .XREF file will allow you to do several things:

  o  Build an SDML file with all symbols listed in a <TABLE> structure. By 
     processing this SDML file (e.g. using the REPORT doctype) you get a 
     nicely printed listing of all symbols and their textual contents. Those 
     lists can be alphabetic on symbol name or sorted numerically by type
     (e.g. all table symbols sorted by table number). 

  o  Build an SDML symbol file containing <DEFINE_SYMBOL> tags of all symbols 
     defined in the .XREF file. This allows you to <INCLUDE> that file into 
     some other book and thereby enables you to cross reference between books.

Build symbol listings:

  DOCTOR/XREF allows you to produce a formatted listing of all symbols 
  defined in a document. The listings are made in <TABLE> format and can be 
  processed with VAX DOCUMENT using any doctype available that supports table 
  tags.  The listings can be made in alphabetical order on the symbol names 
  but also in numerical order of the section or object numbers.

  By default all symbols are then sorted alphabetically per type. However, in 
  many cases it may be more useful if they are sorted by their numeric value 
  (if applicable) so that for example, you can quickly look up the symbol for
  Table 5-6. 
  
Build cross reference symbol file:

  To build a file with <DEFINE_SYMBOL> tags that define the symbols plus 
  their reference translation, you need to specify the .XREF file to scan 
  and the /SYMBOL_FILE=filespec for the resulting output file.

__________________________________________________________________

In Summary, the various tools under DOCTOR are invoked by the following
commands:

DOCTOR/GLOSSARY

  DOCTOR/GLOSSARY-Sort glossary items in SDML file

  The DOCTOR/GLOSSARY utility will sort all <GTERM> tags and associated 
  <GDEF> tags within an SDML source file. The glossary section may be part 
  of a larger file. There may only be a single glossary.


DOCTOR/MESSAGE

  DOCTOR/MESSAGE-Create SDML file from VMS Message definitions

  The DOCTOR/MESSAGE utility can create a VAX DOCUMENT SDML file with 
  explanation of error messages, from a properly coded VAX/VMS Message
  source file.


DOCTOR/ONLINE 

  DOCTOR/ONLINE-Modify SDML files for Bookreader

  The DOCTOR/ONLINE scans through the specified SDML source file and the 
  files it references, for correct syntax to be processed for the 
  BOOKREADER destination. This implies that symbols are added to all 
  unsymboled sections, tables, examples and figures.


DOCTOR/PS

  DOCTOR/PS-Modify PostScript files

  This utility adds blank pages to PostScript files when required to have 
  a balanced set of odd/even pages. It also replaces the prologue part of 
  a PostScript file or produces an alternative output file that consists 
  of a subset of pages. It can extract or remove encapsulated PostScript 
  figures from a document, or re-order the page sequence to allow for 
  saddle stitching the printed output.


DOCTOR/SDML

  DOCTOR/SDML-Markup Files Included

  The DOCTOR/SDML scans through the VAX DOCUMENT source files for other 
  sources included by them, up to a nesting level of 20. These included 
  files can be VMS files or CMS elements, if DEC/CMS is installed on the 
  system. These files can be any of the ones normally accepted through 
  standard tags.

  It reports the document structure as a comment block in the source file 
  and can produce an MMS build file as well as a list of all the 
  occurrences of index tags.


DOCTOR/TAG_COUNT 

  DOCTOR/TAG_COUNT-Count all tags in SDML file

  The DOCTOR/TAG_COUNT utility counts all tag constructs inside an SDML 
  document. This document may be a complete book (profile plus elements).
  It reports the counted tags in the produced output file.


DOCTOR/XREF

  DOCTOR/XREF-List cross reference symbols

  The DOCTOR/XREF utility enables you to produce a file with

DST-SCANNER, Utilities, Scan Vax or Alpha images and display symbol definitions
DST SCANNER 

Chris Chiesa (lvt-cfc@servtech.com) (formerly Chris_F_Chiesa@cup.portal.com)

    The collection of files accompanying this text, make up the "DST
Scanner" utility: when built, they produce three executable images whose
function is to scan an executable image and display, if the information
is available, the names of the source files which were compiled/assembled
and linked to form the image being scanned.  The baseline utility scans
a VAX or Alpha AXP VMS image and displays source file specifications only;
a modified, "details" version scans a VAX image (no corresponding Alpha AXP 
"details" version currently exists) and displays source file specifications
PLUS some RMS information (record/file organization, EOF position) associated 
with the source files.

    This utility does its job by reading the "target" executable image 
(.EXE) file, following the image's internal structure (Image Header, 
Debugger Symbol Table (DST), etc.), and extracting the desired information 
from one particular small subset of the information contained in the 
image's Debugger Symbol Table, or "DST," records.  Note that an image will 
contain DST records _only_ for those contributing source files which were 
compiled (or assembled) with the /DEBUG qualifier, and only if the image 
itself was linked with the /DEBUG qualifier.  

    Note that other software utilities exist which may interfere, or which 
you might worry MIGHT interfere, with the operation of the DST Scanner.  
The STABACCOP program used in creation of Standalone Backup sets on those 
systems which still support them, can be used to copy an executable image 
WITHOUT its Debug Symbol Table records; therefore, the DST Scanner will 
produce NO output upon scanning an image that was copied with STABACCOP.
On the other hand, numerous public-domain utilities exist which clear the
IHD$V_LNKDEBUG bit, and/or modify the transfer-vector array, in an image's 
header, in order to "disable" invocation of the VMS Debugger when executing 
an image which was compiled and linked with /DEBUG.  Use of such utilities 
will NOT prevent the DST Scanner from finding, and emitting, the desired 
information if it was present in the "original" form of the image.

   The format of DST records is "undocumented" by Digital, in addition to
being intricate and subject to change.  It is, however, explained fairly
thoroughly in the comments in the relevant section (DSTRECRDS.REQ) of the
VMS Source Listing, allowing the intrepid programmer to write DST Scanners
and such.  Just don't expect Digital to help you fix it if it breaks at the
next release of VMS! 

    This particular DST Scanner is actually quite minimal, compared to what 
it could be "in theory."  DST records embed a huge amount of information: 
routine names, other symbol names, sufficient information (file specification, 
RMS attributes, creation date, exact EOF position, and ODS-2 File ID) to 
uniquely identify each source file, and the complete source-line-to-instruc-
tion-address table necessary for the VMS Debugger to support source-level
Debugging -- just to name a few.  There are at least a dozen (maybe more) 
types of DST record, and several subrecord types within most of those!  From 
this wealth of information, this particular DST Scanner extracts *ONLY* the 
"source-file-specification strings" and, in the "details" version, RMS 
file-and-record type and EOF-position values.  It should be pretty clear from 
the source code for the "details" version, how to extend it to emit what YOU 
want it to emit -- at least from the "source-file correlation" type of DST 
record this code is designed to find-and-process
    
   There are a couple of other "limitations" -- if you want to call them 
that -- to this utility.  

   First, the DST Scanner outputs to SYS$OUTPUT -only-.  It would be fairly 
simple to add an /OUTPUT qualifier, but I've never gotten around to doing it; 
sorry again!  Fortunately, you can easily get around this limitation by 
defining logical name SYS$OUTPUT to a file _before_ invoking the DST Scanner. 
This comes in very handy as you'll see.

   Second, my experience shows that an image contains a "source-file 
correllation" DST record for EVERY instance of a source file which 
contributed to a /DEBUG compilation at some point in the building of the 
image.  For example, if you compiled several C source files, each of which 
included "hoohah.h," or included something else which included "hoohah.h," 
and then linked the resulting objects into a single executable image, then 
the DST Scanner would find, and display, "HOOHAH.H" several times, not just 
once.  HOOHAH.H would appear at least once for each object whose compilation 
involved "hoohah.h" at ANY point.  This can be a little annoying when 
trying to cross-reference the "raw" DST Scanner output stream to a minimal 
list of source files.  On the plus side, the multiple-occurrence behavior 
makes it easy to notice, for instance, that two different C modules used
two DIFFERENT versions of "hoohah.h" -- perhaps as a result of having been 
compiled at different times, across modifications of "hoohah.h" -- alerting 
you to a potential run-time problem without having to actually execute the 
image!  

   Third, the DST Scanner emits source file specifications in the order it 
encounters source-file-correlation DST records in the image, which seems to 
be a combination of the order in which the compiler encountered the source 
files, and the order in which the linker encountered the objects.  It is NOT 
alphabetical, and multiple appearances of a particular source file do NOT, 
as a rule, occur "in a row" but, rather, "scattered" throughout the image.  
This can make it tricky to find a particular source file you're looking for, 
but can be useful in determining the order in which the compilers and 
linker "put the image together," if you have reason to be concerned about 
it.

   Fourth -- and there's nothing I can do about this -- the DST Scanner can 
*only* find source file specifications if they're actually present, i.e. if 
DST records were generated at compilation/assembly time, and were preserved 
at link time.  It is not necessary that all objects linked into an image be 
compiled with the same /DEBUG (or /NODEBUG) state.  If any object contributing 
to the image was compiled without /DEBUG, no DST records were generated for 
that object, and thus the DST Scanner will NOT find any source-file 
information for that object.  And of course if the image was LINKED without 
/DEBUG, you won't see ANY source file specifications AT ALL because all DST 
records have been omitted from the image!

   The second and third limitations can both be overcome by first directing 
SYS$OUTPUT to a file, then invoking the DST Scanner, and then sorting the 
output file with SORT /NODUPLICATES.  That will give you a nice, tidy,
listing, in alphabetical order with each unique source file specification 
appearing exactly ONCE.

   But enough about that.  How do you build it, and then how do you USE it?

   To build the DST Scanner, first make sure all the files supplied with 
this package reside in the same directory.  Set your default directory to 
that directory and invoke the command procedure file BUILD_DST_SCANNERS.COM:

   $ @BUILD_DST_SCANNERS

This procedure will perform three essential operations:

   1) Define the logical name DSTDIR to point to the directory where the 
      DST Scanner package's files reside;

   2) Build a Macro library containing assembly-time macros necessary for 
      step 3, below;

   3) Assemble the Macro-32 source code for the DST Scanner, and link it to 
      form the DST Scanner executable images;

   4) Add a new DCL command, "DST", to the then-current process.

Note several things.

   First, the logical name DSTDIR must point, at assembly time, to the 
directory where the Macro LIBRARY (created in step 2) resides.  At run-time 
it must point to the directory where the DST Scanner executable images 
reside.  These NEED NOT be the SAME directory, but things will probably go
more smoothly if they ARE.

   Second, you'll note that I keep saying "DST Scanner executable IMAGES,"
plural.  The DST Scanner package "as shipped" consists of three executable 
images:

   VAX_DST_SCANNER.EXE - reads a VAX image, emits source filespecs ONLY

   VAX_DST_SCANNER_DETAILS - reads a VAX image, emits source filespecs AND
       "other details" -- RMS attributes and EOF position, as shipped, but
       is easily modified to emit, say, source-file creation date...

   AXP_DST_SCANNER - reads an Alpha AXP image, emits source filespecs ONLY

Which program gets run, depends on how you invoke the DST Scanner, which
depends on how you issue the DST command.  We'll get to that momentarily.
Note that ALL THREE of these programs can be built, and will run and do
what they're supposed to, under VAX/VMS (built/tested under V5.4-3) and
OpenVMS AXP (built/tested under (cringe) V1.5-1H1).  I -expect- them to be
buildable, executable, and usable under "all" versions of VMS, but like any
sane person I DON'T GUARANTEE it. 

   Third, logical name DSTDIR gets defined, and the DST command verb added 
to your DCL environment, automatically, _only_ when you invoke 
BUILD_DST_SCANNERS.COM.  Thereafter it's up to YOU to define the logical 
and add the DST command verb.  I'll discuss this further in a moment.

   So now that you've built the DST Scanner and have the command verb all 
ready to use, HOW do you USE it?  Like this:

   $ DST [qualifiers] image_filespec

   Qualifiers:

      /VAX

          Scan a VAX/VMS (OpenVMS VAX) executable image

      /AXP

          Scan an OpenVMS Alpha (AXP) executable image

      /DETAILS

          Display source-file RMS attributes and EOF position in addition
          to file specifications.   The /DETAILS qualifier is allowed only
          when scanning a VAX image.

   You can set up either /VAX or /AXP to be the default, as discussed 
below.

   The build-procedure BUILD_DST_SCANNERS.COM will define the logical name 
DSTDIR, and will add the DST command to your DCL environment.  However, the 
next time you log in you will have to define the logical name, and add the 
command verb, yourself.  

   Defining the logical name is done by using either the DEFINE or ASSIGN
command, like so:

       $ DEFINE DSTDIR directory_where_DST_Scanner_executables_reside
or

       $ ASSIGN directory_where_DST_Scanner_executables_reside DSTDIR

   Adding the DCL command verb is done by using either of the two .CLD 
files provided by this package, with the SET COMMAND command.  Assuming the 
.CLD files reside in the directory pointed to by the DSTDIR logical name, 
the command is either:

       $ SET COMMAND DSTDIR:VAX_DST.CLD
or

       $ SET COMMAND DSTDIR:AXP_DST.CLD

The only difference is that VAX_DST.CLD defines the DST command so that 
when no qualifiers are specified the default is /VAX, and that AXP_DST.CLD 
defines the command so that the default is /AXP.

   Consult your system documentation for information on how to provide the 
DST command on a system-wide basis, or to yourself automatically at login 
or in all processes.  

   This should be enough information for you to build and use the DST 
Scanner.  If it is not, you may contact me (at the time of this writing) on 
the Internet at lvt-cfc@servtech.com .  If that address ever ceases to work, 
hopefully you'll still be able to search the Usenet newsgroups for "Chris 
Chiesa" and find me.  :-)

DTDRIVER, SOFTWARE, Device driver for TC-11/TU56 DECtape

The steam locomotive is an overweight, underpowered, fussy, expensive
to own and operate, totally obsolete source of motive power. And yet
is carries an undying charm that attracts many people. The same thing
can be said of DECtape.

DECtape was a random-access tape storage device that used a 3/4" tape
to emulate a disk. The 4" diameter DECtape reel fit comfortably in
your back pocket (unless you dressed like John Travolta) and had a
capacity of 296KB. The concept of DECtape originated at the M.I.T
Lincoln Laboratory and was originally called LincTape. Out of this
Digital developed the first personal storage media product in 1964.

It was always a bit dumpy in terms of speed and capacity, but its
reliability was legendary. There are tales of DECtapes continuing to
work after being dropped into a mud puddle, washed off in a sink, and
hung up to dry; of working until the oxide was so worn off you could
see through it; of a drive with a burned out motor successfully used
by hand-cranking the tape with a pencil.

Nowadays, like the steam locomotive, DECtape is hopelessly overpriced
and underpowered (I've seen Postcript preambles that would overflow
the tape), but it's still a blast to watch it run. Be the first
on your block to run a real museumpiece!

DUNGEON, GAMES, The original Dungeon adventure game

Dungeon is a development prototype of the game ZORK(tm), which is
available commercially from Infocom, Inc, on most personal computers.
Copyright on the Dungeon sources is retained by Infocom, and commercial
use is strictly prohibited.  ZORK(tm) is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.

   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
within.

   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

   No system should be without one!

   Dungeon was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science by
Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was
inspired by the Adventure game of Crowther and Woods, and the long
tradition of fantasy and science fiction games.  The original version
was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated
from MDL into FORTRAN by Digital engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.

DWREMTERM, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Start X-Window displays on remote machines

This command procedure is designed to allow users flexability in using 
DECwindows across a large number of machines connected together by a 
Local Area Network. It allows users to create LAT or DECnet windows locally
or to create remote DECwindow sessions. The decwindows commands RDT, RFV and
RDW are actually network process's and therefore do not count as an
interactive login.

DWremterm can be run in two modes:
  MENU MODE: commands are entered from a Small Menu Window.
  COMMAND MODE: commands are entered from the DCL command line.

Valid command are:- HELP, DWHELP, LAT, DECNET, RDT, RFV, RDW, DWRT and $.
Parameters listed are [] brackets is optional. 
HELP: Gives details on how to receive Brief or Expanded Help
DWHELP: Provide detailed Help on DWremterm
LAT:    Creates a Local DECterm Window using a SET HOST/LAT command.
        Only valid in Menu mode.
        LAT nodename
DECNET: Creates a Local DECterm Window using a SET HOST command.
        Only valid in Menu mode.
        DECNET nodename
RDT:    Creates a Remote Decterm Window.
        RDT nodename [init_state] [title] [dcl_command]
                     [display] [transport] [x:y]
RFV:    Creates a Remote Fileview Window.
        RFV nodename [init_state] [display] [transport]
RDW:    Runs a Remote Remote Decwindows Application.
        RDW nodename command [display] [transport]
DWRT:   Starts a second DWremterm Window.
        DWRT nodename [init_state] [display] [transport]
$:      Executes a local DCL command
For further details refer to sys$library:dwremterm.hlb.

A unique window title and icon name is chosen by referencing the user's
process name. If the login sequence changes the process name then duplicate
window and icon names may occur.

Refer to SYS$HELP:DWREMTERM.HLP for further help by typing:-
@VUE$LIBRARY:DWREMTERM DWHELP.

DWremterm consists of two files:
SYS$COMMON:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]DWREMTERM.COM 
SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP]DWREMTERM.HLB

The file DWREMTERM.COM needs to exist on both the local and remote nodes 
and requires the user to either specify node access control or for the 
remote account to be set up for proxy access. DWremterm can simply reside 
in sys$login on the remote node, which requires each user to have their own
copy -or- DWremterm can be defined as a DECnet object, requiring each 
system to have only one copy.

To install DWremterm as a network object the system manager should enter the
following commands:
 $ MCR NCP
 NCP> DEFINE OBJECT DWREMTERM NUMBER 0 FILE -
      SYS$COMMON:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]DWREMTERM.COM PROXY BOTH
 NCP> SET OBJECT DWREMTERM ALL
 NCP> EXIT
 $

If DWremterm is not installed as a network object then by default no other 
setups are required. However if the DECnet object task has been modified to 
disable proxy access then DWremterm will fail. In this case the system 
manager should enter the following commands:
 $ MCR NCP
 NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TASK PROXY BOTH
 NCP> SET OBJECT TASK ALL
 NCP> EXIT
 $

LATmaster must be installed to use the LAT command then. This software is 
optional under VMS 5.4-x and has been integrated into VMS 5.5. If 
LATmaster is installed on VMS 5.4-x then CSCPAT_0511 patch should be also 
be installed. If LATmaster is not installed then the LAT command cannot 
be used.

PROXY accounts allow one user direct access to another users account
 without having to specify username and password. The system manager
 can set up proxy account access from within AUTHORIZE. 
 Example:  $ MCR AUTHORIZE>
           UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL KINGSMILL/DEFAULT
           UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL OLSENK
           UAF> EXIT
           $
 This examples allows user KINGSMILL on node MVAX into the local KINGSMILL 
 and OLSENK account. The default switch enables you to specify just the 
 nodename when addressing this node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX::
 If Default access is not specified then you need to specify the 
 nodename and username when addressing this node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"OLSENK"::
 If you do not have proxy access then you need to specify the
 nodename, username and password when addressing a remote node:-
   eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"SYSTEM password"::
 
The Factory Defaults prohibit a remote users from displaying their
output to your workstation. To authorize other users or remote
nodes to use your workstation display you should:
  1. Choose Security... from Session Manager's Options menu.
  2. Type the nodename, the username, and the method of transport,
     of the user you want to authorize. Entering * * * will allow
     any user on any node with any transport to display output on
     your workstaton.
  3. Click on the Add button and the Clock OK.
Refer to the DECwindows user guide for further information.

CONFIGURATION SETUPS:
  The following logicals can be used to alter default DWremterm behaviour.
  DWREMTERM_INHIBIT_COPY to prevent a user being asked whether a new version
    of DWremterm should be copied.
  The WINDOW POSITION and INITIAL STATE can be altered from the default
    by editing the resource file. Details on how to do this is given within 
    the following resource files. 
      Default DWremterm window:
      - decw$user_defaults:dwremterm$default_v*.dat 
      DWRT DWremterm window:
      - decw$user_defaults:dwremterm$dwrt_default_v*.dat 
        This is on the remote node/users account.
      You can also override the DWRT resource file window position by
      defining the logical names DWREMTERM_DWRT_X and DWREMTERM_DWRT_Y
      under your local user account. These values are then passed to
      the remote node/users account.
  LAT$DISCONNECT_CHARACTER defines the character that you can use to 
    disconnect from a remote session. Default character is Ctrl+\.

TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS:
o Ensure that Security has been set up to enable a remote node to
  display output on your workstation. See installation section above
  for further details.
o The following logicals can be used to aid in troubleshooting
  These can be defined before starting DWremterm or during a DWremterm 
  Session by using the $ command.
    DWREMTERM_VERBOSE to display the progress of both local and remote 
      events. If verbose is enabled then a full sized menu window will 
      be displayed. This can also be enabled by prefixing the version 
      with an "X".
    DWREMTERM_VERIFY to turn on verify and verbose.
o NETSERVER.LOG on the remote node may also aid in troubleshooting.
o DWREMTERM_'pid'*.COM temporary file on the remote node shows the created
    command file.
o DWREMTERM.LOG temporary file on on the remote node showing the output
    from dwremterm_'pid'.com
o If you have problems creating DECterms then get the latest DECterm patch
    from your CSC.

Differences from the standard distribution:

    I have edited GNU_Startup.Com so that one version supports startup on
    either VAX or Alpha and renamed it to GNU_Startup_Common.  I fixed a
    couple of minor bugs in Configure.Com that prevented me from building
    Emacs in precisely the way I wanted to.

    Note that because it was built with the SINGLE-TREE option, you can
    easily build Emacs for additional (older and newer) versions of VMS
    and have everything but the .Exe and .Dump files shared.

    The standard VMS Descrip.MMS uses SET FILE/ENTER to create EMACS.EXE
    as an alternate name for EMACS-19_22.EXE and likewise for
    EMACS-19_22.DUMP and REBUILD-EMACS-19_22.COM.  I've also used SET
    FILE/ENTER to point DOC-19.22;2, DOC.;1 and DOC.;2 at DOC-19.22;1
    (I haven't yet figured out how to stop the Alpha build from creating
    an exact duplicate of this file built by the VAX build.)  If you
    copy the files from this CDROM, these SET FILE/ENTER commands will
    have to be redone, because BACKUP and COPY will create separate
    files for each entry.

Fast Backup

This package allows use of VMS Backup BACKUP/PHYSICAL by giving a means
to present a back/phys image as a disk to the system. Thus you can
use back/phys, which is about twice as fast as regular backup,
but still access saved data as individual files. The saveset must
all fit on one tape (need not be first saveset on the tape though)
and the utility can use CRC and XOR blocks to reconstruct bad data.
  The "disk" will appear on device DTA0: (which ought to please those
old enough to remember DECtape). The package has been tested on 8mm,
9track tape, 4mm, and TK cartridges and should work on any tape like
device. It uses fast skips to move around the tape and has a large
internal cache to speed operation.

Offered as shareware by Glenn C. Everhart, 25 Sleigh Ride Rd., Glen Mills
PA 19342-1440. If you use and like the package a donation of $10 would
be appreciated. 

The dthost_start.com file will get things started for you.

FINGER, UTILITIES, FINGER provides a user-information query service.

Three versions of finger are available on this CD.

NAME
  finger, f - Displays user information

SYNOPSIS

  finger [-bfhilmpqsw] [user ...]

  The finger command displays information about the users in the passwd file.

DESCRIPTION

  By default, information for each user on the host is listed.  This informa-
  tion includes the login name, terminal name and write status (an * (aster-
  isk)) before the terminal name appears (if write permission is denied), and
  login time.

  The finger command uses a longer output format when you specify a user or a
  list of users.  You can use account name, given name, or surname (as listed
  in /etc/passwd) to specify users.  This multiline format includes the
  information described previously, as well as full name, office number, and
  phone number (if known); the user's home directory and login shell; idle
  time; any plan that the user has placed in the file .plan in the user's
  home directory; and the project on which the user is working from the file
  .project in the home directory.  (Idle time is minutes if it is a single
  integer, hours and minutes if a : (colon) is present, or days and hours if
  a d is present.)

  If a host is not specified, the information is for users on the local host;
  otherwise, the information is for users at the specified host.  You can
  specify a user on a remote host by using the form user@host; if you specify
  @host alone, the standard format listing is provided on the remote system.

  The finger command displays user information only if the specified host has
  a fingerd server running or inetd is configured to start fingerd.  (For
  more information on setting up this server for your host, see the
  fingerd(8) daemon reference page.)

  If you want to make information available to other users who run finger on
  your user ID, you can create the following files in your home directory:

  .plan
      A file that contains plans.  The .plan file can contain more than one
      line.

  .project
      A file that states what project you are currently working on.  The
      .project file can contain only one line.

  The f command is a supported alias for the finger command.

FLAGS

  -b  Produces a briefer version of long format output.

  -f  Suppresses display of header line (the first line that defines the
      displayed fields).

  -h  Suppresses printing of .project files in long and brief long formats.

  -i  Produces a quick listing with idle times.

  -l  Forces long output format.

  -m  Assumes user specified is an account name, not a given name or surname.

  -p  Suppresses printing of .plan files in long and brief long formats.

  -q  Produces a quick listing, including only login name, terminal name, and
      login time.

  -s  Forces short output format.

  -w  Forces narrow, short format listing.

FLECS, LANGUAGES, Structured FORTRAN Translator

FLECS is a FORTRAN-to-FORTRAN translator which adds some additional
"structured programming" control constructs to FORTRAN.  It was written in
the early 1970s by Terry Beyer of the University of Oregon and is largely
obsolete since the emergence of FORTRAN-77.  Still, many applications 
written in FLECS still exist, thus having the translator available for
OpenVMS systems is still a benefit.

This version contains modifications by several people, including (most
recently) Selden Ball of Cornell University, to whom I am grateful for 
having furnished the sources.  I made some minor corrections to Fortran
syntax that don't affect the behavior of the program.

In the top-level directory are the following files:

	FLECS.MEM         - User's Manual for the FLECS language
	FLECS.HLP         - HELP file that can be inserted into HELPLIB.HLB
	FLECS-ALPHA.EXE   - Alpha executable version of FLECS
	FLECS-VAX.EXE     - VAX (VMS V5.0 or later) executable
	FLECS-ALPHA.OBJ   - Alpha linkable object
	FLECS-VAX.OBJ     - VAX linkable object

To use FLECS, define a foreign command as follows:

  $ FLECS :== $disk:[dir]FLECS-ALPHA (or FLECS-VAX)
  $ FLECS file.FLX (.FLX file type is assumed)

INCLUDE files are expanded and processed unless they have the "/NOLIST"
qualifier in the file specification. In such cases, FLECS simply passes
along the INCLUDE statement for FORTRAN to handle. If a file is passed 
to FLECS with a "/NOI" qualifier, all include files processing is passed 
on to FORTRAN.

See FLECS.HLP for more information on the command syntax.

Sources for FLECS (and RUNOFF sources for the manual) are in the [.SRC]
directory.  To build FLECS, copy the .FOR and .INC files into a directory,
set default there, and use the following commands:

  $ FORTRAN FLECS,SFLECS
  $ LINK FLECS,SFLECS

The compiler may issue some informational messages about "questionable
branch into block", and variables declared but not used.  The former are
due to FLECS' propensity for creating the following control structure:

	IF (.TRUE.) GOTO 99999
	DO WHILE (expr)
 99999  CONTINUE

I've looked at all the cases where this appears and I believe them to be
harmless (though I'd rap the knuckles of any programmer who did this
deliberately.  It would be hazardous if it were an indexed DO loop.)

The FLECS translator sources are also provided in their original .FLX
format (the .FOR files are the result of running FLECS.FLX and SFLECS.FLX
through FLECS).

The FLECS source code and manual are in the public domain.

If you find errors, feel free to send them to me, Steve Lionel, at
lionel@quark.enet.dec.com, and I'll see what I can do.  Please don't ask me
for enhancements or for assistance with the FLECS language.

FLIGHT, GAMES, Real-time multi-user flight simulator
!
FLIGHT V3.1 is an OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha AXP) application which provides an
interactive, real-time flight simulation environment. While running FLIGHT, the
user sees a wire-frame representation of the world around them, and a
representation of the aircraft's cockpit. Both are continuously updated in real
time. The keyboard and mouse are used to control the aircraft during the
simulation (e.g., start and stop the engine; deflect the ailerons). 

Some of FLIGHT V3.1's capabilities include:

     o	Extensive Collection of Aircraft and Worlds -- FLIGHT includes 100
	different models of aircraft (both fixed wing and rotary, and some
	vertical take-off and landing craft), along with a few ships, ground
	vehicles, the Apollo/Saturn V rocket, and other odds and ends, some
	real and some fictional (such as the NCC-1701D USS Enterprise).

	More than 20 different worlds are provided in which simulations may be
	run, covering a variety of regions (some actual and some fictional) and
	time eras, as well as some specialized worlds such as the near-Earth
	solar system.

     o	User-Created Aircraft and Worlds -- FLIGHT allows users to create new
	objects (e.g., aircraft and ships) which can then be flown or driven
	in FLIGHT. Similarly, new environments ("worlds") may be created by
	users in which simulations can then take place. Compiler and viewer
	utilities are provided with FLIGHT to facilitate this.

	The definition of an aircraft covers aerodynamic (e.g., lift and
	drag), geometric (appearance and animation), and structural (e.g.,
	wing span and chord, strength) aspects. In addition, the cockpit layout
	is completely user-defined. Instrument panels may be composed of
	arbitrarily arranged user-defined instruments. Instruments themselves
	are defined as of some basic type, ranging from the very general (dial,
	slider, digital, lamp, toggle) to the more specialized (radio, radar,
	artificial horizon, turn-slip/turn coordinator, ADF, VOR/ILS). An
	instrument may be "wired" to more than 70 virtual signal channels such
	as airspeed, altitude, throttle setting, and various radar lock data.
	Customizable aspects of an instrument range from basic parameters such
	as size and textual or numeric labeling, to details such as the shape
	of the toy airplane in an artificial horizon or the curvature and arc
	of the tube in which a turn coordinator's "ball" is suspended.

	The definition of a world covers geometric (appearance and location of
	objects), radio (frequency, type, and location), and physical (e.g.,
	gravitational) aspects.

     o	Multiple Users -- Up to seven users, running separate simulators on
	separate OpenVMS systems, may coexist together in a shared enviroment
	linked by DECnet. Each user will see all other users, and collisions
	between users' aircraft (and weapon fire) may be detected.

	Collisions may result in either partial or complete destruction of one
	or both parties, depending on such factors as the geometry of the
	collision and the strength of the aircraft or weapons. Damage can be
	evidenced in various forms, including partial or total loss of control
	(e.g., a rear hit may affect the aircraft's elevators) or engine power.

	Simulated radios may be used for communication amongst users. Radios
	may be set to different frequencies.

     o	Multi-Crew Aircraft -- An aircraft model may include up to four crew
	positions, such as pilot, copilot, navigator, gunner. Each crew
	position can have unique viewpoints and instruments, and can be
	operated by a separate user on their own workstation or display.

     o	Multiple Windows -- An aircraft may have multiple view windows (one
	facing forward and another aft, for example) and multiple instrument
	panels (e.g., a main console and an overhead panel).

     o	Multiple Viewpoints -- The user may view the environment from various
	points in or around the aircraft being flown (e.g., from the left seat
	or right seat or behind the aircraft), or the user may view the
	aircraft being flown from external viewpoints (control towers,
	mountaintops, etc.).

     o	Animated Aircraft -- An aircraft model may include moving components
	such as landing gear, bomb doors, control surfaces, and the like which
	visually illustrate the changing state of an aircraft, as well as
	autonomous components such as rotating beacons or strobes for night
	flight.

	Another use of animated components in an aircraft is to model a Head
	Up Display (HUD). FLIGHT supports simple HUDs which include velocity
	vectors, aim points, radar lock indicators, altitude/airspeed tapes,
	pitch ladders, and the like.

     o  Comprehensive Aerodynamic and Mechanical Simulation -- including
        modeling of forces on each wing-half separately (which can result in
        behaviors such as fixed-wing autorotations [spins] and adverse yaw),
        ground effect, vectored thrust, and tail dragger vs. tricyce landing
        gear.

     o	IFR Simulation -- FLIGHT models the essential features of both airborne
	and ground-based equipment to support Instrument Flight Rules
	operations. This includes working ADF recievers with NDB ground
	stations, and VOR/ILS receivers with corresponding ground stations.

     o	Multiple Vehicles per Simulation -- A simulated aircraft may deploy
	additional simulated objects. Examples include NASA's B-52N releasing
	an X-15 (provided in the kit); a bomber releasing a cruise missile
	(provided in the kit); a landing craft releasing a tank. The deployed
	object may be controlled separately from the parent craft (with its own
	views, panels, etc.) or it may be self-guiding (e.g., radar-seeking
	missile) or uncontrolled (e.g., a free-falling bomb).

     o	True 3D, Large-Scale Universe -- The environment in which simulations
	occur accurately models not only three-dimensional activity on a local
	scale (e.g., climbs and descents), but on a global and universal scale
	as well. The Earth is a true sphere in FLIGHT. A user can detect this
	via progressive curvature of the horizon as altitude increases, as well
	as by the ability to circumnavigate the globe, returning to one's point
	of origin.

	This latter capability may be achieved in a practical manner with high-
	powered craft such as rockets. FLIGHT's gravity model allows orbital
	behavior to be simulated (in real time), allowing, for example, a
	complete trip around the Earth in about 90 minutes from Low Earth Orbit
	(LEO). The strength of gravity properly attenuates with distance from
	the Earth, and is a function of the mass of the simulated object and
	the Earth. The Apollo/Saturn V model included in the kit has been used
	to achieve stable low Earth orbits lasting a week (real time).

	FLIGHT supports multiple planets (termed "masses") in a single
	environment. Examples include the Earth and the Moon, or two asteroids.
	The masses may have different sizes, masses, and atmospheres.

	The possible extent of a simulated environment is very large. Objects
	and distances may range from the very small (e.g., details of doorways
	on buildings) to the very large (e.g., planets separated by a few
	light-years) within a single environment, all to a consistent linear
	scale.

     o	Terrain Handling -- A simulated enviroment may include arbitrary
	landforms or other impeneterable objects. FLIGHT models the surface
	contours of such objects, to allow for ridges, valleys, tunnels,
	bridges, etc. which may be driven over with surface vehicles or flown
	around/through with air vehicles. Separate land and water surfaces may
	exist on which only suitably equipped vehicles can operate (e.g.,
	automobiles, ships, or amphibious craft).

FLIST, UTILITIES, File and Directory Manager

FLIST V2.4  [25-FEB-1998]
Copyright © 1990, 1998, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

----------------------------------------
This code may be freely distributed and modified for non-commercial
purposes as long as this copyright notice is retained.  Modified
copies may not be redistributed.
----------------------------------------

FLIST is a file and directory manager written in VAX TPU and VAX C (DEC
C).  The program was originally written in 1987 by Hunter Goatley. 
FLIST v2.0 includes many new features, added by Hunter Goatley and Peter
Galbraith.  (Generic EVE and DCL code by Peter Galbraith is provided to
support a "kept" EVE subprocess.  This code is compatible with the code
used by EVEplus.)

Please forgive me for the bad code---I wrote it quickly and have never
had the time to go back and really do much with it.  It isn't as
pretty as I'd like, but it works.

There also isn't much documentation, but pressing "H" while in FLIST
will show you help on the commands available.

To build, simply execute LINK.COM.  FLIST runs on both OpenVMS
VAX and OpenVMS Alpha.

To use, you must define a logical and a symbol:

	$ define FLIST_TPU_SECTION device:[dir]FLIST.TPU$SECTION
	$ FLIST :== $device:[dir]FLIST.EXE

You can then type

	$ FLIST [file-spec]

The optional file-spec can contain wildcards.  Once inside of FLIST, you
can type H for a one-line description of some of the commands.  Pressing
PF2 will show you a list of all key definitions.

All of the FLIST commands consist of either single-key presses or
GOLD-key combinations; be careful which characters you type once inside
FLIST.  (If you use a DECwindows mouse for cut and paste between
DECterms, be careful that you don't paste into a DECterm running FLIST,
because each pasted character will be treated as an FLIST command.)

Known limitations:

  o  Long  file  names  get  truncated and can't be viewed; it's one of
     those little bugs I just haven't gotten to yet.

See AAAREADME.TOO for additional information on FLIST and KEPT EVE.

FLIST (directory-editor) provides you, the user with a powerful and  versatile
interface  to VAX/VMS.  Rather than the line-oriented, "glass teletype", FLIST
is a full-screen editor which  shows  the  effects  of  commands  rapidly  and
naturally.   It  provides  both interfaces to VAX/VMS file management commands
(EDIT, COPY, RENAME) as well as extensions to the command interface to  better
integrate VMS commands, and to augment them

    o   Directory sorting shows you the relationship between  files  based  on
        their directory-attributes (e.g., size, date).

    o   Alternate display formats (from a palette of directory-attributes) can
        easily be constructed.

    o   A built-in command history and parameter substitution  facility  makes
        FLIST simple to learn and easy to use.

    o   Commands which alter or create files are  reflected  in  the  display,
        which is updated automatically for most operations.

FLY8-102, GAMES, Flight Simulator under X window

  DESCRIPTION

    This program is a flight simulator. It puts more emphasis on
    the dynamics than on the cosmetics: just wire-frame. It  can
    run on any machine but a 386DX is the minimum for any decent
    performance. A fast video controller is a boon as  the  pro-
    gram,  when  running  on a 386DX/40Mhz, spends 70-80% of its
    time pushing pixels. On non-intel machines you can  try  and
    see if it is fast enough...

    The  program  was  written  for  fun.  I borrowed ideas from
    everywhere and hope to hear some more. The basic  design  is
    based  on  a  program  I wrote more than 20 years ago at uni
    (the Technion). I had an excellent coach (Danny Cohen) and I
    still have fond memories of those times. But now my computer
    has more than 24Kbytes of memory! so Fly8 is  written  in  C
    (Fly8  was the name of the last version of the original pro-
    gram dated 12-JAN-1974, it was written in PDP15  assembly  -
    macro15 - for a VT15 graphics processor).
    The actual purpose of the program was to give me an opportu-
    nity to experiment with various aspects  of  flight  simula-
    tion, but mostly with (1) the HUD symbology (or, more gener-
    aly, with man-machine interaction) and (2) the  studying  of
    basic  aerodynamics (as well as general real time simulation
    techniques). This explains why there are so many HUD options
    and  such a proliferation of flight dynamics models, as well
    as why the simulation parameters are user definable as input
    files at run time. Of course, the experimental nature of the
    program means that it must be distributed in source form.
 
    On the  PC  the  basic  screen  drawing  uses  the  standard
    Microsoft  graphics library. It is OK but not very fast; the
    main advantage is that it will support most video  adapters.
    The  fast  graphics  driver was built from the routines from
    DJGPP with much personal additions. The flight dynamics  was
    influenced  by  an SGI program I saw and ACM. The timer rou-
    tines come from a microsoft journal article, the  user-input
    routine (notice how you can use arrow keys etc? use up-arrow
    to retrieve history.. I will document it one day) comes from
    DDJ (or was it CUJ? author name is Bob Bybee). Well, I avoid
    re-inventing wheels unless it is fun. The  program  compiles
    with Microsoft C, Borland C, gcc on a friends Amiga, Sun and
    Linux and I hope on other platforms; it  is  written  to  be
    portable.  It runs under MSDOS, MSWindows, Amiga and unix/X-
    Windows... and now on OpenVMS !!

    What? what? WHAT? you want to see some action? OK. just skip
    to the next chapter then come back.
    The full set of commands is detailed in the 'commands' chap-
    ter. Here we will look at the program areas in general.
    There are two rather distinct kinds  of  commands  that  one
    uses:  commands  that drive (fly) the game and commands that
    configure, set options and so on (which are used  with  less
    urgency).  It  was  attempted  to get the important commands
    into the keyboard (a one keystroke command) while the others
    go  into  the  main menu system (accessed with the Esc key).
    Some of the urgent commands may bring up a  menu  which  you
    may ignore if you know the keystokes.
    The  urgent commands will control the vehicle flight and the
    other subsystems (radar, HUD, HDD, weapons etc.).  You  will
    notice  early that the program lacks the traditional instru-
    ment panel: it is intended to be driven  from  the  HUD  and
    other digital displays.
    The vehicle is also driven by a pointing device (a mouse or,
    preferably, a joystick). It will run off the keypad when you
    have  no such device.  The pointer is used only for steering
    control although the buttons  can  be  mapped  to  auxiliary
    functions (by default both 'fire').

    The  display area is typicaly divided into the main view and
    a number of secondary Head Down Displays (HDD).  The  design
    has  a dozen or so on board instruments that generate visual
    data; you select which ones should  be  displayed  on  which
    HDD.  The main view is what you see through the cockpit. The
    HUD can be overlaid onto this view (as is the  case  with  a
    real  plane).  Other  data may also be shown here for conve-
    nience.

    One other instrument is designated as an alternate main view
    (use  the 'v' command to see it). The 'windows' menu handles
    the screen format and configuration.
    The program generates various messages  as  it  goes  along,
    these  will  appear at the bottom of the main view and stack
    up. Each message has a time-out for deletion but you can use
    'c'  to  clear the lot. When the program needs user input it
    will open a prompt line at the very bottom of the main  view
    (in  magenta  color)  where your data will show. You can use
    the normal editing keys while entering data here -  previous
    entries  are  accessible with the up/down arrows. See 'input
    line editing' later.

    You may find some of the commands/options  strange  (if  not
    outright  insane);  this  will  be  related  to  my taste or
    (mostly) to much history and quick fixing that did not  com-
    pletely  settle  yet.  I have looked at other programs (like
    F3, JF2, ACM and SGI f.s.) but this was after the first ver-
    sion of this program was finished, so some good ideas missed
    the bus this time. In the future I hope to polish  the  user
    interface  (especialy  after  other people get to use it and
    express an opinion).

    Being as the program is still evolving you  will  find  some
    areas less complete than others. I hope that there is enough
    of it to make it useful. I expect to see  contributions  (of
    ideas  and  code)  from  other  people;  I  will continue to
    develop the program (at least for a while) and would like to
    see it take it's own path in life [heavy stuff :-)].

  QUICK_START

    In  this  chapter the symbol '@' is used to denote the Enter
    key. This will give you a quick feel for what the program is
    like.  With the program installed, type
      $ fly -z5
    This  starts  the program in a demo setting and is useful to
    see if all is OK and also great as a screen blanker :-)
    If the fly.ini options are correct then your plane will take
    off  and  start  looking  for action. Some messages are dis-
    played during startup - these will disappear after  a  short
    while.  The  screen will show a simple view of the runway, a
    ground grid (in gray) and an overlaid HUD.

    To exit hit 'Esc' 'x' and 'y'.

FLYING618, GAMES, Pool/snooker/carrom/hockey/curling simulator

    Flying was actually meant to be a test program to implement some classes
    to control flying objects on the screen. After the classes were
    implemented there was the need of some real tests and a game of billard
    was just the first idea. By now, many subgame-classes are already more
    or less completely defined. They can either be selected by the options
    or by making a link to the original with a special name. Unfortunately
    having so many subclasses means that the classes themselves can't be too
    complicated. (There's just too less time in the world :( ) Therefore the
    games don't have any rules yet. This means you have to play fair and
    watch your opponent.

    Anyway, the main thing was animation and controlling and that works
    fine, especially with the -deluxe version of pool-billard. Since the
    main intention was to get an excellent billard game, I will mainly
    describe the pool-version in the following pages. The other subgames are
    similar to control (and there are no special rules anyway).

--------------------------------------------

It was mainly written with a colour capacity in mind, but allows the colours
on the command line to be set for monochrome dispays:

e.g. for monochrome: xmntn -ba black -mn black -se black)

Use 'xmntn -help' for a full list of options.

There is a simple interaction to allow new generations of mountain data without
having to quit and restart: simply click any mouse button in the pointer window
at the point along the scale for the dimension. The scale is graduated at the
integer values 1.00 and 2.00, and the scale allows for values entered up to
3.00. Clicking on the 'New Mountains' window will cause new data to be
generated and the mountains drawn. On a lowly GPX, this takes 30 seconds or
so for each phase. On a MIPS box, its INSTANT!

There is an alternative perspective to the mountains shown by the executable
'xlmntn'. This attempts to bring the viewer down to the level of the
mountains. It takes many of the same options, but also allows for the distance
of the observer to be changed.

FRAGAVOID, System_Management, a tool to prevent disk defragmentation

Fragmentn Avoid, DEFRAG, Avoid ~98% of dsk frag, 30%+ Disk Speedup w/src
Released by Acorn and GCE for the freeware CD or other general consumption.



	The Fragmentation Avoider

This utility actively prevents most disk fragmentation from occurring,
so that disks run less fragmented, and usually considerably faster. It
can be set up and left running with no attention; you configure it, turn
it on, and forget it, enjoying faster I/O and disks that grow fragmented
much more slowly than before. Your access to disks does not change at all
in detail.

This utility for Vax or Alpha came out of the Safety product available
from General Cybernetic Engineering and was extended by Acorn Software
to make its user interface more usable. It is presented in source as a
"calling card"; we hope that you will look over the SPDs for the
Acorn products and for the Safety components DPS and EACF in this area.
They provide many services for storage management unavailable from
any other places and include a complete "operator in a box" solution for
tape jukeboxes, a cluster-aware disk jukebox solution that allows failover,
and does not exhaust the MSCP server, full function, multi-level HSM,
realtime compressing storage (disk space trebler), reliable user UNDELETE
(which turns deletion to a "move to wastebasket"), and vast extensions to VMS
file security.

Now to the Frag Avoider.

The frag avoider will largely prevent disks from becoming fragmented
and will speed up disk access. In a nutshell, FA causes file extends to
be a fraction of the initial file size (with some safeguards so the
disk isn't filled etc.) so that VMS will not need to extend it as often.
This results in files less fragmented than they otherwise would be,
and writing doesn't need to "go to the well" as often. Some tests of
random loads have shown up to a 30% speedup. (Enjoy!!) It also by this
means, and by doing extends Contig Best Try, reduces the amount of
"chaff" space in the extent cache, so your files tend to be placed with
a "first fit" algorithm. The reduced fragmentation speeds read access.
It will not interfere with normal operation or even disk defragmenters,
but if you are nervous it can be turned off or on when you want. Normally
it is expected to be set up in your systartup_vms script however.

FA has been in use at several sites for a few years now. 

VMS disks in ordinary operation become fragmented rather quickly
once defragmented. This leads to files which require many index file
reads to locate and to lots of unnecessary disk head motion. On
optical disks, this is an even worse problem, since seek times are much
longer than magnetic disks.

There are several reasons for this rapid refragmentation which
deserve exploration. First is the way VMS uses its "extent cache".
Whenever disk space is released, pointers to it are kept in memory
awhile, so that space can be quickly allocated. The problem is that
whenever files are closed, they are generally truncated to return
extra allocated space to the system. The returned space is usually
in small pieces, and thus new space requests wind up being satisfied
from the last bunch of these little pieces of disk, rather than from
larger areas. When files are deleted, they leave these pieces around
which only get cut up still more with time. The result is fragmentation.

Also, it is often the case that files are left open for fairly long
times, and grow a few blocks at a time, typically allocating the
volume default allocation, but sometimes allocating a small fixed
number of blocks. Many of these files may grab 5-block extents
thousands of times over their lives; this inevitably produces badly
fragmented files which are hard to defragment because they're open.
It also wastes a lot of time calling the file system for every few
blocks.

The Fragmentation Avoider is a system for automatically addressing
these problems, and incidentally solving a few others.

The Fragmentation Avoider arranges for file extension to be done
"Contiguous Best Try" when this is possible. This causes VMS to
flush (i.e., forget about) its extent cache and attempt to find
a space big enough to hold the whole requested area before using
badly fragmented store. The program can do this for every extension
(the default and recommended behavior) or every Nth extension,
if you feel the need to have the extent cache used, but cleared
periodically. 

Fragmentation Avoider also controls the amount of space requested
when a program extends a file (i.e., makes it longer). It can
set a minimum extent request, so even explicit requests for one
block at a time can be increased, and is able to request that a
file be extended by 1/N of its current size, subject to free space
constraints on the volume and a maximum extend amount. It will
always request at least as much space as the program wanted, but
will attempt to extend by 1/N of the file size, 1/8 of the available
free space on the disk, or the maximum extent request, whichever
is least.

File extension is an expensive operation; by arranging it to be less
often needed, F.A. can permit file writing to enjoy up to a 30%
speed gain, in addition to permitting faster access to files written with
it. This is the gain from not having to do the extend operation
as often.

SUMMARY:

Fragmentation Avoider permits disk fragmentation to be controlled
by altering somewhat the VMS file extend operation in a way
that greatly slows the refragmentation of disk space. The package
can be installed on any disks where this is desired and its
parameters can be set on a per-disk basis. Disks where the 
Fragmentation Avoider is not installed are unaffected.


Installation:

See the AAAREADME.TXT. FA is installed with VMSINSTAL.

GAWK, UTILITIES, GNU AWK for VMS

aug-1995 Sheldon Bishov, bishov@star.enet.dec.com

The source for files was Free Software Foundation, ftp from
anonymous@prep.ai.mit.edu

To build, set default to source directory and enter the command:

$ @vmsbuild {param}

where {param} is VAXC (for VAX only) or DECC (for VAX or Alpha).

To (optionally) load help you can use one of the following methods.
{directory} refers to location where the gawk.hlp and/or gawk.hlb files
are to be located; in the source kit, gawk.hlp is in the [.vms] 
subdirectory of the main source directory:

    - Load help entry into a VMS help library
      e.g., set default to source directory, then enter command:
        $ library/help sys$help:helplib {directory}gawk.hlp

    OR

    - Load help into user library.  Set default to top level source
      directory and enter the following commands:
        $ library/help/create {directory}gawk.hlb
        $ library  {directory}gawk.hlb/help {directory}gawk.hlp
        $ @install_help  {directory}gawk.hlb

For other build and installation details, see the *readme*.* files in 
the source kit.

The following changes were made in the code:

getopt.c: change names of variables optarg, optind, opterr, optopt to have
         prefix "vms" (e.g., vmsoptarg) to avoid conflict with externals
         either in VAXC or DECC.  Also, removed local definition of getopt
         routine.

getopt.h: change variable names, as in getopt.c

getopt1.c: change variable names, as in getopt.c

install_help.com: new procedure for optional installation of help file.

main.c: change variable names, as in getopt.c

GIFMAP, MISCELLANEOUS, GIF files Web indexer (clickable contact sheets)

Gifmap provides a means of easily putting image collections on the Web.
It recurses through directory trees, building HTML pages and imagemap
(GIF or JPEG) files to allow the user to navigate through collections of
thumbnail images (somewhat similar to 'xv') and select the images to
view with a mouse click.

Gifmap is written by Bob Friesenhahn (bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us). I
would be happy to hear about your trials and tribulations with gifmap.

Gifmap 1.54 port under OpenVMS                             March 1998
==============================

You need perl and ImageMagick installed on your VMS system to run Gifmap (and
his brother gifmapsel). Gifmapsel is another version of gifmap with a new
option:

 --selectiontype image_type

to select only one image file type (for ex gif, jpg, etc ...).

gifmap try to translate a VMS path into a Unix syntax before writing an URL.
You generally need to define a rooted logical to correctly map your VMS path to
your WWW path.

Example:

The WWW /toto path is located to disk2:[tata.toto]
Before running gifmap, you need to define toto logigal name:

$ def/trans=conc toto disk2:[tata.toto.]

and

$ set def toto:[000000]

Now you can run gifmap or gifmapsel without need to edit the html files created
by gifmap.

Nota: Comments written by gifmap into html index files are in French.

You can invoque SETUP.COM procedure to define symbols and use gifmap
directly from this distribution.

GUESS_PASS, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Test users passwords.

DESCRIPTION:
This tool was developed to get users passwords.  This is to help determine
security issues releating to passwords.  I use this program to verify that new
users don't use "simple" passwords.


Parameter:	USERNAME

Qualifiers:	[no]COUNTWORDS	--  [Don't] Count the words in the dictionary.
		[no]DICTIONARY	--  [Don't] Use the dictionary.
		[no]DOUBLEUP	--  [Don't] Double words in the dictionary.
						ex:  test SAND	  <- Not doubled
						     test MAN     <- Not doubled
						     test SANDMAN <- doubled
						     test MANSAND <- doubled

		INTERVAL=time	--  Interval to display progress.  Default is 10
				    seconds.
						ex: /interval="0 00:01:00"
						    this indicates 0 days, 0
                                                    hours, 1 minute, and 0
                                                    seconds

		MAXADDITIONS=n	--  Largest number to add to the end of the
				    password.  Default is 9.
						ex: test SAND
						    test SAND0
						    test SAND1 ...

		MAXCOLUMNS=n	--  Largest number of columns to test.  Once all
                                    the words have been used in the dictionary,
                                    the program will start to try ALL possible
                                    passwords.  The default number of columns is
                                    set 5.  Which means it will test up to ZZZZZ
                                    then stop testing.  See NOTE #1 for more
                                    explanation.

		METHOD=method	--  Search method.  This does not apply to the
                                    dictionary words.  Options are BVM and JDW. 
                                    BVM is the default.  See NOTE #2 for more
                                    explanation.

		[no]REVERSE	--  [Don't] Reverse the passwords.
						ex: test SAND	<- not reversed
						    test DNAS	<- reversed password


NOTE #1: BVM method will test 0, 1, 2..., A, B, C..., 00, 10, 20..., A0, B0,
         C0..., YZ, ZZ, 000, 100, 200...  The default number of columns to test
         is 5.  Which means it will test up to ZZZZZ then stop testing.  See

NOTE #2: JDW method will test 0, 1, 2..., A, B, C..., 00, 01, 02..., 0A, 0B,
         0C...  The right most column will increase the fastest, where the BVM
         method will increase the left most column the fastest.

HGLOGIN, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Log in to another account without a password

HGLOGIN (Hunter's LOGIN)
Copyright © 1997, 1998, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

------------------------------
HGLOGIN is a rewrite and enhancement of the GLOGIN utility written by
Anthony C. McCracken, Northern Arizona University, in 1992.

HGLOGIN uses the PTD$ routines supplied by VMS and may not work on
older versions of VMS.
------------------------------

HGLOGIN lets privileged users log in to a named account without having
to know the password for that account.  A process running under the
target username is created.  Its input and output are read from a
pseudo-terminal, which is controlled by HGLOGIN.

Unlike BECOME and SWAP, the process created by HGLOGIN is a full
process, with all the privileges, rights identifiers, quotas, DCL
symbols, logical names, etc., as well as anything else that is set up
in the target user's LOGIN.COM.

HGLOGIN requires the target username as a parameter.  If there is
other text on the line, HGLOGIN enters "single command mode." The
remaining text is passed to the new process to be executed by DCL. 
When the command execution completes, the process is automatically
logged out and control returns to the original process.



INSTALLING HGLOGIN
------------------
To build the executable:

* Execute the following command to produce HGLOGIN.EXE from the supplied
  binaries:

	$ @LINK.COM

* If you have the BLISS sources and the MMS description file available,
  use MMK to compile and link the executable.

Once you have the HGLOGIN.EXE file, you can set up a DCL foreign command
to run HGLOGIN:

	$ hglogin :== $disk:[directory]HGLOGIN.EXE

To log in as user SYSTEM, simply issue:

	$ hglogin system

The effect will be similar to using SET HOST 0 or TELNET to log in to
local system.

To execute a single command under the target username, issue a command
like:

	$ hglogin system mail

In the example above, you will be logged in as SYSTEM and the MAIL
command will be executed in the SYSTEM process.  When you QUIT or EXIT
MAIL, you're automatically logged out of the SYSTEM process.

HGLOGIN and SET TERM/INQUIRE
----------------------------
HGLOGIN's single-command mode will not work properly if either
SYLOGIN.COM or the target user's LOGIN.COM include the command SET
TERMINAL/INQUIRE.  Normally, the commands sent to the process are
purged when the SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE command executes.

In cases like this, you must use the /PROMPT qualifier to tell HGLOGIN
what the DCL prompt will be once the process is logged in.  HGLOGIN
will then wait for the given prompt (which defaults to "$") before
sending its commands to the process.

	$ hglogin/prompt="What?" system mail

There is also a /NOQUIET qualifier that can be given to override
HGLOGIN's "quiet mode" in single-command mode.  HGLOGIN/NOQUIET will
display all the output from the process.

IF you try to use single-command mode and never see any output, type
LOGOUT and then use HGLOGIN/NOQUIET to see the output and prompt.  You
can then use /PROMPT to force HGLOGIN to wait for the DCL prompt.

HGSD V2.3, UTILITIES, Yet another SET DEFAULT replacement

SD V2.3  [31-AUG-1998]
Copyright © 1998, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

This is my version of SD, a SET DEFAULT replacement based on an old DECUS
submission by Alan Zirkle.  This version implements a stack of the last 16
directories visited, as well as short-cuts for specifying directory specs.

  Set/Show Default Directory

  SD ^      Go up one subdirectory level
  SD @      Go to top level of current directory (enter TOP for help)
  SD .      Go to login default directory and disk
  SD #n     Go to directory in n'th entry of the SD stack
  SD #      Set default to stack entry #1 (toggle stack entries)
  SD >X     Set default to [z.X] when currently in [z.y]
  SD >      Move to alphabetically next directory at same level
  SD <      Move to alphabetically previous directory at same level
  SD .X     Set default to [current.X]
  SD X.Y.Z  Set default to [X.Y.Z] (enter X for help)
  SD %      Push the current default onto the stack
  SD *      Show the SD stack (enter STACK for help)
  SD ?      Show this SD help information
  SD &      Unconceal a directory specification
  SD        Show the current default

SD can also set your prompt equal to the default directory name if the
logical HG_SD_SET_PROMPT is defined.

INSTALLING SD
-------------
To build the executables:

* Execute the following command to produce SD.EXE and SD_PROMPT.EXE from
  the supplied binaries:

	$ @LINK.COM

* If you have the BLISS sources and the MMS description file available,
  use MMK or MMS to compile and link the executable.

Once you have the SD*.EXE files, you can set up a DCL foreign command
to run SD:

	$ sd :== $disk:[directory]SD.EXE

For SD to find its help file, you should set its protection to W:RE
and define the following logical:

	$ copy sd.hlb dev:[dir]/prot=w:re
	$ define/system/exec HG_SD_HLB dev:[dir]SD.HLB

You can also include the file SD.HLP in a local help library to make
it available via the HELP command.

SD ? gets you help.

SETTING THE DCL PROMPT
----------------------
The SET_PROMPT.EXE image contains code to set the DCL prompt to the
name of the current default directory.

	$ sd :== $disk:[directory]SD_PROMPT.EXE

To actually have SD set your prompt, the following logical must be
defined:

	$ DEFINE HG_SD_SET_PROMPT TRUE

Note that you must have CMEXEC privilege in order to set the DCL
prompt. To allow non-privileged users to set their prompts,
SD_PROMPT.EXE can be INSTALLed with CMEXEC privilege:

	$ install add disk:[dir]sd_prompt.exe/open/header/share-
		/priv=(noall,cmexec)

HOTJOT, MOTIF_TOYS, Motif Desktop note Jotting Utility supports dual head color

HOTJOT is a Motif desktop note jotting utility which allows you to
create multiple jot windows.

Some of the neat features include 
  · Saves automatically every 15 minutes but only if there have 
    been edits  (prevents losing your notes).
  · Supports up to 100 notes each having up to 10,000 characters.
  · Shrinks notes down to a single line button so you can 
    have many on screen without taking up lots of space.
  · Can switch screens on dual head systems.
  · Allows different colored notes.
  · Can print individual notes or all notes.
  · Remembers color, size and location.
  · Stores in flat ASCII file using character 255 as a note separator.

Helpful hints when using the program.
  · Program uses minimal borders to lesson screen space usage so
    to move and resize a window you must use MB3 on the minimal
    border and bring up the windowing systems menu.  You can
    also use keyboard accellerators - 

         Alt+F7 Move   Alt+F8 Size
    
    Once you get the jots where you want, you probably won't move
    them much.

  · Only resize when open or the new size will not be remembered.
  · Add HOT JOT to your menus and Autostart and your daily notes
    will appear when you log in.

OpenVMS IMAKE, Build_Tools, Makefile generator

I. Summary:

        This freeware saveset contains everything necessary to use Imake on
OpenVMS systems.  Use the following command to restore this directory tree:

        $ backup/log Imake.sav/sav [...]*.*;

This will duplicate the Imake directory tree starting at your current directory. 
The instructions that follow are assuming that you restore this Imake directory
tree as the top level directory on a particular disk.

After restoring the Imake.sav saveset at the top level of one of your disks, you
can run the Imake_login.com procedure specifying a rooted logical name pointing
to your current disk default.   This command file will setup all the proper
logicals to use Imake on your system from any build area.  The following command
shows how this might be done:

        $ @imake_login dka300:[000000.]

or alternately from a development tools directory:

        $ @imake_login dka300:[project.tools.]  ! assuming this is where you
                                                ! were when you restored the
                                                ! Imake saveset as above.

Note the rooted directory specifications used above.


II. Directories:

    [IMAKE...]  - This is the top level Imake directory which holds all the
                  following directories:

    BINARY.DIR  - This directory holds the finished Imake tools, executables, and
                  Imake configuration files for a VMS environment.  The
                  Imake.Rules file is a monster file of slight variations
                  of Imake rules for building all sorts of program targets.  You
                  only really need a couple of these rules, but they exist in
                  all their splendor to show how you can create an Imake rule
                  to build any VMS type program target that you might ever need.

    CPP.DIR     - This is the C preprocessor that Imake uses.

    IMAKE.DIR   - This is the build directory and documentation for Imake.

    MAKEDEPEND.DIR      - This is the build directory for the makedepend image.

    MAKEINCLUDE.DIR     - This directory holds a command file to process output
                          from makedepend and insert it into an MMS makefile.

    UTILS.DIR           - This directory holds a command file to stream/lf an
                          OpenVMS text file that is not.  TPU creates files
                          that by default are not stream/lf.  You may be able
                          to configure TPU to do so.
           
III. Prerequisite Software:

    OpenVMS VAX | Alpha
    MMS
    VAXC, DECC, or DECC++ compiler


IV. Conclusion:

    The images in this saveset were built on an OpenVMS VAX 5.5-2 system with
VAXC.  You may have to play with the CC command on your system a bit to get
things to compile correctly with DECC.  This has not yet been tried, but there
should be no problems.  Once you get a good compile, you are pretty much done
building this stuff until you change platforms.

The CPP and IMAKE build areas have a bootstrap makefile.ini if you can't 
happen to run the existing images.   You build CPP first then Imake itself. 
There are readme files in most of the build directories to help you along.  They
describe some of the things that had to be done to get Imake working.

    The license release for all this software is found in the Imake.c module in
[imake.imake.build]imake.c.  It is a very nice tool.  May you find it useful!

The images and sources are located in zip20.zip.  Use the UNZIP images
located in this directory to obtain these images and sources.

UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format (also
called "zipfiles").  Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP
and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our
primary objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.

JAZZ, MISCELLANEOUS, MIDI Sequencer (Midi file editor).

jazz is a full size MIDI sequencer providing functions like record / play and
many edit functions as quantize, copy, transpose, graphical pitch editing, ...
multiple undo. It has two main windows oprating on whole tracks and single
events. There are special functions like GS sound editing and random rhythm
generation.

JAZZ V2.6b MIDI Sequencer port under OpenVMS                 18 August 1997
============================================

Jazz is a Midi software sequencer using wxWindows graphic library. WxWindows is
happily available for OpenVMS VAX & Alpha. WXwindows 1.67 for VMS is available
on this CD and at urls:

 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/lib/
 ftp://ftp2.cnam.fr/decwindows/lib/


One limitation : the wxhelp system is not actually available for OpenVMS.
Jazz is using wxhelp for implementation of contextual help, and therefore Jazz
help doesn't work on VMS. However, a formatted Jazz documentation is available
into [.DOC]JAZZ.DOC

For playing Midi files created or edited by Jazz, you can use Timidity, the VMS
version is available on this CD and at urls

 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/
 ftp://ftp2.cnam.fr/decwindows/

Jazz is written in C++ and was built under OpenVMS using DEC C++ 5.0 or 5.2
compilers. I don't know if it can be built with gcc on VAX.

The kit contains all sources and documentation plus VAX & Alpha executables
and object files (the object files are stored into ZIP archives AXPOBJS.ZIP and
VAXOBJS.ZIP). If you want relink, you need WX object library file and if
you want to recompile you need WX source kit.

To rebuild on vax:

$ SET DEF [.SRC]
$ @COMPILE_VAX
$ @LINK_VAX

To rebuild on Alpha

$ SET DEF [.SRC]
$ @COMPILE_AXP
$ @LINK_AXP

Before running Jazz, you need to copy [.SRC].JAZZ to SYS$LOGIN:JAZZ.CFG
file.

Enjoy !!

JED, UTILITIES, Editor that contains EDT/Emacs/Wordstar key mappings.

This area contains JED V97-12, an EDT like editor for VMS, Unix, MSdos, etc.
from John E. Davis, and also SLANG, the symbolic script language for it,
plus MOST, a handy text viewer, SLRN, a news reader, and SLSC, a spreadsheet
calculator. These files were last updated Nov. 7, 1995 from his net
area at space.mit.edu.

JED is an editor that contains EDT, Emacs, and Wordstar key mappings.
It runs on OpenVMS, UNIX, and PC systems.   It's very useful for learning Emacs
if you are a traditional OpenVMS programmer.  Some other features are;

	- Language sensitive editing.  There's a C mode, text mode, DCL
	mode, and others.  
	
	- ANSI color support.  Parts of a C source file can be programmed to 
	be displayed in different colors (i.e., comments one color, reserved
	words another, etc.).
	
Jed is shipped in a .ZIP file.  To unzip on an OpenVMS system, use the
Info-Zip unzip program that's located elsewhere on the OpenVMS FREEWARE CD,
and provide the following parameters (on UNIX and PC, the "-V" isn't
necessary);

	$ unzip "-V" jed097b8.zip
	
This will create two directories under the one that you execute the unzip
command from;  [.JED] and [.SLANG].  OpenVMS binaries are shipped in the
[.JED.BIN] directory.  JED.EXE is the VAX executable, and JED_ALPHA.EXE is
the AXP executable.

To install, read the file [.JED]INSTALL.VMS.  This provides all the
information that you need.

Jed comes from John Davis (davis@amy.tch.harvard.edu).  Read the
documentation in the [.JED.DOC] directory for more information.

HINT: copy [.JED.LIB]JED.RC to your SYS$LOGIN directory and edit your
changes there (turn color on, etc.).  Color works best on a terminal with a
black background and a light foreground.

JGdriver, SOFTWARE, intercept driver to retry errors on any VMS disk

JGdriver is an intercept driver which is used to retry errors on any
VMS disk. It is currently set up to build correctly on VAX systems.

It works by arranging, at start-IO time, that the disk start-io control
goes into it first, and a counter is initialized. Then when the I/O
completes, if it was unsuccessful, it is retried up to some number
of times (255 by default). If it was OK, the I/O is completed normally.

This means that a disk drive that gets some errors can be forced to
have them retried invisibly to the rest of VMS. Now and then some
disk errors will in fact occur which can be retried and which will
not appear all the time. This gives you a way to increase (sometimes
markedly) the reliability of the disk abstraction.

To build:

$ macro jgctl
$ macro jgdriver
$ link jgctl+sys$system:sys.stb/sel
$ link jgdriver+sys$system:sys.stb/sel+sys$input/opt
base=0
$ !
$ copy jgdriver.exe sys$common:[sysexe]
$ copy jgctl.exe sys$common:[sysexe]
$ copy jgctl.cld sys$common:[sysexe]
$ set command sys$system:jgctl
$ sysgen connect jga0:/noada/driver=jgdriver
$ sysgen connect jga1:/noada/driver=jgdriver
... etc....load one JG unit per disk...

$jgctl/verify jga0: dka0:
$jgctl/verify jga1: dka200:

...and so on. Use a different JGAn: unit for each disk.

(To deassign this facility use a command like

$jgctl/deas jga0: dka0:

)

You can do this at any time, and just continue to use the disks
as normal. There will be no observed effects except that transient
errors may disappear, and that fatal errors will take longer to
appear. In normal operation you don't see any change, but it
gives you a safety net. This was concocted for optical disks
originally where the author was seeing error log entries labelled
"recoverable ECC error" and the errors were not being retried in
dkdriver. It corrected the problem completely. 

The driver is also a decent example of a VMS intercept driver.

JPEG, GRAPHICS, JPEG release 5 Image Compression/Decompression

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"real-world" scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its
strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not necessarily
identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have
identical output bits.  However, on typical images of real-world scenes, very
good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and amazingly
high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.
For more details, see the references, or just experiment with various
compression settings.

JPI, UTILITIES, Selective Listing Of Processes Across Clusters And Wan's

  JPI is an OpenVMS wide-area network tool which is used to create a one
  line per process static information display for all processes matching
  specified selection criteria, displaying the output according to display
  criteria. JPI utilizes the $process_scan and $getjpi OpenVMS System
  Services to accomplish the scanning. Scanning can be targeted to a local
  node, a remote node, a local OpenVMS Cluster or a remote OpenVMS cluster
  or any combination of these. JPI V2.1 will execute on OpenVMS VAX V5.3
  and later and OpenVMS AXP V6.1 and later.

  This utility uses the DCLTABLES CLI for a command named JPI. JPI is
  NOT a DEC registered command and therefore may, in the future,
  conflict with a DEC registered DCL command.

  The kit is in a VMSINSTAL saveset. Sources are contained within the
  kit. The kitinstal self-detects VAX or AXP and builds the appropriate
  images.

  The following is a sample display output:

JUMP v3.0, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Become a different user exactly or in part

JUMP is a  program  which  allows  selected  users (Systems Programmers,
Operators and specifically authorised users) to change elements of their
process to those of another user, or to become *exactly* the target user
in  a pseudo-terminal.  Limitations are placed on Operators: they cannot
target users who have more than a certain set of privileges unless  they
are specifically authorised to do so.

All users except Systems  Programmers  are  validated against an  access
list  file  to determine any specific access to be granted or denied  in
addition to any default access (e.g.  for Operators).

For non-exact jumps, items which are changed to those of the target user
are:

  Username (Systems Programmers only, using the SETUSER or ALL qualifier)
  UIC, Default Directory, Default Disk, LNM$GROUP.
  Privileges and process rights are NOT changed.

To install JUMP:

  1. Re-link JUMP (NO Traceback) as directed in the build procedure.
  2. Define EXECUTIVE mode SYSTEM table logical names as required (see help).
  3. If required, create the JUMP_ACCESS rights ID.
  4. If required, grant the JUMP_ACCESS rights ID to authorised users.
  5. If required, create/edit the user access data file (see example file).
  6. INSTALL JUMP with privileges: CMEXEC, CMKRNL, DETACH, SYSNAM, SYSPRV
  7. Define a foreign command: $ JUMP :== $device:[directory]JUMP
  8. Boing!

The author of JUMP is

    Jonathan Ridler,
    Information Technology Services,
    The University of Melbourne,
    Parkville, Victoria, AUSTRALIA, 3052.

    Email: jonathan@unimelb.edu.au

Note: Some ideas in JUMP have been drawn from Eric Wentz's program BECOME.
      The code for pseudo-terminal creation is derived from Anthony
      McCracken's GLOGIN program.  Thanks to Jeremy Begg for a minor code
      fix and testing, and Bob Beckerhof for testing and helpful suggestions.

JUMP is written entirely in DEC Pascal and has been built and tested on
OpenVMS VAX v6.2 (DEC Pascal v5.4) and OpenVMS Alpha v6.2 and v7.1 (DEC
Pascal v5.5).

Kp shows a keyboard and practice text.  If you hit the right keys, the
cursor advances.  The keys you hit appear to be pushed in for
amusement.  (This is the primary reason why I chose Motif.)

It also shows the next key you have to hit in reverse-video so that
you don't have to watch your fingers (I know from experience that it
is hard not to watch your fingers).  After you get rid of the habit of
watching your fingers, you can turn off the next-key showing to
perfect your typing.

Kp has a "filter" feature which will let you select the keys you want
to practice.  When this is enabled, only words entirely consisting of
those characters are displayed.  This will make the sentences
meaningless, but it's just practice and you don't have to comprehend
what the practice text is saying.

LDDRIVER, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, VAX/Alpha Virtual disk driver

The logical disk utility is a system management tool available
to any user for controlling logical disk usage. It can also be used
for testing out things like volume shadowing, striping, host-based
raid, or software which does dangerous things to disks without disturbing
a real disk.

A Logical Disk is a file available on a Physical Disk, which acts as a
real Physical Disk. The Logical Disks can be created in any directory
of the Physical Disk.

A large disk can be divided into smaller sections, each a Logical Disk,
supporting the same I/O functions as the Physical Disk. By giving the
Logical Disk File a good  protection level and mounting it private or
with device protection, you are able to add a number of protection
levels to your file system.

Logical disks may be just a single disk, part of a volumeset, part of
a stripeset, part of a host-based shadowset, part of a host-based raid
set or any combination.

The file to be used for the logical disk may be placed on any physical disk,
in any directory. A backup can be made to protect the disk.

Another possibility is logging of all I/O requests for the driver, as well
as suspending/resuming I/O requests on certain conditions.

A physical device may be 'replaced' by a logical disk to enable logging of
all I/O of the physical disk. In that case we don't use any container file.

This driver can be used to create for example ODS-2 Cdrom's on a PC.
Just create a containerfile, hook it to a logical disk drive, mount it
and copy anything you like. Then take the container file to a pc, and
burn this file in raw format to a Cdrom.

The driver is now supported for both the VAX and the Alpha architectures.

The only limitation at present is that this tool needs at least OpenVMS
Version V5.4. Binaries are only supplied for version V5.5-2 and up for
OpenVMS VAX, and for V6.2 and up for OpenVMS Alpha. But since the full
sources are included a straight rebuild should be enough to get it
running on V5.4 and up. Be sure to read the releasenotes before an attempt
is made to rebuild from scratch.

The driver can be installed with VMSINSTAL. The LD062.B saveset contains
the sources, the other kits the binaries for various VMS versions.
After installation full help is available with HELP LD.

LINCITY-109, GAMES, A free SimCity game for X11

Copyright (c) I J Peters 1995,1997. Please read the file 'COPYRIGHT'.


WHAT IS LinCity?
================

LinCity is an SVGALIB (Linux only) and X based city/country simulation game
for Linux and other Unix platforms - Solaris, FreeBSD, HP_UX, AIX, SCO and
IRIX. There is also a Win32 version (win95 and NT) available as a separate
package at

    www.winsite.com/info/pc/win95/games/lc108.zip/index.html

or follow the Win32 link from the LinCity home page

    www.floot.demon.co.uk/lincity.html

XLin City V 1.09 port under OpenVMS                       December 1997
===================================

Xlincity is a city simulation game, very similar to Simcity, available for
Linux and various Unix systems, and now for OpenVMS VAX & Alpha.

Installation:
------------

To load and save scenes (cities), you need gzip installed on your VMS system
(however, without gzip you can play with xlincity but you cannot save your
cities). Scene files are very big (near 1 Mbyte each, and the compression
is very efficient on such files).

Xlincity needs some logical names to work:

LINCITY_DIR, a system wide rooted logical name pointing the location where
Xlincity data files are located.

LINCITY_SAVE_DIR and LINCITY_SAVE_OLD, two user logical names in the process
table. You need to define them at login time.

SETUP_VMS.COM DCL procedure gives you an example of an automatic definition
of these logical names (if you invoke this procedure, you can use Xlincity
using the provided distribution, the save directories are located under your
SYS$LOGI directory).

To make a regular installation of Xlincity, you must copy the four
subdirectories [.HELP], [.ICONS], [.MESSAGES] and [.OPENING] under
LINCITY_DIR:[000000] and also copy the colour table file:

Example (you are located into the lincity distribution):

$ define/sys/trans=conc lincity_dir disk:[toto.lincity.]
$ backup/log [.help]*.* lincity_dir:[help]*
$ backup/log [.icons]*.* lincity_dir:[icons]*
$ backup/log [.messages]*.* lincity_dir:[messages]*
$ backup/log [.opening]*.* lincity_dir:[opening]*
$ copy colour.pal lincity_dir:[000000]*
$ set prot=(w:re) lincity_dir:[000000...]*.*

Example of definition of user logical names under the home directory
(put the code in LOGIN.COM or SYLOGIN.COM):

$ mydir = f$trnlnm("SYS$LOGIN")
$ mydir = f$extract(0,f$locate("]",mydir),mydir)
$ def LINCITY_SAVE_DIR 'mydir.LINCITY]
$ def LINCITY_SAVE_OLD 'mydir.LINCITY_OLD]

Rebuild:
-------

You need DEC C++ 5.2 and DEC C 5.2 to rebuild Xlincity under OpenVms 6.2 or
higher. It is probably possible to build under previous versions of VMS and
previous versions of DEC C and DEC C++ (at least 5.0) but you need to provide
some unix functions not available with these prehistoric versions (at least
getopt). You recompile with COMPILE_DECCXX.COM procedure.

Object files are provided for these who just want to relink (use
LINK_{VAX|AXP}.COM procedure.

Running:
-------
The standard screen is rather small and not easy to read. You can double the
size (in X and Y) to fill a 1280x1024 screen with -d option:

$ xlincity -d

When running xlincity for the first time, you are prompted for the creation of
the LINCITY_SAVE_DIR directory.

Enjoy !!

LOGGING-VD, Storage_Management, Virtual disk that logs all writes to a logfile

This area contains my VAX driver (not touched for a few years) that
can (using logdata.ftn) log writes to the device to a logfile. The
idea was to give continuous backup. The logfile contains LBN, time
(to 64 bits), and PID of the writer, and the data written so that it
can be re-recorded to play forward from a physical backup up to any
time. The logger currently writes a block's worth at a time, though
that can easily be altered. FVdriver, LOGdata.ftn, and FVHST* are
the relevant routines.

Also an older version of my back/phys tape as disk utility sources are
present here in zoo files.

Creation dates are not all exact; these have been copied and renamed
a number of times. The files data from generally late 1991 to early
1992.

COMPRESS_LZ, UTILITIES, Tool to compress and decompress files

  The COMPRESS command invokes a utility to copy a file, generating
  a file with (usually) fewer bytes.  Files compressed by COMPRESS
  are recovered by DECOMPRESS.

    COMPRESS Input-file-spec Output-file-spec

2 Parameter

 Input-file-spec

  Specifies the name of the file to be compressed.  If you have
  specified /EXPORT=VMS mode, the file must be stored on a disk.

 Output-file-spec

  Specifies the name of the file created by COMPRESS.
2 Qualifiers

  Indicate special actions to be performed by the COMPRESS utility
  or special properties of either the input or output files.
  Qualifiers apply to the entire process.

  The following list shows all the qualifiers available with the
  COMPRESS command:

   o /BITS=value

   o /EXPORT=(option,...)

   o /METHOD=option

   o /MODE=(option,...)

   o /SHOW=(option,...)

2 /BITS
 /BITS=value

  This specifies the maximum number of bits to be used in the
  compression. It implicitly controls both the "quality" of the
  compression (more bits means more compression) and the amount of
  memory needed for both compression and decompression (more bits
  requires more memory). If the compressed file is to be read by a
  computer with limited memory (such as a PDP-11), choose /BITS=12,
  else leave BITS at its default of 16.  The minimum value is 9
  and the maximum value is 16.

2 /EXPORT
 /EXPORT=(option, [,...])

  Export controls the format of the output file.  You can select
  the following:

  VMS (D)               Write a file that can only be read by VMS
                        COMPRESS.
  UNIX                  Write a format that can be read by programs
                        compatible with the Unix compress utility.
  [NO]ENDMARKER         Write a special file endmarker after the
                        data if specified.
  [NO]BLOCK             Monitor compression and reinitialize if the
                        quality decreases if specified.
  [NO]HEADER            Write a file header with information for
                        DECOMPRESS if specified.


  In general, use /EXPORT=VMS for compression where the result will
  be decompressed on a VMS system and /EXPORT=UNIX where the result
  will be decompressed on a Unix, RSX-11M, RSTS/E, or other non-VMS
  system.  If /EXPORT=UNIX is specified, BLOCK, HEADER, or ENDMARKER
  may be negated to further qualify the output file format.

3 VMS

  Specifies output in VMS ("private") mode.  In addition to the
  contents of the file itself, the "File definition block" is also
  compressed. The decompression utility can thus recreate the file
  exactly (including ISAM indexes).  This is the default, and the
  recommended mode for most uses.

3 UNIX

  Specifies an output format compatible with Unix compress v3.0.
  This allows transmitting sequential files to non-VMS systems that
  support a compress-compatible utility.  If you have specified
  /EXPORT=UNIX, the utility can be configured for variants of Unix
  compress by negating BLOCK, HEADER, and/or ENDMARKER as needed.
  Notice that file attributes are not preserved by /EXPORT=UNIX.

3 BLOCK

  Selects an algorithm whereby COMPRESS evaluates its performance
  and re-initializes the compression tables whenever performance
  degrades.  Older versions of Unix compress do not support this
  capability. If negated, ENDMARKER must also be negated.

3 HEADER

  If negated, COMPRESS does not write a header record.  This is
  for compatiblity with very old versions of Unix compress.  If
  negated, BLOCK and ENDMARKER must also be negated.

3 ENDMARKER

  If specified, a special "endmark" is written after the end of the
  file.  This is necessary if the file is to be decompressed on RT11
  or other systems that require the last block of a file to fill the
  last block.  On the other hand, some versions of Unix compress
  cannot understand the "extra" endmarker.  If you guess wrong, a
  few bytes of garbage may be appended to the decompressed file.  A
  version of Unix compress that handles endmarkers correctly is
  available.

2 /METHOD
 /METHOD=(option)

  This specifies the particular compression algorithm.  Currently,
  only /METHOD=LZW is supported.

3 LZW

  Use the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression algorithm.

2 /MODE
 /MODE=(option)

  This allows specification of variations on the compression method.

3 BINARY

  This opens the file in "binary" mode, rather than "text" mode.
  It is ignored if /EXPORT=VMS is chosen.

3 DELTA
  Compress the difference between successive bytes, rather than the
  bytes themselves.  For certain file formats, such as bit-mapped
  graphics, this may yield a 10-15% improvement in compressibility.
  This is not compatible with some implementations of Unix compress.

2 /SHOW
 /SHOW=(option, [,...])

  Display information about the compression.  If omitted, COMPRESS
  operates silently (except for error messages).

3 ALL
  Equivalent to /SHOW=(PROGRESS,STATISTICS,FDL)

3 PROGRESS
  Print status messages at intervals, showing the operation of the
  program.  The report shows the current compression ratio (the
  ratio of input to output bytes).  If this decreases, COMPRESS
  decides that the characteristics of the file have changed, and
  resets its internal parameters.  The "gap" is the number of
  input codes used to compute the ratio.

3 STATISTICS
  Print a report at the end of the process.  Note that COMPRESS reports
  the number of bytes it compresses, which includes the file as well as
  the information that COMPRESS records about the file (the File Definition
  Language block and some internal codes), and will therefore be several
  hundred characters greater than the actual size of the file.

3 FDL
  Dump the File Definition Language block that describes a VMS input
  file.

3 DEBUG
  Print internal debugging information.

3 DEBUG_SERIOUS
  Print more internal debugging information.

3 DEBUG_IO
  Dump the output file, too.

2 LZW_Overview
  LZW stands for a compression method described in

    "A technique for High Performance Data Compression."
    Terry A. Welch. IEEE Computer, Vol 17, No. 6 (June 1984)
    pp. 8-19.

  This section is abstracted from Terry Welch's article referenced
  below.  The algorithm builds a string translation table that maps
  substrings in the input into fixed-length codes.  The compress
  algorithm may be described as follows:

  1. Initialize table to contain single-character strings.
  2. Read the first character.  Set <w> (the prefix string) to that
     character.
  3. (step): Read next input character, K.
  4. If at end of file, output code(<w>); exit.
  5. If <w>K is in the string table:
     Set <w> to <w>K; goto step 3.
  6. Else <w>K is not in the string table.
       Output code(<w>);
       Put <w>K into the string table;
       Set <w> to K; Goto step 3.

  "At each execution of the basic step an acceptable input string
  <w> has been parsed off.  The next character K is read and the
  extended string <w>K is tested to see if it exists in the string
  table.  If it is there, then the extended string becomes the
  parsed string <w> and the step is repeated.  If <w>K is not in the
  string table, then it is entered, the code for the successfully
  parsed string <w> is put out as compressed data, the character K
  becomes the beginning of the next string, and the step is
  repeated."

  The decompression algorithm translates each received code into a
  prefix string and extension [suffix] character. The extension
  character is stored (in a push-down stack), and the prefix
  translated again, until the prefix is a single character, which
  completes decompression of this code.  The entire code is then
  output by popping the stack.  I.e., the last code put into the
  stack was the first code in the original file.

  "An update to the string table is made for each code received
  (except the first one).  When a code has been translated, its
  final character is used as the extension character, combined with
  the prior string, to add a new string to the string table.  This
  new string is assigned a unique code value, which is the same
  code that the compressor assigned to that string.  In this way,
  the decompressor incrementally reconstructs the same string table
  that the decompressor used.... Unfortunately ... [the algorithm]
  does not work for an abnormal case.

  The abnormal case occurs whenever an input character string
  contains the sequence K<w>K<w>K, where K<w> already appears in
  the compressor string table."

  The decompression algorithm, augmented to handle the abnormal
  case, is as follows:

  1. Read first input code;
     Store in CODE and OLDcode;
     With CODE = code(K), output(K); FINchar = K;
  2. Read next code to CODE; INcode = CODE;
     If at end of file, exit;
  3. If CODE not in string table (special case) then
       Output(FINchar);
       CODE = OLDcode;
       INcode = code(OLDcode, FINchar);
  4. If CODE == code(<w>K) then
       Push K onto the stack;
       CODE == code(<w>);
       Goto 4.

  5. If CODE == code(K) then
       Output K;
       FINchar = K;

  6. While stack not empty
       Output top of stack;
       Pop stack;

  7. Put OLDcode,K into the string table.
       OLDcode = INcode;
       Goto 2.

  The algorithm as implemented here introduces two additional
  complications.

  The actual codes are transmitted using a variable-length
  encoding.  The lowest-level routines increase the number of
  bits in the code when the largest possible code is transmitted.

  Periodically, the algorithm checks that compression is still
  increasing.  If the ratio of input bytes to output bytes
  decreases, the entire process is reset.  This can happen if the
  characteristics of the input file change. (This can be supressed
  by /EXPORT=(UNIX, NOBLOCK)).

1 DECOMPRESS
  The DECOMPRESS command invokes a utility to restore copy a file
  that had been compressed by COMPRESS.

    DECOMPRESS Input-file-spec [Output-file-spec]

2 Command_Parameters

 Input-file-spec

  Specifies the name of the compressed input file.

 Output-file-spec

  Specifies the name of the file created by COMPRESS.  If the file
  was compressed by /EXPORT=VMS, the original file name will be
  used if the Output file spec. is omitted.  If the file was
  compressed by /EXPORT=UNIX and no Output file spec. is provided,
  the file will be written to SYS$OUTPUT:

2 Command_Qualifiers

  Indicate special actions to be performed by the COMPRESS utility
  or special properties of either the input or output files.
  Qualifiers apply to the entire process.

  The following list shows all the qualifiers available with the
  DECOMPRESS command:

   o /BITS=value

   o /EXPORT=(option,...)

   o /METHOD=option

   o /MODE=(option,...)

   o /SHOW=(option,...)

2 /BITS
 /BITS=value

  If a header was not provided, this specifies the maximum number
  of bits that were used in the compression.  This parameter is
  ignored if the compressed file contains a header.

2 /EXPORT
 /EXPORT=(option, [,...])

  Export describes the format of the input file.  You can select
  the following:

  VMS (D)               The file was created by VMS COMPRESS.
  UNIX                  The file was created by Unix compress
			or a compatible program.
                        compatible with the Unix compress utility.
  [NO]ENDMARKER         A special file endmarker follows the data.
  [NO]BLOCK             The compress program may have reinitialized
			compression.
  [NO]HEADER            The compress program wrote its parameters
			into a file header.

  In general, the program can determine the proper value of these
  flags by reading the first few bytes of the file.  If valid,
  the file header overrides the command line specification.
  Generally, this option is needed only if you are trying to read
  a file generated by a version of Unix compress that did not
  write a header.  See the description of COMPRESS for details.

2 /METHOD
 /METHOD=(option)

  This specifies the particular compression algorithm.  Currently,
  only /METHOD=LZW is supported.

3 LZW

  Use the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression algorithm.

2 /MODE
 /MODE=(option)

  This allows specification of variations on the output file
  format.  These values will be taken from the source file
  description if /EXPORT=VMS is chosen.

3 BINARY

  This creates the file in "binary" mode, rather than "text" mode.
  It is ignored if COMPRESS created the file in /EXPORT=VMS mode.
  The output file will be created in RMS "Stream-LF" format.

3 DELTA
  Compress used the difference between successive bytes, rather
  than the bytes themselves.  For certain file formats, such as
  bit-mapped graphics, this may yield a 10-15% improvement in
  compressibility. This is not compatible with some implementations
  of Unix compress.  This value is normally read from the file
  header, and generally need not be specified by DECOMPRESS.

3 FIXED

  Create the file in "fixed-length-record" format.
  This is probably the best format to use for decompressing
  binary files (such as tar archives)  created on Unix.

  The record size can be specified with this keyword, as in

  	/MODE=(FIXED=recsiz)

  If no size is specified, then a value of 512 is assumed.

3 TEXT

  Create the file in "variable-length carriage-control" format.
  This is appropriate for decompressing readable text files
  created by Unix compress.

2 /SHOW
 /SHOW=(option, [,...])

  Display information about the compression.  If omitted, DECOMPRESS
  operates silently (except for error messages).

3 ALL
  Equivalent to /SHOW=(PROGRESS,STATISTICS,FDL)

3 PROGRESS
  Print status messages at intervals, showing the operation of the
  program.

3 STATISTICS
  Print a report at the end of the process.

3 FDL
  Dump the File Definition Language block that describes the output
  file.

3 DEBUG
  Print internal debugging information.

3 DEBUG_SERIOUS
  Print more internal debugging information.

3 DEBUG_IO
  Dump the input file, too.

MadGoat FTP V2.1-2, NETWORKING, An FTP client/server for VMS
                                       
   [2-DEC-1994]
   
   MadGoat FTP is an FTP client and server for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS
   AXP. MadGoat FTP works with MadGoat's NETLIB TCP/IP library, which
   means that it works with virtually every implementation of TCP/IP for
   VMS.
   
   MadGoat FTP started life as the CMU-Tek FTP client and server. Many
   thanks go to John Clement and Henry Miller, who made the CMU FTP much
   better than it used to be. The MadGoat version was modified to work
   with NETLIB and includes numerous enhancements and bug fixes. The
   MadGoat version was done by Darrell Burkhead and Hunter Goatley.
   
   UCX sites, in particular, should find MadGoat FTP of interest. Some of
   the features include:
   
     * The client features a VMS CLI$ interface, with support for normal
       UNIX-style commands. For example, SET DEFAULT and CD both change
       the remote working directory. Unlike MultiNet's client, which
       offers a TOPS-20-style interface, MadGoat FTP provides a VMS-style
       interface with the case preservation, etc., of a UNIX-style
       interface.
       
     * The MadGoat FTP client and server support STRU O VMS. When both a
       server and a client support STRU VMS, VMS file attributes are
       retained when files are transferred.
       
       UCX does not support STRU VMS, making MadGoat FTP ideal for UCX
       sites connecting to anonymous FTP sites running MultiNet.
       
     * The MadGoat FTP server fully supports ANONYMOUS FTP accounts.
       Anonymous accounts can be restricted to certain directories, etc.,
       as you expect from an anonymous FTP server. The MadGoat FTP server
       is running on ftp.wku.edu, if you'd like to see its output.
       
     * The MadGoat FTP server implements the REIN command, which lets you
       log out of an account and log in to another without disconnecting
       from the remote server.
       
     * FTP/ANONYMOUS on the DCL command line automatically logs you in as
       an anonymous user.
       
     * The client automatically senses the file type, so you don't have
       to remember to say "Image" or "Ascii" before transferring a file.
       
     * May be started without the server, supplying a client-only option.
       
     * Works in batch mode.
       
   MadGoat FTP installs using VMSINSTAL. It is distributed with full
   documentation in the form of on-line help, PostScript, ASCII text, and
   Bookreader files. The BLISS sources are also distributed with the
   software.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  CONTACTING THE AUTHORS
  
   MadGoat FTP is maintained and enhanced by Darrell Burkhead and Hunter
   Goatley. To report bugs, please send mail to
   MadGoat-Bugs@WKUVX1.WKU.EDU. Additional MadGoat mailing lists are

MadGoat FINGER V1.2, UTILITIES, A FINGER client/server

   [26-FEB-1995]
   
   MadGoat FINGER is a FINGER client and server for OpenVMS VAX and
   OpenVMS AXP. MadGoat FINGER works with MadGoat's NETLIB TCP/IP
   library, which means that it works with virtually every implementation
   of TCP/IP for VMS.
   
   The MadGoat FINGER server is a relatively no-frills server. When asked
   for system information, it returns the usernames, owner names, nodes,
   and terminals of all logged-in users. It does not return the image
   name, and the information returned cannot be customized without
   modifying the source code.
   
   When information for a particular user is requested, that user's login
   directory is searched for a plan file, which is returned to the
   client. If the user is currently logged in, that information is also
   returned.
   
   The BLISS sources are distributed with the software.
   
  CONTACTING THE AUTHORS
  
   MadGoat FINGER was written by Matt Madison and Hunter Goatley. To
   report bugs, please send mail to MadGoat-Bugs@WKUVX1.WKU.EDU.
   Additional MadGoat mailing lists are available as well.

MSWEEPER, GAMES, Character Cell Mine-sweep like game.

DESCRIPTION:
This game started out as a "learning" tool for programmers.  I wanted them to
have something fun to work on and learn some 'C' tricks at the same time.  I
designed the program to be written with different techniques given the same
situation.  This way we could see how the optimizer would handle the different
techniques so we would know how to code 'real' programs.

USAGE:
         arrow keys - to 'drive' the cursor
                  F - to flag a bomb
<space> or <RETURN> - to select a spot to clear
	    <ctrl>H - to 'help'
	    <ctrl>R - to restart the game from the begining
	    <ctrl>U - to undo an explosion
	    <ctrl>W - to We-draw the screen
            <ctrl>Z - to exit any screen

If you have mouse control, you can use the following:
        Left Button - to select a spot to clear
      Middle Button - to flag a bomb
       Right Button - to undo an explosion

   [05-OCT-1995]
   
   MMK is a "make" utility for VMS systems. It is used for building
   software systems based on a "description file" (or "makefile") you
   create that lists the sources and objects of a system and the
   dependencies between them.
   
   MMK provides a subset of the functionality of Digital's DEC/Module
   Management System (DEC/MMS); the description files MMK uses are
   syntactically compatible with DEC/MMS.
   
   MMK runs on VAX/VMS, OpenVMS VAX, and OpenVMS AXP systems. It requires
   VAX/VMS V5.0 or later, or OpenVMS AXP V1.0 or later.
   
   MMK is written entirely in C. Complete source code is provided.

Mpeg3play 0.96 port under OpenVMS Alpha                      August 1997
=======================================

Mpeg3play is an Mpeg audio layer2 and layer3 real-time player.

It is  only available with OpenVMS Alpha systems with a 16 bits sound
card and MMOV (MultiMedia services for OpenVMS) installed (Alphastations 200,
250, 255, 500, 600)

On Alphastation 255 4/233, real time playing of an Mpeg-2 file gives about 25 %
cpu load (44,1 Khz stereo). Real time playing of an Mpeg-3 file gives about 50%
cpu load (44,1 Khz stereo).

This kit contains sources, object and executables plus sample mpeg audio files

ISO 13818-3 MPEG-2 Audio Codec

Mpeg audio Layer 2 & 3 encoder port under OpenVMS                Oct 1997
=================================================

The source kit contains ISO mpeg original audio encoder and decoder. Only the
encoder is ported under OpenVMS, an optimised decoder already existing
(mpeg3play).

You can find the encoder sources , object and executables files for VAX & Alpha
into [.LSF.ENCODER] directory. This encoder is Mpeg-1 Layer II and layer III
capable. However, it is not optimised and you need a fast cpu especially with
layer III.

You can compress at bitrates as low as 128 kbs before really earing artifacts,
even with Layer II !! At such a bitrate, the resulting Mpeg file of a 44 Khz
16 bits stereo stream is 30% smaller than a mono 8 bits 22 Khz WAV file and
gives a far better quality.

                 MPEG, CCITT H.261 (P*64), JPEG
  Image and Image sequence compression/decompression C software engines.


The Portable Video Research Group at Stanford have developed
image/image sequence compression and decompression engines (codecs)
for MPEG, CCITT H.261, and JPEG. The primary goal of these codecs is
to provide the functionality - these codecs are not optimized for
speed, rather completeness, and some of the code is kludgey.

Development of MPEG, P64, and JPEG engines has not been the primary
goal of the Portable Video Research Group.  Our research has been
focused on software and hardware for portable wireless digital video
communication.  The charter of this group ended in the summer of 1994.

OpenVMS port of MPEG Encoder/Decoder V 1.22                  December 1996
===========================================

Mpeg was ported on OpenVMS with few modifications (in MPEG.C and LEXER.C
files). It compiles on VAX with either VAX C or DEC C and on Alpha with DEC C.

Sources, object and executables are provided into this kit, with also a VMS
help file.

You can use Mpeg via display program of ImageMagick to encode animations into
mpeg format; you just need to define mpeg symbol:

$ mpeg :== $disk:[directory]mpeg.exe

MPEG decoding engine (c) 1992 The Regents of the University of California
Front end (c) 1994 Gregory P. Ward (greg@pet.mni.mcgill.ca)

The MPEG Library is a collection of C routines to decode MPEG movies
and dither them in a variety of colour schemes.  Most of the code in
the library comes directly from the Berkely MPEG player, an
X11-specific implementation that works fine, but suffers from minimal
documentation and a lack of modularity.  A front end to the Berkeley
decoding engine was developed by Greg Ward at the Montreal
Neurological Institute in May/June 1994 to facilitate the development
of an MPEG player specifically for Silicon Graphics workstations; the
decoding engine together with the MNI front end constitute the MPEG
Library.

MINISM, UTILITIES, Remote Xwindows Session Manager Utility

Launch remote X applications and display the output on your VMS
workstation. Executables are provided for Alpha and Vax. These
exe's require VMS V7.1 on the remote system(s).

To use:

Add following line (or similar) to your remote login.com(s):

  $ vmsm :== submit/noprint msmtcp.com /que=sys$batch/param=viking

Note that VIKING is the tcpip/decnet/nodename of local VMS workstation.
Make sure MSMTCP.COM in in the remote sys$login directory. Enter the
appropriate security info for the remote nodes and be sure the tcpip
transport is loaded on your VMS workstation. Also copy MINISM.DAT and
MSMAPPS.INP to wherever DECW$USER_DEFAULTS resides. When you are able
to display MiniSm locally from the remote node, use online help to see
how to use the tool. 

Two files are included to show how to implement your own application
launching command files. DECTERM.COM is used to create a remote decterm.
XV.COM shows a method for creating a launch file for custom apps.

MiniSm was built on VMS 7.1 using DecC 5.6 on VAX & ALPHA. In the past,
previous versions were built with VMS 5.5-2, Motif 1.1, and VaxC. This
may still work today, BUT IS NOT SUPPORTED. Remember, your mileage may
vary. 

If you do not have reasonable experience with displaying remote apps on
local displays, you will probably have trouble with this app. Otherwise,
it should be simply plug and play.

MX V4.2, SOFTWARE, E-mail message exchanging software
   
   [20-JUN-1994]
   
   Message Exchange (MX) is electronic mail software for OpenVMS VAX
   systems running VMS V5.0 or later, including OpenVMS V6.0, and OpenVMS
   AXP systems running OpenVMS AXP V1.0 or later. It supports Internet
   mail over CMU-OpenVMS TCP/IP, VMS/ULTRIX Connection, TGV MultiNet,
   Process Software's TCPware, and Wollongong's WIN/TCP and PathWay;
   BITNET mail over Wingra's Jnet; and UUCP mail over DECUS UUCP. Also
   included is support for SMTP message transfers over DECnet and X.25
   (using VAX P.S.I) and L-Soft International's LISTSERV software. MX
   uses VMS Mail for local message entry and delivery, and includes
   support for mailing lists and mail-based file servers.
   
   Features:
   
     * Users send and receive messages using VMS MAIL. Support for
       "signature" files is included in the VMS MAIL interface. Full
       support for automatic forwarding with the VMS MAIL SET FORWARD
       command is included. User-defined alias databases for e-mail
       addresses is supported. Binary files may be sent through MX to
       other VMS sites running MX, PMDF, or MultiNet.
       
     * Provides SMTP (RFC 821) message transfers over CMU-OpenVMS TCP/IP
       (aka CMU-Tek TCP/IP), DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (aka
       VMS/ULTRIX Connection), TGV MultiNet, TCPware from Process
       Software, and PathWay and WIN/TCP from Wollongong. Includes
       support for Internet domain system MX records. Also supports SMTP
       over DECnet and X.25 (using VAX P.S.I.).
       
     * Provides BSMTP message transfers with other BITNET mailers over
       Jnet, compatible with the CU Mailer package for VM systems. Fully
       supports BITNET-Internet gateways for non-Internet-connected
       systems. When combined with the SMTP support, can also provide a
       BITNET/Internet gateway service.
       
     * Interfaces with DECUS UUCP to provide a single mail interface to
       all mail protocols. Can also gateway between UUCP and other
       networks. (Not supported under OpenVMS AXP yet because DECUS UUCP
       has not been ported to AXP yet.)
       
     * Provides a mailing list processor with automatic subscription
       requests. Mailing lists can be configured to restrict postings
       only to subscribers or list owners, and to restrict the automatic
       subscription handling. Internet mailing list conventions and a
       subset of LISTSERV commands are supported.
       
     * Supports one or more file servers that can be set up by the system
       manager to handle automatic distribution of packages of files
       using mail as the distribution medium. Large transfers can be
       deferred to off-hours, and daily per-user, per-system, and/or
       per-server limits can be placed on each server.
       
     * Provides interfaces for a site-provided custom mail transport and
       custom address processing routines.
       
     * Provides its own message queueing subsystem. RMS block I/O is used
       to provide extremely fast queue access with little overhead.

NET3D, GAMES, A networked multiplayer 3d combat game.  Version 0.08

This is version 0.08 of net3d, a simple multiplayer game written for
Unix and X11. At the moment, I have only successfully tested net3d on
the following systems -

        Ultrix 4.4 / 4.3        (DECstation)
        OSF/1                   (DEC Alpha)
        HP-UX
        SunOS
        Solaris                 (Sun Sparc Classic)
        Irix 5.2                (SGI)

==> And now OpenVMS !!

If you are using either of the above, then it should work. As for
anything else... if you get it to compile and run then tell me about it,
and any changes / bug fixes needed to get it up and running.

NETLIB V2.0J, Networking, Vendor-independent TCP/IP routines
                                       
   
   NETLIB consists of routines for interfacing with any of the following
   TCP/IP packages:

    CMU-Tek TCP/IP V6.5 or later                (OpenVMS VAX)
    DEC VMS/ULTRIX Connection V2.0 or later     (OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP)
    TGV MultiNet V2.2 or later                  (OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP)
    Process Software Corporation TCPware        (OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP)
    Wollongong Software WIN/TCP and PathWay     (OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP)

   NETLIB is implemented as a pair of shareable libraries: a
   transport-independent library and a transport-dependent library.
   Multiple transports can be installed simultaneously; a logical name
   selects the library to be used at run-time.
   
   NETLIB is included in the following packages also available here:
   
     * Message Exchange (MX)
     * MadGoat FTP
     * NEWSRDR
       
   NETLIB is used by, but is not included with, the following packages
   available here:
   
     * MadGoat FINGER
     * NSQUERY
       
   The NETLIB package included in those kits may not be the most current;
   check the release notes for the other packages to see if you could
   benefit from updating your NETLIB installation.
   
   The files NETLIBvvu.A, NETLIBvvu.B, and NETLIBvvu.C comprise the
   VMSINSTALlable installation kit for NETLIB (where "vvu" represents the
   version number). The file NETLIBvvu_SRC.BCK contains the source code
   to NETLIB.

NetPBM, GRAPHICS, Suite of graphic image format manipulation & conversion pgms

          Enhanced portable bitmap  toolkit.  The PBMPLUS toolkit allows
      conversions between image files  of different format.  By means of
      using common intermediate formats, only  2  * N conversion filters
      are required to support N distinct  formats,  instead  of the N**2
      which would be required to convert directly between any one format
      and  any  other.    The  package also includes  simple  tools  for
      manipulating portable bitmaps.
 
          The package consists of four upwardly compatible sections:
   
      pbm     Supports monochrome bitmaps (1 bit per pixel).
 
      pgm     Supports grayscale  images.    Reads  either  PBM  or  PGM
              formats and writes PGM format.
 
      ppm     Supports full-color images.  Reads either PBM, PGM, or PPM
              formats, writes PPM format.
 
      pnm     Supports content-independent manipulations on any  of  the
              three formats listed above, as well  as  external  formats
              having  multiple  types.  Reads either PBM,  PGM,  or  PPM
              formats,  and  generally writes the same type as  it  read
              (whenever a PNM tool makes an exception and ``promotes'' a
              file to a higher format, it informs the user).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           N E T P B M

Netpbm is based on the widely spread Pbmplus package (release: 10 Dec 91).
On top of that, a lot of improvements and additions have been made. After
the latest release of Pbmplus, a lot of additional filters have been
circulating on the net. The aim of Netpbm was, to collect these and to turn
them into a package. This work has been performed by a group of program-
mers all over the world. If *you* have some code to add, please contact us,
and we will incorporate it. There is a mailing list for discussions about
Netpbm. You post a message to the list by writing to "netpbm@fysik4.kth.se".
If you want to be on the list, send a mail with the message "subscribe netpbm"
to "majordomo@fysik4.kth.se". If you want to report a bug, please send
your report to netpbm@fysik4.kth.se, and to the author of Pbmplus,
jef@netcom.com.


Please note, that this is not an official Pbmplus release. The code in
this release is merely a collection of code from various sources around
the world. Not all of the new code parts follow the high standard of
programming of Pbmplus. We have tried to make the code portable to as
many systems as possible, but we haven't cleaned up all routines. We hope
that this release will help the many users of Pbmplus to upgrade their
code all in one piece, instead of having to hunt down different code
fragments at different sites around the world. We also hope, that our
effort will help the author of Pbmplus, Jef Poskanzer, to make a new
official release soon.

The file Netpbm lists all new featues and functions in netpbm.

NEWSRDR V4.8-6, NETWORKING, A VMS Mail-like USEnet NEWS reader
                                       
   [20-JUN-1995]
   
   NEWSRDR is an NNTP client program for VMS systems running CMU-Tek
   TCP/IP, TGV MultiNet, DEC's VMS/ULTRIX Connection, or any TCP/IP
   package supported by the NETLIB network interface library.
   
   NNTP is the Network News Transfer Protocol, which is used to
   communicate USENET news over TCP/IP. Since many systems cannot afford
   the disk space to store all net news locally, this program can be used
   to communicate with a cooperating news server system to read and post
   net news. News articles are fetched on an as-needed basis and are
   stored on the client system only while they are being read.
   
   NEWSRDR is not a port of UNIX-based news readers. It is written
   strictly for VMS and provides an interface that VMS users should find
   reasonably comfortable. Most of the commands in NEWSRDR should be
   familiar to VMS MAIL users.
   
   NEWSRDR is written entirely in C. NEWSRDR can be used with any TCP/IP
   package that supports a Berkeley socket library interface, or with any
   package supported by the provided NETLIB network interface library.
   NEWSRDR requires VAX/VMS V5.0 or later, or OpenVMS Alpha AXP V1.0 or
   later.
   
   Support for Japanese sites using Kanji in news articles is provided
   through the use of an installable library of character conversion
   routines which can be mapped in at run-time by NEWSRDR. C source is
   provided for the Kanji character code conversion routines. Support for
   username and mail address conversion routines is also provided, also
   through the use of shareable libraries.
   
   Refer to the NEWSRDR documentation for specific system and user
   requirements.

Nmail, utilities, queued DECnet mail system for use with VMS MAIL


   SO WHAT'S NMAIL ANYWAY?

   Nmail works in conjunction with the  VMS  MAIL  utility  to  implement
   queued  transmission  of  mail.   This  allows you to queue up mail to
   nodes that are currently unreachable, for example, or to transmit long
   documents without needing to wait until transmission is complete.

   Nmail requires no special software to be installed at the remote node;
   it can send to any destination that ordinary MAIL can send to.


   HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

   To install, use VMSINSTAL:

            $ @VMSINSTAL NMAIL100 SYS$UPDATE:
   
   The same kit is used for both VAX and Alpha systems.

   You will be asked a few questions about your configuration.  If  you
   don't  understand  a  question,  simply enter "?" in response to the
   prompt.  The installation procedure will  display  some  explanatory
   text and then repeat the question.

   It is fairly easy to change the configuration at a later date,  just
   by editing the Nmail startup command file.
   
   After installing Nmail, you should read the documentation, which  is
   located in the following files:

            SYS$HELP:NM$SYSMGR.DOC      System Manager's manual
            SYS$HELP:NM$UGUIDE.DOC      User Guide
   

   HOW DO I BUILD IT FROM SOURCES?

   Expand the sources  saveset into a directory and  execute BUILD.COM. 
   On the  author's system, this will  build the VAX and  Alpha images.
   To do this, it  requires the Alpha  cross-system tools, which aren't
   support  on  VAX VMS V6.1, so some trickery is  required to get them
   working.  This trickery is left as an exercise for the reader.

   Since the author has a VAX, the build procedure probably  won't work
   on an Alpha without modification -- for example, it will expect some
   non-existent cross compiler so that it can build the VAX images.
  
   Once you have actually  managed to  build the  images, use CREAK.COM 
   to create a VMSINSTAL-format kit.

NNMCVT, UTILITIES, Export VMS mail in a format that can be read by NMAIL

Nnmcvt is a self-contained utility to export VMS mail in a format that can be
read directly by Nnmail.  It has the following features and restrictions:

It processes only the default mail file.  If you don't know what this means,
you probably won't notice a problem.

It processes all mail messages in all mail folders in a single execution.  One
consequence is that you must have enough working disk space to create all the
converted files.

It places the converted mail in subdirectories of your current default
directory.  Each mail message is in a separate file.  The files are named
MSGnnnn.MAI, where 'nnnn' is an arbitrary sequence number.

It does not disturb your VMS Mail in any way, except to read it.

For example, if you had mail in folders A, B, and MAIL, you would get a number
of .MAI files in [.A], [.B], and [.MAIL].  You then copy the files in these
directories to your Windows NT system.  One way to do this is by mounting your
VMS directory as a share using Pathworks and then selecting and dragging the
files to subdirectories of your Nnmail storage directories.  When you are
satisfied that the result is correct, you can delete the files from the VMS
system.

The utility is a VAX/VMS image linked on V5.5-2 named NNMCVT.EXE.  To execute
it, copy it to your system and RUN it.

Comments and problem reports will be received at jack@JAMMER.enet.dec.com.
However, this utility is not a work project and must receive a corresponding 
level of attention.

NOTICE V2.2, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, A system for managing login notices

NOTICE V2.2
Copyright © 1992--1998, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

This kit contains all the files necessary for installing the
NOTICE utility.  Requires OpenVMS VAX V5.4 or later or
OpenVMS Alpha V1.0 or later.

NOTICE  informs  users  of important (?) notices when they log in to a
VMS system.  When a user logs  in,  he/she  is  informed  of  any  new
notices added to the system since his/her last interactive login.

NOTICE  was  written  to  provide  some  means  for notifying users of
important system changes (new software,  new  operating  hours,  etc.)
without  having  to  display  a  text file each time they log in.  The
heart of NOTICE is a normal VMS text library, which contains the  text
of all NOTICE messages.  When NOTICE is run with the /NEW qualifier, a
brief description of all notices added to the system since the  user's
last interactive login is displayed:

	$ notice

	NOTICE topics.  Type NOTICE <topic-name> for more information.

	Topic      Date         Description
	---------  -----------  -----------
	VUG        22-APR-1992  VMS Users Group meeting, April 23

	$

Such  a  call  to NOTICE would typically be placed in the system login
procedure (SYS$SYLOGIN) so it is executed  each  time  an  interactive
user logs in.


HOW NOTICE WORKS
----------------
A  simple  command procedure is provided to help you manage the NOTICE
text library (NOTICE_MGR.COM).  Any time you wish to notify your users
of  some event, you can add a module to the text library.  When NOTICE
is executed with /NEW, it compares their last interactive  login  time
(which  is  the last time they logged in *before* the current session)
with the insertion date of each module in the NOTICE text library.  If
a  module has been added since the last time the user logged in, it is
included in the list of NOTICES that is displayed  (accompanied  by  a
bell).

The  /PAUSE  qualifier can be given to cause NOTICE to prompt the user
to press RETURN to continue, iff there were new notices.

The  /TEXT  qualifier can be used with /NEW to force notice to display
the text for all new notices,  prompting  the  user  to  press  RETURN
between  each  new notice.  This is useful for those sites who want to
ensure that users see the notices  by  displaying  the  full  text  at
login.   NOTE:   If you plan to use /TEXT, be sure your notices can be
displayed on a single screen, otherwise they will  scroll  off  screen
before  the user can read them.  (SMG$ routines are not used when /NEW
is given.)

Users  can  examine the actual text of the message by adding the topic
name to the NOTICE command:

	$ NOTICE FINALS

NOTICE  works like TYPE/PAGE on video terminals---the user is prompted
to press RETURN before each screen is scrolled so they  can  read  the
notice without having it scroll off-screen.

NOTICE can be configured to always display a topic in the NOTICE list.

NOTICE  without  any  parameters  will  display  all  of  the  notices
available.


SETTING UP NOTICE
-----------------
To link NOTICE, just execute the LINK.COM command procedure:

	$ @LINK

If you have BLISS, you can use MMK or MMS to rebuild it in the [.SOURCE]
directory.

You  must  then  create  the  NOTICE text library.  You can either use
NOTICE_MGR.COM to do it, or you can execute the following commands:

	$ LIBRARY/TEXT/CREATE NOTICE.TLB	!Or any other name you want

You   then   define   a   system  logical  to  point  to  the  library
(NOTICE_STARTUP.COM can be edited to do this):

	$ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC NOTICE_LIBRARY dev:[dir]NOTICE.TLB

The  protection  on  the  NOTICE library should be set to W:R and full
access by SYSTEM:

	$ SET FILE/PROT=W:R dev:[dir]NOTICE.TLB

With  W:R  access  to the text library, NOTICE requires no privileges,
though you may want to install it to speed access to it:

	$ INSTALL ADD dev:[dir]NOTICE.EXE/OPEN/HEADER/SHARE

(Again, this command is included in NOTICE_STARTUP.COM.)

Finally,  you'll  need  to  define  NOTICE  as  a  foreign  command in
SYS$SYLOGIN (by default, SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM) and execute  it  for
all users.

	$ notice :== $dev:[dir]notice.exe	!Define globally!
	$ notice				!Display any new notices

There is a help file that can be added to a help library.  You may put
it in either the system help library or a site-specific library:

	$ LIBRARY/HELP/INSERT SYS$HELP:HELPLIB NOTICE.HLP	!System help


ADDING NOTICES TO THE TEXT LIBRARY
----------------------------------
There are only two restrictions on the text of NOTICE messages:

  o  The TOPIC name *should* be no more than 10 characters.  The topic
     name cannot be truncated when users type NOTICE <topic>, so keeping
     it under 10 characters makes it easier to type the topics.

  o  The *first* line in the message is used as the brief description
     shown at login time and when NOTICE without qualifiers is executed.

A typical format might look like the following:

	-------------------------------------------------
	New NOTICE utility added to the system

	A new utility, NOTICE, has been added to the system to inform you of
	important system announcements.
	-------------------------------------------------

If  the file above was added as module NOTICE to the text library, the
NOTICE listing for it would look like:

	$ notice/new

	NOTICE topics.  Type NOTICE <topic-name> for more information.

	Topic      Date         Description
	---------  -----------  -----------
	NOTICE     22-APR-1992  New NOTICE utility added to the system

	$

When a user types NOTICE NOTICE (in this example), the screen would be
cleared and the following would be displayed:

	--------------------------------------------------
	Notice NOTICE, dated 23-APR-1992 19:01:23.34

	New NOTICE utility added to the system

	A new utility, NOTICE, has been added to the system to inform you of
	important system announcements.
	--------------------------------------------------



MANAGING THE NOTICE LIBRARY
---------------------------
The  command procedure NOTICE_MGR.COM can be used to manage the NOTICE
text library.  When executed, the following menu is displayed:

	$ @notice_mgr

	NOTICE library maintenance

	  1.  List the library contents
	  2.  Add/replace a module to/in the library
	  3.  Touch a module in the library (update date)
	  4.  Edit a module in the library
	  5.  Rename a module in the library
	  6.  Delete a module from the library
	  7.  Create a new library
	  0.  Exit

	Choice <0>: 

NOTICE_MGR  is  not  bullet-proof,  but  it does work.  Typically, you
would add a module using option 2.  You will be prompted for the  file
name to add (you will be placed in an editor if the named file doesn't
exist) and for the module name.  The module name is then used  as  the
<topic> name on the NOTICE command line.

Option  3,  "Touch a module," lets you update the insertion date for a
module so that users will see the module listed again  the  next  time
they  log  in.   A sample use for this option would be an announcement
added a week before an  event.   To  remind  users  again,  you  might
"touch"  the  module again the day of the event so that users will see
it again that day.

NOTICE_MGR is, I believe, pretty self-explanatory and easy to use.


SETTING UP "PERMANENT" NOTICES
------------------------------
If  you  would  like to ensure that a notice is displayed every time a
user is logged in (for very important  notices  like  operating  hours
during holidays), you simply add a dollar sign ($) to the beginning of
the name of the module.  For  example,  suppose  the  file  FINALS.TXT
contains  the  lab  hours  during  finals  week.  If you add it to the
library with a module name of  "$FINALS",  the  user  will  see  topic
"FINALS"  displayed  at every login until the module is deleted.  Note
that the user never sees the "$" in the topic name---only  the  NOTICE
administrator knows it's there.


CALLABLE NOTICE
---------------
If you have a program that you run as part of SYLOGIN, you can have it
call NOTICE_MAIN() in the .OBJ file NOTICE_SYLOGIN.  The effect is the
same  as  specifying  NOTICE/NEW  in  the SYLOGIN.COM, except that you
avoid another image activation.  NOTICE_MAIN() accepts two parameters,
both  flags  passed by value.  If the first parameter is omitted or 0,
the output is the same as NOTICE/NEW.  If the flag is one, the  effect
is  NOTICE/NEW/PAUSE.  The  second  parameter corresponds to the /TEXT
qualifier; its value can be 0 or 1.

Sample call:

	void notice_main(int);
	[...]
	notice_main(1,0);	!Show new NOTICEs, make user press RETURN


To link it, use a command like the following:

	$ link sylogin,notice_sylogin,notice/library

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The  only  known NOTICE limitations are imposed by the use of the text
library (for example, it would be nice to have  modules  automatically
expire at a certain time).  However, the big advantage of using a text
library is that the DCL LIBRARY command can  be  used  to  manage  the
NOTICE database; a new interface did not have to be written.

NOVIRUS, UTILITIES, Validates images using CRC32 checksum

VALIDATING VMS IMAGE FILES AT RUN-TIME BY CALCULATING A CRC32 CHECKSUM.
=======================================================================

About VMS virus protection:

I am working in a GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) environment and was bothered
with questions about VMS virus protection several times. I myself are not
worried at all but to be able to reply to the customers and regulatory 
inspectors I added a self-check mechanism to our self-developed images, both
on MS-DOS and VMS. It is easy to program. There are lots of public domain
examples for PC which are easy to port to VMS.

Directly after image activation, the program calculates a CRC32 checksum on the
image file, makes some site-specific changes to it and compares it with a
pre-calculated CRC32 in a separate key-file. If there is a difference, an 
operator request is made and the program halts. It is actually a waste of 
initial response time but serves as an early warning system for future virus 
attacks, media corruption, hacks etc. I now can prove that a program is in a
well-defined state and should execute just like the validated version.

This distribution is compiled with DEC C++ on a microVAX3100-95 running VMS 6.2 
on 21 february 1996. Any other C compiler will probably compile the code
correctly. All standard disclaimers apply. Use at your own risk.

Library CRCLIB.OBJ

Copyright (C) 1994 Maarten van Breemen
Released to the public domain 210795 MVB
Includes code by Gary S. Brown

This are routines to perform 32 bits Cyclic Redundancy Checks.
The selfcheck routine calculates a CRC and compares it with a pre-defined CRC
in an external key file. The selfcheck routine can be included in applications
where security demands are high. See CALCCRC and DEMOCRC for a demonstration.

The CRC is the well-known 32 bits CRC from telecommunications and is commonly
used by virus scanning software and data-integrity checks. The CRC is very
sensitive for data changes, even for changes in one bit.

CALCCRC is an utility to calculate the CRC checksum of an arbitrary file.
Its main goal here is to calculate the CRC value for inclusion in the external
key files and therefore should be kept in a safe place by the system manager
and/or trusted personell :-). It is advised to change the symbol 
APPLICATION_OFFSET in module CRCLIB.C to something which is at least 
site-specific. CALCCRC can also be used to calculate checksums for data files.

Define CALCCRC as a foreign command with @MSYM CALCCRC

$! MSYM.COM
$ 'p1 == "$''F$ENVIRONMENT("DEFAULT")'''p1'"

Syntax to define the CRC of the image filename.exe:

$ CALCCRC filename.exe

Enter the reported CRC value in a key file with name filename.crc.
Use an editor to create the key file.

CALCCRC and CRCLIB can be compiled for both MS-DOS and VMS. Because of the odd
VMS file formats and record attributes and its effect on the fgetc() runtime
function, the CRC value probably differs from CRC values calculated with other
packages but the value is always reproducable.

DEMOCRC contains VMS specific code but is easy to port to other operating
systems. If the CRC check fails, an OPCOM request is posted and the program
halts (loops).

ODS2, affinity, Read OpenVMS disk volumes on PC

ODS2 is a program to read OpenVMS disk volumes. While it will
run on OpenVMS it is generally useful only when reading VMS floppy
disks or CDs on a PC running Windows 95, Windows NT or OS/2.

Program functions include being able to mount, perform a directory,
search files, or copy files from an OpenVMS volume. Search and copy
functions are restricted to sequential file formats.

Included are compiled versions of the program for Alpha/VMS,
VAX/VMS and Intel/Windows (95 & NT).

This program includes full C source so that it can be adapted
for use on other operating systems as required. The source
also contains various VMS date routines which may be useful
in other programs.

There is no support for this program, but suggestions can be sent
to  paulnank@au1.ibm.com

PASLIB has been  developed  to  allow  Pascal  programmers  to take full
advantage of many Digital library and system routines which increase the
ease  of use, and scope of application of the language.  In  combination
with  the  Digital-supplied  programming  language  facilities  such  as
STARLET,  PASLIB  provides  the  Pascal  programmer with a comprehensive
environment for both application  and  systems programming.  It is usual
to  INHERIT environment files which contain the appropriate declarations
for the programming  environment  concerned.   The  files  available  in
STARLET are detailed in the HELP sub- topic entitled Source_Code.

Most  Run-Time  Library  and  Utility  routines  that  are  not  already
available  in  Digital-supplied software are declared in  PASLIB.   Some
routines have been omitted where the same functionality is available  in
intrinsic Pascal functions.  These intrinsic functions should be used in
preference to any equivalent RTL or Utility routines.

    lifetime, and, if set displays DISUSER flag.

PWDSET - username parameter required. Will prompt for new password
    which is not echoed. It then prompts for password verification,
    again not echoed. This procedure bypasses the history, dictionary,
    and length restrictions of AUTHORIZE. It is intended for use
    by system managers in unusual situations, and should not be made
    available globally. 

The provided images are VMS 7.1 and DecC 5.6 but there should be no

Password_Policy, System_Management, A Password Policy Module that more strickly controls passwords on the system.

This a VMS Password Policy Module to screen passwords before they are set.

This code will only work with VMS 5.4 or greater.

This module does not allow the password to be the following:

	The username and variations on such
	The account name from the UAF and variations on such.
	Variations of the owner field from the UAF
	Any word in a data file supplemental to the VMS provided dictionary.

To build and install this module, execute the command procedure
BUILD_PASSWORD_POLICY.COM.  Afterwards, make sure you add the following line:

	$ INSTALL ADD SYS$LIBRARY:VMS$PASSWORD_POLICY.EXE

to your SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM file.

An auxilary program is ADD_DICTIONARY which will allow you to add words
to the supplemental dictionary.  It will add words that are not already in
the VMS dictionary or the supplementary dictionary.

If you have a large number of words you would like to add to the supplemental 
dictionary, put them into a flat data file, one word to a line, ASSIGN the 
file to SYS$INPUT: and then run the ADD_DICTIONARY program.  It will read all 
the words from the file and add them, if needed to the supplemental 
dictionary.  The ADD_DICTIONARY program can also be run interactively.

(The supplement dictionary is used rather than adding words to the VMS 
provided dictionary to prevent those changes from being lost in future 
upgrades/updates of the operating system.)

OpenVMS PERL, Languages, Scripting Language

I. Summary:

    This is a port of PERL5 to VMS.  It contains all the information and files
that are required to build PERL5 on OpenVMS VAX and AXP systems.  The
readme.vms file in the [.perl5_000] directory that is unpacked explains how to
start building the tool.  It also provides pointers to the people who are
actively porting PERL5 to VMS, and you can get on their distribution list if
you desire.  The zip file also contains the freeware license statement as it
applies to Perl5.

II. Unpacking Perl once it is on your VMS system:

        1. Perl comes in a ZIP file.  Define a foreign symbol to
           point to your ZIP executable.

                uzip :== $ TOOLS$:[ZIP]vmsunzip.exe;


        2. Simply use the following command to unpack the zip file,
        
                $ uzip -x your_zip_file.zip

        3. TROUBLE SHOOTING the ZIP file

                a. Sometimes the unzip image that we have for VMS
                   will not understand a file format (or something).
                   The UNZIP simply stops with an error.  If this happens
                   with the freeware ZIP image, the following steps
                   will help you recover.
                   

                b. Note the last file 'Inflated', it was successful.
                   Now get a directory of the files using

                        uzip -v zip_file.zip

                c. Look for the filename of the last file that was 
                   successfully unpacked before the uzip failed.

                d. Now look at the very next file(s) in the listing
                   and manually uzip the next file (or several following files)
                   then retry the next command.

                e. Now you should be able to run uzip as follows:

                        uzip -xn your_zip_file.zip

                f. This will unpack your zip file and not overwrite
                   existing files.  Since you unpacked the problem
                   files, unzip should progress to the end of the file.
                   If not, manually unpack the next file after the last
                   successful file and try this command again.

                f1. Don't ask me why, but this even fails sometimes no matter
                    how many files you correctly unpack!  This sequence 
                    eventually got the whole thing unpacked after numerous 
                    errors.

                        uzip -u the_zip file
                        uzip -o the_zip_file
                        uzip -xno the_zip_file

                    Now, the -o produces a command line warning that it can not
                    be specified with  -n, BUT BUT BUT, the whole thing unpacked
                    without output statements.  I couldn't believe it!  Must be
                    a weird zip image that I have used.

                    Note that the zip image that I used may be old or buggy 
                    and if you simply make enough contortions when calling the
                    program to unzip your file, it will hiccup the right 
                    behavior. See the bizarre sequence above as example of a 
                    contortion!  Oh well...

                g. This is how to get through an unzip that has errors.
                   We probably need a later version of unzip that can 
                   read these newer file types and data, or one that is
                   compatible with the ZIP program used by the Perl folks.

PINE, UTILITIES, Electronic Mail Utility


                         PINE Electronic Mail

BACKGROUND

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs on Unix and MS-DOS.

The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes. It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  Feedback from the University of Washington community and a
growing number of Internet sites has been encouraging. 
  
Pine's message composition editor, Pico, is also available as a separate
stand-alone program.  Pico is a very simple and easy-to-use text editor
offering paragraph justification, cut/paste, and a spelling checker. 

FEATURES

   - Online help specific to each screen and context.

   - Message index showing a message summary which includes the status, 
     sender, size, date and subject of messages.
 
   - Commands to view and process messages:  Forward, Reply, Save, 
     Export, Print, Delete, capture address, and search.

   - Message composer with easy-to-use editor and spelling checker.
     The message composer also assists entering and formatting
     addresses and provides direct access to the address book.

   - Address book for saving long complex addresses and personal 
     distribution lists under a nickname. 

   - Message attachments via the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
     (MIME) specification.  MIME allows sending/receiving non-text 
     objects, such as binary files, spreadsheets, graphics, and sound.

   - Folder management commands for creating, deleting, listing, or
     renaming message folders.  Folders may be local or on remote hosts.

   - Access to remote message folders and archives via the Interactive
     Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) as defined in RFC-1176 and revisions. 

   - Access to Internet bulletin boards (Usenet network news) via NNTP 
     or IMAP.  (Additional news features, including posting, coming soon.)

AVAILABILITY

Pine, Pico, and UW's IMAP server are copyrighted, but freely available. The
latest versions, including source code, can be found on the Internet host
"ftp.cac.washington.edu" in the file "mail/pine.tar.Z" (accessible via
anonymous FTP and IMAP).  From the Internet, you may also try out Pine and
leave comments by telneting to "demo.cac.washington.edu" and logging in as
"pinedemo".  To join the discussion or announcement list, send mail to: 
       pine-info-request@cac.washington.edu
  or   pine-announce-request@cac.washington.edu

Unix Pine runs on a variety of systems including Ultrix, AIX, SunOS,
SVR4, and PTX.  PC-Pine is available for Packet Driver, Novell LWP, FTP
PC/TCP, and Sun PC/NFS.  A Windows/WinSock version is planned, as are
extensions for offline use. 

For further information, send e-mail to pine@cac.washington.edu.  Pine
was originally based on Elm, but it has evolved much since... ("Pine Is
No-longer Elm").  Pine is the work of Mike Seibel, Mark Crispin, Steve
Hubert, Sheryl Erez, David Miller and Laurence Lundblade* at the
University of Washington Office of Computing and Communications.  Pine is
a trademark of the University of Washington.  (* Now at Virginia Tech.)

PMX, MISCELLANEOUS, Pre-Processor for MusixTeX score macros

        ***  PMX - 1.3.7 (Unix/C version)  ***

This is the Unix/C version of PMX-1.3.7 . It was generated from the
fortran source code with Netlib's F2C. This package includes the special
library routines required to compile the resulting C source.
(please read the file "permission" in the present directory, which
lists conditions for the use of Netlib's library code)
Most of the original PMX distribution is contained in the pmx-orig/
subdirectory. Be sure to read the PMX manual there (pmx134.ps). It is
probably useful to print the quick reference card (ref134.ps).

  System Requirements
  ===================


* any current mainstream Unix flavour
* standard C compiler (as always, GCC is the safest bet)
* TeX/LaTeX (a recent version, as required by musixtex)
* MusiXTeX T.86 or newer

PMX 1.3.7 for OpenVMS                                        May 1998
=====================

You can install PMX 1.3.7 on OpenVMS providong TeX (DECUS distribution) and
MusiXTeX packages are already installed. Set up your privileges to be able to
write into TEX_ROOT directory tree and invoque:

$ @INSTALL_VMS

The DECus TeX and MetaFont distribution is available on the OpenVMS Freeware
CDROM V 3.0 (size about 90 Mo).

To run PMX, you can use PMX.COM script (there are 2 passes of PMX and 3 passes
of MusiXTeX needed).

Enjoy !!

PNG081, GRAPHICS, PNG V 0.81 and ZLIB v 0.95 libraries

readme.txt - for libpng 0.8

This is the second beta version of libpng 1.0.  I've updated most
of the stuff I want to before the final 1.0 version.  Remaining
to do are the medium memory model support (which I'll put in
as soon as we test this version), better dithering, and any bug
fixes and makefile/include additions.  I expect a third (and
perhaps final) beta after zlib is officially 1.0.

===================================================================

zlib 0.95 is a beta version of a general purpose compression library.
This should be the last version before the first official
version (1.0), so please test it now. (At least compile and run it with
"make test"). This version has no known bugs.

The data format used by the zlib library is described in the
files zlib-3.1.doc, deflate-1.1.doc and gzip-4.1.doc, available
in ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/doc.

GNU for POSIX, utilities, GNU tools for POSIX for OpenVMS

		    GNU tools for POSIX for OpenVMS
		    ===============================

This directory contains the following GNU utilities, each configured
for POSIX for OpenVMS:

	Utility		    File
	-------		    ----
	flex		    posix_flex.tar
	gawk		    posix_gawk.tar
	gmake		    posix_gmake.tar
	gzip		    posix_gzip.tar


For each utility, the tar file should be unpacked within a POSIX container 
filesystem using the command,

psx> tar -xvf posix_gmake.tar

This will create a directory hierarchy under a directory called

POSIX_gmake-3.72.1

Since several of the files do not conform to VMS naming ocnventions (too
many dots) and the lack of these files rpevents the kit from building,
this kit _must_ be unpacked within a container.

To build the executable you should run make within this directory. 
For example,

psx> cd gmake-3.72.1
psx> make

You may see make or compiler warning and informational messages, but I
believe these are benign.

NB ** Do not run configure. **  

These kits have been pre-configured for POSIX for OpenVMS.  This is because 
the configure script gets confused by differences in behaviour between what 
GNU expects and what POSIX provides.  The script will incorrectly guess
what functions/facilities/headers POSIX provides, and set up the kit in
such a way that it will not build.

If you have run configure, the best way forward is to delete the kit and 
untar it again.

POSTMAN, UTILITIES, Uses PMDF's DELIVER to setup vacation forwards & filters

Postman
-------

The Postman utility allows you to manage incoming electronic mail.
You can establish, change or remove:

  - a vacation message;
  - multiple forwarding addresses;
  - multiple filters to discard messages based on "From" and "Subject" lines.

         ***   The Postman utility uses PMDF's DELIVER system.   ***
         *** If you wish to control the use of DELIVER yourself, ***
         ***          you should NOT use this utility.           ***

A vacation message can be used to automatically notify a person who has
sent you mail that you are on vacation, or simply to indicate to the
sender that you have received the mail.

Forwarding allows you to send a copy of a message to another person.
You may establish as many forwarding addresses as you wish - each one
will receive a copy of the message.

Filtering allows you to discard incoming messages as if they had never been
received.  You choose to filter based on "From" and/or "Subject" lines in
the messages.

PP v3.0, LANGUAGES, Pascal Pre-processor (or Pretty Pascal)

PP - the Pascal Pre-processor (or "Pretty Pascal")

PP takes a  DEC  Pascal  source  file  and  performs  a  number  of text
standardization tasks on it.

PP identifies four different types of symbols (or "tokens"):

   - tokens that are identified as "Pascal reserved words";
       (these are specified in a vocabulary file)
   - tokens that contain a dollar sign ($);
   - tokens that are considered as user-declared identifiers;
   - all characters not included above.

Three contexts are identified:
   - in a comment;
   - in a quoted string;
   - not in either a comment nor a quoted string.

Tokens are only identified when they do not occur in a comment nor
a quoted string.

The Pascal Pre-processor is capable of performing the following tasks:

   - each of the token types (reserved symbol, identifier and dollar
     symbol) can be converted to one of the following lexical styles:
           . all letters uppercased;
           . all letters lowercased;
           . no change from current style;
           . the first letter and each first letter following an
             underscore or dollar sign are uppercased, all other
             letters are lowercased.
   - lines which have white noise beyond the last significant
     character of a line are unequivocally truncated to the
     last significant character;
   - lines may be re-formatted as necessary to maximize the use
     of TAB characters to eliminate SPACES where possible;
   - lines which are longer than the working screen-width (either
     80 or 132 characters) are identified;

  Progress of the processing can be watched with Control-W.

To install PP:

  1. Re-link PP (NO Traceback) as directed in the build procedure.
  2. Define EXECUTIVE mode SYSTEM table logical name as required (see help).
  3. Define a foreign command: $ PP :== $device:[directory]PP
  4. Pretty Pascal!

The author of PP is

    Jonathan Ridler,
    Information Technology Services,
    The University of Melbourne,
    Parkville, Victoria, AUSTRALIA, 3052.

    Email: jonathan@unimelb.edu.au

PP is written entirely in DEC  Pascal  and  has been built and tested on
OpenVMS  VAX v6.2 (DEC Pascal v5.4) and OpenVMS Alpha v6.2 and v7.1 (DEC
Pascal v5.5).

Suggestions, comments, criticisms, bug reports, bug fixes ... all welcome.

The current version of PP is v3.0 (13-Aug-1998).

PRODUSE010, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Product Usage by Imagename and Username 

Digital and third party vendors are providing many new licensing options in
addition to the standard full use system license. When building a new system,
it is quite easy to determine if system-wide, concurrent-use or user licenses
make the most sense. When upgrading an existing system, the decision is much
more difficult because the actual usage of products with system-wide licenses
is seldom known. This tool uses data collected by DECps or VPA to build an
array of Imagenames and Usernames run on different Cluster nodes over the time
specified (one month is the minimum suggested interval). The report produced
lists all images run on the systems sorted by product name (if known) and
imagename with the maximum number of concurrent users and the number of
different usernames running the product on each node. The /user=username
qualifier produces a report showing all images run by a single user and the
/image=imagename qualifier produces a report showing all users of an image.
The ability to save the array to avoid many interations of data collection is
provided (sorting through a months worth of DECps data for many nodes can take
a long time). User editable files of products to imagenames are provided.

This tool requires that either DECps or VPA are installed and running on the
system. 

This product is VMSINSTAL-able. See the Postscript User Guide for details.

PS-To-Text, Utilities, Convert Postscript documents to plain ASCII text
Greetings,

Here's a PS to Text filter that works pretty well.  It is pretty
simple, as it does not interpret PS, but merely parses it based on previous
knowledge about the relevant PS operators.  

This program is not currently a part of any product.  Enjoy.

David


------------------------------------------------------------
Features:

- filters PS text back into text
- keeps page, paragraph and line breaks
- traps kerning in some PS implementations
- can handle included PS files, provided the file is by a supported 
	creator
- supports following PS creators:
  + VAX Document (Latin, and Japanese)
  + DECwrite (Latin, and Japanese)
  + dtroff
  + troff
  + Rags
- creators are registered in a run-time accessed dat file
  + it has not been too difficult to add new creators
- runs on U*x and VMS and Dos 


Usage:
- on VMS, copy executable, to any directory
  + invoke with a symbol
  + Make sure that dat file resides in your top-level directory
- on U*X, compile and link.  Please call the executable 'ps2text'
  + place dat file in top level shell
  + invoke by typing 'ps2text'
- on DOS, copy the executable ps2text.dos
- the first parameter is the input file
- the second parameter is the output file.  If missing, output goes to the
  terminal
- a modicum of help is available via -h or '?'


Notes:
- some error messages, but not ideal
- code is pretty thoroughly commented
- no Mac PS yet.  Feel free to try and get it working and send it to me
- more graphics creators are needed
- Please feel free to send flame-free comments and criticisms, bug fixes,
  new creators, and whatnot to VAXUUM::PARMENTER.  This is the first U*X work
  I've ever done, so I'm especially interested in that side of things.
- Output is usually quite wide.  It typically looks better with your terminal
  set to 132 width mode
- Code has no global variables.  If you decide to extend it, please do so
  without introducing any global variables


The posting contains:
- ps2text.c: the main converter
- psdat.c: reads the dat file
- ps2text.dat: dat file of registered PS creators
- ps2text.h: include file for the 'c' source files
- ps2text.exe: VMS executable
- ps2text.opt: VMS options file

To build:
- cc ps2text, psdat
- link ps2text/opt

To run:
- copy pstext.dat into your home directory
- define logical: $ps2text to the directory containing ps2text.dat
- define symbol:  ps2text :== $disk:[directory]ps2text.exe
- ps2text foo.ps [output file] ! output file is optional


All files are located in 
  via::$user3:[parmenter.public.ps]

Enjoy,

         This program is designed to be installed with SYSPRV and controlled
         via an ACL to allow non-privileged users to change the password of
         certain accounts. I recommend creating a HELPDESK identifier
         and assigning it to HELPDESK personnel.

         The user is prompted for a username and then presented with the
         last LOGIN and PASSWORD CHANGE date.  The caller should be asked these
         questions.  If they are answered correctly, the password can be
         changed.  If not, the account can be disabled.

         This program uses the SYS$SETUAI service to change the password
         and set any relevant flags, but due to a "feature" of LOGINOUT,
         it has to modify the UAF file directly to pre-expire the account.
         (LOGINOUT doesn't look at the PWD_EXPIRED bit to determine if it
         should prompt for a new user)

         There will be no auditing on the password expiration call, but the
         call to SYS$SETUAI will provide an audit record.
         
 	 If you end up using this program, please drop a note to me at
         the above addresses so I know makes use of this stuff!

QI, NETWORKING, VMS CCSO Nameserver version 3.09

The CCSO Nameserver is a computer resident "phone book".  It can
keep a relatively small amount of information about a relatively
large number of people or things, and provide fast access to that
information over the Internet.

Unlike a printed directory, the information in the CCSO Nameserver
is dynamic.  It can be updated at any time, from any computer on the
Internet capable of running "client" programs such as ph, Gopher or
a number of web clients and gateways.  The Nameserver can also be
taught to keep new types of information, such as electronic mail
addresses or office hours, without recompilation or change to the
existing database.

VMS qi is a native RMS-based implementation of the protocol
described in the CCSO documents from UIUC.  Both the original
documents and the VMS differences are included in this kit.

RAID Evaluator, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, StorageWorks(TM) RAID Evaluator program

This directory contains a copy of the StorageWorks(TM) 
RAID Evaluator program, Version 1.9.  V1.9 is an experimental 
version of the program. It contains new features, but has not been 
thoroughly tested. It is being released primarily for fall, 1993 
DECUS attendees, although it may be made available to others.

----------------------------
New Features Of Version V1.9
----------------------------

1. Each child window now contains a "Print" button which enables 
printing of its contents to a laser printer. This feature has been 
tested with the Apple LaserWriter Plus, the Digital LN03R, and 
the Digital LPS20 and LPS40 laser printers. Whether it works properly 
with other laser printers is not known. The File menu contains a 
"Printer Setup..." command to provide printer setup local to the 
RAID Evaluator program.

2. Data about Digital's latest disk and controller products has been 
added to the built-in disk and controller types in the RAID Evaluator 
program. This enables you to construct hypothetical configurations 
using these products. Cautions: like previous RAID Evaluator versions, 
this one does not restrict modeled configurations to valid ones. 
Moreover, the variable maximum data transfer rates of the newer 
'banded' disk drives have been approximated by averages. 

*********************************************************************

			Most Important:

The RAID Evaluator model is based on disk mechanical characteristics.
It DOES NOT MODEL cache. This is especially important to note in the
case of cached controllers (HSC70, HSC9x, HSJ40), where performance
can be seriously understated. This will be fixed in a future release
of the model.

*********************************************************************

3. A new "Parameters" menu has been added to the RAID Evaluator menu 
bar. This menu has two commands, "Controllers..." and "Disks...". 
These allow you to add user-defined controller and disk types 
respectively. User-defined controller and disk types do not become 
available until the session following the one in which they are added. 
The "Parameters" menu applies only to user-defined controller and 
disk types. It is not possible to alter the parameters of the 
built-in disks and controllers. Approximately 20 User-defined 
controller types and 40 User-defined disk types may be added. 
The program is supplied with two hypothetical controller types called 
"UserControllerA" and "UserControllerB" and six disk types called 
"UserDisk1A" through "UserDisk3B" to give you an idea of how to use
the user-specified controller and disk types. 

-------------------------------------------------
General Description of the RAID Evaluator Program
-------------------------------------------------

The RAID Evaluator is a simple application for the Microsoft(TM) 
Windows V3.1 or later environment that can help you understand the 
tradeoffs among various RAID configurations and appreciate the 
performance, data reliability, and cost characteristics of various 
RAID alternatives using your own I/O workload and hardware 
configuration definitions.

-------------------------
Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install and use the RAID Evaluator program, do the following:

1. Create a directory on your PC hard drive, for example:

   C:\RAIDEVAL\

2. Copy the following files from the distribution diskette to 
the directory:

    QREV19WN.EXE    -- program image (windows version)
    RAIDEVAL.INI    -- file of drive/controller parameters
    *.WLD           -- sample workload files (This is optional)
    QRE_HELP.HLP    -- help file

3. Use any of the standard Windows mechanisms for running the 
program. If you make a Windows association between file type .WLD 
and QREV19WN.EXE, the RAID Evaluator will start executing and 
automatically open any .WLD file that you double-click from 
File Manager.

4. When the RAID Evaluator starts executing, you first see a 
panel in its main window that describes the limits of its modeling 
capability. Be sure you read this panel to understand the program's 
capabilities and limitations.

5. When you have read the introductory panel, use the <ENTER> key 
or double-click the <OK> button to start. You may either enter 
your own workload data into the input dialog panel that appears, 
or you may use the <FILE> menu to open an existing .WLD file. 
A single .WLD file generally contains several workloads. The
names of the available workloads can be listed at any time by 
pulling down the Workload Name list box in the input dialog panel.

6. At any time, you may press the F1 key for help. When you do this, 
the cursor changes to the words "QRE HELP" with an upward left 
pointing arrow. If you move the cursor to the RAID Evaluator window 
object you want help on (the cursor will change back to a text 
cursor or arrow) and click, you will get a help panel describing 
the object you have clicked. This works with menu commands as well. 
After each invocation of HELP, RAID Evaluator program returns to 
normal mode.

Note: I have encountered problems with the HELP cursor not 
appearing on some monitor/video board combinations. The circumvention 
seems to be to minimize the RAID Evaluator main window and then 
restore it. The next time you press "F1", the HELP cursor should appear.

You may also use the Index command on the Help menu to invoke the 
Help utility for browsing, or Search to go directly to the help search 
list. The updating of Help to include the new features is not complete.
What is there is generally valid, but you may encounter some missing
context-sensitive help items.

RAMDISK, Storage_Management, Fast RAMDISK driver for OpenVMS VAX

								March 1993

Here's yet another new version of the RAMDISK driver I wrote lo these
many moons ago.  This version fixes a few bugs, and adds some enhancements.

The most important bug fix has to do with mount verification support for
VMS V5.5:  DEC changed the way this behaved, with some consequences for
RAMDRIVER.  The basic difference is that the mount verify code will place
IO$_PACKACK (among other things) IRPs directly onto the RAMDRIVER's I/O
queue, which is not what it expected to find there.  The result was often
a system crash.  This has been fixed.  (Cluster transitions will put disks
into mount verify these days, including ramdisks.).

The most important new feature is that the RAMDRIVER no longer uses non-paged
pool for its disk "blocks"  - it swipes pages off of the free page list and
maps them into system address space.  The nice thing about this scheme is that
you can give the pages back to the system as something besides non-paged pool
when you're done using the RAMDRVIER.

MSCP support is included in this version, though why anyone would find it
useful mystifies me.  The biggest problem with MSCP support turns out to be
brain damage in the MSCP server -- it doesn't bother to set IRP$V_FUNC in
IRP$W_FLAGS for read requests (like everything else does) -- and we were
dispatching based on this flag.  Also bear in mind that while access to
the RAMDISK on a local machine can be multi-threaded, access via the MSCP
server is single threaded.  Most of the performance advantage gained by
not having any rotational latency is negated by the number of data copies
that go on when using MSCP to access a remote ramdisk.  Note that the device
name for the RAMDISK must be RDA0 if you intend to use it via MSCP.

Before anyone asks, I have no idea if you can bind two of them into a shadow
set or into a stripe set :-)

The original text file that came with the 1988 version of this is called
ORIGINAL-RAMD-BLURB.TXT.  The previous new blurb file (which came with the
last version) is called OLD-RAMD-BLURB.TXT.

Included once again is a MAKE.COM, which will build everything, and an INITVD
program to initialize the RAMDISK.  You still need lots of spare SPTREQ to use
this.  If you attempt to initialize a RAMDISK and win an %SYSTEM-F-INSFSPTS,
then you need to raise the SYSGEN parameter SPTREQ and reboot.

To short circuit the inevitable deluge of questions about how to use it, build
the driver (use $ @MAKE), and then use SYSGEN from an account with CMKRNL to
load it:

$ Run SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN
SYSGEN> LOAD disk:[dir]RAMDRIVER
SYSGEN> CONNECT RDA0/NOADAPTER/DRIVER=RAMDRIVER
SYSGEN> EXIT
$

Then use INITVD to expand the size of the disk to the desired number of blocks
(you must have sufficient free memory on your system to support the size of the
disk you want):

$ Run INITVD
Init-VD> RDA0 size
$

Then, initialize, mount, and use it in the standard way:

$ Initialize RDA0 FOOBAR
$ Mount/System RDA0 FOOBAR
$ Create/Directory RDA0:[TMP]

etc.

No, the contents of the RAMDISK are not saved across system boots (yes, people
asked me this question :-).

RAMDRIVER is still a spare-time project.  I am grateful to TGV, Inc (my new
employer) for their tolerance of my fixing RAMDRIVER, and to Ehud Gavron
(gavron@aces.com) for testing it thoroughly and several helpful suggestions.

This version is for VAX only;  the next spare-time project is an Alpha version.

This is still UNSUPPORTED code.  Use it at your own risk.  Enhancements and bug
fixes welcome;  I'll deal with bug reports as spare time allows.

Please  *DON'T*  send bug reports or questions about RAMDRIVER to service@tgv.com;
this is not a TGV product, and is not supported by TGV.

RTN ANALYZER, UTILITIES, Routine call analyzer for C and BLISS source code 

The Routine Analyzer parses C and BLISS source code to identify routine
definitions and calls. It compiles basic statistics and call trees from this
information and generates SDML or HTML output for presentation. It also
generates annotated source code with line numbers and indices of defined
routines. The SDML format is suitable for development/support documentation.
The HTML format is heavily linked to provide rapid navigation between source
modules, routines, and cross-reference information.

The files USERS_GUIDE.TXT and USERS_GUIDE.HTML contain plain text and HTML
versions of the user's guide, respectively. The guide explains the purpose of
the analyzer and provides instructions on how to use it. The [.SRC] directory
contains complete source. The [.EXAMPLE] directory contains an example HTML
output of the analyzer run over its own source code; the file
[.EXAMPLE]RANALYZER_FILES.HTML is the "home page" for the example.

The Routine Analyzer was written by Steve Branam, Digital Equipment
Corporation.

RCARD, UTILITIES, Read Cardfiler cards on VT terminal

RCARD V1.4 - Read DECwindows/Motif Cardfiler card files
PCARD V1.0 - Print DECwindows/Motify Cardfiler card files

Copyright © 1998, Hunter Goatley.  All rights reserved.

RCARD is a program that will read a DECwindows CardFiler card file and
display it on non-DECwindows terminals using the SMG$ routines.  It works
with the files produced by DECwindows v5.4 and Motif v1.x (yes, the files
are different).

RCARD can be compiled with either VAX C or DEC C.  MMS or MMK should
be used to built it.

To use it, just define a symbol and give the name of the card file:

	$ rcard :== $dev:[dir]rcard.exe
	$ rcard phone			!Defaults to SYS$DISK:[].CARD

Once the file has been read into memory, a window will appear containing a
menu of card subjects.  You can scroll through the menu using up-arrow,
down-arrow, NextScreen, and PrevScreen.  When the cursor is positioned
on the subject for the card you want to see, press RETURN.  A new window
will pop up containing the text of the card.

You can scroll through the card's contents and press either "Q" or ^Z to
exit the card and go back to the subject menu.  You can also press "N" or
"P" to move to the next or previous card, respectively without closing the
card window.

CTRL-W repaints the screen.

Please note the following limitations:

  o  The file format was based on observation only; I didn't have access to
     the DECW$CARDFILER sources.  RCARD could break in the future.
  o  Card files containing DDIF images *cannot* be viewed using RCARD.  I
     never could figure out how the images were stored so that RCARD could
     skip over them.  Instead, the program bombs with a horrible access
     violation and stack dump.  So much for error checking.
  o  Card files cannot be created or modified by RCARD (the "R" stands for
     "read").  Since I couldn't identify all of the information in the
     files, I didn't want to claim to be able to write them.
  o  Really large files could crash the program.  The entire file is read
     into memory, so it is limited by whatever process limits are in
     effect.

I wrote the program because I was using the DECwindows CardFiler while at
work and didn't have any easy way to look at the information while I was
dialed in from home.  The program isn't very robust; I never store images
in the files, so it works well for me.

---------------
PCARD reads DECwindows/Motif Cardfiler card files and generates a TeX
output file that will produce two-column output showing the contents of
each card.  The TeX source file NEWSLETTER.TEX is required.

	$ pcard :== $dev:[dir]pcard.exe
	$ pcard phone		!Creates PHONE.TEX
	$ tex "\input newsletter   \input phone"

REVE, GAMES, An othello game under MOTIF


         Reve is a version of the popular Othello game.  It  contains
         graphical  interfaces for SunView, X11 and XView, as well as
         being able to function on normal display terminals  using  a
         termcap interface.

         Reve is played on an 8 x 8 board, with stones  which  should
         be  considered  to  be  black  on  one side and white on the
         other. A legal move consists of placing a stone of one's own
         color  on  the  board  so  as to "sandwich" one or more rows
         (orthogonal or diagonal) of stones  of  the  opposite  color
         between  the stone just placed and another stone of the same
         color. All stones so sandwiched are flipped over  to  reveal
         the color of the other side (your own color).

         The object of the game, is to  have  more  stones  than  the
         opponent  at the end of the game (ie. when the board is full
         or neither side has a legal move).  If  you  have  no  legal
         move, you simply miss a turn.  Black goes first.

         With reve, to place one of your own stones simply click with
         the  mouse  over  the square in which you want your stone to
         go. Note that it is also possible to supply a number  and  a
         letter pair, to indicate where you would like your new stone
         to go. This is the only method to place stones with the dumb
         tty  interface.  The square containing the last move will be
         shown with a black outline. This is updated  with  each  new
         move.  If  you hold the mouse button down as you move around
         the board,  the  square  you  are  currently  over  will  be
         highlighted.

         There are various buttons, choice, toggles and cyclic selec-
         tions  available.   Their  meanings are given below, plus an
         indication of their keyboard equivalents.  With  the  cyclic
         selections,  clicking  over  the left half of the cycle item
         increments the selection, and clicking over the  right  half
         of  the  cycle item decrements the selection. Control-l is a
         keyboard accelerator for redrawing the reve windows.

         By default, a human will play black, and the  computer  will
         play  white.  If  you  want a human vs human startup or some
         other combination, then you should use the appropriate  com-
         mand line options.

RMS_JRNL_SNAP, UTILITIES, RMS After-Image Journal Snapshot Utility

The RMS_JOURNAL_SNAP utility allows RMS after-image journal files to
be copied and truncated in place with concurrent online access. This
utility allows non-stop application operation where it might otherwise
be unavailable due to having to create new RMS after-image journal
files on a periodic basis.

When using RMS after-image journaling, it is necessary to disconnect
all accessories from any journaled file in order to create a new
journal stream file. This operation may be periodically required as
the after-image journal file grows. For some operations, the downtime
required to create a new after-image journal file prevents non-stop
(24x7) operations that might otherwise be desired.

The RMS_JOURNAL_SNAP utility can be used to snapshot (copy and rewind;
spool) an RMS after-image journal file of a single file.  Snapshots of
a journal file that is used to journal changes in multiple files is
not supported by the RMS_JOURNAL_SNAP utility.  The journal file can be
copied and truncated while it is open and being actively accessed. 
The RMS_JOURNAL_SNAP utility is intended to allow nonstop access to
RMS files that have after-image journaling enabled.

RMS_STATS, UTILITIES, Display RMS file access statistics and more RMS tools

	The main tool in this collection is RMS_STATS.
	This tool provides an alternative to MONITOR RMS for files
	that are marked for RMS statistics ($SET FILE/STAT ... )
	It displays raw numbers versus Monitor's rates/second.
	As such it can be a more accurate tool for transient usage.
	The information presented is comparable with the ANALYZE/SYSTEM 
	output from SHOW PROC/RMS=FSB (VMS V6.1). This program 
	requires CMEXEC and target file access privileges to work. 

	Options are a repeat time, absolute or incremental numbers,
	list of files, and selected output formatting. The 'summary'
	output format line shows the number of IOs per Operation which
	is believed to be a handy indicator of file tuning effects.

	Other tools in the collection:

	    SIDR.C
		Program to print indexed file alternate key statistics.
		Mainly intended as a tool to understand excessive $PUT

ROCKS-DIAMONDS, GAMES, X11 game (like Boulderdash)

   R O C K S   ' N '   D I A M O N D S
   -----------------------------------

A game for Unix/X11 by Holger Schemel, (c) 1995 by Holger Schemel.

Introduction
============
This is a nice little game with color graphics and sound for your
Unix system with color X11. You need an 8-Bit color display or better.
It is not recommended on black&white systems, and maybe not on gray
scale systems.

If you know the game "Boulderdash" (Commodore C64) or "Emerald Mine"
(Amiga), you know what "ROCKS'N'DIAMONDS" is about.

Rocks'n'Diamonds V 0.9B port under OpenVMS                 December 1997
==========================================-

Installation:
------------

ROCKS_N_DIAMOND rooted logical is needed. You can define it onto the
distribution running SETUP_VMS procedure (which also defines the DCL symbol
rocksn to run the game).

$ @SETUP_VMS

To install on a system-wide basis, you need to:

1) copy [.LEVELS...], [.GRAPHICS] and [.SOUNDS] directories to another location
2) define ROCKS_N_DIR rooted logical in Systartup_vms.com procedure:
   $ define/sys/trans=conc rocks_n_dir disk:[location.]
3) copy rocks_n_diamond executable to this location
   $ copy rocks_n_diamonds.exe(_vax) rocks_n_dir:rocks_n_diamonds.exe
4) redefine rocksn symbol in the sylogin.com procedure:
   $ rocksn*diamonds :== $rocks_n_dir:rocks_n_diamonds.exe

Rebuild:
-------
You can rebuild using COMPILE_DECC.COM procedure to compile with DEC C 5.0 or
higher (tested for 5.0 and 5.2) and LINK_DECC.COM (for VAX)/LINK_AXP.COM (for
Alpha) to relink. Object files are provided into ALPHA_OBJS.ZIP and
VAX_OBJS.ZIP files. XPM libraries are also provided for VAX & Alpha.

Exes:
----
Executables provided were built under VAX/VMS 6.1 and Alpha/VMS 6.2

WARNING (VAX VMS):
-----------------
The VAX/VMS X server doesn't like very much rocks'n'diamonds : fatal loop ...
You need to display on another system ...

Porting notes:
-------------
It was necessary to rename "Joystick" function to "Thejoystick" to avoid
collision with the "joystick" variable.

The sound driver is not ported (the sound samples provided are low quality 8khz
8 bit samples and if you have a fast enough Alpha you'd better play  Hifi
music during the game via decsound, timidity or mpeg3play ...).

No joystick support. You can use the keyboard arrows instead.

Enjoy !!

ROSEGARDEN, MISCELLANEOUS, Musical Notation Editor and Midi Sequencer

Rosegarden 2.1
==============

This is the Rosegarden Editor and Sequencer suite, release 2.1.

See COPYRIGHT for information about copyrights, and COPYING for
information about redistribution and (the lack of) warranty.

See INSTALL for details of how to install this distribution.

Chris Cannam, cannam@zands.com        October 1997

Rosegarden V 2.1 port under OpenVMS                       January 1998
===================================

Rosegarden provides a Musical Notation Editor and a Midi Sequencer on various
Unixes and now on VMS systems !!

Usage:
------
Rosegarden is composed of 3 executables, Rosegarden.exe (also called the
Topbox), Editor.exe and Sequencer.exe . Rosegarden.exe lets you execute the
Musical Notation Editor, the Sequencer and access to the Help system.

The kit contains binaries for VAX and Alpha, built under VAX VMS 6.1 and Alpha
VMS 6.2

You need to copy ROSEGARDEN.DAT ressource file under your SYS$LOGIN directory
or under SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] directory.

On VAX, you need to rename *.EXE_VAX files into *.EXE

Now, run SETUP_VMS.COM procedure to define logicals and the rosegarden symbol.

You invoke Rosegarden by:

$ rosegarden

You can also run the Editor and the Sequencer as stand-alone programs using
roseditor and rosesequencer command. However, the help system is only
available through rosegarden "topbox" application.

The Sequencer can be used as an X11 interface for Timidity, the nice Midi
player you must use on VMS. Timidity for VMS can be found at my site (and its
mirrors) at urls:

 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/timidity-02i.zip

You also need instrument samples (also called patches):

 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/timidity_base_samples.zip

 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/timidity_instruments_samples.zip
 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/timidity_drums_samples.zip
 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/timidity_wow_samples.zip
 http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/timidity_new_samples.zip

Unzip the patches archives in the same order. The best configurations files
(using selected and tested patches from the sets) are in the last one. The
total size of patches is about 15 Mo (the price to pay for a good quality midi
software only player) but the result is really nice.

Rebuild:
-------
You need an X11R5 XAW and XMU library. You can find it at my site and its
mirrors at urls:

  http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows/x11r5_xaw_xmu.zip
  ftp://ftp2.cnam.fr/decwindows/x11r5_xaw_xmu.zip
  ftp://ftp.wku.edu/vms/decwindows/x11r5_xaw_xmu.zip

The definition of X11R5 logical names is done into MAKE_*.COM files. You must
customize accordingly to your own installation. By default, I invoke
[X11R5]LOGICALS.COM procedure

To rebuild on VAX, you type:

$ @setup_vms
$ @make_vax

To rebuild on Alpha, you type:

$ @setup_vms
$ @make_alpha

At the end of the build, the 3 executables EDITOR.EXE, SEQUENCER.EXE and
TOPBOX.EXE are moved to [.BIN] directory

If you just want to relink, you'll find LINK_AXP.COM (for Alpha) and
LINK_DECC.COM (for VAX) procedures into [.EDITOR.SRC], [.SEQUENCER.SRC] and
[.TOPBOX.SRC] directories.

Modifications and adaptations:
-----------------------------
The BUFFER_INITIAL_SIZE for Midifiles is now 400 Kbytes to handle big files.
(in [.MIDI.INCLUDE]MIDIFILE.H)

Sub processes are spawned via LIB$SPAWN in NOWAIT state. An AST routine is
used to handle sub process termination. (I don't use C/Unix signals).

Subprocesses are used by TOPBOX to execute the Editor and the Sequencer. The
Sequencer also uses a subprocess to play midi files via an external player
(timidity on VMS).

The ressource file for VMS is ROSEGARDEN.DAT . Note that you need to provide
either a command name or an "mc file_specification" for Editor and Sequenceer
executables (because I use lib$spawn):

!!! Paths, edit these

Rosegarden*editorName:          mc ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[bin]editor
Rosegarden*sequencerName:       mc ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[bin]sequencer
Rosegarden*helpFile:            ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[common.help]rosehelp.info
Rosegarden*midiFmPatchFile:     ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[common.synth-patches]std.sb
Rosegarden*midiFmDrumPFile:     ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[common.synth-patches]drums.sb
Rosegarden*sequencerName:       mc ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[bin]sequencer
Rosegarden*helpFile:            ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[common.help]rosehelp.info
Rosegarden*midiFmPatchFile:     ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[common.synth-patches]std.sb
Rosegarden*midiFmDrumPFile:     ROSEGARDEN_DIR:[common.synth-patches]drums.sb

You need to put your preferred Timidity options in the ressource file:

!!! this is for the sequencer's "Play through Slave":

Rosegarden*externalPlayer:      timidity "-a" "-s32000"


Bugs/Limitations:
----------------
This port has some limitations, mainly in the Interlock system and the file
browser:

The file browser is ok with files but not yet with directories.

The Interlock library is not ported on VMS. The Editor and the Sequencer cannot
communicate without explicit action on the both sides (for example you export
to a midi file in the editor and you read that file in the sequencer. Not a big
deal). If someone has some spare time to implement Interlock library ...

The Help system is only available in Rosagarden aplication (the topbox) and not
into the Editor or the Sequencer.

Filters in TCL are not tested under VMS.

Enjoy !!

Sapphire - an acoustic compiler for Unix and DOS

Sapphire is an acoustic compiler: a program which takes a
representation of sound as a text file and generates the sound from
it, rather like a ray-tracing package takes a text representation of a
scene and generates a picture from it.

Sapphire has a large range of objects from which your sound can be
built, including envelope shapers, filters, oscillators, sample
playback modules, and arithmetic operators. These can be 'wired'
together into sounds of arbitrary complexity. Complex sounds just take
a bit longer to build.

All sounds created with sapphire can be used commercially without
royalty, provided you put a notice saying something like:

	"Sapphire acoustic compiler by J. Finnis"

SDL, LANGUAGES, Data Structure/Interface Definition Language

	SDL is both a data structure and interface definition
language and a utility/compiler to convert those definitions
into language output for a number of different languages.
This allows a single source definition of a data structure,
for example, while supporting multiple language representations
of that data structure.
	SDL consists of a front-end and numerous language
back-ends. The front-end generates an intermediate language
which is interpreted by the back-ends. It is straightforward to
create back-ends for new languages, following the example of an
existing back end. When the SDL/LANGUAGE qualifier is used, the
specified language name is used to search for the back-end image.
Note that SDL sources are provided in the [.SRC] directory,
including build and option files as well as needed include files.
	Since the OpenVMS operating system itself is written
in multiple languages which share many of the same data structures,
SDL is used to define the data structure once and then produce
output for the respective languages which require access to that
structure definition.
	The most recent "formal" documentation describes VAX
SDL V3.2. That documentation is available on this kit. There have been a
number of bug fixes made to SDL for Alpha which are included in this kit.
	To use SDL, invoke the [SDL]SDL.COM procedure.

	Typical use of SDL:

	The following example starts with a standard OpenVMS message
definiion file, and ends up with an include file (.H) for C:

    $ MESSAGE/NOOBJECT/SDL='NAME'.SDL 'NAME'.MSG
    $ SDL/VAX -   ! or /ALPHA 
        /LANGUAGE=(C)
        /COPYRIGHT 'NAME'.SDL

	The GEN_MSG tool can be used to have a common source file for
both the application message file and the SDML documentation.

GNU SED, UTILITIES, UNIX Stream Editor for VMS

aug-1995 Sheldon Bishov, bishov@star.enet.dec.com

The source for files was Free Software Foundation, ftp from
anonymous@prep.ai.mit.edu

To build, unzip the source kit, then set default to source directory and 
enter the command:

$ @vmsbuild {param}

where {param} is VAXC (for VAX only) or DECC (for VAX or Alpha).

To run, define a foreign command to sed, e.g., if .exe is in sys$system:
             sed :== $sys$system:sed

For other details, see file readme.; in the source kit.

The following changes were made in the code:

getopt.c: change names of variables optarg, optind, opterr, optopt to have
         prefix "vms" (e.g., vmsoptarg) to avoid conflict with externals
         either in VAXC or DECC.  Also, removed local definition of getopt
         routine.

getopt.h: change variable names, as in getopt.c

getopt1.c: change variable names, as in getopt.c

rx.c: syntax change; original shortcut notation not accepted by VAXC or DECC.

sed.c: syntax change; original shortcut notation not accepted by VAXC or DECC.
         Also change usage for errno (which assumed UNIX environment).

utils.c: switch from use of fwrite to fprintf so that output would be 
         written correctly with redirection (with fwrite would get one
         character per line).

   SEND is patterned after the Jnet SEND command for BITNET sites. For
   example, a message could be sent to user BRUCE on node BATMAN using:

  $ send batman::bruce "Hello, are you there?"
  $ send batman::bruce
         (BATMAN)BRUCE: These are multi-line broadcasts

   
   
   The message would be broadcast on BRUCE's terminal like:

  (CAVE)ROBIN - Hello, are you there?

   
   
   SEND supports a number of qualifiers to control the broadcasts of the
   messages.
   
   The BLISS sources are distributed with the software.

Shadowing Unlike Disks

This version of VDdriver permits one to make virtual disks of parts of
other disks and works with Digital volume shadowing. Thus you can take
unlike disks and make virtual disks out of parts of them, and shadow the
parts. The remaining parts of the disks can be used either as separate
virtual disks or as other file structures, if you decide to make file
structures on the raw disks first and place the virtual disks on contiguous
files on them.

This code is presented as a "calling card" and works nicely with the author's
product SAFETY. 

Please read the file "Safetyspd.txt" in this directory to learn about
Safety, a comprehensive data safety package offering a reliable user
undelete system, storage management, and data security functions unequalled

SHOW_QUOTA, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Show quota available/left for a process

This procedure shows the given quota and the remaining quota of a process. 
It uses the process id as first parameter. 

Take the results as an idea of how much quota is used. Do not take all 
the values for granted because they are updated in a certain interval.
Specialy the peak values may differ from what SHOW PROCESS/ACCOUNTING 
does give you.

AnalyRIM - spreadsheet and DBMS integrated, runs on vms, rsx, unix,
	amigados, and msdos. Full sources are present.
DBAG - roughly, a clone of dBase III for VMS with source & docs
DECOMPRESS_TOOLS - decompression tools from sigtapes you may need to
	decompress archives in zoo, lharc, zip, etc. formats in this
	material. AXP and Vax executables are present.
F2C and Setuser - F2C converts fortran 77 to C; VMS port by Tony
	Scandora. Setuser - "become" some other user if you have ]
	privs.
JUICER3 - Defragger that uses movefile, so is safe. Full source present.
	Defrags ODS-2 disks only (normal VMS structure) and does not
	handle volume sets.
READVMSBACKUP - Reads vms backup savesets on unix. Works on little endian
	machines (e.g. AXP) or big endian ones (e.g. sun)
VAXNET - Communications program for VMS. Knows kermit and xmodem
	and its own protocols and has a sophisticated script language
	so it can be used to call pagers etc. (Note the kermit protocol
	used is a basic one, but it does work. Xmodem checksum or crc
	are both there. VAXnet tends to work better as a remote terminal
	than other communications programs, in that it uses negligible
	CPU (unlike others that do single character I/O).

Unzip executables suited to these zipfiles are also provided for vax

SNAKE, GAMES, X11 Fruit-eating snake game

snake4 - Fruit-eating snake game.
=================================

This program is my fourth implementation of the snake game, written
for Unix and X11. Previous versions were written for MS-DOS.

Move the snake around the screen and eat food. The snake grows in
length as you eat. Avoid hitting the fence, eating lethal mushrooms
and rotten food, and biting your own tail.

Now and then a slim-pill will bounce around. If you eat this, you will
get shorter, and you will gain bonus points for every length you
loose. The bonus is also given when a round is over.

When food starts blinking, it's about to rot. Rotten food is
poisonous, and thus uneatable. As long as it blinks, it can still be
eaten.

Oh, yes - I almost forgot: You may be visited by the evil headbanger.
Take my advice and run away from him before he hits you in the head!
He won't stay long.

                 Bill Schottstaedt (bil@ccrma.stanford.edu)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs and an old, sorely-missed
PDP-10 sound editor named Dpysnd. It can accomodate any number of sounds at
once, each with any number of channels. Each channel is normally displayed
in its own window, with its own cursor, edit history, and marks; each sound
has a 'control panel' to try out various changes quickly, and an expression
parser, used mainly during searches; there is an overall stack of 'regions'
that can be browsed and edited; channels and sounds can be grouped together
during editing; edits can be undone and redone without restriction
('unlimited undo'); Snd can be customized and extended using a built-in
Scheme interpreter (Gnu Guile); and it's free; the code is available via
anonymous ftp from ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu as pub/Lisp/snd.tar.gz.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

SND version 2.1 port under OpenVMS                   October 1998
==================================

SunClock, MOTIF_TOYS, XWindow SunClock Display

        This demo is  a  clock  that  shows  which portion of the Earth's
        surface is illuminated by the Sun. 

        This version of SunClock  has  evolved  from  the original source
        posted in the  SPEZKO::DECW_EXAMPLES  notes conference.  I ported
        the code to OpenVMS AXP and  added several command line switches.
        For more information on the original code  see  the  SUNCLOCK.DOC
        file.  The command line switches are documented below.
                
       
        ** NOTE **

        You must have the logical name  DEMOS defined to point to the top
        level  directory  that  contains  the  SunClock  directory.   All
        command  procedures rely on this being defined.  For  example  if
        all the SunClock files are in WORK:[SMITH.SUNCLOCK] then you need
        a logical name defined as follows:
        
        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE DEMOS WORK:[SMITH.] 

        **  Ensure you include the "." after the last directory name  **

        This will  build  either a OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP image based
        on what architecture it is run on.

                
        To run...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        $ @DEMOS:[SUNCLOCK]START_SUNCLOCK.COM
        
        This  will  start  up  the  appropiate  architecture  version  of
        SunClock.  You will  need  to  edit  this startup file to set the
        appropiate timezone you are in and  your  offset  from  GMT.  The
        offset from GMT is required to correctly  position  the sun.  The
        zone may  be  any  3 characters to represent the timezone you are
        in.  For  example,  in the Eastern USA the -zone is "EST" and the
        -offset is 5.   To  retain  the  case  for  -zone,  quote  the  3
        characters.

TELL, UTILITIES, Issues DCL commands on remote machines

 This command procedure will execute commands on a remote node.

 The command syntax for tell is :-
 @TELL[/output=filename] NODENAME[,...] DCL-COMMAND [&] [|...]

   P1 - NODENAME:
    More than one nodename can be specified, each being seperated by a comma.
    Nodename can also be a symbol and the double colon (::) after the nodename
     is optional.
    "0" can be used to specify the local nodename.
    If you do not have proxy access then you can specify access control 
      information as part of the nodename specification. 
    You can force a routing path by specifiy nodename of the from
      nodename::nodename::
    If two or more nodenames are specified then on completion TELL displays a 
      summary listing of unreachable nodes. This feature can be disabled by
      defining the logical name as follows:-
      $ DEFINE/PROCESS/NOLOG TELL_INHIBIT_SUMMARY TRUE

   P2 to P8 - DCL COMMAND:
    INTERACTIVE MODE:
      If no DCL command is specified then you will be in interactive mode.
      At that point you will have a DCL session in the context of the remote
        node. The standard EXIT command will return you to your local node.
    COMMAND MODE:
      Here the DCL commands are specified in P2 to P8 and are separated 
      by a vertical bar "|". Quotes are optional and are only required to
      reduce the number of P parameters.
    DETACHED MODE:
      Jobs can be run in the background as a detached process by 
      suffixing the & (unix background command) to any command.
      This can be done from either Interactive or Command Mode.

    Note that you cannot issue commands that require terminal input such as 
    EDIT etc. This is a restriction of the DECnet task-task software and not
    of TELL itself. Some of these restrictions can be overcome by defining 
    the verb as a foreign command. This allows many commands to be entered on 
    a single line.
        eg. $ AUTHORIZE :== $AUTHORIZE
            $ AUTHORIZE SHOW KINGSMILL
     
   QUALIFIERS:
    /Output can be used to direct the output to a filename.


   EXAMPLES:

   $ TELL :== @SYS$MANAGER:TELL.COM
        All the following examples assume that the tell symbol is defined.
        Place this in your login.com.

   $ TELL MVAX SHOW ERROR
        This command relies on proxy access to MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX.

   $ TELL/OUTPUT=SYS$LOGIN:TELL.OUT MVAX SHOW ERROR
        This command relies on proxy access to MVAX. 
        It does a remote $show error on node MVAX with the output
           directed to the file sys$login:tell.out

   $ TELL MVAX"KINGSMILL PASSWORD":: SHOW ERROR
        this command supplies access control to accounts that do not have 
        proxy access

   $ TELL MVAX"KINGSMILL":: SHOW ERROR
        Under VMS V5.x you can have a number of different proxy users pointed
        to one account. This example show how to gain access to a non-default
        proxy account. Note that only the username needs to be specified.

   $ TELL MVAX,TVAX,SVAX SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ DECA_CLUSTER :== MVAX,TVAX,SVAX
   $ TELL 'DECA_CLUSTER' SHOW ERROR
        this command will do a show error on MVAX, TVAX and SVAX.

   $ TELL MVAX,TVAX "SHOW ERROR"|"SHOW NET"
        this command will do both a show error and a show net on both MVAX 
        and TVAX.

   $ TELL MVAX,TVAX "SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=MAXPS1" | "CREATE/TERM &"
        this command will create a detached decterm on both MVAX and TVAX

   $ TELL MVAX
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> SHOW ERROR
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> SET PROC/PRIV=OPER
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> MCR NCP SHOW EXEC
   MVAX_KINGSMILL>> EXIT
   $
        This is an example of an interactive session. The prompt indicates
        the remote nodename and username, whilst the ">>" is used to
        distinguish between a local and remote session. 
    
   $ TELL MVAX TELL TVAX SHOW ERROR
   $ TELL MVAX::TVAX:: SHOW ERROR
        Both of these commands perform the same function. 
        The first performs a nested TELL, ie. TELL node MVAX to TELL node
          TVAX to do a $ show error. Only command mode is valid with 
          this syntax and you must specify the command as TELL not @tell.
        The second example show how to do the same thing using Poor Mans
          Routing (PMR). This is far more efficent than the first examples
          and it supports both command and interactive modes.


 CONFIGURATION SETUPS:
 TELL.COM needs to exist on both the local and remote nodes and requires
 the user to either specify node access control or for the remote account 
 to be set up for proxy access. TELL can simply reside in sys$login on the
 remote node, which requires each user to have their own copy -or- TELL
 can be defined as a DECnet object, requiring each system to have only one 
 copy.

 To install TELL as a network object the system manager should enter the
 following commands:
  $ MCR NCP
  NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TELL NUMBER 0 FILE SYS$MANAGER:TELL.COM PROXY BOTH
  NCP> SET OBJECT TELL ALL
  NCP> EXIT
  $

 If TELL is not installed as a network object then by default no other setups
 are required. However if the DECnet object task has been modified to disable
 proxy access then tell will fail. In this case the system manager should 
 enter the following commands:
  $ MCR NCP
  NCP> DEFINE OBJECT TASK PROXY BOTH
  NCP> SET OBJECT TASK ALL
  NCP> EXIT
  $

 PROXY accounts allow one user direct access to another users account
  without having to specify username and password. The system manager
  can set up proxy account access from within AUTHORIZE. 

  Example:  $ MCR AUTHORIZE>
            UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::KINGSMILL KINGSMILL/DEFAULT
            UAF> ADD/PROXY MVAX::OLSENK KINGSMILL
            UAF> EXIT
            $
  This examples allows remote user KINGSMILL and OLSENK on node MVAX
  into the local KINGSMILL account. The default switch enables you to
  specify just the nodename when addressing this node:-
    eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX::
  If Default access is not specified then you need to specify the 
  nodename and username when addressing this node:-
    eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"KINGSMILL"::
  If you do not have proxy access then you need to specify the
  nodename, username and password when addressing a remote node:-
    eg. $ DIRECTORY TVAX"KINGSMILL password"::

  The following logicals can be used to alter the default TELL behaviour.
  TELL_INHIBIT_SUMMARY to disable the statistics printout.

 TROUBLESHOOTING:
   The following logicals can be used to aid in troubleshooting.
   TELL_VERBOSE to display the progress of both local and remote events.
     This can also be enabled by setting the version prefix from "V" to "X"
   TELL_VERIFY to turn on verify and verbose.
   NETSERVER.LOG on the remote node may also aid in troubleshooting.
   TELL_'pid'*.COM temporary file on the remote node shows the created
     command file if detached qualifier was specified.
   TELL.LOG temporary file on on the remote node showing the output
     from tell_'pid'.com

TETRIS312, GAMES, GENERIC TETRIS - Yet Another Tetris Game on X

    This is a game of "Tetris" for the X Window System.

    The program lists the top 15 players at the end, each player may has at
    most three scores. With the option -s, it shows all the players
    and scores.

    Key "j" moves the block left, "l" moves right,
    "k" rotates. Left-handed people may want to use "s",
    "d", "f" respectively. Or maybe someone wants to try the
    arrow keys...  The space bar drops a block quickly. Use "CTRL-L"
    key combination to redraw - in case the program messes somthing up.

    As usual, "+" and "-" speed up or lower down the speed. Note
    that you don't need to press the "SHIFT" key - "=" and
    "_" also work. The "b" key toggles "beep", and "n"
    toggles "show next".

    If you press "p", the game will be paused, and the window
    will be iconified - just in case your boss suddenly appears at your
    door ;o). When the tetris window loses its focus, it also goes to
    "paused" mode except it doesn't iconify itself.

    To get high scores, don't use "show next" mode, try starting at a
    higher level and try to let "tetris" eat more than one line at a time.
    Play fast and see how well you can do in the bonus mode
    (what is that? ;-). Warning: some blocks in the bonus mode will rotate
    differently than you would expect.

TeX95, SOFTWARE, TeX typesetting system

DECUS TeX95 is a new compilation of the popular TeX typesetting system
This compilation is a joined work of Ch.Spieler and R.Gaertner, starting
in 1994. The compilation has a much clearer structure and consists of the
programs:
  TeX 3.14159 (Juni '95), Metafont 2.718 (Juni '95), XDVI , DVIPS 5.58,
  DVITOLN03 4.1c, BibTeX 0.99c, Makeindex, Bibclean, GloTeX, IdxTeX,
  and DECUS SPELL

All programs appear in source form with prebuild objects and images for
both Alpha and VAX. The programs have been compiled on VMS 6.0 systems,
so running them on VMS 5.x may require a recompilation. Beside the pro-
grams the most used macro packages are available as prebuild formats:
  Plain , LaTeX , AMSTeX 2.1 , AMSLaTeX 1.2 , Eplain, TeXinfo, TeXsis,
  and some other formats.
For sites which can not immediatly upgrade, the (now obsolete) formats
for LaTeX 2.09 and AMSLaTeX 1.1 are supplied.

The following fonts for a printer with 300 dpi are available: 
  CM , LaTeX , AMS , DC/EC 1.1 , Concrete Fonts , DVIPS virtual fonts
Besides these precomputed fonts some other fonts are supplied in source
form. Missing bitmaps can be computed with MAKETEXPK, if the Metafont
source is available.

The on-line help has been rewritten and a new guide, VMS_TEX_MGR.GUIDE,
describing the relations/roots of the various components has been added.
For all components (programs/packages) DCL procedures to recreate these
components are supplied. DECUS TeX95 can be installed on a system-wide
or process-only basis.

An installation will create about 7800 files and will need appr. 200MB of 
disk space.

For the future ist is planned to reorganize the collection in the direction
of TUG directory standard, to add more DVI drivers and to increase the
PostScript support.

Timidity 0.2I port under OpenVMS                              30 July 1997
================================

Configuration files are referenced with timidity_dir rooted logical:

$ define/trans=conc timidity_dir disk:[rep1.timidity-0_2I.]

                                    don't forget the dot ^

You need MMOV 2.0 (multimedia Services for OpenVMS V 2.0) to play midi files
in real time on good contidions on your Alphastation (and SYSNAM privileges
to connect to Multimedia server; timidity is linked /notraceback to allow image
installation with SYSNAM privilege).

I've added the AMD audio device support (taken from Xlockmore source
distribution). The result is not very good but however on Alpha its audible.
It also run on VAX but you need a very fast one !!

To rebuild on Alpha with MMOV and DEC C 5.2/VMS 6.2:

$ @COMPILE_MMOV
$ @LINK_MMOV

To rebuild on Alpha or VAX with AMD audio and DEC C 5.2/VMS 6.2

$ @COMPILE_AMD
$ @LINK_AMD

Actually only the command-line interface is ported under VMS, but with that you
can even use Timidity as a Midi sound player for the Web (tested with Mosaic
and Netscape). You just need to add one line into your SYS$LOIN:MAILCAP. file:

audio/midi; timidity  %s

By default, with MMOV, midi files are played in stereo, 16 bits samples
at 22,050 Khz of sample rate which gives a good sound quality with a
moderate cpu charge (between 20% and 30% on Alphastation 255/233). With AMD
audio, midi files are played in mono, 8 bits samples at 8,000 Khz of sample
rate.

Patch Level 1 (20 July 1997):

Some parameters are modified to improve peformance and allow use of 44,100 Khz
sample frequency (with about 50% CPU on a 255/233):

- AUDIO_BUFFER_BITS is set to 12        (CONFIG.H)
- CONTROLS_PER_SECOND is reduced to 250 (CONFIG.H)
- The size of sample buffer in DEC_A.C is set to 2048*8 (16 Kb) instead of
   1024*8

Patch Level 2 (20 July 1997):

Some rewrite of AMD audio output using a flip/flop of two buffers and
asynchronous QIO's. The result is far better and if not great is at least
audible without trouble. The size of audio buffer is now 2048 samples to
improve performance (it is probably the max for AMD device driver SODRIVER).

Instrument samples:

Only a few patches (sounds samples needed to play midi files) are provided into
this kit (bright piano and nylon guitar). A rather complete set of samples is
available at my site (http://www2.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr/ftp/decwindows) or into
this distribution:


  o timidity_base_samples.zip        Base samples (piano and acoustic guitar).
  o timidity_instruments_samples.zip Full General MIDI set(Midia).
  o timidity_drums_samples.zip       Dustin McCartney's drum set.
  o timidity_wow_samples.zip         Dustin McCartney's Wow patches.
  o timidity_new_samples.zip         Flutes, Organs etc ... (good
                                     quality) Also contains last configuration
                                     files, the last file to be unzipped.

Package name:	SSINT (System Service INTercept)
Version ident:	V1.3%6.233	20-August-1996
Description:	Demonstration of interception of system service routines
		on OpenVMS Alpha via a loadable executive image(execlet).
Author's name:  Brian Schenkenberger, VAXman

Package Overview:
----------------
This package is comprised of a single loadable executive image(execlet)
which demonstrates a method for intercepting a system service's service
routine on OpenVMS Alpha.  For demonstration purposes, this incarnation
of SSINT intercepts two system services SYS$CREPRC and SYS$DELPRC.  For
each invocation of either of the intercepted system services, a message
is output on the system console device to display the PID of the process
invoking the service and the status of the call.

This execlet is unique in that, it does not declare its initialization
routines in the normal fashion using the INITIALIZATION_ROUTINE macro.
Normally, an initialization routine would be declared using this macro
which, in turn, builds the table of vectors of initialization routines.
This table is then used by the INI$DOINIT routine in module SYS$DOINIT
to call the execlet's initialization routines.  Unfortunately, this is
not an appropriate initialization senario in cases where an execlet is
required to perform some function prior to default functions performed 
as a consequence of the INI$DOINIT routine.
 
In this particular execlet, certain initialization functions need to be
performed before the INI$DOINIT routine invokes the INI$SYSTEM_SERVICE
procedure which, in turn, invokes the procedure EXE$CONNECT_SERVICES to 
define the replacement system service function.

To accomplish the requirements discussed above, a local routine called
SSINT$DOINIT, is established for this execlets transfer address; thus,
causing the execlet loader to invoke IT for the initialization routine
instead of the normal INI$DOINIT routine.

After this initialization code is invoked, the INI$DOINIT routine must
be invoked.  Unfortunately, this routine is not defined globally to be
called by another routine.  Therefore, by playing a little "game" with
the ordering of the initialization linkage, a symbol can be defined in
the EXEC$INIT_LINKAGE psect to establish the location of the Procedure
DeSCriptor (PDSC) of the INI$DOINIT routine.  This is accomplished via
the module SSDOINIHACK.MAR.

The initialization routine in this execlet is used to obtain the PDSC
address of the original service routine for the system service that is
being intercepted.  A change mode system service which changed mode is
defined by a bound procedure value procedure descriptor.  The address 
found at PDSC$Q_ENTRY in the system service's procedure descriptor is
the address of the system service transfer vector code.  For a change 
mode system service, this vector will contain the following code thread:

SYS$<SS-name>_C+00: LDL  R1,(SP)		; A03E0000
SYS$<SS-name>_C+04: BIS  SP,R31,R28		; 47DF041C
SYS$<SS-name>_C+08: LDA  R0,#X<chm-code>(R31)	; 201Fxxxx
SYS$<SS-name>_C+0C: CHMx			; 0000008x (x: 2=E/3=K) 

* Note: The format of the system service transfer vector under OpenVMS
	Alpha version prior to V6.1 differ from the above and therefore,
	this execlet will not function without making necessary changes.

The initialization code looks through the vector to determine the mode
of the system service and the assigned change mode code of the system
service.  After obtaining these values, the address of the change mode
dispatch vector is calculated and the service routine's PDSC address
is stored for transfer to later in the intercept (replacement) system 
service routine.  The dispatch table entry vector format is depicted 
below.

+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| DISP_A_SERVICE_ROUTINE|:CMOD$AR_<mode>_DISPATCH_VECTOR+10(16)*chm-code
+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 
|   DISP_A_ENTRY_POINT  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 
|   <reserved>    |FLAGS|
+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 
|      <reserved>       |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 


The module SSINTLOADER.MAR can be used to dynamically load the execlet. 
This execlet could also be loaded during system initialization.  To do
this, define the execlet using the SYSMAN command:  SYS_LOADABLE ADD.  
An execlet must reside in SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES to load it during system
bootstrapping.  After adding the execlet using SYSMAN, a DCL procedure
called VMS$SYSTEM_IMAGES.COM located in SYS$UPDATE must be executed.



Modification Information:	V1.3%6.233	20-August-1996
------------------------
This version of SSINT contains new code to support the interception of
64 bit system services and system services enhanced to permit passing
of 64 bit addresses.  This version defines the macro: $SETUP_CALLG_64
for creating a 64 bit argument list which can, subsequently, be passed
to the built-in EVAX_CALLG_64 to invoke the original service routine.
This 64 bit mechanism, available as of OpenVMS Alpha V7.0, may be used 
to intercept any change mode system service even though the service is
not 64 bit enhanced.

This version also changes the way in which the SSINI$DOINIT routine is
invoked as the primary initialization routine.  This version now elim-
inates the ugly "%LINK-W-MULTFR, multiply defined transfer address..." 
when linking SSINTERCEPT.EXE.

TYPE CHECKER, UTILITIES, MACRO-32 Type checking tool for VAX and AXP systems

This DCL tool applies type checking rules to MACRO-32 code. For example, the
embedded data type in MACRO-32 field names can be checked against the MACRO-32
opcode's expectations for each argument. This tool can isolate bugs without any
debugging and can be used on both VAX and Alpha MACRO-32 listing files. It is
especially useful for MACRO-32 code which has been ported to Alpha, where byte and
word fields may have expanded to longwords. The tool helps assure all MACRO-32
opcodes use these changed fields in a longword fashion.

The tool consists of the following files:

TYPCHK.COM - the MACRO-32 Type Checker which is a DCL command file.
TYPCHK.DEFINITIONS - a text file containing all the type checking rules which
	you can tailor to your needs.
TYPCHK.PS - a postscript file containing a user guide.
TYPCHK_DIFF.COM - a DCL command file to perform a specialized difference 
	between two Type Checked listing files. This allows one to quickly
	access new Type Check warnings added as a result of a code change
	or to verify that Type Check warnings have been eliminated by a
	code change.

Version: 1.2 
Submitted By: Digital Equipment Corporation 
Operating System: VMS V5.0-V5.3 
Source Language: BLISS 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract: VAX SCAN is a native mode high level language designed for 
text processing that operates under the VMS Operating System. VAX SCAN 
programs can invoke and be invoked by routines written in other VMS 
languages as well as many Run-Time Library routines. 
VAX SCAN is implemented as an optimizing compiler that produces standard 
VMS object modules. These modules can be linked with modules written in 
other VMS languages to produce an executable image that can be executed 
by the VMS RUN command. 
The VAX SCAN language can be divided into two parts; the first part is a 
block-structured language that can be used for traditional algorithmic 
programming, while the second part deals with pattern matching. 
-------------------------------

	VAX SCAN project files

	Notes from the re-archiver


These files are what remains of the VAX SCAN project.  It has been tested,
and it will build with the appropriate support tools installed.  The
product kit files are in the directory [scan.kit.current]scan*.%.

A careful study of what is included here will certainly show loose ends:
links and references to other things that seem to be missing.  This is
true, but without spending too much time polishing the edges, it must be
so.  VAX SCAN was developed in a group that developed many language
products, and there was much sharing of tools and procedures.  Not all of
those are required to deal with VAX SCAN in isolation, and so they were not
included.

Take care not to delete the VCG object files and library.  The SCAN build
procedure does not exercise the VCG build, it just copies it from another
directory.  I am therefore not sure that everything needed to build VCG is
here, nor even that this is the version of VCG's source that matches this
version of SCAN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you run the LOGIN_DECUS.COM (even from some account other than [SCAN],
as I have), it will work around the problems caused by having removed
LOGIN.COM et alia from their original environment.  It assumes that the
SCAN stuff is in a top level directory on a disk labelled SCAN, and hence
that the system has defined DISK$SCAN for the device.  disk$scan, scan$disk
and scan$$disk now all refer to the same device.

The SCAN_BUILD command symbol refers to a .COM file that will ask a few
questions and submit a build of SCAN.  Answering "yes" to the "compiler
build" question will build the compiler.  Answering "no" will build the
RTL.

The DWCI code is expected to fail because DWCI is no longer supported.  (Which
is why I simply commented out that section of the MMS file to deal with the
fact that they were written for VAX C, which I don't have anymore.  DECC/vaxc
gets you part way there, but the DWCI support files are still absent, so LINK
can't find everything).

VGP1_1, GRAPHICS, Vector Globe Projection tool

		THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES MOTIF OR LESSTIF!

What is vgp?

Vector Globe Projection is a tool for engineers, scientists, or anyone
that deals with series of R3 (3-dimensional) vectors.  (A vector of
vectors so to speak.)  The usual case is a set of these n x 3 matrices
with one representing time and the others representing other signals
like momentum or velocity, changing with time.  It could also
represent a partial attitude, by the vector representing e.g. the
Y-axis of the body with respect to an inertia frame.  Throughout this
document I will refer to the series as a time history which is most
usually the case.  vgp displays the entire time history of the vector
as the path it would follow on a sphere.  This time history can be
animated as a vector starting at the center of sphere and pointing
toward the current point.  The current row number of the data is
displayed in the top right corner.

What are the controls?

The left mouse button will rotate the sphere. The right button will
translate the sphere.  The middle mouse button will create a zoom
rectangle that should be dragged around the region of interest and a
zoom-in will occur.  To zoom-out either push the "full size" button or
shift-middle mouse button.  The "start" button will start the
animation.

Data Format:

The data format consists of three space delimited columns of ASCII
text floating point numbers.

Examples:

	vgp data/orbit.data data/earth.dat data/latlon.dat

I've included some example data files to demonstrate some of the
concepts.  The data is in the 'data' sub-directory.  The first is
named 'spiral.dat'.  This is a simple spiral which is good
demonstration of the animation.  The file 'earth.dat' is the outline
of all the major land masses.  This is only for show purposes and not
the point of the program.  The last two files were generated by the
SWAS spacecraft simulation.  The file 'cone.dat' demonstrates the
solar array axis of the spacecraft acquiring the sun and coning about
it.  The file 'map.dat' demonstrates the mapping mode of the
spacecraft along the instrument bore-sight.  This data must be zoomed
in on a lot!  Look for the busy part of the picture.  This can be
found be starting the animation and rotating the sphere until you find
the point were the vector spends the most time.  Zoom in on this area
repeatedly and you will notice the finer and finer details of the
motion.


What vgp is not:

Since I work with spacecraft many people urged me to make the
sphere the earth and animate a spacecraft going around it.  But this
program is meant to be more general than that.  This program will
work with any series of 3D vectors.  Also, from an engineering
perspective, I feel this program, the way it is, gives the important
information.

VIOC_RESET, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, Reset Virtual I/O Cache counters
 
The Virtual I/O Cache (VIOC) is a clusterwide, file-oriented disk
cache available to all supported configurations, from single-node
systems to large mixed-interconnect VMScluster systems.  Any base
system can use VIOC, no additional license is required. 

There are applications that cause the VIOC counters to be skewed,
resulting in an incorrect interpretation of the usefullness of the
VIOC.  By resetting the counters, the SHOW MEMORY/CACHE/FULL
display depicts a more accurate use of the VIOC.

The following discussion is relevant to the SHOW MEMORY/CACHE/FULL 
display:

    The BACKUP utility typically causes a large increase to the
    "Read IO Count" while incurring no read hits. Depending on
    the amount of data being backed up, the increase to "Read IO
    Count" can be drastic in a short span of time.  Since the
    "Read Hit Rate" remains somewhat flat for this same period of
    time, the calculated "Hit%" will be skewed.  The skewed
    values will remain until the system is rebooted, or until
    enough time and I/Os, with an equitable hit rate, occur. 
    Typically, "IO Bypassing Cache" will increase in proportion
    to "Read IO Count".

  VMS_SHARE is designed to package a series of files into a multi-part
  share file suitable for mailing across a network. Files are encoded to
  be resistant to the corruption that many mailers and networks
  generate.  When all parts of the share file are combined and run as a
  command procedure, the packaged directory tree is recreated in its
  original format.

        	TECHNICAL INFORMATION ABOUT VMS_SHARE

    								Version 8.4
    								May 1993



1. INTRODUCTION

VMS_SHARE is designed to package a series of files into a form that can be 
easily mailed across many different networks. Difficulties arise with doing 
this because of the many and varied possibilities for corruption of data in 
transit.  For example, line wrapping, case folding, transposition of key 
characters etc.

VMS_SHARE encodes files before transmission so that these things may be kept 
under control and proper restoral effected at the receiving end.

For a given series of files to be packaged, VMS_SHARE combines them into a 
single large 'text archive' file that can be unpacked into its component files 
simply by running it as a command procedure at the receiving end. For 
convenience, VMS_SHARE will optionally split the result into multiple parts 
that can be individually mailed and recombined at the receiving end.

NOTE - VMS_SHARE is designed for Digital VAX or Alpha systems running the VMS
operating system. It will not work on other operating systems/hardware, and
minimum operating system versions must be observed.



2. WHAT VMS_SHARE DOES NOT DO

Because VMS_SHARE relies on electronic mail to ship the files, there are no 
protocols that can be used to check the accuracy of the received file(s). 
There is a reliance on the underlying mail system to get everything there in 
one piece and unchanged.  VMS_SHARE is unable to ask for retransmission of 
missing or damaged pieces.

VMS_SHARE should therefore be used to send files only via essentially reliable 
mail systems which can get files, whose characters fall within certain bounds, 
there intact.

VMS_SHARE is intended for sequential files only. Other file formats can be
packaged into a backup saveset, whose file format is supported by VMS_SHARE



3. LIMITATIONS OF MAILERS AND HOW VMS_SHARE GETS AROUND THEM

Various mail systems have different limitations within them. For instance, 
they will wrap or truncate lines that are too long, they may limit the size of 
an individual mail message, they may transpose characters incorrectly if the 
underlying character set is different from the transmitter (ASCII/EBCDIC is a
good example of this). 

VMS_SHARE encodes the files in different ways to get around the problems.
Please note however, that the encoding techniques are NOT foolproof. We have
merely tried to anticipate all possible corruptions and devise an encoding
scheme which ensures that the conditions under which corruption occurs does not
arise. If a form of corruption that has not been anticipated occurs, corruption
to the transmitted files will be irreparable except through manual editing. 



3.1 Maximum Size of a Mail Message

Many mail systems cannot cope with single mail messages larger than a fixed 
number of bytes and will truncate messages or maybe even fail to deliver them 
altogether.

This is a real problem if a large software package is being sent.  VMS_SHARE 
tries to overcome this by splitting the packaged files into several parts, 
each part being smaller than some fixed size. By default, a part size of 30
blocks is chosen; this can be overriden by defining a logical name
(SHARE_PART_SIZE) or by a qualifier on the command line (/PART_SIZE=nn). For
example, we might send a  total of 300 blocks of code as 10 parts each of 30
blocks or less. VMS_SHARE  will automatically split at the 30 block boundary.

It should be noted that mail headers added on route can account for several
blocks worth of extra space so this should be realised when setting the
maximum part size.




3.2 Maximum Line Length

Many mail systems do not like lines longer than some fixed maximum length, a 
maximum length of 80 characters is typical. This results in longer lines being
wrapped or truncated at seemingly arbitrary positions. 

VMS_SHARE tries to cope with this by wrapping long lines itself and inserting 
markers to allow them to be rejoined at the receiving end. What VMS_SHARE does 
is to prefix each line with a flag character. This flag character says EITHER 
'this is the first part of a line' OR 'this line is a continuation of the 
previous line'.

The maximum line size is configured into the code as a global value and  can be
easily changed if required. It is not intended that this value should  be
altered by the average user however.




3.3 Trailing Blanks

Some mailers interfere with blanks at the start and end of lines. VMS_SHARE
encodes blanks (and tabs) as if they were troublesome characters (see below)
to get around this. During unpacking of an encoded file, any blank characters
are ignored.




3.4 Escaped Characters

Undoubtedly the biggest problem is that a mail message moving through many 
different systems on route to the destination may undergo character 
conversions (for example - ASCII to EBCDIC if moving from VAX to an IBM). 
Unfortunately, not all systems keep similar translation tables and characters 
can get translated into something unexpected at the remote end. Culprits are 
caret (^), tilde (~), square and curly brackets ( [ ] { } ) and a few others.

VMS_SHARE deals with this problem by replacing each of the troublesome 
characters - the ones mentioned above plus any non-printing character - by an
escape sequence. The escape sequence is recognized at the receiving end and is 
translated back to the original character.  Obviously, to work correctly, the 
escape sequence itself must be immune from translation problems. 

The escape technique used is to replace each character by a string of the form
`xx   where the ` symbol flags the start of an escape sequence and 'xx' is a
2-digit string which is the hexadecimal form of the ASCII code for the
character. Naturally, the ` character itself must be escaped in this form to
avoid confusion. For example, a space would be replaced by  `20   and a tab
by  `09. 



3.5 Additional Compression Techniques

Two additional forms of character encoding can be optionally selected by the
user to reduce the size of the packaged data - either run-length encoding or a
modified form of Lempel-Ziv compression.

A file compressed with one of these options will be automatically decompressed
when unpacked. It is not necessary for the recipient to use external
decompression tools.


3.5.1 Run-Length Encoding

A form of run length encoding is used to encode sequences of the same character
into a 5 character sequence. In this instance, the generated sequence is:

   &nnXX

where & is the run length sequence flag, nn is the count (in hex) of
characters, and ZZ is the hex code of the ascii character.  For example, a run
of 15 spaces would be replaced by  &0F20 (`0F' = 15, `20' = hex code for
space).

The use of run length encoding dramatically increases the time spent on
encoding the files. In many cases, it will be of no benefit. Because of this it
is not active by default.


3.5.2 Lempel-Ziv Compression

The Lempel-Ziv algorithm scans for common substrings in a file and replaces
them by a pointer back to a previous occurrence within the file. For this
implementation, a number of changes have been made to the basic idea to fit the
restrictions of the TPU utility, and the line wrapping and quoting schemes used
for long lines and non-printable characters.

The file is scanned for the longest previously occurring substring and is
replaced by an escape sequence of the form:

   \bbll

where \ is the flag to indicate an lz encoded string, bb is a 2 digit hex
encoded backwards count to the start of the original string, and ll is a two
digit hex encoded length. Because of the 2 digit hex encoding, the maximum
backwards search distance is 255 bytes and the maximum length is also 255
bytes. Therefore up to 255 bytes can be compressed to a 5 char sequence in the
optimal case. In practice, compression ratios are nothing like as dramatic.

This form of compression is very slow in operation due to the repeated
searching for substrings that have previously occurred. Some optimisations have
been made to the searching but it should still be selected only if it is
certain to be of some benefit.



3.6 Detecting Damaged Files with Checksums

In cases where some corruption occurs despite the encodings used by VMS_SHARE, 
detection of damage (BUT NOT REPAIR!) should be possible because each file is 
checked for accuracy using a checksum once it has been unpacked.

VMS_SHARE uses the currently undocumented CHECKSUM command to produce a 
checksum value for the source file. This checksum is carried across in the 
packed share file and checked when the file is restored. A failed match causes 
a message and the receiver can take action to try to locate and repair the 
damage.

The DCL command:

     $ CHECKSUM filename

writes the checksum value into a DCL symbol called CHECKSUM$CHECKSUM.

The CHECKSUM command does not work with files that have certain types of
records (specifically, those with an MRS value of 0 and records exceeding 2048
bytes). Therefore, VMS_SHARE cannot verify such files. Unfortunately, for the
same reason, VMS_SHARE is unable package such files at all, so an error message
is issued and the file is skipped.


4. VMS_SHARE IMPLEMENTATION

VMS_SHARE is provided as a combination of DCL and TPU code in order to ensure 
that it will run on any VMS system.  A specific program would be faster of 
course but then portability is not guaranteed.

The DCL part of the software is used merely to pick up parameters and
qualifiers, and parse filenames, passing them to the TPU code in a scratch
file.

The TPU code does the hard work of packaging the files, wrapping lines, 
escaping characters, compressing if requested,  and generating multiple parts.

As distributed, the DCL and TPU code are bundled into a single large procedure 
but there is no reason why the TPU code could not be extracted and made into a 
section file for enhanced speed. The modifications required are quite 
straightforward.


4.1 Long Lines

Because the code is based upon TPU, some limitations are imposed upon
VMS_SHARE. In particular, early versions of TPU (pre-VMS 5.4 on VAX) do not
allow records longer than 960 bytes so it is impossible to package them.
Versions of TPU at VMS 5.4 and beyond (VAX) or any OpenVMS (Alpha) allow
records up to 65535 bytes, so the problem virtually disappears. For
compatibility, VMS_SHARE still uses the old record length unless requested by
the user with the /LONGLINES qualifier. Use of this requires a minimum VMS of
5.4 (VAX), or any OpenVMS (Alpha) and the generated share file will unpack only
on VMS 5.4 or greater (VAX), or any OpenVMS (Alpha).

TPU file handling is limited. Files can only be written with variable length
records and CR carriage control. To allow other formats to be packaged,
VMS_SHARE encodes selected file record attributes into the share file and uses
the CONVERT utility to restore those attributes during the unpacking phase. In
principle, this allows VMS_SHARE to package files of most types, including
.EXE, .OBJ and .BCK files. In the case of .BCK files, this is subject to the
BACKUP block length being compatible with the maximum record length selected by
the user (960 or 65535 as appropriate). Allowing BACKUP savesets to be packaged
allows files of all other types to be packaged, provided they are first stored
in a saveset. BACKUP requires a minimum block length of 2048 bytes, so the long
line support is a pre-requisite for this.


4.2 Part Size Determination

The size of a part is conceptually simple. Find the size of a buffer in bytes
and divide by 512 to get the number of blocks it will occupy. However, this is
complicated by several things.

First, TPU does not count line ends when returning the `LENGTH' of a buffer.
Second, when a buffer is written to disk, there is a 2 byte overhead on each
record giving the length of the record. Finally, within a disk block, a record
always starts on a word boundary so that some records may be padded with an
additional null byte.

To accurately determine how much disk space a buffer would occupy would involve
some complex computations. However, since we know that each record has either a
2 byte or a 3 byte overhead we can get a reasonably accurate approximation by
taking the LENGTH of the buffer and adding 3 bytes for each record. We use 3
bytes to allow for the worst case and ensure that the part, when written to
disk, never exceeds the specified part size. In practice, this means that parts
will sometimes be less than the part size - the discrepancy grows as the part
size is increased.



5. USING VMS_SHARE

As distributed, VMS_SHARE is run as a command procedure (usually via a 
suitable symbol set up to point to it) thus:-

     $ @VMS_SHARE filespecs sharefile

where 'filespecs' is a comma separated list of wildcarded filenames to be 
packaged, and 'sharefile' is the name to be given to the packaged files. Each
part of the sharefile will be suffixed by a part number in the form:

    nnn-OF-mmm

where nnn is the part number and mmm is the total number of parts.

There are some restrictions on the filenames that can be used:

     - Subdirectories may be used provided that they are beneath the current
       directory. It is not permitted to package files in other directories.

     - At least one valid file must be given in 'filespecs' or no sharefile
       will be produced.


6. UNPACKING A VMS_SHARE FILE

In general, a package delivered using the VMS_SHARE software will arrive in a 
number of parts, from 1 up to 'n'.  All parts should be concatenated together 
in order. It is NOT necessary to remove superfluous mail headers from any part 
other than part 1 prior to concatenation.

The resulting combined file should then be executed as a command procedure in 
order to unpack the resulting files.



6.1 Typical Unpack Sequence

A typical sequence of events goes like this:

 - Set your default directory to a scratch directory which is empty.

 - Go into MAIL and select the folder which contains the parts of the
   package.

 - Extract part 1 into a file, using the command 'EXTRACT/NOHEADER        file'
   Extract part 2 into a file, using the command 'EXTRACT/NOHEADER/APPEND file'
   ...
   ...
   Extract part n into a file, using the command 'EXTRACT/NOHEADER/APPEND file'

 - Read warning below BEFORE proceeding!!!

 - Execute as a command procedure, using the following command:
      $ @file



6.2 Warning

It is strongly suggested that the generated command procedure ('file.SHAR' in 
the above example) be carefully checked before execution. It is possible that 
unscrupulous persons might tamper with the source before sending it and 
introduce a virus into the VMS_SHARe'd code. There is nothing that VMS_SHARE 
can do about this automatically. However, since all the files should be human 
readable it should be possible to detect fraudulent code by manual checking.
Certainly the lines starting with '$' symbols, and the TPU code near the
start, should be checked carefully as these are most likely to be troublesome.

WATCHER V2.9-1, SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT, An idle terminal monitor/killer
                                       
   [30-SEP-1994]
   
   WATCHER is an idle terminal monitor. That is, it logs out interactive
   users after a certain period of inactivity. WATCHER is fully
   configurable, allowing the system manager to define which terminals to
   watch, what measurements to use, and how long a terminal should be
   idle before getting zapped. It also includes provisions for preventing
   logouts or overriding inactivity settings based on any combination of
   username, UIC, terminal, privileges, image being run, held identifier,
   and time of day.
   
   WATCHER runs on VAX/VMS V5.0 and later, and OpenVMS AXP V1.0 and
   later.
   
   WATCHER is written primarily in BLISS. Complete sources are provided.

WATCH_MAIL, UTILITIES, Automatically reply to (and/or copy) new mail


  --- DESCRIPTION ---

The purpose of this procedure is to automatically reply to new mail
with a specified message for a specified time interval, and possibly
also copy that mail to one or more other users.  For example, if you
are on vacation or away on business, the replies can be used to let
others know that you won't be able to respond to their mail for some
period of time, and also possibly inform them of other people they
might consider contacting in your absence.  The copies (if enabled)
might be checked by someone else to see if something urgent comes up
in your absence.

  --- INSTALLATION ---

Simply copy the procedure to a private or shared directory:

    $ COPY/LOG  FREEWARE$CD:[WATCH_MAIL]WATCH_MAIL.COM  <destination>

The advantage of a shared location is that it allows multiple people
to use the procedure without incurring the disk space costs of multiple
copies.  The procedure provides several features for facilitating the
use and management of such a shared copy.

  --- USAGE ---

Invoke the procedure interactively (e.g., @WATCH_MAIL), answering the
questions and providing input files as requested.  A batch job will
then be submitted to perform some additional checking and subsequent
mail processing.

Have a nice vacation (or whatever)!

Upon your return, new mail that has been successfully processed by
this procedure will be found in your WATCH_MAIL mail folder.  You may
also have new mail that has come in since the last time the batch job
ran, or to which the procedure has had difficulty replying.

  --- ADVANTAGES ---

The procedure is installed by simply copying the command file, and no
privileges are required to install or use it.  It allows group- and
system-specific tailoring of some default parameters, as may be desired
by a system manager.

There are several features to "delight" the user and system manager,
as detailed in the internal documentation (e.g., specify dates using
weekday notation ("Monday+8:00"), create or edit the reply file after
supplying its specification ("/EDIT"), etc.).

  --- LIMITATIONS ---

The chief limitation is that system crashes and batch queue-related
problems may result in the batch job disappearing, and hence the loss
of automatic replies to and copies of your new mail.

  --- MORE INFORMATION ---

See the extensive documentation contained in the comments within the
command file.  In particular, see the section on known restrictions
and bugs.

On-line help is also available by entering a question mark (?) in
response to one of the procedure's prompts.

X11PERF12, MOTIF_TOYS, X11 server performance test program

The x11perf program runs one or more performance tests and reports timings of
the operations.

Many graphics benchmarks assume that the graphics device is used to display the
output of a single fancy graphics application, and that the user gets his work
done on some other device, like a terminal.  Such benchmarks usually measure
drawing speed for lines, polygons, text, etc.

Since workstations are not used as standalone graphics engines, but as
super-terminals,  x11perf measures window management performance as well as
traditional graphics performace. x11perf includes benchmarks for the time it
takes to create and map windows (as when you start up an application); to map a
pre-existing set of windows onto the screen (as when you deiconify an
application or pop up a menu); and to rearrange windows (as when you slosh
windows to and fro trying to find the one you want).

    One of the motivations of this abacus program is simplicity. This
    was originally a demonstration that I could write a window program.

    Use "mouse-left" to move beads. Note you can move them faster
    by holding down the button and sweeping across beads. Use
    "mouse-right", "C",or  "c" to clear. "Q",
    "q", or "CTRL-C" keys kill program.

XACURSOR, MOTIF_TOYS, Set an animated cursor in a window 

Hi, thanks for using "xacursor".  It is, as its name implies, a
program that animates the cursors in an X-terminal.  The program has
3 modes, it can:

     1. change the cursor to the one specified using the "-cursor" option
     2. show the standard demonstration by the option "-demo"
     3. Most importantly, it changes the cursor in the sequence provided by
        a configuration file, so an animated effect is achieved.

XBATTLE4, GAMES, Multi-user battle strategy game under X

    Xbattle  is a   concurrent  multi-player battle  strategy   game  that
    captures the dynamics  of a  wide  range of military  situations.  The
    game board is a matrix of game squares (or hexagons- see "-hex" option
    below) which can be  occupied by troops  of various colors  or shades.
    The number of troops in a square is indicated by the size of a colored
    troop square (or  circle, with "-hex") within the  game   square.  The
    troops are commanded by clicking the mouse near the edge of the square
    in the direction that the movement is to take place.  The command will
    be acknowledged by the appearance of a command vector, and thereafter,
    in each  update cycle, a certain  proportion  of  the troops will move
    from the source  square  to the destination  square until  the  source
    square is exhausted.  Command vectors can be set in several directions
    at  once, in which case  the movement is   divided evenly between  the
    vector directions, and the  command  remains  active until  cancelled.
    Thus a  trail of squares can be  set up as  a supply   line that  will
    deliver troops steadily at  its endpoint.   The command vector remains
    active even if the  number of troops  in that square is zero, although
    the command vector will then be displayed at half length.  The game is
    concurrent, so that  commands  are given continuously  by  all players
    without waiting for  turns.  Different  combinations of options create
    radically different games.

XBCLOCK, MOTIF_TOYS, D. Binninger's Berlin clock for X displays


This is a program I've written looong time ago as one of my first
experiences with X/11, testing the core functions for color and
stipple. The result of this testing was an awfully written clock,
modelling the arithmetic clock on the Kurfuerstendamm near
Uhlandstrasse in Berlin (Germany - Europe - Northern Hemisphere - Earth -
Solar System ... you know). (I don't know, wether there was another
program of the same clock ever going around the net, if so, please
delete & forget my version ASAP.)

On color displays my first try worked fine, but the set stipple
function left me with an unknown error where X normally crashed
reaching the full hour. I never found out why. I never asked anybody.
Within 3 years.

But I took that program and erased nearly 200 lines.  It isn't less
ugly than before. In fact, now it works also on black and white displays
through the hour, but with the prize that it redisplays the whole clock
every minute. Sometimes you see the flicker, sometimes you don't.
Even worse: I've managed it to delete the error for black and white
displays and put in a X error for color displays. But hopefully this
is also history.

XBILL, GAMES, Battle against "Viruses"

Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin, and
someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people running around
the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus
cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.  Your objective is to
click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat. If one of the people
reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the
virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with your vital
software.

Clicking the button on one of the little people will cause it to cry out in
pain and melt (id software eat your heart out!), dropping the stolen os if it
is carrying one.  If a computer is running Wingdows or is temporarily off, the
os can be dragged back to the computer (or another computer originally running
the same os).

XBLACKJACK21, GAMES, Game of blackjack under X Window


    Xblackjack is a MOTIF/OLIT
    based tool constructed to get you ready for the casino.  It
    was inspired by a book called "Beat the Dealer" by Edward O. Thorp, Ph.D.
    of UCLA.  A number of important statistics are maintained for display,
    and used by the program to implement Thorp's "Complete Point System"
    (high-low system).
    Harvey Dubner presented the strategy at a panel session of the 1963
    Fall Joint Computer Conference.

    The COUNT
    used by the strategy starts at zero after the shuffle.
    When you see a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 you add one to the COUNT.
    Subtract one when you see a ten, face card, or ace.
    The 7, 8, and 9 have no effect on the COUNT.
    When the COUNT is positive your odds are favorable;  you should bet more,
    and then stand, double down, and split more often.

    The complete system takes the number of uplayed cards into account; a
    COUNT of 2 in the last hand is better than a COUNT of 2 in the first hand.

    All selections are made using the LEFT
    mouse button.
    Bets are placed using the scale labelled "your bet".
    Choices are made by clicking on the
    pushbuttons (split, double down, hit, or stand).
    
    Game status and results are shown in the message pushbutton
    below the card area.  Pressing it will reveal the high-low
    INDEX calculation:

                (COUNT*100)/UNSEEN

    The strategy recommends you bet half the INDEX in favorable situations,
    and only buy insurance when the INDEX is greater than 8.
    When  making a choice, the relevant table corresponding to the best
    choice is revealed too:


                Pair Spliting

                Doubling Down

                Drawing or Standing with Hard Hands

                Drawing or Standing with Soft Hands

    Press the message button repeatedly to cycle through the relevant tables.
    There are separate standing tables for HARD and SOFT hands.  A hand is SOFT
    if it contains an Ace that can contribute 11 to the total without
    exceeding 21.  All other hands are HARD.

    When making choices, first decide if you should split (when you can), then
    whether or not to double down, and finally if you should hit or stand.

    Test the strategy using the slider to the right of the card area.
    The program will play unattended, until you return the slider to the
    bottom.  You can stop by pressing the bottom area of the scale to return
    the slider there immediately, or click on the message pushbutton.

XBLOCKBUSTER, GAMES, Break out type game under X

    XBlockbuster is a variation of the break-out type games, only a bit more
    complex in the type of bricks it has and effects the bricks have.  It is
    X11 based.
 
    The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by
    busting through blocks of various types with a ball that reflects from
    the blocks and from a pallet controlled by mouse movement.

    The ball must be seen as a high-energy particle that penetrates the block
    before being repelled.
    If it gets repelled into another block it will find its own way out again.
    This process, which often leads to surprises, is known as tunnelling.

    (By design, tunnelling only occurs along a horizontal connection between
    blocks or along the vertical sides, so never vertically between blocks.)

    As the game progresses, balls are launched faster and faster.
    When the speed has reached it maximum, the pallet is gradually,
    though cumulatively, shrunk.
    Be aware that the maximum launch speed (see below),
    and hence the point from which the pallet is shrunk,
    is only 2/3 of the speed limit, and the effect is much larger than that of
    hitting a speeder (but of course you may hit them often).

    The pallet is convex.
    Hence reflection is a function of both the incoming angle and the
    excentricity of the point of impact.
    If the pallet is sufficiently convex (differs from stage to stage), the
    ball may even rebound.

    The mouse buttons control the pallet:
    LEFT moves it up one row, MIDDLE moves it all the way down again.
    Each ball is launched with the RIGHT mouse button.

    A stage can be halted by closing the window.
    Be advised however, that the game will resume immediately upon opening the
    window.
    If no-pause has not
    been selected (see below), moving the pointer out
    of the XBlockBuster window will also stop the action.

    During a game, the score, number of balls left and speeds are shown.
    The speeds are represented by up to 3 thin lines (one for each ball),
    above a thick line representing the speed limit.
    The short vertical bar indicates the launch speed
    (black upon reaching the maximum launch speed, white below that).
    If, during a stage, you have busted a 'double' or 'triple' brick, your
    bonus multiplier will also be displayed at the top.

    A game can be saved in between stages with the Escape key.
    At this point, as well as at the end of the game, your score is logged.
    The score board shows scores, number of balls left between parentheses if
    any and user name.
    Finally, an indication of your current pallet shrinkage is given.

    At any time, 'q' or 'Q' may be pressed to quit the present game.  This
    quits
    the game immediately, so may be useful if your boss is closing in.  Also
    useful if you mess up on the first stage, and thus, continuing play of that
    game is no longer worth it.

    'P' or 'p' may be pressed during the game to toggle the no-pause option.
    When no-pause is active, the game will continue even when the mouse pointer
    is outside the window.  With it turned off, action stops once the mouse
    pointer is outside the window.

XBOING V 2.4 port under OpenVMS    Dec 1996
===============================

Xboing 2.4 can be built with DEC C on Alpha (etsted with DEC C 5.2 & DEC C 5.2)
and DEC C or GCC on VAX  (DEC C 5.0 or DEC C 5.2, GCC 2.5.8)

You need to define XBOING24_DIR to point a directory where you'll put level
files and high score file:

$ create/dir disk:[directory]
$ set prot=(w:rwe) disk:[directory]
$ define/SYSTEM XBOING24_DIR  disk:[directory]
$ COPY HIGH.SCORE XBOING_24_DIR:* /lo/prot=(w:rwe)
$ set def [.levels]
$ copy *.* XBOING24_DIR:* /lo/prot=(w:re)

Nota: High score is now working !!

OBJ and binaries files are provided (DEC C 5.0, VMS 6.1-1H2 for Alpha; DEC C
5.0 VMS 6.1 and  GCC 2.5.8 VMS 6.1 fro VAX).

If you want to rebuild:

Compilation:
===========
COMPILE_DECC.COM          : compile with DEC C
COMPILE_DECC_AUDIO.COM    : compile with DEC C (with Amd audio support)
COMPILE_GCC.COM           : compile with GCC
COMPILE_GCC_AUDIO.COM     : compile with GCC (with Amd audio support)

Nota: Amd (8 bits 8 Khz) audio support is not really functionnal. I'll try to
implement sound with MMOV (MultiMedia services for OpenVms).

It can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and displays the date when a mouse

most other fonts that contain all of the digits.  It can also do some funky
psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use the "shape" extension so that the

********************************************************************************

Xdemineur is not just another version of the minefield game, it's the best!

DESCRIPTION

The object of the game is to find the location of the mines and to mark their
location by placing a small flag.  You have exactly as many flags as there are
mines, no more, no less.  The number of flags that remain to be placed is
displayed in the top left corner and a timer is displayed in the top right
corner.

The game is played using a three buttons mouse.  The left button is used to
uncover the cell on which you click (hoping that a mine is not hidden there)
and the right button is used to place a flag (this indicates that there is a
mine here).  If you click again with the right button on a cell that has a
flag, the flag is changed into a question mark: this if you are trying to guess
the possible location of specific mines.  One more click with the right button
and the question mark disappears.  Clicking with both buttons on an uncovered
cell which has all its flags uncovers the surrounding cells (this will save a
lot of time).

The numbers displayed in uncovered cells indicate the number of mines which
are located all around (for example, a 3 means that there are three mines
within the 8 adjacent cells).  The whole game relies on the use of these
numbers.

To start playing, click randomly to uncover some cells until you find an
"opening" (a number of cells that will be uncovered at the same time) or
specify the option -ouvre which automatically finds an opening.

Finally, to start a new game, just click on the little yellow face above the
playfield.

XEPHEM28, MOTIF_TOYS, Interactive Astronomical Ephemeris program for X Window

			Welcome to xephem v2.8

Xephem is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for X Windows systems.
For a full list of features and the latest news, please see the xephem home
page at:

    http://iraf.noao.edu/~ecdowney/xephem.html.


The complete xephem version 2.8 release kit is a compressed tar file at:

    ftp://iraf.noao.edu/contrib/xephem/xephem_2.8/xephem_2.8.tar.gz.


Xephem requires at least X11R4 and OSF/Motif 1.1. Xephem has been built on
many UNIX systems as well as VMS. A list of known ported systems and building
hints may be found in the file INSTALL. A summary of the changes since v2.7.1
appears at the end of this notice.


There is only a small manual, but there is extensive on-line help, including
step-by-step examples. So, the first thing to do is to build xephem then start
selecting the Help buttons.  A good order to read the help entries is the way
they are listed in the Help pulldown off the Main menu. Instructions for
building xephem may be found in the file INSTALL.


Xephem uses several X resources to name supporting files and directories. The
sample X defaults file, XEphem.ad, and the fallback resources in xephem.c, have
these defined relative to this top level directory structure I have included in
this distribution kit. You may want to rearrange things for your installation.
See the file INSTALL for a list of all the files used by xephem at runtime. The
comments throughout XEphem.ad will also help you set up all the X resource
defaults for xephem.


I would like to hear what you think of xephem, good and bad. If you drop me a
quick note I will save your email address and directly send you announcements of
changes. Thank you for your interest in xephem.

Xephem 2.8 for OpenVMS                             December 1995
======================

If you want an access to the stars and objects databases, you need to define
a directory tree pointed by the rooted logical XEPHEM_DIR:

$ define/trans=conc XEPHEM_DIR disk:[directory.xephem.]

Under XEPHEM_DIR, you need at least AUXIL, EDB and WORK directories:

$ dir xephem_dir:[000000]

Directory XEPHEM_DIR:[000000]

AUXIL.DIR;1         EDB.DIR;1           WORK.DIR;1

Total of 3 files.

You need to copy the content of original AUXIL and EDB directories from the 
Xephem distribution. WORK directory may be under user's directory tree. In this
case, each user needs to update the resource file XEPHEM.DAT.

XEPHEM.DAT may be placed under SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] or under
SYS$LOGIN:

Compilation & link: 

Il you want to rebuild Xephem, you'll find various COMPILE*.COM and LINK*.COM
procedures to match your compiler (VAX C or DEC C on VAX, DEC C on Alpha). 
The link procedure can automagically sense the version of DECW/Motif 
installed on your system and select the right option file.

Enjoy !!

XFISHTANK22, MOTIF_TOYS, Transform your X screen in fish tank v 2.2


       ********************** FUN WITH FISH *********************

There are lots of programs for lots of platforms to make fish swim in the
background of your screen.  This is a modification of an old one called
xfish (also called Xaquarium), that I have added more features to.

To not confuse you (or confuse you more) I will call this modified xfish
"xfishtank". ['A rose by any other name...' and all that]


How is this different?  I started with you basic xfish, and I kept the
bubbles (actually I re-wrote some of the bubble code, but it LOOKS the same).
I changed the rest of the code to allow any number of multicolored fish to
swim around.  Each fish can have up to 255 colors, but on startup the program
takes all the colors from all the fish, and squeezes them down to all fit
into the default colormap as best it can.  Any fish can be any size in
width and height.  To make them look more like they are swimming, fish are
animated (Very simple 2 frame animation) [I got this idea from watching
the AfterDark fish on the Mac].  Fish CANNOT swim over each other, they
will turn around if they are about to collide.  I had a version that
had fish swiming over each other, it was WAY to slow to be something to run
on your background while working, so I deleted it.

    square you must have more influence on it than your adversary.
    If you have more influence than your opponent on a square occupied by him,
    his castle is destroyed.

     REMEMBER : you must have more influence than him at the end of the
     21 turns !!! Do NOT try to kill him every time. it can cost you the
     victory !!

XGALA13, GAMES, Galaga arcade game for X WINDOW



                              XGalaga v1.3a
                     Copyright (c) 1995 Joe Rumsey
                            <ogre@netcom.com>

   Basic instructions:
    It's Galaga, you know how to play Galaga, stop bothering me.
    (Ship follows the mouse, button fires.  Auto-fire by holding it
     down, so no-one accuses me of breaking their mouse!)
 
  Keyboard commands:

    p - pauses
    q - end this game
    b - Toggle buffering (flicker vs. speed.)
    o - Toggle OR mode.  Don't use this, it sucks.

XGAS, MOTIF_TOYS,  Animated simulation of an ideal gas


xgas is a physical simulation of an ideal gas in a heated box.
Gas molecules move around the box with velocities
dependent on their temperature.
A chamber consisting of two boxes contains the gas molecules;
the temperature of each box can be independently controlled
by a scrollbar.
When gas molecules collide with the walls, their temperature
approaches that of the box.
 
Use mouse button 1 to create molecules one at a time
at the cursor position.

Use mouse button 2 to create the maximum number of molecules
at the cursor position.

XGas port under OpenVMS                     December 1995
=======================


XGas compiles out of the box under OpenVMS. However, you need DECUS X11R4 XAW &
XMU library kit available on your system (you can grab it at
ada.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr or ftp2.cnam.fr servers into [.DECWINDOWS] directory,
or find it at DECUS Web server www.decus.org).

Object and executables are also provided.

To rebuild, various COMPILE*.COM and LINK*.COM procedure are provided.

The resource file XGAS.DAT may be installed either under your SYS$LOGIN
directory or (for a system-wide availability) under
SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAUKTS.USER] directory with World Read acces.

Enjoy !!

DISK$FREEWAREV4_2:[XGLOBE]FREEWARE_README.TXT;2
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
XGLOBE, MOTIF_TOYS, XWindow spinning earth
        
        This version of  XGLOBE  came  from the original source posted in
        the  SPEZKO::DECW_EXAMPLES notes conference  and  was  ported  to
        OpenVMS AXP.  Included in  this saveset are the various sizes and
        orientations of the globe pixmap.   There  is  the original BLISS
        code included to both shrink and rotate  the globe pixmap.  These
        were used on OpenVMS VAX to create the various pixmap datafiles.

        
        ** NOTE **

        You must have the logical name  DEMOS defined to point to the top
        level directory that contains the XGLOBE directory.   All command
        procedures rely on this being defined.  For  example  if  all the
        XGLOBE  files are in WORK:[SMITH.XGLOBE] then you need a  logical
        name defined as follows:
        
        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE DEMOS WORK:[SMITH.] 

        **  Ensure you include the "." after the last directory name  **

        
        To build...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                        
        $ @DEMOS:[XGLOBE]BUILD_XGLOBE.COM p1    
        
        Where p1 = 64, 128 or 256 for globe size (eg: 128x128 pixels)
        
        This will build either a OpenVMS VAX or  OpenVMS  AXP image based
        on what architecture it is run on.
                                                                     
        
        To run...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        
        $ @DEMOS:[XGLOBE]START_XGLOBE.COM p1 p2
        
        ;where p1 = 64, 128 or 256 for globe size (eg: 128x128 pixels)
        ;where p2 = R for rotated or leave blank for vertical orientation
        
        This will  start up the appropiate architecture version of XGLOBE
        of either 64x64,  128x128  or  256x256  pixels in size and either
        vertically oriented or rotated to the left.
                
        
        XGLOBE options...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        Besides the p1, p2 parameters,  XGLOBE also allows you to specify
        the window  positioning  (-x  -y),  delay (-d) between frames and
        (-t) title of  the  window.    You  can  edit  the values used in
        START_XGLOBE.COM.
        
        $ XGLOBE :== "$ DEMOS:[XGLOBE]XGLOBE_256_AXP"
        $ XGLOBE -h

        Usage: demos:[xglobe]xglobe_256_axp.exe;8 [ options ]

             where options are one or more of:
             [-x #] [-y #] [-d delay] [-t WindowTitle]
                                                  

        Revision history...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        11-22-92 - previous  version  would  consume 100% of the CPU in a
        dead loop, waiting to rotate the  pixmap.    Added  a lib$wait in
        XGLOBE.C's  main  loop  to reduce the CPU  to  about  3%.    This
        required adjusting the -d value used in START_XGLOBE.COM as well.

XHOST, MOTIF_TOYS, Server access control program for X

The xhost program is used to add and delete host names or user names to the
list allowed to make connections to the X server.  In the case of hosts, this
provides a rudimentary form of privacy control and security.  It is only
sufficient for a workstation (single user) environment, although it does limit
the worst abuses.  Environments which require more sophisticated measures
should implement the user-based mechanism or use the hooks in the protocol for
passing other authentication data to the server.

This game was originally written by Yoshihiro Satoh of HP.  I have made a
modest attempt to replicate Domain/JewelBox under X.

I have somewhat rudely taken the bitmaps from the original game and
created this version.  I hold the copyright for the code, as I created
it, but I hold no claim to the bitmaps which were freely
distributed with the Domain version.

REDISTRIBUTION in source or binary from is permited as long as adequate
notation of the originators is retained, including the developer of the 
original Domain/Jewlbox, Yoshihiro Satoh.
NOTE: I do not claim to hold any copyright on columns games, Jewelbox, or any
related name or icon.  I have written the source and thats all I hold claim to.

 Description:
      XJig is a puzzle, that tries to replicate a jigsaw puzzle on the
      screen as close as possible. Gif-images can be loaded and sliced
      into pieces and as in every jigsaw puzzle, the goal is to
      set the parts together again.

 Special effects:
      - Tiles are freely rotatable with intuitive pointer movement.
      - Tiles can even be flipped to their back (to mirror them).
      - Tiles can be shown as shaped windows on the desktop.

XJIG v 2.4 port under OpenVMS:                         31 December 1997
=============================

XJIG is a fabulous puzzle maker from GIF images. After making it, you can
solve the puzzle interactively !!

XJIG works either on VAX & Alpha. If you have a display with MIT SHAPE
extension, it is better (an Alpha or an X terminal), but Xjig also works on
displays without shapes.

Rebuild:
=======

You need at least DEC C++ 5.0 and DEC C 5.0 to rebuild from sources (not tested
with version 4 compilers). Use COMPILE_DECCXX.COM procedure to recompile and
either LINK_VAX.COM or LINK_AXP.COM to link.

Binaries and object files are provided (objects are in AXPOBJS.ZIP and
VAXOBJS.ZIP files). They are produced under VAX VMS 6.1 with DEC C++ 5.0 and
DEC C 5.0 and under Alpha VMS 6.2 with DEC C++ 5.2 and DEC C 5.2

Notes:
=====

Sometimes, you need to reduce the colour number of the GIF image (try with
mconvert from ImageMagick):

$ mconvert -colors 128 toto.gif toto.gif

Provided GIFs:
===============

TINA.GIF is provided by the author of Xjig. I've put another image,
VALLOIRE.GIF

xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap.  It opens a window that looks
like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms and Modifier
bits that key generates.  Clicking on a key simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease
events on the window of your choice.  It is possible to change the KeySyms
and Modifiers generated by a key through a mouse-based interface.  This
program can also write an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes

XLOCK, MOTIF_TOYS, Locks the local X display till a password is entered

xlock locks the X server till the user enters their password at the keyboard.
While xlock is running, all new server connections are refused. The screen
saver is disabled. The mouse cursor is turned off. The screen is blanked and a
changing pattern is put on the screen. The pattern changes after timeout
seconds. If a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for
the password of the user who started xlock.

If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X server
is restored.  When typing the password, characters are echoed to the screen as
question marks (?), and Control-U and Control-H are active as kill and erase
respectively.  To return to the locked screen, click in the small icon version
of the changing pattern.

XLOCKMORE310, MOTIF_TOYS, X Window Screen Locker with many graphic demos


          >>> NEW release of Xlockmore (August 1996)   <<<<

  Under X, run xlock.  The screen will clear, and some pretty animated
  picture (exactly which depends on which module is active) will appear
  on the screen.  If you hit a key, then the screen will clear, and
  (unless you've changed the application defaults file that I packaged
  with this) you'll get a black screen with some graphics in the top
  center.  These graphics consist of a reduced size image of the module
  you were viewing, the name of the user who executed xlock, and
  password prompt field, and some short instructions.
 
  At this point, you can either click on the graphic to return to xlock,
  or you can type a password.  If the password is verifiable as the
  root password, or the password of the user listed above, then xlock
  will terminate.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP XLOCK WITHOUT SHUTTING
  DOWN THE X SERVER.  That's what makes it a lock.

  There are two sets of resources for XLock.  The first set are (what I
  call) global XLock resources, while the second set consists of
  module-specific resources.  I'll get more into modules a little further
  below.
 
  The global resources are:
        XLock.mode: This sets the module.  More about this later.
        XLock.font: This is the font used on the password entry screen.
        XLock.background: The background color for the password entry screen.
        XLock.foreground: The foreground color for the password entry screen.
        XLock.username: The label for the field indicating the user name.
        XLock.password: The label for the password prompt.
        XLock.info: The "short instructions" to print.
        XLock.validate: A message to display while checking the password
        XLock.invalid: A message to display if the password is incorrect
        XLock.nice: How much XLock should nice itself.
        XLock.timeout: How long to wait idle at the password prompt.
        XLock.timeelapsed: Message to see how long lock running (yes or no)
        XLock.mono: Monochrome mode (yes or no)
        XLock.nolock: disable the lock mechanism (yes or no)
        XLock.remote: allow remote locking (meaningless under linux)
        XLock.allowroot: allow the root password to unlock (yes or no)
        XLock.enablesaver: allow the system screensaver to work (yes or no)
        XLock.allowaccess: allow other clients to connect while active
        XLock.echokeys: Echo "?" for each password keypress (yes or no)
        XLock.usefirst: Ignore the first character typed (yes or no)
        XLock.verbose: Verbose mode. (yes or no)
        XLock.inwindow: allow the xlock to run in a window (yes or no)
        XLock.inroot: allow the xlock to run in the root window (yes or no)
        XLock.grabmouse: Grab the keyboard and mouse (yes or no)
 
  XLock has a number of modules which it can display.  (See the man page
  for a complete list).  It turns out that each module is characterized
  by a number of initializations, separated by a number of "draws".
  Each module has the following resources defined:

        XLock.<module>.delay: How long to wait between draws (usec)
        XLock.<module>.batchcount: May mean various things (see man page).
        XLock.<module>.cycles: Controls the timeout of screen (see man page).
        XLock.<module>.saturation: Saturation (as in HSV) of colors to use.

  I did not write the original algorithms in any of the lock screens
  (except wator, bug, life1d, demon, and ant), although I did
  convert many of the new ones to run with xlock.  I tried to follow
  the original style of Patrick Naughton.  Updates are made at
  ftp.x.org in directory /contrib/applications.  Many of the additions
  were "borrowed" from xscreensaver (Jamie Zawinski <jwz@netscape.com>).
  Some of the others were "borrowed" from old demos from Sun.

  I will consider putting new ones in if (1) they are more or less public
  domain (i.e. BSD, sorry no GNU copyrights), (2) they are neat (I am
  biased towards mathematically based programs (especially the Computer
  Recreations of Scientific American)), and (3) I have the time.

XLOCKMORE39, MOTIF_TOYS, X Window Screen Locker with many graphic demos



  Under X, run xlock.  The screen will clear, and some pretty animated
  picture (exactly which depends on which module is active) will appear
  on the screen.  If you hit a key, then the screen will clear, and
  (unless you've changed the application defaults file that I packaged
  with this) you'll get a black screen with some graphics in the top
  center.  These graphics consist of a reduced size image of the module
  you were viewing, the name of the user who executed xlock, and
  password prompt field, and some short instructions.
 
  At this point, you can either click on the graphic to return to xlock,
  or you can type a password.  If the password is verifiable as the
  root password, or the password of the user listed above, then xlock
  will terminate.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP XLOCK WITHOUT SHUTTING
  DOWN THE X SERVER.  That's what makes it a lock.

XMAHJONG, GAMES, Version of the solitaire mahjongg game undef X Window

MAHJONGG is an ancient chinese game usually played by four players with tiles
similar to dominos.  This is an X windows version for the solitaire game
originally seen on the PC and later ported to SunView.  It also has a new
tournament option.
  


/*
 * Copyright 1990 Jeff S. Young
 */

This is version 2 of the game xmahjongg.  It has been almost totally rewrit-
ten.  I have run this program on SUN systems (3 and 4) and Michael Campanella
has provided VMS help for xmahjongg.

Xmahjongg has 2 new features which will make life enjoyable:
	1) we now have COLOR (well its about time)
	2) we now have different board layouts
See the man page for information on these features

The layout files are a generalization of the board layout.  The default is
the standard "pyramid".  You can create you own layouts.  See the man page
on how to do this.

I would appreciate hearing about new layouts and any bugs which are found.
I will post a patch when enough data comes in.

Remember that Mark A. Holm has the original copyright on the look of the tiles.
See his README file which is included below.

Enjoy!

XMFRACT14, MOTIF_TOYS, A freeware fractal generation program


      This is xmfract 1.4, an X11R[5/6] Motif program based upon a
      popular DOS freeware program named Fractint. It is a true graphic
      user interface quite different from that program.

      The program will calculate, display and manipulate over 90 discrete
      fractal types with very fast algorithms. Other features include zooming,
      animation (color cycling), color editing, spherical projection, and an
      amazing wealth of parameters. There are too many features to list here.

      Also included are dozens of ancillary files such as color map files,
      parameter files, formula files, and an extensive on-line help system.

      System requirements:
        The program is known run to under the following operating systems:

          OSF/1 (with Motif 1.2 or later)
          Solaris 2.x (with Motif 1.2 or later)
          Linux 1.94 or later (with XFree 3.1 and Motif 1.2 or later)
          HPUX (with Motif 1.2 or later)
          AIX (with Motif 1.2 or later)

     ==> AND NOW OPENVMS !!!

XMORPH, GRAPHICS, Digital image warping (morphing) for X windows 12-Jul-96

Written and Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996 by Michael J. Gourlay

NO WARRANTEES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

Xmorph is a digital image warping program, also known as a "morphing"
program.  It runs under the X Window System, using the X library, X
toolkit, X miscellaneous utilities, and the Athena widgets, all of
which are publically available from MIT, and part of the typical X
installation.  It is written in ANSI C.

Xmorph loads, saves, warps, and dissolves images, and loads, saves,
creates, and manipulates control meshes which determine the warping.
Xmorph has help pages built into it, so no external documentation is
necessary.

---

FURTHER READING:

Morphing was invented and first used by Industrial Light and Magic.
The original author of the first morphing algorithym is Douglas B.
Smythe.  If you can get ahold of the article, read Douglas B.
Smythe's article ``A Two-Pass Mesh Warping Algorithm for Object
Transformation and Image Interpolation'', ILM Technical Memo #1030,
Computer Graphics Department, Lucasfilm Ltd., 1990.

The first commercial use of morphing was in a sequence in the movie
_Willow_.  Since then, morphing has been wildely used.  Among the
more memorable morphing sequences are those found in Michael
Jackson's "Black or White" video, and in the movie _T2_.

Be sure to read George Wolberg's _Digital Image Warping_.  I've
corresponded with George Wolberg about this program.  I asked him
whether he considered xmorph to be a violation of copyright of the
algorithms in his book, since there are similarities.  Mr. Wolberg
assured me that my algorithms were different enough that there was no
problem, and he seemed very interested and enthused about the
existence of my public domain implementation.  Also, the algorithms
published in Mr. Wolberg's book had bugs in them which I and other
xmorph contributors have found, and those bugs have been reported to
George Wolberg, who verified my corrections to be proper.  I was also
told that these bugs were propagated on to Lucasfilm, although I've
heard from no one at Lucasfilm directly.

---

DISPLAY HARDWARE:

Xmorph is designed to work on static gray 1-bit, pseudo-color 8-bit,
and true-color 24-bit displays.  If you are running on a static gray
or pseudo-color display, the images that show up in the xmorph image
panels are dithered (which makes them look grainy), but the images
stored internally are full-color non-dithered, and the image files
written by xmorph are full-color non-dithered.  Don't let the
relatively poor image quality of the dithered image panels concern
you.  They are only "schematic" images to let you manipulate the
meshes.  Remember that the xmorph graphical user interface is
primarily used to manipulate meshes, not to display images.  To view
your morphs in full glory requires that you make an animation of your
image sequence.

A note about color dithering:

I've made the color dithering routines somewhat generic, in the sense
that you can choose the number of bits per channel that you want to
use when creating the so-called "dithering colormap".  Look in
diw_map.h.  You can change the number of bits used to represent each of
the channels red, green, and blue.  It's generally believed that the
human eye is moste sensative to green, and least sensative to blue, so
it makes sense to give more bits to green and fewer to blue.  However,
one could imagine that somebody could prefer to give more bits to
another color, or whatever you want.

Also, for 16-bit colormapped displays (which are becoming more common
now), you could conceivably use up 8 bits or more for your colormap
without worrying about interference with other programs.  It'd
recommend using a RGB-332 dithering colormap in that case.

Another thing:  Some monochrome displays simulate PseudoColor by
allowing the applications to have a colormap.  This makes application
programming more simple.  The X server then has the responsibility of
dithering from color to monochrome.  Some such monochrome systems
have a 4-bit PseudoColor simulation mode which could conceivably be
used with xmorph, if some changes were made in the dither_image
routine in image.c.  The colormap situation is easy to deal with:
Just use 1 bit per channel to get an RGB-111 dithering colormap.

---

TARGA IMAGE FILE FORMAT:

I've been asked by many people what image file format xmorph uses.  I
use Targa.  I intend to use others in the future, but for now Targa
works well because it's sufficiently flexible to use a number of
storage schemes (including colormapped, 24-bit true color, and 32-bit
alpha true-color, and gray scale) and it provides for some
compression using a form of run-length encoding, which is modified to
minimize the worst-case expansion.

Right now, Xmorph only reads and writes Targa image files.  There is
a PBMplus (and netpbm) utility to convert Targas to and from other
formats.  Also, Art Department Pro's Professional Conversion Pack
(which runs on Amiga systems) has a Targa loader and saver.  Targa
files are also viewable from Image Magick utilities, but they have to
have a .tga extension to them for some reason (probably because Targa
files don't have a magic number in their header identifying them as
Targas.)

---

CREATING MOTION ANIMATIONS:

I've been asked about programs which convert these images to
animations.  You can use PBMplus or netpbm or ImageMagick to convert
Targa to other image formats.  Use mpeg_encode from Berkeley to
create MPEG animations.  Also see Andy Thaler's WWW home page for
links to some relavent programs.

Please report to me if you have animations that are cool that you'd
like other people to see.

    I could simulate it.

    The top of the window shows what certain mouse inputs are. These are
    only activated inside the widget itself. (Clicking on the mouse icons
    is ignored).

    Use "mouse-left" to move ccw.

    Use the key pad or "R" keys for other ways to move other than CCW. (NOTE:
    one must have the keyboardFocusPolicy set to pointer).

    Use the slider to change complexity.

    Use the menu mode to change period of turn.

    Use "mouse-center", "P", or "p" to toggle the practice
    mode (in practice mode the record should be "VOID").

    "mouse-right", "R", or "r", to randomize (this must be
    done first to set a new record).

    "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys kill program.

    Use the key pad or "R" keys for other ways to move other than CCW. (NOTE:
    one must have the keyboardFocusPolicy set to pointer).

    Use the slider to change complexity.

    Use the toggle to toggle the orient lines.

XNEKO, MOTIF_TOYS, XWindow Cat and Mouse Hack

        The XNEKO demo turns the pointer into a  mouse pixmap and opens a
        window with a cat in it that chases the  mouse pointer around the
        screen.
        
        This version of XNEKO came from the original source posted in the
        SPEZKO::DECW_EXAMPLES  notes conference and was ported to OpenVMS
        AXP.

                                       
        ** NOTE **

        You must have the logical name  DEMOS defined to point to the top
        level directory  that  contains the XNEKO directory.  All command
        procedures rely on  this  being  defined.  For example if all the
        XNEKO files are in  WORK:[SMITH.XNEKO]  then  you  need a logical
        name defined as follows:
        
        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE DEMOS WORK:[SMITH.] 

        **  Ensure you include the "." after the last directory name  **

        
        To build...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                        
        $ @DEMOS:[XNEKO]BUILD_XNEKO.COM
        
        This will  build  either a OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP image based
        on what architecture it is run on.            

        
        To run...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        
        $ @DEMOS:[XNEKO]START_XNEKO.COM        
        
        This will start up the appropiate architecture version of XNEKO.
        START_XNEKO_PAUSE.COM uses the pause window instead.

Xodometer, MOTIF_TOYS, Mouse Odometer

Xodometer measures how far your mouse travels in miles or kilometers!  It
was written as more of an exercize, than as a useful program (obviously).
The end result of the exercize, however, yeilded this fun little
application.  It was inspired by a similar application I saw demonstrated
for OS/2.

The main window contains both a trip odometer (resettable at your whim),
and a non-resettable odometer (which remembers its value between program
invocations).  The program is controled via a pop-up menu activated by
pressing mouse button 3 in the Xodometer window.

This program truly epitomizes the expression "X toys." :-)  Its completely
useless, but fun to look at.  Happy motoring.

XPAINT-244, GRAPHICS, X Window painting program and image editor

Release notes for XPaint 2.4.4
------------------------------

NOTE: This version of XPaint is released and maintained by Torsten Martinsen
(bullestock@dk-online.dk). It is based on XPaint 2.1.1, which was written by
David Koblas. Please do NOT send bug reports etc. to David Koblas.

KNOWN BUGS

The 'Water Colour Brush' tool does not work well on colour mapped visuals with
256 colours. The reasons are:
	1) It is too slow. This could perhaps be fixed.
	2) All entries in the colour map are used up in rather quickly.
	3) The limited number of colours give rise to round-off errors
	   when computing the new pixel colours.

Undo/Redo exhibits some weirdness in certain circumstances.

Selecting a region enables the 'Last Filter' menu item.

If you are running a program which uses a lot of colourmap entries, such as
Netscape without a private colormap loaded, you may see this error when
starting XPaint:

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  14 (X_GetGeometry)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  686
  Current serial number in output stream:  686

-Torsten Martinsen (bullestock@dk-online.dk), June 1996

Xpaint 2.4.4 OpenVMS port:   August 1996
=========================

This new version was ported on Alphastation 255 with VMS 6.2, DEC C 5.2 
and Motif 1.2-4 . I was able to build Xpaint on VAX with VAX C and DEC C, 
but the resulting code crash. VAX olbs are provided in the [.SRC] directory 
for those who want to debug the beast.

EXE, Objs and Olb provided (Alpha): VMS 6.1-1H2, DEC C 5.0, MOTIF 1.2-3

Known bug on Alpha:
------------------
Sometimes, a crash occurs when saving a PNG image.

------------------------------

NOTE: This version of XPaint is released and maintained by Torsten Martinsen
(bullestock@dk-online.dk). It is based on XPaint 2.1.1, which was written by
David Koblas. Please do NOT send bug reports etc. to David Koblas.

To compile this program, you will need:

        - an ANSI C compiler (such as GCC),
        - the Xpm library, version 3.4c or later

-Torsten Martinsen (bullestock@dk-online.dk), August 1996

Xpaint 2.4.7 OpenVMS port:                   Jan 1997
=========================

This new version was ported on Alphastation with VMS 6.2, DEC C 5.2 and Motif
1.2-4 . I was also able to build Xpaint on VAXstation with VAX C and DEC C,
but only the DEC C resulting code is working. (Note that with the previous
version 2.4.4 the VAX code crashes even compiled with DEC C).

Executables provided:
--------------------
VAX-VMS 6.1 built with DEC C 5.0 & DECW/MOTIF 1.2
Alpha-VMS 6.2 built with DEC C 5.2 & DECW/Motif 1.2-4

Obj files and libraries are also provided for VAX and Alpha to help relink.

Ressource file:
---------------

You can copy XPAINT.DAT file under SYS$LOGIN (or under
SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] for a system-wide definition).

Porting notes:
-------------

1) The "readonly" variable was renamed into "Readonly" to avoid collision with
   reserved word into all source files.

2) Adding some M_PI definition where missing.

3) Collision at link time between graphicCreate and GraphicCreate routines.
   We rename GraphicCreate into Graphic_Create to avoid double definition
   and crash at run time ...

XAW library used : the XAW3D available with Johannes Plass's 
Ghostview-VMS 2.7.6

You can find Ghostview 2.7.6 distribution at ada.cenaath.cena.dgac.fr and
ftp2.cnam.fr (into [.DECWINDOWS] directory) or at the  original ftp site
iphthf.physik.uni-mainz.de


Known bugs:
-----------
A crash generally occurs when saving a PNG image (tried with PNG 0.88 and
PNG 0.89C).  However, you can read a PNG image without troublen, but you must
save in GIF, TIFF or JPEG.

XPAT2, GAMES, Various Patience (Solitaire) card games for X11

Xpat 2.0 port under OpenVMS:                  December 1997
============================

Xpat2 gives you the ability to play various solitaire card games.

The version built is the Motif version with XPM rounded cards.
There is also a Xlib version (not tested on VMS).

Installation:
------------

You can play xith xpat2 on the distribution by invoking SETUP_VMS.COM
procedure (you must set the LANG logical name before or comment it if you want
English language).

For a regular installation, you need to copy the whole [.LIB...] tree on
another location and point it via the XPAT_DIR rooted logical:

$ cre/dir disk:[toto.xpat]
$ def/trans=conc XPAT_DIR disk:[toto.xpat.]
$ backup/log [.LIB...]*.* XPAT_DIR:[000000...]*
$ set prot=(w:re) xpat_dir:[000000...]*.*

You need to copy XPAT.DAT resource file either under your SYS$LOGIN directory
or under the decw$defaults location:

$ copy xpat.dat sys$common:[decw$defaults.user]* /lo/prot=(w:re)

 VMS resource file XPAT.DAT was built from the [.SRC]XPAT.AD file

Rebuild:
-------
You can either relink (with LINK_AXP.COM and LINK_VAX.COM procedure into [.SRC]
directory) or recompile before relink (with COMPILE_DECC.COM procedure). Before
relinking, please unzip the obj archives AXPOBJS.ZIP or VAXOBJS.ZIP

On VAX, with Motif 1.2, XmuFillRoundedRectangle is undefined. I have commented
the invocation of DEC XMU library in VAX opt files and provided an old DECUS
XMU library which works well.

XPM libraries are also provided for VAX and Alpha.

Enjoy !!

XPDF, Software, VMS/X11 reader for Adobe Acrobat etc. files
xpdf
====
and pdftops

version 0.5 (beta)
96-may-23

The xpdf and pdftops software and documentation are
copyright 1996 Derek B. Noonburg.

Email: derekn@ece.cmu.edu
WWW: http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/dn0o/xpdf/xpdf.html

The PDF data structures, operators, and specification
are copyright 1995 Adobe Systems Inc.


What is xpdf?
-------------

Xpdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  (These are
also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's
PDF software.)  Xpdf runs under UNIX or VMS and the X Window System.

Xpdf is designed to be small and efficient.  It does not use the Motif
or Xt libraries.  It uses standard X fonts.  Xpdf is quite usable on a
486-66 PC running Linux.


Compatibility
-------------

Xpdf is known to work on the following systems:

* x86, Linux 1.2.13 a.out, gcc 2.7.2
* x86, Linux 1.2.13 ELF, gcc 2.7.2
* PowerPC, AIX 4.1, gcc 2.7.0
* SPARC, SunOS 4.1.3, gcc 2.7.2
* MIPS, Ultrix 4.4, gcc 2.6.3
* Alpha, OSF/1 3.2, gcc 2.7.0
* HP-PA, HP-UX 9.05, gcc 2.7.2

It should work on pretty much any UNIX or VMS system which runs X11.
You'll need ANSI C++ and C compilers to compile it.  If you compile it
for a system not listed on the xpdf web page, please let me know.  If
you're willing to make your binary available by ftp or on the web,
I'll add a pointer to the web page.  If you can't get it to compile on
your system, I'll try to help.


Getting xpdf
------------

The latest version is available from:

  http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/dn0o/xpdf/xpdf.html

or:

  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/xpdf/

Source code and several precompiled executables are available.

Announcements of new versions are posted to several newsgroups
(comp.text.pdf, comp.os.linux.announce, and others) and emailed to a
list of people.  If you'd like to receive email notification of new
versions, just let me know.


Running xpdf
------------

To run xpdf, simply type:

  xpdf file.pdf

where 'file.pdf' is your PDF file.  The file name can be followed by a
number specifying the page which should be displayed first, e.g.:

  xpdf file.pdf 18

On-screen controls, at the bottom of the xpdf window:

  left/right arrow buttons:
    Move to the previous/next page.

  'Page' entry box:
    Move to a specific page number.  Click in the box to activate it,
    type the page number, then hit return.

  magnifying glass buttons:
    Increase and decrease the resolution, i.e., zoom in and zoom out.

  print button:
    Bring up a dialog for generating a PostScript file.  The dialog
    has options to set the pages to be printed and the PostScript file
    name.

  curved arrow buttons:
    Rotate the page clockwise and counterclockwise.  These are
    intended primarily for PDF files where the rotation isn't
    correctly specified in the file, but they're also useful if your X
    server doesn't support font rotation.

  '?' button:
    Bring up the 'about xpdf' window.

  'Quit' button:
    Quit xpdf.

Links:

  Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link's destination.
  Currently, only links within PDF documents or to another PDF file
  are supported.  Clicking on a URL link just prints the URL.
  Clicking on any other type of link (e.g., links to executable
  programs) prints an error message.

Key bindings:

  n            move to the next page

  p            move to the previous page

  <Space>      scroll down on the current page; if already at bottom,
  <PageDown>     move to next page
  <Next>

  <Backspace>  scroll up on the current page; if already at top, move
  <Delete>       to previous page
  <PageUp> 
  <Previous>

  <Home>       scroll to top of current page

  <End>        scroll to bottom of current page

  arrows       scroll the current page

  control-L    redraw the current page

  q            quit xpdf

Command line options and X resources:

  -err
    Send error messages to /dev/tty instead of stderr (useful if xpdf
    is started from another application, e.g., netscape which
    otherwise pops up an annoying little window for every error).

  -z <number>                [xpdf.initialZoom]
    Set the initial zoom factor (-5 .. 5).

  -g <geometry>              [xpdf.geometry]
  -geometry <geometry>
    Set the initial window geometry.

  -remote <name>
    Start/contact xpdf remote server with specified name (see the
    'Remote server mode' section below).

  -raise
    Raise xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).

  -quit
    Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).

  -rgb <number>
    Set the size of largest RGB cube xpdf will try to allocate.  The
    default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube); set to a smaller number to
    conserve color table entries.

  -cmd
    Print commands as they're executed (useful for debugging).

  -h or -help
    Print usage information.

Several other standard X options and resources will work as expected:

  -display <display>         [xpdf.display]

  -foreground <color>        [xpdf.foreground]
  -fg <color>

  -background <color>        [xpdf.background]
  -bg <color>

  -font <font>               [xpdf.font]
  -fn <font>

The color and font options only affect the user interface elements,
not the PDF display (the 'paper').


Web browsers
------------

If you want to run xpdf automatically from netscape or mosaic (and
probably other browsers) when you click on a link to a PDF file, you
need to edit (or create) the files '.mime.types' and '.mailcap' in
your home directory.  In '.mime.types' add the line:

    application/pdf pdf

In '.mailcap' add the lines:

    # Use xpdf to view PDF files.
    application/pdf; xpdf -err %s

Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.


Remote server mode
------------------

Xpdf can be started in remote server mode by specifying a server name
(in addition to the file name and page number).  For example:

  xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf

If there is currently no xpdf running in server mode with the name
'myServer', a new xpdf window will be opened.  If another command:

  xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9

is issued, a new copy of xpdf will not be started.  Instead, the first
xpdf (the server) will load 'another.pdf' and display page nine.  If
the file name is the same:

  xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4

the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.

The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it can be
specified with or without a file name and page number.

The -quit option tells the server to close its window and exit.


Fonts
-----

Xpdf uses X server fonts.  It requires the following fonts:

* courier: medium-r, bold-r, medium-o, and bold-o
* helvetica: medium-r, bold-r, medium-o, and bold-o
* times: medium-r, bold-r, medium-i, and bold-i
* symbol: medium-r
* Zapf Dingbats: medium-r

Most X installations should already have all of these fonts, except
Zapf Dingbats (which isn't used very heavily anyway).

X servers, starting at R5, support font scaling.  Xpdf will
automatically take advantage of this.  There are two types of scaling.
The first type uses standard bitmap fonts: if a font doesn't exist in
the requested size, the server will scale the bitmapped characters.
This is reasonably fast, and the results are readable but not very
pretty.  X servers can also handle true scalable, e.g., Type-1, fonts.
(The free Adobe Acrobat Reader comes with a set of Type-1 fonts which
can be used by X; see the mkfontdir(1) man page for details on setting
these up.)  Scalable fonts are slower, especially since PDF documents
tend to use lots of fonts, but they look much nicer.

Some X servers also support font rotation.  Xpdf will use this feature
if available.


PostScript output
-----------------

Xpdf can generate PostScript files.  Click on the 'printer' button,
select the pages you want to print and the name for the PostScript
file, and click 'Ok' (or hit return).

There is also a separate program which converts PDF files to
PostScript.  It runs from the command line, and can be compiled
without the X includes and libraries.  To run it, type:

  pdftops file.pdf

to generate 'file.ps' or:

  pdftops file.pdf anotherfile.ps

to generate 'anotherfile.ps'.

You can specify a range of pages to convert:

  pdftops -f 3 -l 17 file.ps

will generate PostScript for pages 3 through 17.

Downloading fonts is not currently supported.  This means that if xpdf
has trouble displaying the document, the PostScript output will
probably look just as bad.

The generated PostScript is Level 2.  If you have an old printer which
supports only Level 1 PostScript, you won't be able to print the
files.  I'm not sure how many Level 1 printers are out there -- if you
want Level 1 PostScript output, send me email, and if there's enough
interest, I'll work on it.

The PostScript output has not been thoroughly tested yet.  Please send
me email if you find any bugs.


Distribution
------------

Xpdf may be distributed under the following conditions:

1. The file 'README' is included, unmodified, in the distribution.

2. The distribution includes:
   a. all of the xpdf source code, unmodified; OR
   b. one or more xpdf executables, compiled from the unmodified
      source code; OR
   c. both of the above.

If you distribute xpdf, I would appreciate receiving a pointer (ftp
site, BBS phone number, etc.) or a copy (disk, CD-ROM, etc.).

Modified versions of xpdf or applications using some or all of the
xpdf code (i.e., 'derivative works' under copyright law) may not be
distributed without explicit permission.


Bugs
----

This is an beta release of xpdf, and there are still a bunch of PDF
features which I have yet to implement.

At this point, the biggest problem is that embedded fonts are not
handled correctly.

If you find a bug in xpdf, i.e., if it prints an error message,
crashes, or incorrectly displays a document, and you don't see that
bug listed here, please send me email, with a pointer (URL, ftp site,
etc.) to the PDF file.

This is a list of things which I plan to add (in approximate order of
priority):

* forms
* text search/select/copy
* separate program to extract all text from PDF file
* text annotations
* bookmarks
* support for Adobe Acrobat Amber optimized PDF files
* article threads
* index window or mode -- outline and/or thumbnails
* distribute with a small demo PDF file
* RunLength filter (I haven't found a PDF file which uses this)
* encryption (if I can get documentation)
* adding text to clipping path
* miter limit
* text rendering mode (X display and PostScript output)
* separate pdftoppm program (args are PDF file, page number, and
  resolution (in dpi))

There are also some problems which I know about.  This is a list of
things which I plan to fix:

* handle embedded Type-1 and Type-3 fonts
  - on screen (dump Type-1 fonts to file and let X server load them?)
  - embed in PostScript files
* "cancel" button to stop page computation
* pan by dragging with button 2
* do a better job of scaling and dithering images
  - look at 'Interpolate' param;
* rotated (non-90) images
* fix trademark ('TM') constructed char to use smaller font
* greek small fonts
* deal better with file names in GoToR links
* deal better with TrueColor visuals (don't use RGB cube)
* option and resource for private color map
* "load file" button, file dialog
* mark links on screen
* support other link types
* some kind of 'configure' script to build Makefile.config
* "save bitmap" (PPM) command (how to generate 24-bit image?)
* efficiently handle very large files - don't read entire catalog,
  xref, etc. (is this necessary?)
* don't allocate full-size pixmap (optional?  only if > N bytes?)

XPIPE, GAMES, Build pipe for the fluid to flow through 

  OBJECT_OF_THE_GAME


      When the fluid flows through all the pipe you've built, the
      level is over.  If the fluid went through enough pipes
      before the end of the level, you get to move on to the
      next level.  Otherwise, "Game over!"

      Fluid will start to flow though the only pipe in the large grid
      after a short while.  (See the status window to see how long
      until the fluid starts to flow.)

      On the left, you will see a small window with four pipes.
      When you click in the main window, the lowest pipe is placed
      where you clicked.  The other three pipes then move down and
      a new pipe is placed at the top of this "preview" window.
      The lowest pipe in the small window is always the next tile
      that will show up on the big grid.  The next higher pipe will
      show up next.  Since there are four pipes in the preview
      window, you always know what the next four pipes will be.

      If you manage to fill enough tiles, you get to move on to the
      next level.

XPM-34E, GRAPHICS, XPM V 3.4E library (X PixMap Library)


                                XPM Version 3

WHAT IS XPM?
============

XPM (X PixMap) is a format for storing/retrieving X pixmaps to/from files.

Here is provided a library containing a set of four functions, similar to the
X bitmap functions as defined in the Xlib: XpmCreatePixmapFromData,
XpmCreateDataFromPixmap, XpmReadFileToPixmap and XpmWriteFileFromPixmap for
respectively including, storing, reading and writing this format, plus four
other: XpmCreateImageFromData, XpmCreateDataFromImage, XpmReadFileToImage and
XpmWriteFileFromImage for working with images instead of pixmaps.

This new version provides a C includable format, defaults for different types
of display: monochrome/color/grayscale, hotspot coordinates and symbol names
for colors for overriding default colors when creating the pixmap. It provides
a mechanism for storing information while reading a file which is re-used
while writing. This way comments, default colors and symbol names aren't lost.
It also handles "transparent pixels" by returning a shape mask in addition to
the created pixmap.

           If you know how to play pool, excellent!, if you  don't,
           here is all I can say (and know) about this game:
           With the current setup, we have two sets of balls, first
           set   is ball # 1-7, second  set is ball # 9-15. whoever
           gets his/her balls in first and then gets the black ball
           in last wins. We don't have automatic scoring right now,
           so whoever wins is supposed to increase his/her score by
           clicking on his/her '+' color button.
           If you  want to  see where your  ball will  go, click on
           'Cheat' button to get a trajectory of your shot.
           The cue stick lenght determines the hitting strenght, so
           if you want to hit harder, change your cue stick  lenght
           by moving your mouse away from the white ball. You don't
           have to click  on the white ball to start stick handling
           you can click  anywhere  on the  table and  start  stick
           handler. The white ball  goes to the opposite  direction
           relative to the cue stick.

XPOSTIT, MOTIF_TOYS, X11 Post-it Notes program

This is a port of XPostIt obtained from comp.source.x from Athena widget set
to VMS DECwindows environment using the DECtoolkit widget set.

Some further changes have been made in the area of sending/receiving notes.
XPostit now puts the name of the sender on the title line of recieved notes,
and you can get received notes to use different colours. The resources are:

XPostit.PostItNote*background:	Yellow
XPostit.PostItNote*foreground:	Black

for normal notes,

XPostit.ReceiveNote*background:	Red
XPostit.ReceiveNote*foreground:	White

for received notes,

XPostit*NoteMenu*background:	Yellow
XPostit*NoteMenu*foreground:	Black

for the popup menu in normal notes,

XPostit*ReceiveMenu*background:	Red
XPostit*ReceiveMenu*foreground:	White

For the popup menu in received notes

There is also an MMS script for building Xpostit, in XPOSTIT.MMS

Simon Graham, 19-Feb-1991
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To learn about programming on multiple displays, I tried fooling around with
XPostIt and here are the results.

I have added functionality of sending and receiving note from other people
running XPostIt. I have removed a lot of Athena widget set code and conditional
compiles for VMS. Now the code contains references to XUI widgets only (plus
the Plaid widget). There isn't much VMS specific stuff left. Basically the
exchange of notes is implemented by receiver keeping tight reign on as the
selection owner of an atom XPOSTIT. When a sender takes away ownership of the
selection, the receiver gets the value of the new selection (a new note)
and then declares itself as the owner of the selection again.

I would like to add some kind of notification when one receives a note
(a reverse icon). But do not have time to do so. I will provide help
to some one inclined to do so.

This version uses one popup menu for all the notes (Instead of one per each
note) and it uses gadgets whereever possible.

You can control whether you want to receive notes and the list of people
in the Send dialog box by following resources:

XPostit*receiveNotes: false
XPostit*sendList: JOHN,DOE,NODE::0

If you want to use names like JOHN, you must define logical JOHN to be
JOHNS'NODE::0 before running postit.

Known bugs:
   1. Lower windows options doesn't work.

Following are the notes from the previous port. (It is no longer possible
to look for "ifdef VMS" and "ifndef VMS" to see the differences between the
original code and new code.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a port of XPostIt obtained from comp.source.x from Athena widget set
to VMS DECwindows environment using the DECtoolkit widget set.

Search for "ifdef VMS" and "ifndef VMS" through the source files to see the
changes I made. These are sometimes extensive chnages.

In a nutshell, I used following transformation:
    Form widget -> attached dialog box widget
    Text Widget -> SText widget
    command widget -> pushbutton widget
    
I also used popupmenu widget instead of form widget in one place

Known Bugs:
   1. Lower windows options doesn't work.

Differences:
   1. Main window: MB2 and MB3 usage is swapped. 
	(MB3 == lower window doesn't work)

   2. Postit notes window: Save, Destroy and Erase buttons are replaced by
      a popup menu (MB2)

   3. You can use the logical POSTIT$HOME to define where the notes are
      saved and read from. If not defined, current directory is used.

COMBINATION ROTATIONAL AND SLIDING 3D PUZZLES
  hold down shift key to move whole puzzle
  letters that represent colors can be changed in mono-mode
xmlink:		a nxm Erno Rubik's Missing Link(tm)

Future directions:
  Sorry about the lack of auto-solvers, but I would rather write the puzzle
    than the tedious solution.
  Currently the saved files are cryptic (not intentionally).
  Also xmlink and xmball need better algorithms for drawing sectors than just
    a series of arcs. If you know of any, tell me.

  The rest of the platonic solids (the dodecahedron and the icosahedron), as
    well as Square-1(tm), seem too hard for me.  (Square-1, by the way, was
    the hardest puzzle I ever solved).
  A combined xrubik 2x2x2 and xskewb (Longridge's Super Skewb) is possible as
    well but xskewb as it stands, seems hard enough (for me).
  A Billion Barrel would be nice but only with a auto-solver (the puzzle is
    too hard (I confess, I never solved it)).
  A Panex Puzzle with a Tower of Hanoi mode would be nice as well.

xrubik is currently the only one in this collection with a auto-solver.

X Window Puzzles port under OpenVMS:                 Nov 1995
===================================

Puzzle programs were already ported under OpenVMS, I have only made some
adjustments to the make procedures:

Each program has its own MAKE.COM procedure to compile, as previously, with VAX
C on VAX platform. I have added automatic DECW/Motif 1.2/1.1 support.

Each program has now a MAKE_DECC.COM procedure to compile with DEC C compiler
on VAX platform and a MAKE_AXP.COM procedure to compile under Alpha platform.

All references to DEC/TCPIP libraries (aka UCX) are removed

Each program has now an .HLP VMS help file.

Ressource files:
---------------

Each program has an PROGRAM.DAT ressource file. You can either copy it under
yout home directory (SYS$LOGIN) or under a system location for a system-wide
definition:

$ copy program.dat sys$common:[decw$defaults.user]* /lo/prot=(w:re)

Exe and obj provided
--------------------

VAX : VMS 5.5-2 , VAX C 3.2, Motif 1.1
Alpha: VMS 6.1-1H2, DEC C 5.0, Motif 1.2

        XROACH creates Roaches that  run  around  on  the root window and
        hide under any open windows or icons.  
        
        ** NOTE **

        You must  have the logical name DEMOS defined to point to the top
        level directory that  contains the XROACH directory.  All command
        procedures rely on this  being  defined.   For example if all the
        XROACH files are in WORK:[SMITH.XROACH]  then  you need a logical
        name defined as follows:
        
        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE DEMOS WORK:[SMITH.] 

        **  Ensure you include the "." after the last directory name  **

XSCREENSAVER, MOTIF_TOYS, X Window Screen Saver and Locker -126


The xscreensaver program waits until the keyboard and mouse have been idle
for a period, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random.  It turns off
as soon as there is any mouse or keyboard activity.

The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen 
when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended 
monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like they do 
in the movies.

However, xscreensaver can also be used as a screen locker, to prevent
others from using your terminal while your are away.

The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock and
xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
about what it means to be a screensaver.

The XIDLE or MIT-SCREEN-SAVER server extensions will be used if you have them.

Unfortunately, locking doesn't work if you don't have Motif.

Also included are several graphics hacks for use as screensavers.  There's
nothing magic about these: they're just programs that draw on the root
window, which are pointed at by the screensaver's default resource settings.

   qix		- My own implementation of this, with many more options
		  than you would have thought qix could have.
   helix	- Generates spirally "stringart" patterns.
   pedal	- Draws a different kind of spirally pattern.
   rorschach	- Random inkblot patterns.
   attraction	- A bouncing ball demo, or a qix-like demo, or a wild
		  color-cycling thing, with some odd rules.
   greynetic	- Random colored/stippled rectangles.
   rocks	- Flying through an asteroid field.
   blitspin	- Rotate a bitmap using bitblts.
   imsmap	- Generates random maps or cloud formations.
   hypercube	- 2d projection of a hypercube rotating on all four axes.
   slidescreen	- Divides the screen into a grid and plays a 16-puzzle on it.
   decayscreen	- A melting effect.
   halo		- Random circular patterns.
   pyro		- Fireworks.  Looks a lot like the version in xlock.
   hopalong	- Fractals.  I snarfed this code from xlock.
   flame	- Fractals.  Also from xlock.
   noseguy	- A guy with a big nose wanders around the screen saying
		  things.  I snarfed this code from xnlock.
   maze		- This is the X maze demo modified to take a -root option
		  so that it works with xscreensaver.
   lmorph	- morphing line drawings.

The latest version of xscreensaver is always ftpable from ftp.x.org.  You can
also get it from my web page at http://www.netscape.com/people/jwz/.

OpenVMS port of Xscreensavser version 1.26     December 1995
==========================================

Xscreensaver distribution can be found in 3 subdirectories:

[.DRIVER]   The Xscreensaver and Xscreensaver-command programs.
[.HACKS]    Graphic demos ,can be run either through the xscreensaver program 
            or standalone.
[.UTILS]    A small libraries of various utilities.

All objets, libraries and exes files are provided for VAX VMS 5.5-2 (compiled
with VAX C 3.2 / Motif 1.1) and AXP VMS 6.1 (compiled with DEC C 5.0 / Motif
1.2). 

If you wan to rebuild, you need to rebuild [.UTILS] directory first and
re-create the object library (look at the end of COMPILE*.COM procedure).

You can now rebuild the [.HACKS] directory and the [.DRIVER] directory.

WARNING : before rebuilding [.HACKS], you need to correct some of DECwindows 
bitmap files. Some files are bogus !! (they have a long line of null chars 
at the end). These files are under SYS$COMMON:[DECW$INCLUDE.BITMAPS] directory:

STIPPLE.XBM
HLINES2.XBM
LIGHT_GRAY.XBM
ROOT_WEAVES.XBM
VLINES2.XBM

These files are all used by Greynetic demo.

Nota: link procedure automagically select appropriate X and Motif Libraries
(X11R4/Motif 1.1 - X11R4/Motif 1.2). 

The SETUP.COM procedure gives you a definition of all DCL foreign command
symbols needed to run Xscreensaver and all the graphic hacks. You need to
modify this procedure if you install these programs in another directory tree.

VMS .HLP files are provied for all programms of this distribution.

You can easily add new graphic demos without recompiling Xscreensaver. You just
need to add them in resource file XSCREENSAVER.DAT. This file (originally
present in [.DRIVER] directory ) can be installed under your SYS$LOGIN 
directory for a per-user customization basis. You can also install it under 
the system-wide user resource directory SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULT.USER] 
(with (W:RE) protections). The new graphics hack must be run in root-window 
mode to be accepted by Xscreensaver.

The graphic demos are spawn into subprocess created by the system() call (in
the Unix version the execve() call is used).

The VMS passord checking programs were picked up in the Xlock distribution.

Many thanks to Martin P.J. Zinser for many portability improvements to this
port (look at XSCREEN_MARTIN.TXT for a list of changes).

Thanks to Grégoire Sandré (sandre@clamart.wireline.slb.com) for a patch
concerning FileVue X Messages.

XSNAP, MOTIF_TOYS, snapshot of a  specified region of the screen



       The xsnap program allows one to take a snapshot of a  speci-
       fied region of the screen.  If xsnap is run without a region
       being specified,  the  user  is  prompted  to  interactively
       drag  one out with the mouse.  In this case, pressing button
       1 will select one corner of  the  region,  and  an  opposite
       corner  will  be  selected upon the release of button 1.   A
       window whose contents are a copy  of  this  region  is  then
       created.   Pressing  "Q",  "q", or "^C" in this  window will
       exit the program.

XSNOW, MOTIF_TOYS, Create a snowy desktop

This distribution contains a file 'make.com' to build Xsnow on
VMS systems, and 'xsnow.hlp'. To build type '@make' in the
xsnow directory. Another make.com is make2.com 

XSNOW

  Create a snowy and Santa-y desktop

                  xsnow [-option .,..]

  Xsnow displays lovely moving snowflakes on your desktop.


OPTIONS

    -display display_name
 Drop the snowflakes on the given display. Make sure the display is
 nearby, so you can hear them enjoy...

    -snowflakes num_snowflakes
 This is the number of snowflakes. Default is 100, max is 1000.

    -sc snowflake_color
 Use the given string as the color for the flakes instead of the default "snow".

    -bg background_color
 Use the given string as the color for the background. Note that the
 usual default desktop pattern consisting of 50% white 50% black doesn't 
 particularly look good with Xsnow. 

    -tc tree_color
 Use the given string as the color for the trees. 

    -slc sleigh_color
 Use the given string as the color for the sleigh. Note that the default
 color is black, so not much of Santa will be seen on a black
 background.

    -santa santa_size
 There are 3 sizes of Santa: 0, 1 and 2. Default is 1.

    -santaspeed santa_speed
 The speed Santa should not exceed if he doesn't want to get fined.  The
 default speed for Santa size 0 is 1, for Santa 1 it's 2 and for  Big
 Santa it's 4.

    -delay delay
 This is the number of milliseconds delay after updating everything.
 Default is 50 milliseconds, i.e. 20 updates per second max.

    -unsmooth
 If you specify this option the snowflakes will 'whirl' more
 dramatically, resulting in a somewhat jerkier movement.

    -whirl
 This sets the whirl factor, i.e. the maximum adjustment of the
 horizontal  speed. The default value is 4.

    -nowind 
 Default it gets windy now and then. If you prefer it quiet specify
 -nowind.

    -windtimer period
 With -windtimer you can specify how often it gets windy. It's sort of a
 period in seconds, default value is 30.

   -xspeed -yspeed
 These options set the maximum horizontal and vertical speed. The
 default X maximum speed is 4, the default maximum Y speed is 8.

    -wsnowdepth -ssnowdepth
 This sets the maximum thickness of the snow on top of windows and at
 the bottom of the display respectively. The default snowdepth for 
 windows is 8, at the bottom of the screen the default is 50.

    -notrees 
 Do not display the trees.

    -nosanta
 Do not display Santa Claus running all over the screen.

    -norudolf
 No Rudolf.

    -nokeepsnow
 Do not have snow sticking anywhere.

    -nokeepsnowonwindows
 Do not keep snow on top of the windows.

    -nokeepsnowonscreen
 Do not keep snow at the bottom of the screen.

    -version
 Prints the current Xsnow version.


EXAMPLES

    $ xsnow -bg LightSkyBlue3 -sc snow  
 Sets the background to a bluish color and lets it snow white.

    $ xsnow -ssnowdepth 100
 Starts with a thin layer of snow that gradually builds up at the bottom 
 of the screen.

    $ xsnow -santa 2 -santaspeed 10
 Gives you the biggest Santa at a speed that is hardly legal.

    $ xsnow -delay 100 -notrees
 For slow systems use longer delay and don't draw the trees.

    $ xsnow -snowflakes 1000 -delay 0
 Uses the maximum number of snowflakes and runs as fast as possible.

VMS Port of Xsokoban 3.1                                      January 1997
========================

Jérôme Lauret has sent to me some mods to build Xsokoban with DEC C on VAX and
Alpha. There is also a multi-user score file and the support of super-user for
score file creation .

Installation:
------------

You need to define some logical names:

- XSOKOBAN_DIR : directory where screens and bitmaps files are

  $ create/dir  disk:[toto.xsokoban]
  $ DEF/SYS XSOKOBAN_DIR disk:[toto.xsokoban]
  $ set def [.screens]
  $ copy *.* xsokoban_dir:* /lo/prot=(w:re)
  $ set def [-.bitmaps.defaults]
  $ copy *.* xsokoban_dir:* /lo/prot=(w:re)
  $ set def [--]

- SOKOBAN_SCORES: where is located the score file

  $ create/dir disk:[toto.xsokoban.scores]
  $ def/sys SOKOBAN_SCORES disk:[toto.xsokoban.scores]
  $ set prot=(w:rwe) XSOKOBAN_DIR:scores.dir

You need to create the score file (your name must match the superuser name
found into CONFIG.H). A blank score file is provided into [.SCORES] directory
if you cannot.

Regular creation (the password is into CONFIG.H file)

$ xsokoban -c
password:

Rebuild:
-------

$ @make builds xsokoban with DEC C on Alpha and GCC on VAX. You can build
with DEC C on VAX with:

$ @make DECC

I've removed the need of Xvmsutils library providing VMS sources for
STRDUP and UNLINK functions.

Exes:
----
Binaries were built on VAX VMS 6.1 with DEC C 5.0 Motif 1.2 and on Alpha VMS
6.2 with DEC C 5.2 Motif 1.2-4

Obj files are in the two .zip files

Enjoy !!

XSPRINGIES, MOTIF_TOYS, A mass and spring simulation system for X windows

xspringies is a simulator which allows you to interactively create and edit a
system of masses and springs.  The parameters of the masses and springs (such
as mass elasticity and spring K) as well as those of the surrounding system
(such as air viscosity and gravity) can be changed.

These systems can be loaded and saved into a file.

I guess you could use xspringies for real work, but it's really intended to be
a time waster.

XSTAR, MOTIF_TOYS, Stars into a gravitational field

XStar by Wayne Schlitt, wayne@backbone.UUCP (wayne@cse.unl.edu)


This program "solves" the n-body problem, and displays the results on
the screen.  It starts by putting a bunch of stars on the screen, and
then it lets the inter-body gravitational forces move the stars
around.  The result is a lot of neat wandering paths, as the stars
interact and collide.

XStar can be used to animate the root window, as a screen saver or just
to display stuff in a regular window.

    XTHING is a tool I wrote for the use of displaying 3D data in 2D.

    that barrior.  XTHING takes a file of data and plots it in n-1
    colors where n is the number of colors available on the display.
    It compresses points either linearly or logarithmically, displays
    the data in color (HSB) or gray scale, zooms, and does period
    repeats of the image.  It also outputs in postscript (which post.c
    might be handy for a slew of programs...)

    I wrote XTHING on an IBM/RS6000 but have successfully compiled it
    with no changes on VAX VMS systems.  Plus (if you have the
    memory) I have plotted over 800,000 points.

XTIC112, GAMES, X version of a simple but tricky board game

  RULES

    The board is made up of 4x4 squares and 16 pieces. The pieces
    carry 4 properties each, namely:

       o Black or brown
       o Horizontal or vertical
       o Solid or hollow
       o Round or square

    This makes a total of 16 possible pieces and there are exactly
    one piece of each type (so each piece can be represented by
    a binary number of length 4).

    Initially, the board is empty and it is successively filled with
    pieces. The game is over when a row, a column or a diagonal
    has four pieces carrying a common property in it, e.g. four
    black pieces. The player who places the fatal piece loses.

    The game is a two-player game, although in the current release,
    only the human-computer combination is supported.
    Player 1 (the human by default) chooses one of the 16 pieces. Player 2
    (the computer by default) places this piece on one of the 16
    squares of the board and chooses a piece out of the remaining
     15 pieces which he gives to player 1, who places this
     piece on one of the remaining 15 squares on the board, etc.

    As mentioned above, the game is over when a player places a
    piece in such a way that a row, a column or a diagonal
    (but see below) contains four pieces carrying a common property.
    The player who places this piece loses. If there is no empty square
    left, we have a draw (yes, this can happen).

XTIFF, MOTIF_TOYS, View a TIFF file in an X window (mono and multi-pages)

    xtiff
    is a TIFF viewer for X based on the libtiff (3) package.
    It displays a TIFF file in an X window that can be resized and panned.
    On appropriate display hardware it can handle 24-bit RGB color TIFF files,
     8, 4 and 2-bit palette color TIFF files
    and 8, 4, 2 and 1-bit grayscale TIFF files.
    The Next and Previous
    buttons allow the user to view different pages
    in a multi-page TIFF file.

    If the image is larger than the window,
    you can pan around the image with the mouse or arrow keys.
    Grab the image by pressing down
    and holding the left mouse button
    and then drag the mouse
    to expose a different region of the image.
    The arrow keys provide another method for moving
    a large image inside a smaller window.

    xtiff
    manages the negotiation between the needs of an image
    and the visual capabilities made available by an X server.
    If necessary,
    it will promote an image to a deeper visual,
    but it will not demote an image by quantizing and/or dithering.
    In that case it will fail to display the image.
 
    xtiff
    reads the "Gray Response Curve", "Gray Response Unit"
    and "Color Response Curve" tags in a TIFF file.
    The data in these tags describe gamma compensation or image companding.
    Together with the -gamma
    option or the NTSC default gamma value of 2.2,
    the image will be gamma corrected and displayed.

    For example, if a TIFF file has been prepared for a typical display,
    it has a gamma compensation of 2.2 built into either the image
    or preferably the "Color Response Curve" tag.
    This is a device-dependent image and,
    in this case, the value for the -gamma
    command line option should be 1.0.
    If the "Color Response Curve"
    tag describes a companded but otherwise device-independent image
    then the command line gamma should be set according to the monitor.

    Unfortunately there is no way of knowing a priori whether or not
    an image is device-independent without knowing its ancestry.
    If the image conforms to the TIFF 5.0 specification
    it should be device-independent;
    but many scanner and image processing programs
    do not adhere rigorously to the standard.

XTRON-11, GAMES, X11 version of Tron game

  xtron v1.1

  Copyright (C) 1995 Rhett D. Jacobs <rhett@hotel.canberra.edu.au>

Xtron is a simple one or two player version of the old classic TRON. The game
is simple: avoid running into walls, your own tail, and that of your opponent.

The game starts in demo mode (two computer players).  To change to a human
player, simply click the human icon for either player 1/2 or both.  The
standard controls are as follows:

                     Player 1:          Player 2:
                       w - up             8 - up
                       s - down           2 - down

Tron 1.1a port under OpenVMS                          January 1998
============================

A one or two player version of the classical Tron arcade game.

Installation:
------------
The ressource file XTRONRC. may be placed under SYS$LOGIN.COM, under
SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] or directly in the directory where is the
executable. You need to alter this file to specify the Pixmap directory
(ressource xtron.PixmapsDIR). You can also alter the keys mapping.
By default, Xtronre. file is suited for running in the distribution directory.

Executables provided were built with DEC C 5.0 under VAX VMS 6.1 and DEC C 5.2
under VMS Alpha 6.2

Rebuild:
-------
You can recompile with COMPILE_DECC.COM procedure and link with LINK_AXP?COM or
LINK_VAX.COM procedures.

Enjoy !!

XV310A, GRAPHICS, Interactive image viewer for the X Window System

  310a:
	The changes made in this freeware copy of XV may not yet
	be available at the ftp site. 

	The functionality is the same with XV 3.10 but the sources
	and build procedure have been updated to work with 
	newer version of DEC C and new functions provided in the
	C Run-time Library (CRTL).

	These changed source and build procedures will be provided 
	at a future date on the  ftp site.

	Image provided:

	   OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2:   *.vvms_552 (compiled using VAX-C)
	   OpenVMS VAX V6.2:     *.vvms_62  (compiled using DEC-C)

	   OpenVMS Alpha V6.1:   *.avms_61  
	   OpenVMS Alpha V6.2:   *.avms_62

	Brian J. McCarthy - Digital Equipment Corp.

   Known Problems with these sources:
	- The MMS files have not been updated
	- When compiled with VAX C:
	  -xvdir.c will not compile.  When using VAXC,
 	    use xvdir_vaxc.c.  xvdir.c has the ability to
	    scan devices on OpenVMS so you can look at other
	    devices from the LOAD menu.
	  -xvdflt.c will not compile because of xvdflt.h.
	    To get this to compile:
	 $ ana/rms/fdl=t.fdl sys$Login:login.com
	 $ convert/fdl=t.fdl XVDFLT.H XVDFLT.H
	 $ delete t.fdl;
	- When compiled with DEC C:
	  - If DEC C V5.0 is used on OpenVMS VAX 
	    the perror.h header file incorrectly defines 
	    sys_errlist.  
	    This is fixed with DEC C the V5.2 release.


Below is the same freeware_readme.txt that was release with XV310


The latest version of XV (or at least a pointer to it) is available
via anonymous ftp on ftp.cis.upenn.edu, in the directory pub/xv.  If
you're not sure if you have the latest version, or you are missing the
source or documentation for XV, PLEASE pick up the latest version of
the xv distribution.  Do *not* send mail unless absolutely necessary
(ie, you don't have ftp capability).

Note:  The documentation ('xvdocs.ps') may be installed in '/usr/local'.
	

If you're viewing this information via the 'About XV' command, and
you'd like to print it out, a copy of this info can be found in the
README file in the top-level XV source directory.  Print that.  If you
don't have it, see the previous paragraph.


XV Licensing Information
------------------------
XV IS SHAREWARE FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.  

You may use XV for your own amusement, and if you find it nifty,
useful, generally cool, or of some value to you, your registration fee
would be greatly appreciated.  $25 is the standard registration fee,
though of course, larger amounts are quite welcome.  Folks who donate
$40 or more can receive a printed, bound copy of the XV manual for no
extra charge.  If you want one, just ask.  BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE
VERSION OF XV THAT YOU ARE USING!

COMMERCIAL, GOVERNMENT, AND INSTITUTIONAL USERS MUST REGISTER THEIR
COPIES OF XV.

This does *not* mean that you are required to register XV just because
you play with it on the workstation in your office.  This falls under
the heading of 'personal use'.  If you are a sysadmin, you can put XV
up in a public directory for your users amusement.  Again, 'personal
use', albeit plural.

On the other hand, if you use XV in the course of doing your work,
whatever your 'work' may happen to be, you *must* register your
copy of XV.  (Note:  If you are a student, and you use XV to do 
classwork or research, you should get your professor/teacher/advisor
to purchase an appropriate number of copies.)

XV licenses are $25 each.  You should purchase one license per
workstation, or one per XV user, whichever is the smaller number.  XV
is *not* sold on a 'number of concurrent users' basis.  If XV was some
$1000 program, yes, that would be a reasonable request, but at $25,
it's not.  Also, given that XV is completely unlocked, there is no way
to enforce any 'number of concurrent users' limits, so it isn't sold
that way.

Printed and bound copies of the 100-odd page XV manual are available
for $15 each.  Note that manuals are *only* sold with, at minimum, an
equal number of licenses.  (e.g.  if you purchase 5 licenses, you can
also purchase *up to* 5 copies of the manual)

The source code to the program can be had (as a compressed 'tar' file
split over a couple 3.5" MS-DOS formatted floppies) for $15, for those
who don't have ftp capabilities.

Orders outside the US and Canada must add an additional $5 per manual
ordered to cover the additional shipping charges.

Checks, money orders, and purchase orders are accepted.  Credit cards
are not.  All forms of payment must be payable in US Funds.  Checks
must be payable through a US bank (or a US branch of a non-US bank).
Purchase orders for less than $50, while still accepted, are not
encouraged. 

All payments should be payable to 'John Bradley', and mailed to:
        John Bradley
        1053 Floyd Terrace
        Bryn Mawr, PA  19010
        USA


Site Licenses
-------------
If you are planning to purchase 10 or more licenses, site licenses are
available, at a substantial discount.  Site licenses let you run XV on
any and all computing equipment at the site, for any purpose
whatsoever.  The site license covers the current version of XV, and
any versions released within one year of the licensing date.  You are
also allowed to duplicate and distribute an unlimited number of copies
of the XV manual, but only for use within the site.  Covered versions
of the software may be run in perpetuity.

Also, it should be noted that a 'site' can be defined as anything
you'd like.  It can be a physical location (a room, building,
location, etc.), an organizational grouping (a workgroup, department,
division, etc.) or any other logical grouping ("the seventeen
technical writers scattered about our company", etc.).

The site license cost will be based on your estimate of the number of
XV users or workstations at your site, whichever is the smaller
number.

If you are interested in obtaining a site license, please contact the
author via electronic mail or FAX (see below for details).  Send
information regarding your site (the name or definition of the 'site',
a physical address, a fax number, and an estimate of the number of
users or workstations), and we'll get a site license out to you for
your examination.

XWIT, MOTIF_TOYS, Pop or iconify this xterm window or named windows

    xwit is an X window interface tool.
    By default when used with no arguments in an xterm it
    de-iconifies and raises the window.
    You can specify a different function to do, such as iconifying the window,
    and apply it to several windows whose name begins with one of the given
    strings, or a particular window id given, or the window id found
    in the environment variable WINDOWID.
    (This variable is set by xterm for the program, usually the shell, it
    runs.)

YACC, UTILITIES, Berkeley yacc

aug-1995 Sheldon Bishov, bishov@star.zko.dec.com

The source for files was University of California at Berkeley.

Builds tested on VAX with VAXC and DECC and Alpha with DECC.

To build, set default to source directory and enter the command:

$ @vmsbuild {param}

where {param} is VAXC (for VAX only) or DECC (for VAX or Alpha).


A command procedure build-yacc.com is provided to make builds from
*.yacc source code easier.  Also provided is calc.yacc, which
produces a simple calculator application.  This code was adapted
from a sample for GNU bison.

The following changes were made in the code:

build-yacc.com: new procedure, makes use of yacc on source files easier

defs.h: Include errno.h, changes to use VMS file extensions vs UNIX (which
         can have >1 dot)

error.c: Format of some continuation was too long for VAXC/DECC

lr0.c: Remove extra static core decl.

main.c: Use free instead of unlink; use logindir/tmp vs. /tmp

skeleton.c: Use fprintf to stderr instead of yyerror

verbose.c: Format of some continuation lines was too long for VAXC/DECC

vmsbuild.com: new procedure; adapted from vmsbuild.com for gawk from
         Free Software Foundation.

YADMAN, MOTIF_TOYS, MandelBrot Demo

        This  demo,  Yadman  (Yet Another Damn  MANdelbrot  program)  can
        generate  and  display  images  of  the  Mandelbrot   set.    The
        Mandelbrot   set  is  produces  images  of  fractals,  fractional
        dimensions,  that  are  pleasing  to  the  eye.    Look   at  the
        OVERVIEW.TXT for complete details.
        
       
        ** NOTE **

        You must  have the logical name DEMOS defined to point to the top
        level directory that  contains the YADMAN directory.  All command
        procedures rely on this  being  defined.   For example if all the
        YADMAN files are in WORK:[SMITH.YADMAN]  then  you need a logical
        name defined as follows:
        
        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE DEMOS WORK:[SMITH.] 

        **  Ensure you include the "." after the last directory name  **
        
        To build...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                        
        $ @DEMOS:[YADMAN]BUILD_YADMAN.COM

        This will  build  either a OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP image based
        on what architecture it is run on.
                
        To run...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        $ @DEMOS:[YADMAN]START_YADMAN.COM
        
        This  will  start  up  the  appropiate  architecture  version  of
        YADMAN.  

                                
        YADMAN options...
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        $ YADMAN :== "$ DEMOS:[YADMAN]YADMAN_AXP"
        $ YADMAN
        
        Usage: demos:[yadman]yadman_axp.exe;1 [ options ]
        
             Where options are one or more of:
        
             [-x #] [-y #]                  x and y window position
             [-title WindowTitle]           Title of YADMAN window
