Postman
-------

The Postman utility allows you to manage incoming electronic mail.
You can establish, change or remove:

  - a vacation message;
  - multiple forwarding addresses;
  - multiple filters to discard messages based on "From" and "Subject" lines.

         ***   The Postman utility uses PMDF's DELIVER system.   ***
         *** If you wish to control the use of DELIVER yourself, ***
         ***          you should NOT use this utility.           ***

A vacation message can be used to automatically notify a person who has
sent you mail that you are on vacation, or simply to indicate to the
sender that you have received the mail.

Forwarding allows you to send a copy of a message to another person.
You may establish as many forwarding addresses as you wish - each one
will receive a copy of the message.

Filtering allows you to discard incoming messages as if they had never been
received.  You choose to filter based on "From" and/or "Subject" lines in
the messages.
