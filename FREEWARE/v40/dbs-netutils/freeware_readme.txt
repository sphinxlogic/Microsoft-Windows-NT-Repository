DBS-NETWATCH, NETWORKING, early version of DBS-*WATCH utilities

    DBS-NETUTILS contains early versions of ETHERWATCH and LATWATCH 
    as well as a protocol counter which will record the number of 
    packets of each protocol type (between two addresses if desired)
    and a frame counter that records the number of packets of various 
    sizes (for selected protocols or addresses). 


    Please note: These packages have been updated as of April 22, 1997.
    The update involved VESTing VAX images to produce Alpha executables.
    These VESTed images have NOT been fully tested - you have been advised.
