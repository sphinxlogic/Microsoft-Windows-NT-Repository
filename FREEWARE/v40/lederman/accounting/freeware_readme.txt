ACC_CONVERT, SYSTEM MANAGEMENT, Utility which converts VMS System Accounting
                                binary files to fixed length fixed field
                                files.

PSI_CONVERT,                    Utility which converts PSI System Accounting
                                binary files.

These are programs I wrote some time ago which convert the unique
varible format binary accounting files to fixed-length fixed-field files
that are more easily read by various programs and utilities,
specifically Datatrieve. 

I have also included some definitions I used to load the data into an
Rdb database, purely for those who want to experiment.
