     The MONITOR_TO_CSV program converts the data file produced
 by the MONITOR /RECORD command into an ASCII text Comma
 Separated Value (CSV) file which can be read by Excel and other
 programs.  It currently converts only some of the record types
 which can be produced by MONITOR.

     To record data, use the following command or the
 equivalent:

     MONITOR /RECORD DISK, STATE, MODE, LOCK, SYSTEM, DECNET

     More types of records can be displayed, but these are the
 only types which will be converted by this program.

     If you enter the command as given above, the file
 MONITOR.DAT will be created.  You can enter a different file
 name if desired.

     To process the data file, you will need the executable
 image of the program and a Command Language Descriptor (CLD)
 file.  The executable image is either MONITOR_TO_CSV.EXE for a
 VAX or MONITOR_TO_CSV_ALPHA.EXE for an Alpha system.  The CLD
 file is MONITOR_TO_CSV.CLD, and it must be edited to suit your
 system.  It looks like this:


define verb M_TO_CSV

  image SYS$SYSDEVICE:[LEDERMAN.MONITOR]MONITOR_TO_CSV

  parameter P1,
	label = INPUT_FILE,
	value (default = "MONITOR.DAT", type = $FILE)

  qualifier OUTPUT_FILE,
	value (default = "MONITOR.CSV", type = $FILE)

  qualifier SPECIAL1


     The "define verb" line may be edited if you want to use a
 command which is different from M_TO_CSV.  If you do assign a
 differrent command name, you should be careful not to use a
 name which conflicts with other VMS DCL commands, otherwise you
 will replace that command with the new one.  (If you make an
 error, you can log out and log in again, and your command
 tables will be reset.)

     The "image" line must be edited to point to the correct
 executable image in the correct directory.  If you are running
 this from the PITS account on a system set up to run the
 standard test suite, you may want to use the definition

  image PERF$EXE:MONITOR_TO_CSV

 and place the image in the PERF$EXE directory.  Otherwise, you
 may want to put it into your SYS$LOGIN directory.

     The above preparation (locating the executable image and
 editing the CLD file) only has to be done once per system. 
 However, the next step must be done each time you log in.

     To use the utility, you must add the new command to your
 command tables.  You do this with the following command:

SET COMMAND MONITOR_TO_CSV

     It is possible to permanently add the command to the
 system-wide command tables, but I recommend against it.  If you
 are going to use this utility frequently, simply add the above
 command to your LOGIN.COM file.

     To use the utility, enter the command M_TO_CSV.  If you
 recorded your data with the default file name of MONITOR.DAT,
 the utility will find it and write the converted data to the
 file MONITOR.CSV.  If you have a different input file name or
 want a different output file name you can use the following
 qualifiers:

M_TO_CSV /OUTPUT = output-file.name  input-file.name

     There is one switch which can be used anywhere on the
 command line, and that is /SPECIAL1.  With this qualifier,
 instead of writing out output record for each input record, the
 utility takes related sets of DISK, STATE, MODE, LOCK, and
 SYSTEM, (but not DECNET) records and concatenates them into a
 single record (which appears as a single line in a spread
 sheet).  This qualifier depends on the MONITOR utility writing
 the records in a certain order, with the System records last. 
 It appears to always do this, and should not change. It also
 depends on the correct records being recorded using the MONITOR
 command line given above.  The program does not check for
 missing records, and will record zeroes (or fail) if the
 necessary input data is missing.
