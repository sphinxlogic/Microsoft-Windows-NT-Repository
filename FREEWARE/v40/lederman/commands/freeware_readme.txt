VMS DCL Sysmgt Files, SYSTEM MANAGEMENT, various

This directory contains a number of DCL command files I've written over 
the years which do various things.  Some of them show information on 
what is available on the system, such as all of the F$ENVIRONMENT 
and F$GETDVI lexical functions; some do system monitoring things not 
available elsewhere, including an equivalent for MONITOR QUOTAS.

There are also command files to extract the counters on various network 
devices.  There are record definitions in the Datatrieve directory that 
match the resulting data files.

Please note that I haven't used some of these procedures for several 
years, and just dug them out of my archives, so I don't know which ones 
still work.  But the basic information within them should still be 
useful.
