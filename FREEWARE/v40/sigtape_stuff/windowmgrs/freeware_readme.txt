BOSS;SWiM, Utilities, Window mgrs for terms; VT emulation; cmd record/playback

These utils let you have many processes controlled from one terminal or
window. BOSS will work also with the "UW" protocol over serial lines.
BOSS uses whole screen, is very low overhead; esc seqs change process or
communicate processes.

SWiM has several windows on screen at once (uses smg$, has builtin vt
emulator), controls processes.

Both work on vax or alpha.

BOSS can also record sessions or play back input.

LOTS of capabilities here.
