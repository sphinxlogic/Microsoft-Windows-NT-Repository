XLOADIMAGE41, MOTIF_TOYS, Load images into an X11 window or onto the root window

                  XLOADIMAGE V 4.1

This utility will view several types of images under X11, load
images onto the root window, or dump processed images into one of
several image file formats.  The current version can read many
different image file types; for a complete list type "xloadimage
-supported".

A variety of options are available to modify images prior to viewing.
These options include clipping, dithering, depth reduction, zoom
(either X or Y axis independently or both at once), brightening or
darkening, and image merging.  When applicable, these options are done
automatically (eg a color image to be displayed on a monochrome screen
will be dithered automatically).

TIFF AND JPEG SUPPORT

This version of xloadimage supports both JPEG and TIFF files through
the IJG V4 JPEG library and the Sam Leffler's V3 TIFF library.  The
libraries are included almost in their entirety.
