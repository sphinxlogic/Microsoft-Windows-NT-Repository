 PRODUCT NAME:  MACRO-64 Assembler Version 1.1          SPD 42.66.01
                for OpenVMS AXP Systems

 DESCRIPTION

 MACRO-64 Assembler for OpenVMS AXP Systems is a macro assembler for
 programming OpenVMS AXP system computers. Source programs written in
 MACRO-64 are assembled into object (or binary) code by the MACRO-64
 assembler, which produces an object module and, optionally, a list-
 ing file.

 MACRO-64 source programs consist of a sequence of source statements.
 These source statements may be any of the following:

 o  Alpha AXP native-mode instructions

 o  Direct assignment statements

 o  Assembler directives

 Because the programmer selects the instruction sequences when program-
 ming with MACRO-64, the programmer is almost entirely responsible for
 the performance of a MACRO-64 application.

 MACRO-64 supports:

 o  All Alpha AXP instructions

 o  All Alpha AXP data types

 o  Macro definition and expansion capability

 o  Optional instruction-scheduling assistance

 o  Optional local code optimization
