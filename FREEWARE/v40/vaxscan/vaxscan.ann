Abstract: VAX SCAN is a native mode high level language designed for 
text processing that operates under the VMS Operating System. VAX SCAN 
programs can invoke and be invoked by routines written in other VMS 
languages as well as many Run-Time Library routines. 
VAX SCAN is implemented as an optimizing compiler that produces standard 
VMS object modules. These modules can be linked with modules written in 
other VMS languages to produce an executable image that can be executed 
by the VMS RUN command. 
The VAX SCAN language can be divided into two parts; the first part is a 
block-structured language that can be used for traditional algorithmic 
programming, while the second part deals with pattern matching.
