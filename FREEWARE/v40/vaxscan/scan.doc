Summary of SCAN directory structure:

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN]

	this directory.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.BUG]

	Contains old bug reports.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COM]

	Contains command files for miscellaneous project management
	operations.  [SCAN.KIT.COM] is the directory used to build
	kits.  [SCAN.COM] is used for non-kitbuilding functions.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER]

	Top level directory for the compiler.  Subdirectories include:

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.AUTO]
		Contains intermediate files that are created during a
		build of the compiler.  This directory can be cleaned out
		when needed, as its contents are recreated when necessary
		during a build.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.COM]
		Contains miscellaneous command procedures.  Not used much.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.LIS]
		Contains listing files from recompiling the compiler modules

		rebuilding the compiler.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.PAT]
		Contains files used by the PATPARSER, which is the
		front end that the SCAN compiler is built with.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.SRC]
		Contains source modules, help text, bnf input to PATPARSER,
		really all source files that make up the compiler.  This is
		a reference directory for the CMS library where the compiler
		sources are kept, so it is kept up to date automatically
		by CMS.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.V1]
		Contains information about SCAN V1.0.  Not used, but can be
		a useful historical reference.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.VCG]
		Contains VAX code generator (VCG) files.  These files are
		copied when needed from TLE:: during a build.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.SRC.CMS]
		Contains the CMS library for compiler sources.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COMPILER.SRC.REF]
		Not used.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.COV]
	Contains cover letters that have been used for field test.

	Contains sources for the SCAN demo program.  A saveset containing
	the demo is in SCAN$PUBLIC:SCANDEMO.SAV.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.DOC]

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.KIT.V11_8]
	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.KIT.X10_5]
	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.KIT.X11_6]
		Each directory contains a kit which was built using the
		compiler modules of the corresponding CMS class in the
		compiler CMS library.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.LRM]
	Contains documentation about SCAN V1.0.  Not used, but can be
	a useful historical reference.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.LSE_V13]
	Contains LSE V1.3.  This was needed to build SCAN V1.1 with LSE V1.3
	because the environment file would have been incompatible with LSE V1.x
	if it was built with LSE V2.0, whic was the current version.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.MENU]
	Contains command procedures to do project management functions,
	such as checkin/out, add tests.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.MMS]
	Contains MMS description files used to build the compiler and rtl.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.PLAN]
	Contains documentation about SCAN V1.0.  Not used, but can be
	a useful historical reference.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.PROTO]
	Contains information about a SCAN prototype.  Not used, but can be
	a useful historical reference.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RCMS]
	Contains the remote CMS tool (RCMS).

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.REPORT]
	Contains monthly reports for the lifetime of the SCAN project.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTEST]
	Not used.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL]
	Top level directory for the SCNRTL.  The 'live' sources for
	the SCNRTL are kept on the VMS integration cluster, VMSINT.  These
	files are a copy of the 'live' files, but they are not used in
	VMS builds.  They exist to make it easier to do SCNRTL development
	on CLT::.  Subdirectories include:

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL.AUTO]
	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL.COM]
	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL.LIS]
	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL.MMS]
	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL.OBJ]
	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL.SRC]
		Same use as the corresponding subdirectories for the compiler,
		only these are used for the SCNRTL.

	SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.RTL.BASE]
		Not used.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.SELECT]
	Contains some modules which contain changes that were started to
	implement the SELECT statement in the SCAN language.  The work is
	mostly completed, but could not be finished in time for V1.1.  See
	READ_ME.TXT in this directory for details.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.SPR]
	Contains all SCAN SPRs received thus far.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.SQM]
SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.SQMBIG]
SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.SQMTEST]
	Contains the tests that SQM uses for verifying SCAN on new processors
	and new versions of VMS.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.TCS]
SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.TEST]
	Contain obsolete tests.  Useful for historical purposes.

SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.TOOLS]
	Contains programs that are used during the build procedure for
	building the compiler.

SCAN$PUBLIC:
	Contains all public documents, networks kits, etc.



SCAN accounts:

	There are SCAN accounts on TLE:: and CLTSML::.  To get an account
	on VMSINT to make RTL changes, you must contact the VMS people.

Login procedure:

	The command procedure SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN]LOGIN.COM should be executed
	to define logicals and symbols used by SCAN development.  See the
	command procedure for more details.

To build the compiler:

	$ SUBMIT COM$:BLDCOMP.COM
		This will only build the parts of the compiler that have
		changed since the most recent build.

	or

	$ SUBMIT COM$:FULLCOMP.COM
		This will rebuild the entire compiler.  All object modules
		are deleted first, then everything is recompiled from sources.

To build the SCNRTL:

	$ SUBMIT COM$:BLDRTL.COM
		This will only build the parts of the SCNRTL that have
		changed since the most recent build.

	or

	$ SUBMIT COM$:FULLRTL.COM
		This will rebuild the entire SCNRTL.  All object modules
		are deleted first, then everything is recompiled from sources.

To checkin/checkout compiler modules:

	$ MENU
		This will put you into a menu command procedure which will
		guide you on how to checkin/checkout modules.  The menu
		command procedures are located in the directory
		SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.MENU].

To checkin/checkout SCNRTL modules:

	The SCNRTL modules are located on the VMSINT cluster.  You must
	use the VMS RTL procedures for checkin/checkout of these modules.

To add tests to the test system:

	$ MENU
		This will put you into a menu command procedure which will
		guide you on how to add tests to the test system.  The menu
		command procedures are located in the directory
		SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.MENU].

To run tests:

	use DTM
		The DTM test database is in SCAN$$DISK:[SCAN.DTM].
