DBS-LATWATCH, NETWORKING, LAT protocol monitor

    DBS-LATWATCH is similar to DBS-ETHERWATCH but only looks at LAT 
    packets and formats the various LAT message types. Selection can 
    be made on message type (as well as address) and record and
    playback is also available. 


    Please note: These packages have been updated as of April 22, 1997.
    The update involved VESTing VAX images to produce Alpha executables.
    These VESTed images have NOT been fully tested - you have been advised.
