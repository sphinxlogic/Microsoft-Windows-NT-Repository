XCE, MOTIF_TOYS, Color editor tool for X11/Motif

This is a Motif color editor.  It can be used in various ways, but the most
interesting feature is the ability to pick an existing application window,
get a pixmap copy of it, and play with the colors.  You can get a feel for
how the whole application will look like with new colors.  There is also
a special window that shows the system's rgb.txt file and the resulting
colors.  This can be used as a reference palet when experimenting with
new colors.
