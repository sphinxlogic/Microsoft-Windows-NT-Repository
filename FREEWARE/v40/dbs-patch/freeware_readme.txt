DBS-PATCH, UTILITIES, file and disk patch utility

    DBS-PATCH contains a file and disk patch utility. These programs 
    allow you to change the contents of any byte in a file or disk. 
    The programs are written in Macro-32 and will build on VAX or Alpha. 


    Please note: These packages have been updated as of April 22, 1997.
    The update involved VESTing VAX images to produce Alpha executables.
    These VESTed images have NOT been fully tested - you have been advised.
