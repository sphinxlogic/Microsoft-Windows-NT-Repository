<h3>/FULL</h3> 
If you use this qualifier , SEARCH will give a full  
output for each file found. This output is a look-alike  
of the output from DIRECTORY/FULL. You cannot combine  
this qualifier with /SORT or /SUMMARY.  
<h3>/HOME</h3> 
This qualifier directs search to give output from the  
disk's home block. SEARCH uses the home block for  
calculating the free and used file headers within INDEXF.SYS.  
<h3>/(NO)IDENT=identifier or uic</h3> 
You can search for files owned by a specific  
identifier or uic. Any valid uic or identifier format may be used.  
Another way is the /OWNER_UIC qualifier;  
you cannot combine these 2 qualifiers in one SEARCH command.  
Issueing /NOIDENT directs DFU to search for files NOT owned  
by this IDENTIFIER, eg: DFU&gt; SEARCH sys$sysdevice/NOIDENT=SYSTEM.  
<h3>/LBN=logical-block-number</h3> 
The /LBN qualifier is a special function of SEARCH.  
This allows you to find a file which  contains a  
specific LBN. This may be usefull if you have bad  
blocks logged in the error log. You cannot combine /LBN  
with search qualifiers such as /FILE.  
<h3>/(NO)OWNER_UIC=uic or identifier</h3> 
This qualifier is used to get files owned by a specific uic or  
identifier. Any valid uic or identifier format may be used.  
You cannot  combine this qualifier with /IDENT. Specifying /NOOWNER  
directs DFU to search for files NOT owned by this UIC or identifier.  
<h3>/MODIFIED=option(,option)</h3> 
The /MODIFIED qualifier is used to search files  
depending on their modification date. The options are :  

<ul> 
  <li>/MODIFIED=BEFORE=date  
  <li>/MODIFIED=SINCE=date  
</ul> 

<p> 
These 2 options can be used to get files which have a  
modification date before or after a specific date. The  
BEFORE and SINCE option can be combined in one command.  
<h3>/MULTIPLE</h3> 
This qualifier searches for files which have more than  
1 file header.  
<h3>/NOSEARCH</h3> 
This qualifier can only be used in combination with  
/HOME. It is used to get the Homeblock info, without  
searching the entire disk.  
<h3>/NOVOLSET</h3> 
The default behaviour of SEARCH is to process an entire  
volume set. You can override this  behaviour with  
/NOVOLSET. This may be usefull when doing a /LBN search.  
<h3>/OUTPUT=file</h3> 
This qualifier redirects the output from SEARCH to an  
output file.This file can later be used  as input to  
the DEFRAG , DIRECTORY or SET command.  
<h3>/OVER_ALLOCATED=n</h3> 
Searches for files where the difference between the used  
and allocated size is at least 'n' blocks.  
<h3>/PLACED</h3> 
Checks for files which have a placement control  
retrieval pointer.This is sometimes set by non-DEC disk  
defragmentation programs.  
<h3>/SIZE=(minimum=size1,maximum=size2)</h3> 
The /SIZE qualifier is used to limit files found by  
their file size.You can either use minimum= or  
maximum= or use both options together. SEARCH will use  
the actual file size for selecting files, except when  
the /ALLOCATED qualifier is used.  
<h3>/SORT</h3> 
This qualifier will sort the files found before being  
output. You can combine this with the /OUTPUT qualifier  
(the default output is SYS$OUTPUT).  
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3> 
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed  
Time,  
I/O and PageFaults.  
<h3>/SUMMARY</h3> 
This qualifier will limit the output to the total  
number of files found, with their size (and  optional  
the fragmentation when /FRAG is used). You cannot  
combine /SUMMARY with /FULL.  
<h3>/VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=version1,maximum=version2)</h3> 
The /VERSION_NUMBER qualifier is used search for files within  
a range of specific file version numbers. Logfiles which are  
produced with the same name may pose problems when they reach the  
maximum version number (32767). Using /VERSION=MIN=32000  
is a quick way to find such files.

<p> 
This chapter describes the SET command with the related parameters  
and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd10_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_10.1"><h1>10.1 Introduction</h1></a> 

<p> 
The SET command allows you to modify file attributes which can't be  
modified through DCL commands.  
Note that you should be carefull about using this function;  
you may easily corrupt files.  
NOTE: This much wanted functionality is finally introduced in VMS 6.0  
with a new DCL command $SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES. Still DFU's SET has  
some options which are not in SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES (such as setting a  
BACKUP date).

<blockquote> 
<h3>file1,file2,...,@file</h3> 
The files to be modified. The attributes to be modified are specified  
with qualifiers. Wildcards area allowed in the filename. An indirect  
file  
can be used by using the @ sign. This allows processing of a file list  
produced by a DFU SEARCH command.  
</blockquote> 
<hr> 
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>/BACKUP_DATE=date</h3> 
<h3>/NOBACKUP_DATE</h3> 
Controls whether a new  backup date is  assigned  to  
the  specified files.  Specify the date according to the rules  
described  
in Chapter 1 of the VMS  DCL  Concepts  Manual.   Absolute  
date  keywords  are allowed.   If  you specify 0 as the date,  
today's date is used. If you specify /NOBACKUP_DATE the Backup date  
field will be cleared.  
<h3>/BADACL</h3> 
<h3>/NOBADACL</h3> 
Sets or  resets the 'BADACL' flag in the file header.  
This enables deletion of a file with  
a corrupted ACL.  
<h3>/BUCKETSIZE=size</h3> 
Sets a new value for the bucket size in the file header.  
<h3>/CONFIRM</h3> 
<h3>/NOCONFIRM (default)</h3> 
Controls whether a  request is issued before each  
individual SET operation  to confirm that  
the operation should be performed on that file.  
When the system  issues  the  prompt,  you  can  issue  
any  of  the following responses:  

<p><pre> 
  YES      NO     QUIT  
  TRUE     FALSE  CTRL/Z  
  1        0      ALL  
           &lt;RET&gt;  
</pre> 

<p> 
You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase  
letters for word responses.  Word responses can be abbreviated to  
one or more letters (for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE).  
Affirmative answers are YES, TRUE, and 1.  Negative  
answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and &lt;RET&gt;.  QUIT or  CTRL/Z indicates  
that you want  
to stop processing the  command at that  point.   When  you  respond  
with  
ALL, the command continues to process, but no further prompts are  
given.  
If you type  a  response other than one of those in the list,  
the prompt will be reissued.  
<h3>/CONTIGUOUS_BEST_TRY</h3> 
<h3>/NOCONTIGUOUS_BEST_TRY</h3> 
Sets or resets the 'CONTIGUOUS_BEST_TRY' bit in the file header.  
<h3>/CREATION_DATE=date</h3> 
<h3>/NOCREATION_DATE</h3> 
Controls whether a new creation date is  assigned to  
the  specified files.  Specify the date according to  
the rules described in Chapter 1 of the VMS  DCL  
Concepts  Manual.   Absolute  
date  keywords  are allowed.   If  you specify 0 as the  
date, today's date is used.  
<h3>/DIRECTORY</h3> 
<h3>/NODIRECTORY</h3> 
Sets  or resets the  directory  attribute of a file.  
This  qualifier allows you to set  the directory  
bit of a file which was mistakingly reset by the 'SET  
FILE/NODIRECTORY' command.  
If it is done on a non-directory   file,  then  access  
to  that  directory  will  give  a 'BADIRECTORY' error.  
<h3>/EBLOCK[=block]</h3> 
This qualifier will reset the  end-of-file mark to the  
highest block allocated if no block has been specified.   
Otherwise the end-of-file mark will be set to the specified block.  
<h3>/EBYTE[=byte]</h3> 
This qualifier  will set the  end-of-file byte mark to  
the highest byte if it has not been specified.  
Otherwise the  end-of-file byte mark will be set to the specified byte.  
<h3>/EXPIRATION_DATE=date</h3> 
<h3>/NOEXPIRATION_DATE</h3> 
Controls whether an expiration date is  assigned  to  
the  specified files.  Specify the date  
according to the rules described in Chapter 1 of the  
VMS  DCL  Concepts  Manual.   Absolute  
date keywords  are allowed.   If  you specify 0 as the  
date, today's date is used.  
<h3>/IDENT=identifier or uic</h3> 
Modify the file ownership. See also /OWNER_UIC. This allows  
modification  
of the file-ownership even if the file is open, eg.  INDEXF.SYS.  
You cannot use both /IDENT and /OWNER_UIC.  
<h3>/LOCKED</h3> 
<h3>/NOLOCKED</h3> 
This qualifier will  lock a file  for future use.  
Nothing else  can then be done with the file, until  
it is unlocked  (which can also be done with the VMS 'UNLOCK' command.  
<h3>/LOG (default)</h3> 
<h3>/NOLOG</h3> 
Controls whether the SET command displays the file  
specification of each file after the  
modification is made.  
<h3>/MAXREC=record</h3> 
Sets a new value for the maximum record number in the  
file header.  
<h3>/ORGANIZATION=keyword</h3> 
The following  keywords are used as  parameters for the ORGANIZATION  
qualifier: DIRECT, INDEXED, RELATIVE and SEQUENTIAL.  
This will allow you to modify the file organization  
type in the file header.  Of course this won't change  
the real  organization of the file.  
<h3>/OWNER_UIC=uic or identifier</h3> 
Modify the file ownership to an uic or identifier. See also /IDENT.  
This allows modification of the file-ownership even if the file is  
open, eg.  INDEXF.SYS.  
You cannot use both /IDENT and /OWNER_UIC.  
<h3>/RECATTRIBUTES=keyword</h3> 
The   following   keywords   are   used   as  
parameters   for   the RECATTRIBUTES qualifier: NONE, FORTRAN, IMPLIED,  
PRINT  
and NOSPAN. This  will allow you to  modify the  file's record  
attributes in the file header. NONE, FORTRAN, IMPLIED and PRINT are  
mutually  
exclusive,  but can be used in combination with NOSPAN.  
When  NOSPAN is omitted  SPAN is  assumed (the  default is to allow  
records to cross block boundaries).  
<h3>/RECSIZE=size</h3> 
Sets a new value for the record size in the file header.  
<h3>/RECTYPE=keyword</h3> 
The  following  keywords  are  used as  parameters  for  
the RECTYPE qualifier: FIXED,  STREAM, STREAMCR, STREAMLF, UNDEFINED,  
VARIABLE  
and VFC. This  will allow  you to  modify the  file's record  
type in the file header.  
<h3>/REVISION_DATE=date</h3> 
<h3>/NOREVISION_DATE</h3> 
Controls whether a revision date is assigned to the  
specified files. Specify the  date according  
to the  rules described  in Chapter 1 of the VMS  DCL Concepts  Manual.  
Absolute date keywords are allowed. If you  specify 0  as the date,  
today's date is used.  
<h3>/RVCOUNT=count</h3> 
Sets a new value for the revision count in the file header.  
<h3>/UPDATE</h3> 
<h3>/NOUPDATE (default)</h3> 
Normally  the  file's  revision  date  will  be  
updated  after  any modification to it.  
SET however disables this update (otherwise the REVISION date could not  
be set).  Specify this qualifier if you want the revision date to be  
updated.  
<h3>/VFCSIZE=size</h3> 
Sets a new value  for the  VFC size in  the file  
header.  This value will only be used with the VFC record type.

<a name="chapter_11"><h1>Chapter 11<br>UNDELETE</h1></a> 

<p> 
This chapter describes the UNDELETE command with the related parameters  
and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd11_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_11.1"><h1>11.1 Introduction</h1></a> 

<p> 
The UNDELETE function is designed to recover deleted files, if  
possible.  
UNDELETE operates in a safe mode such that  
it first checks if the deleted file header and diskblocks are still  
available.  
Only in that case will the file be recovered. Otherwise UNDELETE will  
leave  
the disk unmodified.  
UNDELETE has some powerfull options:  

<ul> 
  <li>Generate a list of recoverable files with the /LIST qualifier.  
This qualifier will not undelete any file, and therefore it does not  
lock  
up the disk.  
  <li>Undelete multiple files in one pass.  
  <li>Make file selections based on the owner with the /OWNER or /IDENT  
qualifier.  
  <li>Undeleted files which cannot be entered back in their original  
directory will be moved to the [SYSLOST] directory. This saves an  
additional ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR action.  
</ul> 

<p> 
<a name="hd11_2"></a> 

<a name="heading_11.2"><h1>11.2 How Undelete works</h1></a> 

<p> 
The UNDELETE command operates as follows :  

<ol> 
  <li>Lock the volume. In the same manner as ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR and  
SET VOLUME  
/REBUILD Undelete locks the disk for other writers such that no  
modifications  
to the INDEXF, BITMAP or QUOTA file can be made.  
  <li>Search the INDEXF.SYS file if the requested file is still there.  
A check  
is made if it really is a valid deleted file header.  
  <li>Checks if the deleted file header and all possible extension  
headers  
are still valid.  
  <li>Checks if the blocks previously owned by this file are still  
free.  
  <li>If all these conditions are met DFU will display the file  
and asks for a confirmation.  
  <li>Rebuilds all of the deleted file headers and bitmaps in memory.  
If no errors are found all the file headers and bitmaps  
are written back to disk. The files original backlink is saved in a  
table in memory.  
  <li>If appropiate the blocks and headers are charged against  
diskquota.  
  <li>When all of INDEXF.SYS has been scanned the volume is unlocked.  
  <li>The file(s) is (are) entered in the original directory if  
possible,  
using the table build up in memory. If the enter command fails  
(probably  
because the original directory is gone) the file will be entered in  
[SYSLOST]. DFU will create this directory if needed.  
</ol> 

<p> 
If the /LIST qualifier is used, DFU will just list the recoverable  
files without performing any action on the disk. The disk will not  
be locked.  

<p> 
It is important to note that during the bitmap and file header  
processing  
any error will immediately terminate the recovery process, and unlock  
the  
disk. Files which have been recovered up to that point will still be  
entered in the appropiate directory. As no wrong information has been  
written back to the disk this should leave the disk in a proper state.  

<p> 
NOTE: The blocks recovered will NOT be subtracted from the Volume's  
free  
block count. To get the actual freeblock count a SET  
VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE  
is necessary. Also a complete reMOUNT will reset the freeblock count.  

<p> 
IMPORTANT: DFU takes care to recover only files whose original blocks  
are  
free. However these blocks may have been modified in the meantime by  
another file which also has been deleted. Therefore each recovered file  
must be checked manually to check its integrity.  

<p> 
Example of a Undelete session :  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; undel $1$dua102:/list

<a name="heading_11.3"><h1>11.3 Files marked for delete</h1></a> 

<p> 
Normally DFU does not undelete files marked for delete. This version  
introduces a new qualifier, /MARKED , which specifically undeletes  
files marked for delete. This allows the recovery of files which  
are deleted but still open, such as INSTALLed files or even  
recovery of the system dump file SYSDUMP.DMP whenever such a file  
is deleted.  
<a name="hd11_4"></a> 

<a name="heading_11.4"><h1>11.4 UIC and identifier processing</h1></a>

and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd13_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_13.1"><h1>13.1 Introduction</h1></a> 

<p> 
The VERIFY command makes an analysis of the disk, scanning for file and  
disk  
structure errors. VERIFY performs almost all of the checks normally  
done  
by a ANALYZE/DISK command. But VERIFY is several times faster than  
ANALYZE/DISK, and using less resources.  

<p> 
VERIFY checks and reports the following errors:  

<ul> 
  <li>Checks the logical information contained in the disks HOME block  
  <li>Reports files marked for deletion  
  <li>Reports mismatches in the index file's bitmap  
  <li>Checks all backlinks.  
  <li>Reports multiple allocated blocks  
  <li>Reports blocks incorrectly marked free and allocated  
  <li>Reports all lost files  
  <li>Checks for mismatches between blocks used and blocks charged in  
QUOTA.SYS.  
(Only done when diskquota is enabled)  
</ul> 

<p> 
<a name="hd13_2"></a> 

<a name="heading_13.2"><h1>13.2 Basic repair actions</h1></a> 

<p> 
The /FIX qualifier can be used to perform some basic  
repair actions. Unlike ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR this does not lock the disk!  
/FIX repairs the following errors:  

<ul> 
  <li>Deletes file marked for delete (if possible).  
  <li>Recovers lost files and directories into [SYSLOST].  
  <li>Recovers a very rare problem which will get ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR  
into a computable loop (This problem is fixed in VMS V6.2 or with  
the VERI02_061 patch kit).  
  <li>Recovers a corrupted backlink for the Master File Directory  
000000.DIR.  
</ul> 

<p> 
<a name="hd13_3"></a> 

<a name="heading_13.3"><h1>13.3 Directory scanning</h1></a> 

<p> 
This version of DFU introduces the new /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier.  
This qualifier directs DFU to scan all directories on the disk.  
This has some advantages :  

<ul> 
  <li>Better detection of some cases of 'lost' files. Combined with the  
/FIX qualifier DFU may be able to recover such files into the correct  
directory instead of moving such files to [SYSLOST].  
  <li>Detects and fixes file-id mismatches between the directory  
and the INDEXF.SYS file.  
  <li>Using the /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier makes DFU fully compatible  
with ANALYZE/DISK.  
</ul> 

<p> 
Please note that a complete directory scan may take several minutes  
to complete.  
<a name="hd13_4"></a> 

<a name="heading_13.4"><h1>13.4 Advanced repair actions</h1></a> 

<p> 
The /REBUILD qualifier can be used to perform some more  
repair actions. This will however lock the disk (like  
a DCL $SET VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE command) for a short period of time  
(usually less than 30 seconds). /REBUILD repairs the following errors :  

<ul> 
  <li>Mismatches in the INDEXF.SYS bitmap (files reported with the  
NOBITSET and NOBITCLR errors)  
  <li>Blocks incorrectly marked allocated or free in the BITMAP.SYS.  
  <li>Mismatches in the diskquota file.  
</ul> 

<p> 
Note that /REBUILD does NOT change the disks free block count.  

<p> 
<a name="hd13_5"></a> 

<a name="heading_13.5"><h1>13.5 Interpreting errors</h1></a> 

<p> 
On a system (cluster) wide mounted disk there will probably be  
concurrent disk activity during the VERIFY command. Therefore VERIFY  
may report  
some errors which are not really errors. Try running VERIFY 2 or 3  
times  
to see if the errors are reported again.  
To get a really consistent report from VERIFY you can use the /LOCK  
qualifier.  
This will write-lock the disk during the VERIFY run, so don't use this  
qualifier too often. (The /REPAIR qualifier of ANALYZE/DISK  also  
write-locks the disk). Even if DFU ends ungracefully the DFU exit  
handler

<p> 
VERIFY can report the following errors:  
<blockquote> 
ALLOCCLR, blocks incorrectly marked allocated,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
Blocks were found which are not allocated by a file but set in the  
BITMAP file. This error is often seen when VERIFY is run and there  
is concurrent file activity on the disk. Also, if after a system crash  
the disk is mounted with /NOREBUILD such blocks may exist.  
ReRun VERIFY with /LOCK to see if the error is still there.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/REBUILD to rebuild the BITMAP file.  
<blockquote> 
ALLOCSET, blocks incorrectly marked free,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
Blocks were found which are allocated by a file but not set in the  
BITMAP file. This error is often seen when VERIFY is run and there  
is concurrent file activity on the disk. Also, if after a system crash  
the disk is mounted with /NOREBUILD such blocks may exist.  
ReRun VERIFY with /LOCK to see if the error is still there.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/REBUILD to rebuild the BITMAP file.  
<blockquote> 
BADBLOCK, file has suspected bad blocks,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
A file has suspected bad blocks. This is likely to be caused by  
hardware errors  
on the disk.  
User Action 
Try to copy the file to another location. Also check the Error Log.  
<blockquote> 
BADEXTLNK, link to extension header broken,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
VERIFY tries to follow the extension link of the file and it  
failed, or the extension header is invalid.  
User Action 
Try ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR. However, this may be an unrepairable error, in  
which  
case the file will be corrupted and unreliable.  
<blockquote> 
BADMFDLNK, directory has backlink to 000000.DIR on RVN n,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
A directory has a backlink to a Master file directory other  
than the one on RVN 1. This is incorrect, but the only way to recover  
is to  
reenter the directory manually into the 000000.DIR on RVN 1.  
User Action 
Do a SET FILE/ENTER into the 000000.DIR directory on RVN 1, then do  
a SET FILE/REMOVE from the wrong 000000.DIR.  
<blockquote> 
DELETED, file marked for delete,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
A file was found marked for deletion. Such files usually exists as  
a result of file being deleted while it was still INSTALLed , or as  
a result of a system crash. It is not considered as an error. You can  
try  
to delete such files by using VERIFY/FIX.  
<blockquote> 
ERRHOME, Home block info not OK,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
The Info contained in the Home Block was not consistent or corrupted.  
User Action 
Run ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR to try to fix the error.  
<blockquote> 
INVBAKFID, file has invalid backlink,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
The files backlink file id is not filled in. This is likely to be a  
lost  
file. (Note that once VERIFY reports this error, it will not be  
reported  
again during the LOSTFILE check). But is also possible that the file  
is in a valid directory, but that the Backlink file id is not filled  
in.  
User Action 
Run ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR. If the file is in a valid directory the  
backlink will  
be repaired. Otherwise the file will be moved to the [SYSLOST]  
directory.  
You can also use VERIFY/FIX but then the file will unconditionally be  
moved  
to [SYSLOST].  
<blockquote> 
LOCKED, file is deaccess locked,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
The file is deaccess locked. This may be a result of a system crash.  
User Action 
Try to unlock the file with the DFU SET command, or the DCL UNLOCK  
command.  
<blockquote> 
LOSTHDR1, file found in nonexistent directory,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
During the lost file check a file was discovered in a nonexistent  
directory.  
This error can be caused as follows : set a directory file to  
NODIRECTORY  
and delete it.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/FIX to move the file to the [SYSLOST] directory.  
<blockquote> 
LOSTHDR2, file found in directory with bad backlink,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
During the lost file check a file was discovered in a valid directory.  
However, the directory has an invalid backlink.  
This error can be caused by doing a SET FILE/REMOVE of a directory  
file.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/FIX to move the directory to the [SYSLOST] directory.  
Then move the directory back to the correct location. The files in  
the directory should be accesible again.  
<blockquote> 
LOSTHDR3, file found in invalid directory,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
During the lost file check a file was discovered in a  directory which  
is not a valid directory. Either the file has a wrong backlink, or  
the directory file has the directory file attribute not set.  
User Action 
Look up the directory and use DFU SET to set the directory bit. If the  
directory file was OK then run VERIFY/FIX to recover the lost file.  
<blockquote> 
LOSTHDR4, not found in a directory,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
When the /DIRECTORY_SCAN qualifier is used , DFU detects files  
which have a valid backlink but which are not seen in the directory.  
This can be repaired with /FIX.  
User Action 
Using /FIX will enter these files in the correct directory.  
<blockquote> 
MULTALLOC, blocks multiple allocated,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 ERROR  
Explanation 
A file has blocks allocated which already belong to another file.  
Note that VERIFY will make a second pass through INDEXF.SYS  
to report all the files involved. This is a serious error, and may be a  
result of a disk being mounted on two seperated VAXClusters  
(or a partitioned VAXCluster).  
User Action 
Copy all the files found to another location. Next all the files must  
be  
deleted. Run VERIFY/REBUILD to repair the BITMAP. All the afflicted  
files must be manually inspected to see which files are valid and which  
are  
corrupted.  
<blockquote> 
NOBITCLR, Deleted file header marked BUSY,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
A file was deleted. The corresponding bit in the INDEXF bitmap should  
be  
cleared but is still set. This is not a serious error.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/REBUILD to fix the error.  
<blockquote> 
NOBITSET, index file bitmap bit not set,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
A valid file was found , but the corresponding index file bitmap  
bit is clear. This is not a serious error.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/REBUILD to fix the error.  
<blockquote> 
NOOWNER, file has no owner,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
A file was found with UIC [0,0] as the owner. This is not a normal  
situation.  
User Action 
Look up the file and modify the file owner.  
<blockquote> 
QUOTAERR, UIC [x,y] has n blocks used, QUOTA indicates m blocks,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
If a disk has diskquota enabled, VERIFY calculates the blocks used and  
compares them with the value in the QUOTA.SYS file. Any mismatch is  
reported.  
This error is often seen when VERIFY is run, and there  
is concurrent file activity on the disk. Also, if after a system crash  
the disk is mounted with /NOREBUILD such Quota mismatches may exist.  
ReRun VERIFY with /LOCK to see if the error is still there.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/REBUILD to rebuild the QUOTA file.  
Or run a DISKQUOTA&gt; REBUILD command.  
<blockquote> 
SLFBAKFID, backlink points to itself,   
</blockquote> 
Severity 
 WARNING  
Explanation 
This error indicates that DFU has found a directory with a backlink  
pointing  
to itself. This feature is only allowed for the MFD 000000.DIR. This  
error  
will result in ANALYZE/DISK going into a COMputable loop.  
User Action 
Run VERIFY/FIX to move the directory to the [SYSLOST] directory.  
Then remove the directory entry from itself with a SET FILE/REMOVE  
command.  
The files in the directory should be accesible again.

<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>/APPEND=filename</h3> 
This qualifier redirects the output to be appended to an  
already existing file. If the output file does not exists it will  
be created. You can use /APPEND or /OUTPUT but not both.  
<h3>/DIRECTORY_SCAN</h3> 
Performs a full directory scan. This may take up some time, but it  
allows detection of mismatches between the directories and  
INDEXF.SYS.    
<h3>/FIX</h3> 
<h3>/NOFIX (default)</h3> 
Repair errors on the disk. File marked for delete will be deleted and  
lost files and directories will be moved to [SYSLOST].  
<h3>/LOCK</h3> 
<h3>/NOLOCK (default)</h3> 
Locks the disk for file allocation/deletion. This gives a consistent  
report  
for the disk, but other users may experience a delay when accessing the  
disk.  
The device will be unlocked a the end of the VERIFY command.  
<h3>/OUTPUT=filename</h3> 
This qualifier redirects the output to a file. The output will  
also go to SYS$OUTPUT.  
CAUTION: if you use /LOCK in combination with /OUTPUT  
be carefull to specify an outputfile on ANOTHER disk, or DFU will  
finish  
with a severe error.  
<h3>/REBUILD</h3> 
<h3>/NOREBUILD (default)</h3> 
Perform a volume rebuild.  
Using this qualifier will temporarily lock the disk for other users.  
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3> 
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed  
Time,  
I/O and PageFaults.
