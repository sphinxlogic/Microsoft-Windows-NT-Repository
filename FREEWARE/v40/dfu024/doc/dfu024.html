<p> 
The Disk and File Utilities (DFU) is a high perfomance tool  
meant as an aid to the system manager who is responsible for monitoring  
and maintaining disks, files and directories.  
It makes use of low level I/O features of VMS. As a result a high level  
of performance is reached with minimal overhead on the system.  
DFU supports all types of disk sets which comply to the VMS ODS-2  
standard  
such as volume sets, stripe sets , shadow sets and RAID sets,  
and combinations of these.  

<p> 
DFU does NOT work on Spiralog disks. Trying to use DFU on spiralog  
disks will produce the error "%DFU-E-NOTF11, Device does not have an  
ODS-2  
filesystem" .  
<a name="hd1_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_1.1"><h1>1.1 Support on DFU</h1></a> 

<p> 
Although there is no official support on DFU you may send  
questions/remarks/bug-reports to the author via  
internet address dorland@utrtsc.enet.dec.com.  
A next version of DFU will no longer work on VMS 5.5-2 and VMS 6.0.  
<a name="hd1_2"></a> 

<a name="heading_1.2"><h1>1.2 General description</h1></a> 

<p> 
DFU provides the following functions (in alphabetical order) :  

<ul> 
  <li>DEFRAG : This function allows simple defragmentation of a file or  
a list of files.  
  <li>DELETE : This function allows either a delete by file-id, or a  
fast delete  
of a complete directory or directory tree with all its subdirectories.  
  <li>DIRECTORY : This function has 6 options :  

  <ol> 
    <li>COMPRESS a directory  
    <li>DUMP a directory block by block  
    <li>CREATE a directory with a preallocated size  
    <li>Search all directories on the disk for files which have  
multiple versions  
    <li>Search all directories on the disk for alias file entries  
    <li>Search all directories on the disk for empty directories  
  </ol> 
  <li>REPORT : Generates a file and free space report for a disk. Also  
a  
disk space usage report, based on UIC's or identifiers, can be  
generated, even  
on a disk which has disk quota disabled.  
  <li>SEARCH : Look up files on a disk by specific file attributes (eg.  
files sizes, dates, ownership, and so on)  
  <li>SET : This functions allows setting of file attributes which are  
not available through DCL commands.  
  <li>UNDELETE : A safe file recovery function.  
  <li>VERIFY : This function performs a fast disk structure  
verification  
and can optionally repair certain disk structure errors  
(comparable with ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR).  
</ol> 

<p> 
Each function is described in detail in the corresponding chapter.  

<p> 
DFU is supported on OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2 through V7.1, and OpenVMS Alpha  
V6.1 thru  
V7.1. DFU has been tested on the Field test versions of VMS 7.1; so  
far no problems have been found. The official freeware release of DFU  
will  
be distributed with the official release of VMS V7.1.  
<a name="hd1_3"></a> 

<a name="heading_1.3"><h1>1.3 New features of V2.4 </h1></a> 

<p> 
This version of DFU offers several improved and new features,  
as well as a couple of bugfixes.  
The new functions and features are:  

<ul> 
  <li>Improved handling of UIC's and Identifiers. DFU now accepts all  
valid numeric and alphanumeric UIC's and identifiers. This option  
is used in the /OWNER and /IDENTIFIER qualifier. The SEARCH, SET and  
UNDELETE  
commands use these qualifiers.  
  <li>In some cases the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier was too restrictive;  
therefore it has been removed from  
the DIRECTORY/COMPRESS, DELETE/DIR and the SET command.  
  <li>Output formatting is now possible on the SEARCH and  
DIRECTORY/VERSION  
commands via the /FORMAT qualifier. This allows the building of action  
DCL command procedures directly from the output of these commands.  
  <li>Output file handling : the new /APPEND qualifier allows DFU to  
add  
output to an existing output file instead of creating a new one.  
  <li>DELETE/DIRECTORY : the new /KEEP qualifier allows preservation of  
the  
directory tree; only the directory content is deleted.  
  <li>SEARCH : added the /OVER_ALLOCATED qualifier to search for  
over allocated files.  
  <li>REPORT : Several new qualifiers allow control over the output.  
The /USAGE  
qualifier can now also be used as /USAGE=&lt;uic&gt; to report a  
specific  
uic or identifier.  
  <li>UNDELETE: ability to undelete files marked for delete  
  <li>VERIFY : several enhancements. VERIFY /DIRECTORY allows a  
complete  
directory check; this results in better detection of lost files  
and some cases of directory problems. Note that /DIRECTORY_SCAN  
replaces the DIRECTORY/CHECK comand.  
Also incorrect backlinks of the Master File Directory (000000.DIR)  
can now be repaired.  
Finally the output of multiple allocated blocks has been improved (  
is now sorted by LBN's).  
</ul> 

<p> 
The following bugs have been fixed:  

<ul> 
  <li>On VAX/VMS V5.5-2 without the patch on SMGSHR installed, DFU  
could  
exit with an ACCVIO error. A workaround has been build in to  
avoid this problem.  
  <li>When processing a corrupt directory DFU could end with an  
ACCVIO error. This has been fixed by better checking  
of the directory file.  
  <li>SET/MAXREC did not work properly.  
  <li>If, during an UNDELETE command CTRL/Y was entered an extra RETURN  
had to be given to abort the UNDELETE command. This is now fixed.  
  <li>VERIFY/FIX and UNDELETE did not always reenter the file with its  
original version number. DFU will now enter the file with the correct  
version number, or the next higher version if the current version  
already exists.  
  <li>Issue a correct error message when trying to use DFU on non ODS-2  
disks such as a Spiralog volume.  
  <li>In a batch job DFU could produce unwanted blank pages when the  
logical DFU$NOSMG was defined.  
</ul> 

<p> 
<a name="hd1_4"></a> 

<a name="heading_1.4"><h1>1.4 Restrictions and Parameters</h1></a> 

<p> 
The DFU program has a few restrictions :  

<ul> 
  <li>DFU can not handle volume sets with more than 32 members.  
  <li>Due to changes in VMS run time libraries for DEC C DFU.EXE files  
linked on VMS 6.2 cannot be run on VMS 6.1 and lower without relinking  
the image. The best solution is to reinstall DFU on those systems.  
  <li>The SMG interface may not work at all on VMS 5.5-2.  
In that case you need to install CSCPAT_0320 and re-install  
DFU. Warning: CSCPAT_0320 replaces SMGSHR.EXE and may have side effects  
on other applications using SMG routines.  
</ul> 

<p> 
The following minimum process quotas are recommended for DFU usage:  

<ul> 
  <li>WSQUOTA : 1500  
  <li>WSEXTENT : 3000  
  <li>DIOLM : 40  
  <li>ASTLM : 40  
  <li>FILLM : 40  
  <li>BYTLM : 30000  
  <li>PGFLQUOTA : 30000  
</ul> 

<p> 
If you use DFU on volume sets with a large number of members you may  
need to increase the SYSGEN parameter CHANNELCNT.  

<p> 
If you use the directory command on very large directory files (&gt;  
1000  
blocks) and run into errors you may need to increase the following  
parameters:  

<ul> 
  <li>WSQUOTA at least 1000 + size-of-largest directory file  
  <li>WSEXTENT : WSQUOTA + at least 1000  
  <li>CTLPAGES (SYSGEN parameter) : at least 100  
  <li>WSMAX (SYSGEN parameter) : at least WSEXTENT  
</ul> 

<p> 
Do not change parameters unless you run into errors such as EXCEEDED  
QUOTA  
or INSUFFICIENT WORKING SET LIMITS.

<a name="chapter_2"><h1>Chapter 2<br>Using DFU</h1></a> 

<p> 
This chapter describes the installation procedure and other actions  
which must be taken to run DFU.  
<a name="hd2_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_2.1"><h1>2.1 Installation procedure</h1></a> 

<p> 
DFU can be installed with the VMSINSTAL utility. During the  
installation  
VMSINSTAL does the following:  

<ul> 
  <li>Moves the documentation to SYS$HELP (Optional)  
  <li>Relinks DFU  
  <li>Creates the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier needed to perform the  
special functions. (See chapter 2.2)  
</ul> 

<p> 
The DFU utility in fact contains just 2 files :  

<ol> 
  <li>DFU.EXE : the DFU program  
  <li>DFUHLP.HLB : the on-line help file  
</ol> 

<p> 
DFU.EXE will be moved to SYS$SYSTEM, and DFUHLP.HLB will be moved  
to SYS$HELP.  

<p> 
You can optionally get documentation of DFU during installation.  
To install DFU log in into a privileged account and enter :  

<p><pre> 
$ @sys$update:vmsinstal  
  
  VAX/VMS Software Product Installation Procedure V6.2  
  
  It is 01-Aug-1996 at 13:46.  
  
  Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.  
  
  * Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]?  
  
</pre> 

<p> 
VMSINSTAL now asks for the distribution media and product. You can  
also specify the directory where you have the DFU_FREEWARE_024.A file  
instead of a device name:  

<p><pre> 
  * Where will the distribution volumes be mounted: [DDCU:]  
  
  Enter the products to be processed from the first distribution volume set.  
   
  * Products: DFU_FREEWARE_024  
  * Enter installation options you wish to use (none):  
  
  The following products will be processed:  
  
         DFU_FREEWARE_ 2.4  
  
  Beginning installation of DFU_FREEWARE_ V2.4  at 13:46  
  
  %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A ...  
  
  Installing DFU version 2.4  
  
</pre> 

<p> 
  The next question will prompt  you for the documentation files.  
  The DFU documentation is available in Line printer, PostScript, HTML  
and  
  Bookreader format. The documentation files will be copied to  
SYS$HELP.  

<p><pre> 
  * Do you want the documentation in Lineprinter format ? [Y]?  
  %VMSINSTAL-I-DOCMOVED, DFU024.LINE moved to SYS$HELP  
  
  * Do you want the documentation in PostScript(TM) format ?   [N]?  
  * Do you want the documentation in Bookreader format ? [N]?  
  * Do you want the documentation in HTML format ? [N]?  
  
</pre> 

<p> 
VMSINSTAL now links the DFU image and adds the identifier to the  
Rightslist  
(see chapter 2.2 for the meaning of the identifier).  

<p><pre> 
  Linking DFU image ...  
  %DFU-I-LINK, Linking DFU 2.4  image...  
  %DFU-S-DONE, DFU.EXE created  
  
</pre> 

<p> 
Next VMSINSTAL will create the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier if necessary.  

<p><pre> 
  
  %VMSINSTAL-I-ACCOUNT, This installation adds an identifier named  
    DFU_ALLPRIV.  
  %UAF-I-RDBADDMSG, identifier DFU_ALLPRIV value: %X80010008 added to  
    rights data base  
  
  
  %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their  
   target directories...  
  
  Installation of DFU V2.4  completed at 13:47  
  
</pre> 

<p> 
You must grant any DFU user including yourself the necessary  
DFU_ALLPRIV identifier if a user be allowed to use the special DFU  
functions.  
See chapter 2.2 for the meaning of this identifier.  
<a name="hd2_2"></a> 

<a name="heading_2.2"><h1>2.2 Security and access</h1></a> 

<p> 
DFU has some functions which must not be made available for general  
usage. Therefore DFU has 2 groups of functions :  

<ol> 
  <li>Normal functions  

  <ol> 
    <li>DELETE/DIRECTORY  
    <li>DIRECTORY  
    <li>REPORT  
    <li>SEARCH  
    <li>SET  
    <li>SPAWN  
    <li>VERIFY (except VERIFY/FIX and VERIFY/REBUILD)  
  </ol> 
    <br>  <li>Special functions  

  <ol> 
    <li>DEFRAG  
    <li>DELETE/FILE  
    <li>UNDELETE  
    <li>VERIFY/FIX and VERIFY/REBUILD  
  </ol> 
</ol> 

<p> 
The normal functions need SYSPRV or BYPASS privilege.  
The special functions require BYPASS privilege as well as the  
DFU_ALLPRIV  
identifier granted.  
The DFU_ALLPRIV identifier is created during the installation  
procedure. To enable a user to perform special functions the system  
manager must grant this identifier as follows :  

<p><pre> 
$ mc authorize  
UAF&gt; grant/id DFU_ALLPRIV username  
</pre> 

<p> 
It is highly recommended that special functions are NOT made  
available to the world.  

<p> 
<a name="hd2_3"></a> 

<a name="heading_2.3"><h1>2.3 Running DFU</h1></a> 

<p> 
To run DFU you can enter :  

<p><pre> 
$ RUN disk:[mydir]DFU  
</pre> 

<p> 
or (if DFU is installed systemwide):  

<p><pre> 
$ MC DFU  
</pre> 

<p> 
You can also define and use a symbol for DFU as follows:  

<p><pre> 
$ DFU == "$DFU"  
$ DFU  
</pre> 

<p> 
DFU now prompts with :  

<p><pre> 
    Disk and File Utilities for OpenVMS DFU V2.4  
    Freeware version  
    Copyright (C) 1996 Digital Equipment Corporation  
  
DFU&gt;  
</pre> 

<p> 
You can now enter DFU commands. HELP gives you online  
help. After each command DFU returns to the DFU&gt;  
prompt. You can recall and edit commands, just as with  
DCL (20 commands will be stored in the recall buffer).  
Use EXIT or CTRL/Z to leave DFU.  
If you use a symbol for DFU , you also process a single  
command and return to DCL immediately:  

<p><pre> 
$DFU SEARCH disk/qualifiers  
</pre> 

<p> 
During a DFU run , you can interrupt DFU with CTRL/C or  
CTRL/Y. These interrupts are catched  
by DFU to allow a correct rundown of the current  
command. It may therefore take some time  
before DFU responds to a CTRL/C or Y interrupt.  
<a name="hd2_4"></a> 

<a name="heading_2.4"><h1>2.4 Using an indirect file list</h1></a> 

<p> 
There are 3 commands, DIRECTORY, DEFRAG and SET which accept  
an indirect file as input parameter. This is achieved by using the  
@ sign. An indirect file is a file containing a list of valid filenames  
(each line in such a file must contain exactly one file). Such indirect  
files can be the output file of the DFU Search command eg.:  

<p><pre> 
$ DFU  
DFU&gt; SEARCH mydisk/CHAR=DIRECTORY/OUTPUT=x.x  
DFU&gt; DIRECTORY/COMPRESS @x.x  
</pre>

<p><hr size=5> 
<a name="chapter_3"><h1>Chapter 3<br>The SMG output interface</h1></a> 

<p> 
As of version V2.2 DFU uses SMG (Screen management routines) to perform  
output for an interactive DFU session. This chapter describes  
the layout of the DFU screen, the special commands used only in the  
SMG interface and other items with respect to the SMG interface.  
<a name="hd3_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_3.1"><h1>3.1 Enabling/Disabling SMG</h1></a> 

<p> 
DFU automatically selects SMG output if you run an interactive DFU  
session on a terminal or workstation which supports SMG.  
In a batch job or a non-DEC terminal DFU will use normal line oriented  
output. You can explicitly disable SMG by defining the logical  
DFU$NOSMG to any value.  
<a name="hd3_2"></a> 

<a name="heading_3.2"><h1>3.2 Automatic switching between SMG and Line mode</h1></a> 
You may prefer to perform interactive DFU sessions in SMG mode, and  
single DFU commands in normal line mode. This can be done by using  
the command procedure listed below:  

<p><pre> 
  
$! Procedure to switch beteen SMG and line mode  
$ DFU = "$DFU"  
$ if p1 .eqs. ""  
$ then  
$!Interactive seesion  
$ def/user sys$input sys$command  
$ dfu  
$ else  
$!Single command so disable SMG  
$ def/user dfu$nosmg x  
$ dfu 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8'  
$ endif  
$ exit

<a name="heading_3.4"><h1>3.4 Special Screen commands</h1></a> 

<p> 
In SMG mode the following keys perform special functions :  

<ul> 
  <li>DO : invokes a subprocess (same as the SPAWN command)  
  <li>HELP or PF2 : invokes a special SMG window for the help command.  
  <li>CTRL/W : redraws the screen  
  <li>PF4 : creates a screen dump into the file DFU_SCREEN.TXT  
  <li>PREV SCREEN : Scrolls back the output screen.  
  <li>NEXT SCREEN : Scrolls forward the output screen  
  <li>SELECT : Toggles between 80 and 132 columns.  
</ul> 

<p> 
Although only some 20 lines are visible in the output (main) screen  
DFU in fact remembers 500 output lines. You can scroll back and  
forward through these lines with the NEXT and PREV SCREEN keys.  
At the beginning of each new DFU command these lines are cleared.  

<p> 
On a workstation with DecWindows/Motif you can change the DecTerm size  
to be more than the standard 24 lines. DFU's SMG screen will  
automatically  
adjust to the screen size of such a DecTerm.

<a name="heading_3.5"><h1>3.5 Side effects</h1></a> 

<p> 
There are a few side effects when using SMG mode. CTRL/C and CTRL/Y  
are catched but not echoed. Also all broadcast messages are trapped  
and will be displayed in the main screen at the end of the current  
DFU command. Sometimes this may slightly disrupt the main screen, which  
can be repaired with the CTRL/W key.  

<p> 
Further, during the execution of a DFU command the cursor will  
disappear.  
After the command finishes the cursor will reappear at the DFU&gt;  
prompt.

<a name="chapter_4"><h1>Chapter 4<br>DFU basics</h1></a> 

<p> 
Note : this chapter is meant for first time users of DFU. If you  
already  
used DFU before you may probably skip this chapter.  

<p> 
This chapter gives a brief overview of the commands which can be used  
with DFU, and how they can provide the system manager with the  
necessary  
information.  

<p> 
One of most common actions by a system manager is trying to locate  
specific  
files eg. files with a certain file size. Although a lot can be done  
with  
the VMS DIRECTORY command this can be a time consuming process ,  
especially if  
the complete disk much be scanned. The SEARCH command of DFU is exactly  
meant  
for this situation. It gives a very quick list of specific files, with  
their size, and if needed the number of file fragments. Some usefull  
SEARCH  
commands are :  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; SEARCH disk/SIZE=MINIMUM=1000 (files &gt; 1000 blocks)  
DFU&gt; SEARCH disk/IDENT=SYSTEM (files owned by SYSTEM)  
DFU&gt; SEARCH disk/FRAGMENT=MINIMUM=10 (files with at least 10 fragments)  
DFU&gt; SEARCH disk/CHAR=MARKED (all files marked for delete)  
DFU&gt; SEARCH disk/CREATED=SINCE=YESTERDAY (all files created since YESTERDAY)  
</pre> 

<p> 
Of course these qualifiers can be combined to narrow the search.  
As the SEARCH command scans INDEXF.SYS , not directories, the output  
generated by SEARCH may look a bit random (but it is just the order in  
which the file headers are in the INDEXF.SYS file). To smooth the  
output  
use the /SORT qualifier.  

<p> 
Another important action for a system manager is to gather some overall  
disk information , such as number of files , free space statistics and  
fragmentation information. The REPORT command will generate such a  
disk report. To get individual disk space usage information the /USAGE  
qualifier can be used. This will work even if there is no disk quota  
enabled on the disk.  

<p> 
At regular intervals a system manager may need to check a disk with  
ANALYZE/DISK. The DFU VERIFY command provides more or less the same  
functionality but many times faster. The /FIX qualifier provides  
some REPAIR options which (unlike ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR) do NOT lock the  
disk, and thus do not interfere with other disk operations.  
However, the disk can be rebuild completely by using the /REBUILD  
qualifier.  

<p> 
Occasionaly a user will delete the wrong file, leaving the system  
manager  
or operator with the tedious task of restoring the file from a backup  
set.  
The UNDELETE command may be able to recover the file if it has not yet  
been overwritten with a new one. Much care has been taken to make this  
command as safe as possible; therefore no disk corruptions will be the  
result of an UNDELETE. If DFU encounters a problem with a deleted file  
it will refuse to UNDELETE it.  

<p> 
Another type of typical system manager problems deals with directories.  
The DFU command DIRECTORY can handle such problems. DIRECTORY can  
generate  
reports about empty directories (/EMPTY qualifier) or directories which  
contains files with a certain number of versions (/VERSION=n  
qualifier).  
Also , directories may become internally fragmented which degrades  
performance. This can be quickly solved by using DFU's directory  
compressing (the /COMPRESS qualifier).  

<p> 
A second problem with directories is in deleting a directory with many  
files.  
On large directories this may take several hours using a DCL DELETE *.*  
command. This problem is solved  
by using DFU's DELETE/DIRECTORY command which can delete large  
directories  
some 10 times faster than the normal DELETE command does. Also, using  
DELETE/DIR/TREE will delete a complete directory tree with just one  
command.  

<p> 
The last 2 commands deal with individual files. SET allows settings of  
some special file attributes. Since VMS V6.0 this functionality is also  
provided by the DCL SET FILE/ATTRIBUTE command, but DFU's SET offers  
some more options. The DEFRAG command is an interface to the MOVEFILE  
function offered by VMS 5.5 and higher. This allows a simple  
defragmentation  
of individual files.  

<p> 
The next chapters gives a detailed description of each individual DFU  
command.

<p> 
This chapter describes the DEFRAG command with the related parameters  
and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd5_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_5.1"><h1>5.1 Description</h1></a> 

<p> 
The DEFRAG command can be used to defragment a single file or a group  
of  
files. You can also enter an indirect command file containing a list of  
files. This feature allows you to create an output file with SEARCH  
and use that as an input to DEFRAG.  

<p> 
DEFRAG makes use of the file-primitive MOVEFILE function. Therefore  
files which are open, or which are marked NOMOVE will not be  
DEFRAGmented.  
Still you should be cautious about using DEFRAG. You should not make  
this function available for general usage.  

<p> 
<a name="hd5_2"></a> 

<a name="heading_5.2"><h1>5.2 Error messages</h1></a> 

<p> 
The most common errors returned by DEFRAG are :  

<ul> 
  <li>ACCONFLICT:  File is open by another user  
  <li>DEVICEFULL:  Device has not enough  contiguous free  
space to move the entire file  
  <li>FILNOTACC:   File has been set to NOMOVE.  
  <li>FILENUMCHK:  You tried to move a reserved file (eg INDEXF.SYS).  
  <li>RMS Errors:   Almost always caused by an invalid or  
wrong file specifcation.  
</ul>

<p><blockquote> 
Defragment a file or a list of files on the disk.  
</blockquote> 
<hr> 
<h2>Format</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>DEFRAG file1,file2,@file... </h3> 
</blockquote> 
<hr> 
<h2>PARAMETERS</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>file1,file2,@file...</h3> 
The file(s) to be defragmented. You can also use an indirect command  
file (@file) which contains a list of files to be defragmented. This  
may be  
an output file generated with the SEARCH/OUTPUT command.  
</blockquote> 
<hr> 
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>/BESTTRY</h3> 
Normally DEFRAG tries to create a contiguous file. If there is not  
enough  
contiguous free space the operation will fail. With the /BESTTRY  
qualifier  
DEFRAG tries to move the file with the contiguous-best-try method.  
This means a maximum of 3 fragments. You should only use this qualifier  
when a normal DEFRAG fails. If a DEFRAG/BESTTRY also fails this is an  
indication that the disks free space is too fragmented. Run a REPORT  
command  
to see what the largest contiguous free space is, and check the free  
space fragmentation index.  
<h3>/DEVICE</h3> 
The device on which the files reside. The device name is added to the  
file name. If you generate a file list with the DFU SEARCH command  
you don't need this qualifier anymore. However you may have a list  
of files produced from another source and thus need to append a device  
name to it.  
Example:  

<p><pre> 
  DFU&gt; SEARCH mydisk/...../frag=min=50/output=x.x  
  DFU&gt; DEFRAG @x.x  
</pre> 

<h3>/LBN=logical-block-number</h3> 
Forces a single file to be moved to the specified logical block number.  
Do not use this qualifier when processing a list of files.  
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3> 
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed  
Time,  
I/O and PageFaults.  
<h3>/WRITECHECK</h3> 
Perform a writecheck on the resultant file. The default is  
/NOWRITECHECK.  
Note that a writecheck doubles the number of involved disk I/O's.

<a name="chapter_6"><h1>Chapter 6<br>DELETE</h1></a> 

<p> 
This chapter describes the DELETE command with the related parameters  
and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd6_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_6.1"><h1>6.1 Introduction</h1></a> 

<p> 
The DELETE command is designed for 2 purposes:  

<ol> 
  <li>Delete a file by file id (with the /FILE qualifier). This  
functionality  
is needed to be able to delete files which no longer have a parent  
directory.  
This way 'lost' files and (sometimes) files marked for delete can be  
removed  
from a disk.  
  <li>A fast method to delete a complete directory or even a directory  
tree  
(with the /DIRECTORY and /TREE qualifier). First all entries of a  
directory are  
deleted without removing the directory entry ; this saves a lot of  
unnecessary directory updates.  
Finally the directory file itself is deleted, unless the new /KEEP  
qualifier is used.  
This way a directory is cleaned up many times faster than with the  
DCL DELETE *.* command. On large directories DFU may be even 10 or more  
times  
faster than DCL.  
To delete a complete directory tree use the /TREE qualifier.  
The DCL command DELETE [.SUBDIR...]*.*;* will almost always  
fail to delete the intermediate subdirectory files forcing you to issue  
this command several times. The DFU DELETE command is smart enough to  
delete  
the files and the subdirectory files in the proper order; therefore  
only  
one command is sufficient to delete a complete directory tree.  
    <br>The new /KEEP qualifier allows you to preserve the directory  
tree.  
The contents are deleted but the directory file(s) remains intact.
