=======================================

Mpeg3play is an Mpeg audio layer2 and layer3 real-time player.

It is  only available with OpenVMS Alpha systems with a 16 bits sound
card and MMOV (MultiMedia services for OpenVMS) installed (Alphastations 200,
250, 255, 500, 600)

On Alphastation 255 4/233, real time playing of an Mpeg-2 file gives about 25 %
cpu load (44,1 Khz stereo). Real time playing of an Mpeg-3 file gives about 50%
cpu load (44,1 Khz stereo).

This kit contains sources, object and executables plus sample mpeg audio files

Enjoy !!
