
                     Introduction to the OpenVMS Freeware
                     ------------------------------------

OpenVMS Engineering is again sponsoring an OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM.  The
OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM contains "public domain" and "freeware" software 
which runs on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha, and selected tools specific 
to the interoperation of other systems with OpenVMS systems.  The purpose 
of the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM is to provide OpenVMS customers with easy 
access to public domain software and to "free" internal Compaq software 
and tools.

The guidelines for the software to be contained on the OpenVMS Freeware 
CD-ROM are the following:

o The software must be unencumbered to the public.  No license fees shall
  be requested of or required by the customer for its use.
o If a product authorization key (PAK) is required, an unrestricted PAK
  must be provided with the submission.
o The software must run on OpenVMS VAX and/or OpenVMS Alpha, or be of 
  direct relevance ("Affinity") to OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha systems.
o Compaq does not warranty this software in any way.  It is provided as
  "as is" software.
o Compaq will not provide service for this software, fix the software, 
  or warranty that it works correctly.
o Customers are free to adapt and change the sources for their needs.


                 Acquiring a Copy of the Freeware CD-ROM kit
                 -------------------------------------------

The OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM will be distributed in conjunction with the 
standard OpenVMS operating system software distribution kits.  It will 
also be made available for anonymous access from the OpenVMS Website:

  http://www.openvms.digital.com/

The Freeware CD-ROM kit is not expected to be separately orderable.


                 Creating a Kit for Inclusion on the Freeware
                 --------------------------------------------

Please carefully follow the following simple steps to ease the job of 
packaging the wealth of software onto the Freeware CD-ROM kit:

  1: Build the software into a saveset or ZIP kit.  Each product must be 
     in a DIFFERENT directory, or in a separate saveset or ZIP kit.  If 
     the sources are included, place them in a subdirectory called [.SRC].

     You must to supply one file (and optionally two others) in each 
     top-level directory:

       - FREEWARE_README.TXT  

         This file must have the following format for the FIRST line:

            PACKAGE_NAME, CATEGORY, ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION

          for example:

            INTOUCH 4GL, LANGUAGES, High-performance 4GL for VAX and Alpha...

         The one-line descriptions will be truncated to 60 characters.  This
         will allow them to display nicely on the selection menus later on.

         The list of categories to choose from are:

         AFFINITY             Interoperation with Microsoft Windows systems
         BUILD TOOLS          Build tools
         WEB TOOLS            CGI and HTML tools
         GAMES                Games (also see Motif Toys)
         GRAPHICS             Graphics tools
         LANGUAGES            Compilers, assemblers, and language-related
         MISCELLANEOUS        Or ask for a new category
         MOTIF TOYS           X Windows, CDE, and Motif toys
         NETWORKING           Networking and network-related tools
         SYSTEM MANAGEMENT    Tools related to system managemet, security, etc
         UTILITIES            Random Utilities not related to other categories

         Compaq OpenVMS Engineering may choose to reset the category to 
         match one of the above categories, or to a more appropriate 
         category.  Petitions for the creation of new categories gladly 
         accepted.

         Any additional lines of text in the FREEWARE_README.TXT file will 
         be displayed to the user from the MENU SYSTEM, if they choose this 
         package from the menu.

       - FREEWARE_DEMO.TXT file (optional)
  
         The FREEWARE_DEMO.TXT file is text that can explain how to try this
         software...or explains what the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM file will be
         showing the user.

       - FREEWARE_DEMO.COM (optional)
  
         If the user selects this package from the menu system, 
         the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM file will be executed.

  2: Each directory should contain the VAX and Alpha executables (if 
     possible), help text, documentation, sources (in [.SRC]) and then 
     anything else you want to put there.  If the kit contains both
     VAX and Alpha objects or executables, consider using subdirectories
     [.VAX_IMAGES] and [.ALPHA_IMAGES].

     If the software is already kitted as a VMSINSTAL or PCSI kit, that 
     is quite acceptable.  Just put the kits in the directory along with 
     the instructions and a basic introduction.

  3: PLEASE make sure that the .txt and .com files are easy to read and 
     understand.  The more friendly your instructions and directions, the 
     more likely that others will want to try it.

  4: In order for the software to be considered for inclusion on the 
     freeware CD-ROM, the attached release form MUST be submitted with 
     the software.  

     Electronic copies of the signed release form are acceptable.

     The release form will not be included in the distribution.
