MUSIXTEX, MISCELLANEOUS, Score macros for TeX/LaTeX

MusixTeX is a set of TeX macros to typeset polyphonic, orchestral or
polyphonic music. Therefore, it is mainly supposed to be used to type wide
scores -- just because true musicians seldom like to have to frequently turn
pages -- and this is not really compatible with LaTeX's standard page
formats.
