VILE, TOOLS, VI-LIKE-EMACS text editor
vile is a text editor which is extremely compatible with vi in terms of
"finger feel".  In addition, it has extended capabilities in many areas,
notably multi-file editing and viewing, key rebinding, and real X window
system support.

Version 5.6 appeared on the second OpenVms Freeware CDROM.  This version
(6.1) has upgraded the source to ANSI C (from extended C), along with
various bug fixes.

The authors of vile are Tom Dickey (current maintainer), Paul Fox, Kevin
Buettner and Rick Sladkey.
