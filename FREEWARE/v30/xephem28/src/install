Building and Installing xephem v2.8.


Building xephem is intended to be straightforward. The goal is just to
compile all the *.c files and link with your X, Motif and UNIX libraries to
form the xephem executable program.


Begin by untaring everything into a fresh directory. You will find all the
source is in one directory. There will also be several subdirectories containing
other files but these are not important for now.


Start by constructing a suitable Makefile. If your system is fully set up for
using xmkmf or imake with Motif then try the supplied Imakefile by typing:
    xmkmf
or something like:
    imake -I/usr/lib/X11/config -DuseInstalled
then:
    make


If this doesn't work (which is too often the case in my experience) there is
also a sample stand-alone Makefile called Makefile.smple; this is what I
use. Copy it to "makefile" then find and uncomment the group of flags and
libraries that looks close to the way Motif programs are built on your
system. Then type "make" which should compile everything with the Motif
include files and link with the X, Motif and UNIX libraries as you would
any Motif application. Don't forget the math library, -lm.

If you are on VMS, there is a sample DCL file to build xephem on VMS/DECWindows
MOTIF at the end of this file. Also, you will want to change the X resource
XEphem*Print*textString to whatever command can be executed on your system
which accepts the name of a postscript file as its only arguement and prints it.


Here are some additional hints about compiling and linking xephem:

    On systems without ANSI C compilers add -D_NO_PROTO to CFLAGS.

    On older USL/AT&T systems (such as SVR3.2) add -DSYSV to CFLAGS.

    If you get regcmp or regex undefined from libXm on SVR4.2 add "-lgen"
    to LIBS. Or try the crude replacement, below, for these functions in
    terms of re_comp and re_exec.

    Setting the timezone from the operating system is only supported if your
    compiler #defines __STDC__.

    If you get undefines that begin with Xm add "-lXIM" to LIBS right after
    "-lXm".

    On SPARC systems, if your get dlopen/dlsym/dlclose undefined try
    fiddling with whether you use static or dynamic libs; best luck seems
    to be with using all dynamic libs. It appears these three functions are
    never called, however, since I can `chmod +x xephem' and it seems to
    run ok.

    On one HP 9000 I found that the X and Motif include files and libs were
    in /usr/{include,lib}/{X11R4,Motif1.1}. There was no xmkmf or imake so I
    used the "Stock" entry in Makefile.smple with the following flags:
	CFLAGS = $(CLDFLAGS) -O -D_NO_PROTO -I/usr/include/X11R4 -I/usr/include/Motif1.1
	LDFLAGS = $(CLDFLAGS) -L/usr/lib/X11R4 -L/usr/lib/Motif1.1

    I've not had good luck with gcc's math. I know that at least one
    version I used on a SPARC recently caused the precession algorithm to
    go badly astray.

    I have searched carefully through the output of running all of xephem
    through lint and gcc on UnixWare, Linux and SunOS and can rationalize
    all the warnings, so don't let these bother you too much.

    Avoid Motif 1.2.0; newer versions of 1.2 seem to be ok.

    If xephem does not work well on your color display, or the colormap is
    out of entries, xephem can be operated using mostly black and white as
    follows: xephem -fg black -bg white.

    The BackSpace and Delete keys do not work correctly on many Linux systems.
    The following commands might be helpful (I have them in my .xinitrc):
	xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
	xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = Delete"

    If running under UnixWare 2.0 with mwm, you will get traditional Motif
    dialog behavior if you set Mwm*secondariesOnTop: True.


Xephem v2.7 was known to run on the following systems. Check with the author
at ecdowney@noao.edy for assistance with porting. Check on iraf.noao.edu in
contrib/xephem for contributed statically-linked binary executables.

Follows is a summary of each of the runtime files used by xephem and, where
appropriate, the names of the related X resources which define them:

    xephem: executable; put where you want locally installed X programs.

    xephem.hlp: help file; point at it with the resource:
	XEphem.HELPFILE

    *.edb: sample astronomical databases; put them all in a directory and
	name it by setting the X resource: XEphem.DBdirectory.

    xephem_sites: sample Earth sites file; point at it with the resource:
	XEphem.SITESFILE

    xephem.man: nroff source for manual; process the output with something like
	"nroff -man xephem.man" and place either/both where you want man pages
	for locally installed X programs.

    fullmoon.fts: FITS file of full moon image; point at it with the resource:
	XEphem.MoonFile

    moon_db: list of lunar features; point at it with the resource:
	XEphem.MoonDB

    XEphem.ad: sample resource file; name it XEphem and place it where you
	want application default resources for locally installed X programs.
	Or put it in, say, your home directory and set the environment variable
	XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to $HOME/%N.

    work/xephem.ps: this is the default name of Postscript save file. This is
	set with the X resource: XEphem*SaveAs*textString. Related, is the
	command which is issued to print. This command is assumed to accept the
	name of a postscript file to print as its one and only argument. The
	name of the command that is issued is in the X resource:
	XEphem*Print*textString.


If you would like to pull out just the astronomical functionality from xephem
for your own programs, start with obj_cir(). This is basically the dividing
line between the user interface and the astronomical functions. Also, the
following files are pretty much just pure transliterations from BASIC into C
from machine-readable copies of the programs in Duffett-Smith's book.  They
have nothing to do with the rest of xephem so they may be used for completely
different applications if so desired. Supporting declations are in astro.h.

    aa_hadec.c anomaly.c astro.h comet.c eq_ecl.c moon.c moonnf.c mjd.c
    nutation.c obliq.c parallax.c pelement.c plans.c reduce.c refract.c
    sun.c utc_gst.c




If you get regcmp or regex undefined, you might try the following functions
which attempt to minimally implement them in terms of re_comp and re_exec.
The reg* functions historically came from the System V lineage of UNIX, while
the re_* functions came from the BSD lineage. To try these alternatives, put
them into a file, say, regcmp.c, and add regcmp.o to the OBJS list n the make
file and remake.

=============================== regcmp.c ======================================

#include <stdio.h>

extern char *malloc();
extern char *re_comp();
extern int re_exec();

/* given an RE:
 *   compile and return malloced internal form if ok
 *   else return NULL if fail
 * N.B. we assume the entire pattern is in the first string.
 * N.B. we assume the caller has no interest within the returned string.
 */
char *
regcmp (re)
char *re;
{
	/* re_comp() returns NULL if RE compiled ok, else ptr to err message */
	if (re_comp (re) == NULL)
	    return (malloc ("Dummy RE"));
	return (NULL);
}

/* given compiled RE and subject:
 *   return ptr to next unmatched char if match found
 *   else return NULL if no match
 * N.B. we assume subject does not request any returned values.
 * N.B. we assume "next unmatched char" is the trailing \0 of subject.
 */
char *
regex (re, subject)
char *re, *subject;
{
	/* re_exec() returns 1 if match found, else 0 */
	if (re_exec(subject) == 1)
	    return (subject+strlen(subject));
	return (NULL);
}

======================== end of regcmp.c =====================================


for VMS users:

I do not currently have access to VMS/DECwindows but the following DCL file,
courtesy fisica@astrpd.DNET.NASA.GOV (Max Calvani - Italy) should build xephem
for VMS/DECwindows MOTIF.

In addition, drucker@Csa2.LBL.Gov (Bob Drucker, Berkeley/LBL) writes:

    For VMS users the default settings file can be pointed to in one of
    two ways.  The default name for the resource file on VMS is
    SYS$LOGIN:DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT.  If you don't wish to use this
    you can define the logical XENVIRONMENT to point to the file (this
    allows you to keep the file anywhere you want with any name).
