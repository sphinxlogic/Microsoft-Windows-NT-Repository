PROBE, UTILITIES, Alpha & VAX Ethernet monitor / statistics / capture / playback

 Probe is a network monitoring tool which allows the real-time capture and/or
 graphical display of Ethernet traffic activity and the tabular formatting of
 previously collected frame and/or data.

 The main features are:

 o  Extensive user-specified attributes allow fine-grained filtering and
    enhanced presentation of raw or computed traffic data. Key attributes
    are dynamically modifiable.

 o  Sampling can be performed unattended (in batch for example) by setting
    a cycle of alternating collection and sleep intervals. Statistics are
    produced for every cycle.

 o  Automatic and static symbolic representation of Ethernet addresses.

 o  Optional (complete or partial) frame data capture and playback.

 o  Automatic line counters (collision) tracking.

 o  Runs on both VAX and Alpha/AXP. Heavily speed-optimized high-priority
    multi-process MACRO32 user-mode code (assembled on VAX, compiled on AXP)
    for capture/display. Playback program in VAXC.

 Please consult the files AAREADME.* and the help documentation for details.

 Complete source code included.

 Provided executables linked on VAX/VMS 5.4-2, 5.5 and Alpha/VMS 6.2

 This is release 2.2B. Check Internet sites FTP.WKU.EDU or FTP.SPC.EDU
