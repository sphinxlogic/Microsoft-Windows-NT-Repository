you can improve this program by redoing 'depthplay.h'
or by changing the value of the filter at line 62
(sc1-resuboard[i][j]<3) 3 is the value.By reducing it you
get more speed,so you can go deeper in the analysis
(to do that you can change the value of 'dump' in 'xfortress.c'
at line 132,133 and 134.
The alogrithm used is not very efficient but for an average player
it can be ok.
You can also wait for the next version in which the computer will
be better than now...
