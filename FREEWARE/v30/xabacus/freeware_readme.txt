        X-BASED ABACUS
        ==============  Abacus X widget, V4.3


    One of the motivations of this abacus program is simplicity. This
    was originally a demonstration that I could write a window program.

    Use "mouse-left" to move beads. Note you can move them faster
    by holding down the button and sweeping across beads. Use
    "mouse-right", "C",or  "c" to clear. "Q",
    "q", or "CTRL-C" keys kill program.
