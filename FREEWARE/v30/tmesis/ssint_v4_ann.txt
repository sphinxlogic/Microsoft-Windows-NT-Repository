Hi Glenn,

The closing paragraphs of your letter which you said you had forwarded
to Dave Schmidt said that I showed unusual ability and inventiveness.

Well, I've spent the day exercising that unusual inventiveness again
with SSINT.

I realized that what I sent you could only be used to intercept those
services which were not 64 bit or did not get 64 bit enhanced.  Using
the homed argument approach and then, invoking the original service
routine via the CALLG meant that the original routine would be called
with 32 bit sign-extended argument values, at least for the first siz
which is what happens when you specify HOMED_ARGS=TRUE.  Not to worry!

I, essentially, rolled my own argument homing macro which can be used
with the EVAX_CALLG_64 built-in.  THis is the better approach because
calling the original routine is done with a full 64 bits in registers
R16 through R21 and the remaining args (stacked) are already 64 bit
ready.  

This is easily accomplished with a macro I built that I have called:
$SETUP_CALLG_64 to parallel Digital's 64 bit macros of similar naming
convention.  The macro simply subtracts <argcnt+1>*8 from the stack
pointer and then uses the EVAX_STQ built-in to move all of the args
to this stack space, for example:
	
	EVAX_SUBQ SP,#<NARGS+1>*8,SP
	EVAX_LDAQ Rx,(SP)
	EVAX_STQ  0(AP),(Rx)+
	EVAX_STQ  4(AP),(Rx)+
	EVAX_STQ  8(AP),(Rx)+
	...
	EVAX_STQ  <<NARGS+1>*8>(AP),(Rx)+
	EVAX_LDAQ Rx,(SP)


You then call the routine via EVAX_CALLG_64 (Rx),ROUTINE.

It works great for either 32 ot 64 bit addresses!

I also took care of the linker error LINK-W-MULTFR by playing another
overlaying psect game and specifying the global label LIB$INITIALIZE
which the linker automatically then make the first entry in the image
transfer vector.  Carefully overlaying this atop of the SSINT$DOINIT
routine makes it the first entry in the transfer vector and the real
DOINIT routine is the second entry.  This doesn't affect anything be-
cause the execlet loader only looks at the first transfer vector slot
and invokes the address it finds there as the initialization routine!

I had a little free time today so it was play time.  I've been sooooo
busy that all the 64 bit stuff I've done was basically the "robotic"
things that needed to be changed according to the "64 bit Upgrading
Guide".  I really needed to get in there and play with 64 bits to get
a good grasp of it all.
 
Anyway, the latest SSINT is on its way (V1.3%6.233.) MFTU encoded ZIP
as always.  I hope it's not too late to get this version on the SIG
tapes.  Don't stop the presses on my accord though.
