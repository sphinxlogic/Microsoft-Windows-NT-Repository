This version of JED requires slang version 0.99-34 or greater.  If you do
not have the library, pick up the slang distribution as well and compile it
first.  It is not needed for the pc distribution.

jedXXX.zip contains DOS executables (bin/jed*.exe) necessary
library files, etc... It does not contain any source code.  The source code
is available in the tar file.
