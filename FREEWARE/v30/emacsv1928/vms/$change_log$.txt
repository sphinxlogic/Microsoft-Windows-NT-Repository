	documented.

	* descrip.mms_in: Removed the reference to ALLOCA,
	C_SWITCH_SYSTEM, LOADLIBES, and YACC, since we don't need
	them here.  The definition of `vmssrcdir' is simplified.

	emacs_startup.dat from emacs_startup.dat_in and config.dat.

	* gnu_generate_script.com: The generated file will now say
	`%GNU_STARTUP-I-SETTING_UP' instead of `%SETUP-I-DEBUG'
	when setting up a GNU program.  Also refuses to generate
	code for definition of the same logical name over and over.
	Takes the CLD command to handle a Command Line Definition
	file.  Changed `nofile:' to `noinfile:'.

	* gnu_install_startup.com: New file.  Installs the startup
	file.

	* recurdel.com: Now part of GNU vmslib, and thus got some
	more documntation.

	* routines.tpu: Now part of GNU vmslib, and this got some
	more documentation.
	* routines.tpu(TPU_substitute): Moves to the end of the
	substitution instead of the beginning of the next line.
	* routines.tpu(TPU_delete): New routine.

	* utime.c: Includes stdio.h, starlet.h and lib$routines.h.
	Forward declares `qadd' and `qmul'.
	* utime.c(settry): Takes an extra argument, `ignored'.
	* utime.c(utime): Changed `newtime' to be an array of
	unsigned long.

	* VMSBUILD: Now referes to gnu_startup.com also.  The request
	that the user run emacs_startup.com before compiling is now
	removed.  Added a line about compvmslib.com.  Corrected a
	few other errors.

	* vmsdist.com: Removed the call to allrename.com.

Thu Mar 24 10:53:43 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	can decide whether he wants a startup database or not.

	* canonicaldir.com: Threre was a bug which changed [A.B.-] to [A.]
	instead of [A].  Fixed.

	* emacs_install.com_in: New file.  Template to emacs_install.com,
