/*
 * int esctrans (char *dst, const char *src)
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *   Copy SRC to DST translating any "special" characters.
 *
 * Description:
 *   If SRC contains no "special" characters, SRC will be copied without
 *   modification into DST.  The backslash character is used, as in printf(),
 *   to introduce any special characters.  The list of special characters
 *   includes all those listed by Kernighan and Ritchie, 2nd edition.  Any
 *   character which is not understood will be passed through after stripping
 *   the backslash.
 *
 *   Additionally, `^' is used to introduce a control character.  This latter
 *   extension is only known to work for the ASCII character set.
 *
 * Bugs:
 *   The newline character, '\n', is translated into CRLF.  This is correct
 *   for VAX/VMS, and probably for MS-DOG.
 *   
 *   The code '\0' (and its octal and hexadecimal equivalents) will be
 *   correctly converted, but will probably cause problems since the normal
 *   C string utilities will assume that is the end of the string.
 *

 *   Roland B Roberts (roberts@nsrl.rochester.edu)
 *   March 1994
