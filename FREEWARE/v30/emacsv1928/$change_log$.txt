	* configure.com_in, configure.com: the definitions of
	startupdir_dev, startupdir_dir, vuelibdir_dev and
	vuelibdir_dir are now replicated into config.status.
	Before this change, there were cases when startupdir and
	vuelibdir could end up with the value [].

Thu Nov  9 18:04:50 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* descrip.mms_in (installdatabase, installstartup): now depend
	on setup_config.
	(install_no_database): Now changed to reflect the changes on
	the install target.

Sat Feb 25 10:47:31 1995  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* INSTALL.VMS: changed `[.src]emacs.exe' and `[.src]emacs.dump'
	to `[.vms]temacs.exe' and `[.vms]temacs.dump'.

Fri Nov 25 09:32:03 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* INSTALL.VMS (BUILDING AND INSTALLATION): Now describes the
	options `--with-ucx', `--with-multinet' and `--with-netlib'.

	* configure.com_in: checks if NETLIB and SOCKETSHR are installed.
	Disable the use of symbols as verbs.  This solves the problem
	with people defining things like EDIT.  Better definition of
	the symbols exec_prefix*.  The symbol `configuration_us' is
	defined as a copy of `configuration' with all dots changed
	to underscores.  The [.LISP] is created if needed, to contain
	the changed `version.el'.

	* descrip.mms_in (do-install): force gnu.hlb to be world readable.
	(mkdir): make sure all directories have a correct protection, and
	that $(vuelibdir) gets created as well.

Mon Nov 21 17:40:47 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: checks for strerror().  Also, now depends
	on autoconf version 1.11.

Fri Aug  5 14:39:01 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Changed the dependencies on HW_NAME to
	be dependent on HW_MODEL instead.  That is more accurate.
	Also, if the VMS version on AXP is other than 1.x, assume
	it is the regular VMS distribution with the same version
	numbering as for VAX, and thus use the `vms*.h' files instead
	of `avms*.h'.

	* descrip.mms_in(all, [.vms]runtemacs.com): Now builds
	[.vms]runtemacs.com, which is used by [.vms]testemacs.com
	from now on.
	* descrip.mms_in([.vms]config.dat): Do not write empty lines,
	nor the configuration string.
	* descrip.mms_in([.vms]): Added compilation of hackdebug.exe
	* descrip.mms_in([.vms]emacs_startup.com): Made
	gnu_generate_string.com write to emacs_startup.com_tmp
	instead of emacs_startup.com.
	clause.

	* README: Corrected a typo.

Tue Jun 28 13:17:46 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* kepteditor.com: Modified to allow several Emacs from one
	xterm when using DEC Windows.

Sat May 21 22:01:51 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Added [.vms]compvmslib.com as yet a file
	to be created by AC_OUTPUT.

	* descrip.mms_in(do-install): Correctly handle old directory
	entries to emacs-<version>.* and rebuild-emacs-<version>.com.

Fri May 20 13:46:46 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* INSTALL.VMS: New file.  Describes how Emacs should be
	compiled and installed.

	* README: changed to refer to INSTALL.VMS.

Thu May 19 23:28:28 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: corrected a few documentation errors.
	Made sure all the boolean strings were in upper case.
	Removed the crazyness with accumulating logical names.  It's
	done in the description file instead.  Removed
	[.vms]emacs_startup.dat from the AC_OUTPUT call.  It is also
	fixed in the description file.

	* descrip.mms_in: changed to setup a configuration file,
	called 	config.dat.  This one now holds the data about the
	paths we might need to resolve the logical names of.
	Now, the different subdirectory are represented as different
	tergets.
	The installation target has been divided in several targets,
	To make it possible to install with or without the GNU startup
	database.  Installation of the database file is a separate
	terget as well.
	The creation of emacs_startup.dat and emacs_startup.com is
	done here now.
	The file rebuild.com is installed as rebuild-emacs.com.
	The directory [.vms] is also cleaned now.
	MMS$QUALIFIERS has been corrected to MMSQUALIFIERS.
	$(vmssrcdir)delete.com is now fully used instead of `delete'.

Sun May  1 22:33:36 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Removed the processing of the startup data
	file, and the creation of config.logicals.

	* descrip.mms_in: Now creates the file config.data from all the
	values that are defined in descrip.mms.  Also handles all the
	creation and installation of the startup command file through
	the script vms/gnu_install_startup.com.

Thu Mar 24 10:47:41 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms_in: Now, mkdir also creates $(startupdir).
	Also, for those who do not want a startup database for GNU
	stuff, the installation target install_no_database can be
	used.

Sun Mar 20 18:34:50 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* aclocal_vms.m4: Changed the macro VMS_ACCUMULATE_LOGICAL so it
	wouldn't barf so hardly on bogus logical names.  Added the macro
	VMS_INSERT_LOGICALS which replaces @all_logicals@ with all the
	accumulated logical names in a given file.

	* configure.com_in: Removed som silly bugs.  Added the possibility
	to take arguments from a file.  Changed the argument parser to not
	use so much if..else..endif nesting.  Made some changes to addapt
	to the new startup file policy.

	* descrip.mms_in: Changed to produce the file emacs_startup.com.
	Changed the installation of the startup file.

Wed Feb 23 00:36:24 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Added the debug_hack feature, which permits
	us to make a runable Emacs with all the debug info included.
	Also added the reference to [.vms]makepaths.com.  And of course,
	a few bugs are fixed.

	* descrip.mms_in: A few bugs removed.  Also writes some info about
	how one might install Emacs during bootup.

Sun Feb  6 21:35:26 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* aclocal_vms.m4: New file, containing a few extra Autoconf
	macros which are used for the VMS configuration script.

	* configure.com_in: Added support to force creation of
	config.status, even if Emacs is already configured.  Also
	added two new directories:  `startupdir' to know where to
	put emacs_startup.com, and vuelibdir, to know where to put
	emacs_vue.com (used with DECWindows).

	* descrip.mms_in: General clean up, and added support for
	`startupdir' and `vuelibdir'.  Also, general clean up of
	installation clause.
