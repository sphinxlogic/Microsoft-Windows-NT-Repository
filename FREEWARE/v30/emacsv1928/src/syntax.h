  1. This character is the first of a two-character comment-start sequence.

  4. This character is the second of a two-character comment-end sequence.

  Note that any two-character sequence whose first character has flag 1

  bit 6 is used to discriminate between two different comment styles.
  Languages such as C++ allow two orthogonal syntax start/end pairs
  and bit 6 is used to determine whether a comment-end or Scommentend
  ends style a or b. Comment start sequences can start style a or b.
  Style a is always the default.
