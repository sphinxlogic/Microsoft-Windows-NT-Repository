/* timer.c --- daemon to provide a tagged interval timer service

   This little daemon runs forever waiting for commands to schedule events.
   SIGALRM causes
   it to check its queue for events attached to the current second; if
   one is found, its label is written to stdout.  SIGTERM causes it to
   terminate, printing a list of pending events.

   This program is intended to be used with the lisp package called
   timer.el.  The first such program was written anonymously in 1990.
   This version was documented and rewritten for portability by
   esr@snark.thyrsus.com, Aug 7 1992.  */
