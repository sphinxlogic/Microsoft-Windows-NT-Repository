Sun Feb 25 17:00:08 1996  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* qsort.c: made sure alloca() is correctly declared.

Wed Dec 27 21:31:54 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* etags.c (relative_filename, absolute_filename, absolute_dirname): 
	changed to work with VMS file specifications.

Wed Dec 13 00:16:58 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* etags.c (main): rebalanced a couple of braces.

Sat Dec  9 18:11:47 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* descrip.mms_in_in (dotstar): DEC C 5.x and up change `.*'
	to `. *'.  Because of this, all `.*' are replaced with $(dotstar).

Sun Sep  3 11:49:47 1995  Richard Levitte  <LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se>

	* make-docfile.c (main): chdir() fails on VMS 6.2.  Make sure
	make-docfile will work even then.

Sun Jan 29 14:35:53 1995  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* mail.h: nothing is allowed after #endif with DEC C.

	* maildef.h: the struct flagsdef must be defined a little
	differently with DEC C than with VAX C to work correctly.

	* vmsgetmail.c: only include <maildef.h>, since the /INCLUDE
	qualifier points at the Emacs source anyway.
	(ftrunc): only call fsetpos() if out is not stdout.
	(main): do an errchk() even on the NEWMAIL folder.  Do not
	fclose() or fgetpos() on `out' if it is stdout.

Fri Nov 25 13:56:20 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms_in: added emacsclient.com to INSTALLABLES and
	emacsserver.com to UTILITIES.

	* emacsclient.com, emacsserver.com: new file.  Thanks to
	Roland B. Roberts <roberts@vaxms2.dnet.ge.com>.

	* env.c: include "config.h" instead of "../src/config.h" when
	on VMS.

	* maildef.h: `struct' and `union' changed to `variant_struct'
	and `variant_union'.

	* vmssendmail.c: Now handles distribution files.

Fri Aug  5 14:54:38 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms_in: Corrected a typo, and made sure the
	logical name `sys' is correctly defined even when
	`sys_includes' is an empty string.

	* make-docfile.c (main): Now goes back to the original
	default directory.

	* vmsgetmail.c (main): Reorganised to make it possible to
	show the count of new mails and exit.

Wed Jun  8 17:58:43 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* vmsgetmail.c (main): Changed the display of the count of new
	mail to use whatever VMS considers to be the right count.
	(getmail_usage): Changed `exit (44)' to `exit (SS$_ABORT)',
	and enhanced the message a little.

Tue Jun  7 23:25:53 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms_in: Corrected a typo.

Fri May 20 13:59:03 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms_in: removed ctags.exe from INSTALLABLES, since
	it is not supported.  Removed the references to hackargv,
	since it has been included in vmslib, and etags-vmslib.obj,
	since it has been replaced with hackargv.

Sun Mar 20 18:44:57 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* mail.h, maildef.h, mailmsgdef.h, vmsgetmail.c, vmsgetmail.readme:
	New files, to support reading of mail.

	* vmssendmail.c: Changed an error message.

Wed Feb 23 00:43:40 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* alloca.c: Removed a bug.

Sun Feb  6 21:46:12 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms_in: Clean up, especially the installation
	clauses.

Tue Jan 18 22:13:54 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* alloca.c: Use BLOCK_INPUT and UNBLOCK_INPUT when freeing
	the chunks.

	* b2m.c: Define NOT_C_CODE before including config.h.  Also,
	on VMS, include config.h instead of ../src/config.h.  The
	include path his corectly set to handle that.

	* env.c: Define NOT_C_CODE before including config.h.  Include
	errno.h.  Also, when on VMS, include unixlib.h and perror.h.

	* etags-vmslib.c: Define system () ONLY when OLD is defined,
	not the other way around.

	* etags.c: Define NOT_C_CODE before including config.h.  Also,
	for VMS, include config.h instead of ../src/config.h.  The
	include path his corectly set to handle that.  Also, defining
	main () to be of type void is wrong with ANSI C.
	When the format is ctags, output should go to `ctags' instead of
	`tags'.
	Put the returned value from gfnames () in a variable.

	* getopt.c, getopt1.h: Define NOT_C_CODE before including config.h.

	* make-docfile.c: On VMS, handle the fact that file names might
	be coma-separated.  Also, change the extension `.obj' to `.c'.

	* wakeup.c: Define NOT_C_CODE before including config.h.

	* yow.c: on VMS, include paths.h instead of ../src/paths.h

Fri Jul 30 13:19:55 1993  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elin.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms: New file for VMS. This is a Makefile for MMS.

	* make-docfile.c (scan_c_file): Small change for VMS to
	change ".obj" rather than ".o" to ".c".

	* vmssendmail.c, vmssendmail.info: New files. This program
	helps vms-sendmail-send-it (defined in vms-sndmai.el) to
	really send the message.
