/*
 * What?  You want to understand the VALID macro anyway?  Alright, since you
 * insist.  Actually, it isn't really all that difficult, provided that you
 * take it step by step.
 *
 * Line 1	Validates that the 2-4th characters are CTRL/A.
 * Line 2	Validates that the 5-6th characters are newline and ``F''.
 * Line 3	Validates that the 7-10th characters are ``rom ''.
 * Line 4	Sets x to point to the end of the line.
 * Lines 5-14	First checks to see if the line is at least 46 characters long.
 *		If so, it scans backwards up to 10 characters (the UUCP system
 *		name length limit due to old versions of UNIX) to find a space.
 *		If one is found, it backs up 12 characters from that point, and
 *		sees if the string from there is `` remote from''.  If so, it
 *		sets x to that position.  The ``|| T'' is there so the parse
 *		will still continue.
 * Line 15	Makes sure that there are at least 27 characters in the line.
 * Lines 16-19	Checks if the date/time ends with the year.  If so, It sees if
 *		there is a colon 3 characters further back; this would mean
 *		that there is no timezone field and zn is set to 0 and ti is
 *		left in front of the year.  If not, then it expects there to
 *		either to be a space four characters back for a three-letter
 *		timezone, or a space six characters back followed by a + or -
 *		for a numeric timezone.  If a timezone is found, both zn and
 *		ti are the offset of the space immediately before it.
 * Lines 20-22	Are the failure case for a date/time not ending with a year in
 *		line 14.  If there is a space four characters back, it is a
 *		three-letter timezone; there must be a space for the year nine
 *		characters back.  Otherwise, there must be a space six
 *		characters back and a + or - five characters back to indicate a
 *		numeric timezone and a space eleven characters back to indicate
 *		a year.  zn and ti are set appropriately.
 * Line 23	Make sure that the string before ti is of the form hh:mm or
 *		hh:mm:ss.  There must be a colon three characters back, and a
 *		space six or nine characters back (depending upon whether or
 *		not the character six characters back is a colon).  ti is set
 *		to be the offset of the space immediately before the time.
 * Line 24	Make sure the string before ti is of the form www mmm dd.
 *		There must be a space three characters back (in front of the
 *		day), one seven characters back (in front of the month), and
 *		one eleven characters back (in front of the day of week).
 *
 * Why a macro?  It gets invoked a *lot* in a tight loop.  On some of the
 * newer pipelined machines it is faster being open-coded than it would be if
 * subroutines are called.
 *
 * Why does it scan backwards from the end of the line, instead of doing the
 * much easier forward scan?  There is no deterministic way to parse the
 * ``user'' field, because it may contain unquoted spaces!  Yes, I tested it to
 * see if unquoted spaces were possible.  They are, and I've encountered enough
 * evil mail to be totally unwilling to trust that ``it will never happen''.
