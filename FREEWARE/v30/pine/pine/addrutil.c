    Criterion is that the mailbox must match the user name and

hostname, matches occur if the hostname on the message is blank, or if it
matches the local hostname, the full hostname with qualifying domain,
or the qualifying domain without a specific host.  Note, there is a very
small chance that we will err on the non-conservative side here.  That is,
we may decide two addresses are the same even though they are different
(because we do case-insensitive compares on the mailbox).  That might cause
a reply not to be sent to somebody because they look like they are us.
This should be very, very rare.
