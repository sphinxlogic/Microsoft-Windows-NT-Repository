SD


Set/Show Default Directory


SD ^      Go up one subdirectory level
SD ^^     Go to top level of current directory
SD .      Go to login default directory and disk
SD #n     Go to directory in n'th entry of the SD stack. (D=1)
SD >X     Set default to [z.X] when currently in [z.y]
SD .X     Set default to [current.X]
SD X.Y.Z  Set default to [X.Y.Z]
SD *      Show the SD stack
SD ?      Show this SD help information
SD        Show the current default

-----------------------------------------------------------------

SD ^
 
  Sets default to the next highest directory level.  If default is [X.Y.Z],
  execution of  SD ^  will set default to [X.Y].  If the current default is
  a top-level directory, nothing happens.


SD ^^

  Entering  SD ^^  sets default to the top level directory.  If currently
  in [X.Y.Z], you will then be in [X] .


SD .

  Sets default to the login default directory and disk.


SD #n

  SD maintains a stack of the last ten directories visited.  Entering
  SD <n  Sets default to the n'th previous entry in the SD stack.
  If n is omitted, 1 is assumed.


SD >X

  Sets default to the directory "X" at this subdirectory level.
  If the current directory is [A.B.C] then  SD >X  will set default
  to [A.B.X].  If the current default is a top-level directory,
  nothing happens.


SD .X

  Sets default to the subdirectory named X at the next lower level.
  If the current default is [A.B], then  SD .X  will result in default
  of [A.B.X]


SD X

  Sets default to directory [X] on the current device.  Note that square
  brackets are not required around the directory name; they are allowed,
  however.  Examples:

	$  SD MYDIR         $  SD NEWDIR.A.B

  You can also move to a different device, by executing:

	$  SD device:directory

  The colon is required; you may follow the colon with a blank.  If you
  just enter a device, you will go to your current default on the new
  device (e.g. from DRA0:[X.Y] to DRA1:[X.Y]).


SD *

  SD maintains a stack of the last ten directories visited.  Entering
  SD *  displays the SD stack, with the current directory at the top
  (the #0 entry).

  Entering  SD #n  sets the default to the corresponding entry.


SD @

  SD maintains a stack of the last ten directories visited.  If SET
  DEFAULT or another method is used to change the default, the stack
  will not be updated and the new default will not show up on the
  stack.  Specifying "@" tells SD to update the stack by pushing the
  current default directory.


Errors

  SD checks for the existence of the directory being entered,
  and prints an error if it is not found, or if the device is
  not mounted.


Multiple functions

  SD can do multiple functions in one call.  Blank(s) must separate the
  functions.

   A.  A  *  will cause the stack to be listed after all other
       processing is complete.

   B.  On GO operations, you can have it do another movement:

	$ SD . .Y    (go to subdirectory Y of login default directory)

	$  SD ^ ^     (go up two levels; note difference from SD ^^ )

	$  SD #3 >X   (go to stack entry 3, then over to X)

   C.  A  @  will cause the current default to be pushed on the stack.
       No matter where on the command line @ is entered, the initial
       default setting is the spec that is pushed.

	$ SET DEFAULT SYS$LOGIN:	! SD stack will not be updated!
	$ SD				! This entry will not be on the stack
	  CDS$USER:[WHG]
	$ SD >MTC @			! Go over to [MTC] and push [WHG]


Logical names

  SD translates logical names if given.  For example,  SD SYS$HELP
  will set the default to the translation for SYS$HELP.
