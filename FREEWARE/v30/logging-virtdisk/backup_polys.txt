Glenn, your mail headers are still wrong ...

I have to admit that I find making a virtual disk out of a backup/physical
tape rather weird, having not seen a single-tape backup for a long time ...

I know why I salvaged said manual ... let me quote (but please don't expect me
to type in all of its appendix):
 
BBH$L_CRC	contains the CRC computed on the entire data block using
		the AUTODIN II CRC algorithm. The CRC field is set to 0
		during the computation. If the flag bit BBH$V_NOCRC is set,
		this field contains 0.
 
BBH$L_FLAGS	contains the following flag bits for the block:
			BBH$V_NOCRC	set if no CRC was computed
					for this block
		[no more bits mentioned - wjm]
 
BBH$W_CHECKSUM	contains a checksum of the block header computed by the
		CRC-16 algorithm.
 
According to the accompanying figure, the offsets ought to be
36. for CRC, 44. for FLAGS, and 254. for CHECKSUM.

I may not know the exact file types - on the "fiche" one only finds
the SDL source, and lacking the SDL "compiler", UNSDL won't help.
There are no binary BACKUP definitions distributed with VMS.

Nice to hear that *someone* thinks about extending that beast.
Maybe I mentioned in the past that I did port the tape server once -
to our VM/CMS IBM DECnetted via INTERLINK (a rather unusual setup,
I guess) - and found it very slow due to the network protocol
(handshake) overhead. So far, I haven't learned anything about
un*x tape handling.
