CVTLIS converts .LIS files from the VMS Source Listings on CD back to the
appropriate source files.  The following file types are recognized:

	Language	Type		Output file type
	---------	----		----------------
	MACRO-32	(VAX)		.MAR
	AMACRO-32	(Alpha)		.MAR
	BLISS-32	(VAX)		.B32
	BLISS-32E	(Alpha)		.B32E
	BLISS-64	(Alpha)		.B64
	MACRO-64	(Alpha)		.M64
	VAX C		(VAX)		.C
	DEC C		(Alpha)		.C
	CDU		(VAX/Alpha)	.CLD
	MESSAGE		(VAX/Alpha)	.MSG
	PL/I		(VAX)		.PLI
	VAX Pascal	(VAX)		.PAS
	DEC Pascal	(VAX/Alpha)	.PAS
	SDL		(VAX/Alpha)	.SDL

CVTLIS is written in BLISS and will compile and run on both OpenVMS VAX and
OpenVMS Alpha.

CVTLIS is highly dependent on the .LIS format produced for the source
listings CDs.  Fortunately, most of the VMS programmers follow rigorous
source code formats, so this program will successfully convert most listing
files.

To build an executable, either execute @LINK.COM or go to the [.SOURCE]
subdirectory and rebuild it using MMK.

To use CVTLIS, define a foreign symbol to run the program and supply a .LIS
file name on the command line:

	$ cvtlis :== $dev:[dir]cvtlis.exe
	$ cvtlis [v61.dcl]recallsub.lis
