JUICER, DEFRAG, Disk defragmenter that uses Movefile and toolset

This defragger will defragment (albeit somewhat slowly) VMS volumes
and uses Movefile as its only method of moving files. It is rather
a resource hog, but will work.

You may want to play with changing the number of files it tries to
move per pass and rebuild.
