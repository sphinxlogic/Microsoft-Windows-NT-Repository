uudecode, utilities, modified to handle multiple segments in a single file.

To use on VMS, type as follows:

$ mcr <file-spec of location>uudecode [-vmh] [files...]

Options [-vmh] need not to be quoted, since VAXCRTL downcases them.
More general information can found in README. file in [.SRC] directory.

Enjoy.
