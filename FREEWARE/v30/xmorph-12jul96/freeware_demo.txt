XMORPH 12-JUL-1996 under OpenVMS
================================

You can run Xmorph (on real photos) via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure. If you
intend to create a warp sequence, you need to specify a location outside the
CDROM (for example, specify SYS$LOGIN: into the dialog box launched via the
"Set sequence file name" of the "Morph Sequence" menu. The "Warp Sequence"
choice of the same menu runs the morphing machine.

Sources are located into [.SRC] directory. AXPOBJS.ZIP and VAXOBJS.ZIP archives
contain object file for relinking if you don't have a C compiler.
