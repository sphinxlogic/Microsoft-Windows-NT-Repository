VAX/VMS port of SOX, release 5, patchlevel 7

As an important side note, the DECsound tool only recognizes DDIF and Sun .au
format sounds (Sun .au sounds *must* be uLaw, 8000Hz sampling rate to be
readable).

The portmeister makes no representations about the suitability of this
software for any purpose.  This software is provided "as is" without
