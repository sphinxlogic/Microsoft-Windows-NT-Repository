XBCLOCK, MOTIF TOYS, D. Binninger's Berlin clock for X displays


This is a program I've written looong time ago as one of my first
experiences with X/11, testing the core functions for color and
stipple. The result of this testing was an awfully written clock,
modelling the arithmetic clock on the Kurfuerstendamm near
Uhlandstrasse in Berlin (Germany - Europe - Northern Hemisphere - Earth -
Solar System ... you know). (I don't know, wether there was another
program of the same clock ever going around the net, if so, please
delete & forget my version ASAP.)

On color displays my first try worked fine, but the set stipple
function left me with an unknown error where X normally crashed
reaching the full hour. I never found out why. I never asked anybody.
Within 3 years.

But I took that program and erased nearly 200 lines.  It isn't less
ugly than before. In fact, now it works also on black and white displays
through the hour, but with the prize that it redisplays the whole clock
every minute. Sometimes you see the flicker, sometimes you don't.
Even worse: I've managed it to delete the error for black and white
displays and put in a X error for color displays. But hopefully this
is also history.
