     The gopher client is used to talk to gopher servers.  Once
     you have started the gopher client, help on using it is
     available by pressing the ?? key.

     The Internet Gopher is a distributed document delivery ser-
     vice.  It allows a neophyte user to access various types of
     data residing on multiple hosts in a seamless fashion.  This
     is accomplished by presenting the user a hierarchical
     arrangement of documents and by using a client-server com-
     munications model.  The Internet Gopher Server accepts sim-
     ple queries, and responds by sending the client a document.

     The [hostname] may be specified at startup; if omitted, the
     default server for your site is used.

     The  [Port_number] of the server host may be specified at
     startup; if omitted you will use the default port specified
     at your site.  The more or less standard and accepted Gopher
     port number on the Internet is 70.

     -b   starts the client on the bookmark page.

     The next few options are for more advanced users who want to
     start at a location other than the default, or to set up
     special aliases or shell-scripts to point the gopher client
     to seperate places.

     --pp _p_a_t_h
          specify a specific selector string to send to the
          gopher server on startup.

     --TT _t_y_p_e
          let the client know what type of object the -_p option
          is pointing at.

     --ii _s_e_a_r_c_h _t_e_r_m
          tell the client what to search for in the object
          defined by the -_p and -_T _7 options.

     --tt _t_i_t_l_e
          set the title of the initial screen for the gopher
          client.

     The last few options aren't really of interest to regular
     users, but are provided for system administrators who waht
     to provide a secure client, or who need to debug a client.


     --ss or --SS
          "secure mode" which means that you can't save or print
          the files that you browse.  -s is for users without an
          account, while -S assumes the user has an account on
          this machine.  One security feature is forced on,
          regardless of the state of these options, if the name
          of the user's shell ends in rsh; the 'O' (options) com-
          mand is disabled so the user cannot select a shell as
          an application.

     --rr   tells the client that its user is remote.

     --DD   turns on the copius debugging output
