Installation Instructions for Unix Gopher.
------------------------------------------

Almost all configuration is now in two files, Makefile.config and conf.h.

Some of the more important parameters in Makefile.config are

   PREFIX       The base pathname where everything is installed.
   CLIENTDIR    Where the client (gopher) is installed.
   CLIENTLIB    Where the client helpfile is installed
   SERVERDIR    Where the server (gopherd) and
                the server configuration file (gopher.conf) is installed
   MAN1DIR      Where the man pages for gopher are installed.
   MAN8DIR      Where the man pages for gopherd are installed.

Some of the more important paramerters in conf.h are:

   CLIENT1_HOST, CLIENT2_HOST  The host(s) to contact first.
   CLIENT1_PORT, CLIENT2_PORT  The port(s) to contact first.

Check the Libraries for your specific system, HP, Umax, SCO and others
will need to make some changes. Specifically for OTHERLIBS.  Ultrix
users note that you'll need to change -lcurses to -lcursesX for
CLIENTLIBS.

If you're making a gopher server and are interested in full-text
indexes, see the section on full-text searching in this file *now*.


If you want to make just the client type:

   make client

If you want to make just the server type:

   make server

If you want to make everything, just type:
 
   make

If you want to install everything, type:

   make install.

If you want to install just the client, type:

   (cd gopher; make install)

If you want to install just the server, type:

   (cd gopherd; make install)


Installing external programs for the gopher client
--------------------------------------------------

The gopher client depends on certain external programs for some
functionality.  Most of these will be present on any good unix system.
However you may need to install the following:

  For tn3270 connections you'll need tn3270 or a version of telnet
that understands tn3270 control streams.

  For downloading in the client you'll need two distributions, kermit
and zmodem.  The binaries are "kermit", "sz", "sb", and "sx".

  To view metamail documents you'll need mm.tar.Z available from
thumper.bellcore.com.

  To view graphics you'll X windows and xloadimage or xv or any other
generic graphics program.

  To listen to sounds you can use the "play" command on SunOS or the
play command in the misc directory for the NeXT


Full Text Indexing Setup for NeXTs (NeXTos 2.0, 2.1, 2.2)
---------------------------------------------------------

First get the libtext and btree libraries.  (Available as a separate
tar file called NeXTtext.tar.Z).  The files libbtree.a and libtext.a
are in this tar file, along with two directories "btree" and "text".
Copy the library (.a) files to /usr/local/lib and type 

   ranlib /usr/local/lib/libbtree.a
   ranlib /usr/local/lib/libtext.a

Then copy the directories btree and text into /usr/include


Full Text Indexing Setup for WAIS
---------------------------------

First get the wais distribution.  If you don't have wais, ftp to
"gopher.boombox.micro.umn.edu" and get
/pub/gopher/Unix/freeWAIS-0.3.tar.gz Untar this and edit the makefiles
appropriate for your system.

After you untar the distribution, go into the top level WAIS directory
and make the distribution.  Refer to the instructions in the WAIS
distribution.

"make lib"
"make ir"
"make bin"

Or just type make if you want the whole WAIS thing.

Now go to the top level of the gopher distribution and do the following:

% cd {GopherSrc}
% ln -s {WaisTop}/ir .
% ln -s {WaisTop}/ui .
% ln -s {WaisTop}/bin .

If you've compiled an older version of gopherd, make sure to type
"make clean" first.
