			Introduction
			------------

OpenVMS Engineering is sponsoring an OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM which will
contain "public domain" and "freeware" software which runs on OpenVMS VAX and
OpenVMS Alpha.  The purpose of the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM is to
provide OpenVMS customers with easy access to public domain software and
"free" internal Digital software and tools.

The guidelines for the software to be contained on the OpenVMS Freeware CD 
are the following:

0 The software must be unencumbered to the public.  No license fees shall
  be requested of or required by the customer for its use.
0 The software must run on OpenVMS VAX and/or OpenVMS Alpha.
0 Digital does not warranty this software in any way.  It is provided as
  "as is" software.
0 Digital will not provide service for this software, fix the software, or
  warranty that it works correctly.  
0 Customers are free to adapt and change the sources for their needs.


               Freeware CD-ROM Software and Organization
	       -----------------------------------------

In order to facilitate the job of packaging the software on the freeware CD,
here is the simple process that must be followed:

Build the software into a saveset.  Each product must be in a DIFFERENT
directory.  If the sources are included, place them in a subdirectory called
.SRC.  You need to supply the following files with each directory:

     - FREEWARE_README.TXT  
       This file must have the following format for the FIRST line:

          PACKAGE_NAME, CATEGORY, ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION

        for example:

          INTOUCH 4GL, LANGUAGES, High-performance 4GL for VAX and Alpha systems

       The one-line descriptions will be truncated to 60 characters.  This
       will allow them to display nicely on the selection menus later on.

       Any additional lines of text in the FREEWARE_README.TXT file will 
       be displayed to the user from the MENU SYSTEM, if they choose this 
       package from the menu.  

       The list of catagories to choose from are:
	GAMES		  GRAPHICS	LANGUAGES
	MISCELLANEOUS	  MOTIF TOYS	SOFTWARE
	SYSTEM MANAGEMENT TOOLS		UTILITIES

     - FREEWARE_DEMO.TXT file (optional)

       The FREEWARE_DEMO.TXT file is text that can explain how to try this
       software...or explains what the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM file will be
       showing the user.

     - FREEWARE_DEMO.COM (optional)
       If the user selects this package from the menu system, 
       the FREEWARE_DEMO.COM file will be executed.

Each directory should contain the VAX and Alpha executables (if possible), 
help text, documentation, sources (in [.SRC]) and then anything else you want
to put there.

If the software is already kitted as a VMSINSTAL or PCSI kit, that is fine.
Just put the kits in the directory along with the instructions.  PLEASE make
sure that the .txt and .com files are easy to read and understand.  The
more friendly your instructions and directions, the more likely that 
others will want to try it.

   NOTE: In order for the software to be considered for inclusion on the 
         CD, the release form MUST be submitted with the software.  
         Electronic copies of the signed release form are acceptable.

Once the software is packaged, you can submit it on a tape (tk50, TK70 or
TLZ04 preferred) to:

	Glenn C. Everhart
	Digital Equipment Corporation
	MS: ZK3-4/T35
	110 Spitbrook Road
	Nashua, NH  03062

If you have internet access, you can send an FTP pointer to the location of
the kit to:

	EVERHART@STAR.ZKO.DEC.COM
		   or
	EVERHART@STAR.ENET.DEC.COM

and we will copy the kit electronically.


The OpenVMS Development group is looking forward to your submissions...
