Yes,  it is pretty simple.

If you look at the command procedure freeware_menu.com, you will see with
INTOUCH is invoked.  

You need to use this command, but specify BUILD_MENU (i think) as the .int
file.  it does the rest.

I can show you in about 3 minutes if you want.  Just let me know...

Steve -
Do you recall how you set up the menu system data? I found a 
<somethin>.INT file in [freeware] but it needs to be run from
something else that is nowhere (far as I've seen) identified.
