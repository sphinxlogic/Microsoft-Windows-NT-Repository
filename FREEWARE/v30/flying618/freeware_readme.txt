FLYING618, GAMES, Pool/snooker/carrom/hockey/curling simulator

    Flying was actually meant to be a test program to implement some classes
    to control flying objects on the screen. After the classes were
    implemented there was the need of some real tests and a game of billard
    was just the first idea. By now, many subgame-classes are already more
    or less completely defined. They can either be selected by the options
    or by making a link to the original with a special name. Unfortunately
    having so many subclasses means that the classes themselves can't be too
    complicated. (There's just too less time in the world :( ) Therefore the
    games don't have any rules yet. This means you have to play fair and
    watch your opponent.

    Anyway, the main thing was animation and controlling and that works
    fine, especially with the -deluxe version of pool-billard. Since the
    main intention was to get an excellent billard game, I will mainly
    describe the pool-version in the following pages. The other subgames are
    similar to control (and there are no special rules anyway).
