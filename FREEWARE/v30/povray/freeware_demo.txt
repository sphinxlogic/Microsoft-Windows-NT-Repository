The demo will simply raytrace an test scene.  The scene is
The words OPENVMS POVRAY in gold on a marble background,
with a mirrored sphere reflecting the words below.

It will do this with the preview option selected, so this
should only be run on a system with graphics.  To see the
file without running POVRAY, you can use XTGA, which will
display the image using the same previewer logic, or by
using TGA2GIF which will convert the image to GIF and then
XGIF which will display the image.
