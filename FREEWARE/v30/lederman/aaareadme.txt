MONITOR_TO_CSV, SYSTEM MANAGEMENT, Utility which converts MONITOR /RECORD
                                   binary output to Comma Separated Value
                                   ASCII Text.

The MONITOR_TO_CSV program converts the binary data file
produced by the MONITOR /RECORD command into an ASCII text Comma
Separated Value (CSV) file which can be read by Excel and other
programs. It currently converts only some of the record types
which can be produced by MONITOR.  It is useful for System
Management and Performance Analysis and Tuning.
