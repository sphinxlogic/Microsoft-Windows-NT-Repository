Process INSTALL/LIST/FULL, SYSTEM MANAGEMENT, System Management

This directory contains programs and procedures for processing
the output of INSTALL /LIST /FULL into a report on how installed
images are installed and used. 

INSTALL_PROCESS.DOC is a reasonably complete description of how
the process works, why I did it, and what you can learn about
your system from this procedure. 

You may also want to check the DATATRIEVE directory for related
procedures and data structures.
