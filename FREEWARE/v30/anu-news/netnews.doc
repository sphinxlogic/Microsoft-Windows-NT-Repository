1. Introduction


Network News (netnews) is a computer-based bulletin board.  As such, it has
many similarities to a normal electronic mail delivery system (e-mail), as
well as some major differences.  Normally e-mail is typically a
person-to-person communication.  In such a system a third person cannot view
the mail contents, and the mail is essentially a transaction between the
sender and recipient.  This e-mail model can be extended with the use of
mailing lists.  In this situation each user posts a mail item to a list of
others, each of whom receives a copy of the mail.  In this model the mail
transaction is extended to include a group of users, but privacy is still
intact to the extent that users who are not on the mailing distribution list
cannot participate in the mail conversation.  Bulletin Boards take the mailing
list model one step further by allowing all users to have the ability to view
all postings, and all postings made by users are public to all other users of
the bulletin board (this is a simplification of many bulletin boards, which
commonly provide functionality which encompasses all these models of
communication, and more).  Usually bulletin boards reside on one computer and
users log into that particular computer or bulletin board to read or leave
messages.  The netnews 'board' floats around the world travelling from one
computer on the network to another.  Since new messages can be entered at any
computer, the 'board' will usually look slightly different at every site.

The netnews community is quite large; there are thousands of sites and
hundreds of thousands readers.  Netnews is divided into hierarchical
discussion groups, or newsgroups.  As you move down the hierarchy generality
decreases.  As an example, the newsgroup for the appreciation and discussion
of classical music is:

      rec.music.classical

That is, the top level group is recreation (rec), the next is music and the
last is classical.  There are over a thousand newsgroups but only about 850
(as of Jan 1991) are distributed in Australia.  Of course, there are many
Australia only newsgroups.  The topics covered include nearly all interests;
both serious to whimsical, very technical to very non-technical.  You may also
participate in discussions by sending articles to newsgroups or by sending
mail directly to someone who sent an article.

The most well known utilities for reading and posting news are those used on
UNIX operating systems.  There also are various utilities for reading and
posting news on VMS/VMS systems.  The one we use at this site is called NEWS,
better known as ANU-NEWS as it was written and maintained solely be Geoff
Huston from the Australian National University (now seconded to AARNet). 
ANU-NEWS provides support for DEC VT100 and VT200 series terminals and their
respective keypads but also can be used without terminal screens (ie,
lineprinters (ugh! :-))).

2. Reading news


To invoke an interactive session of NEWS, use the command:

      $ NEWS

When beginning a session, NEWS will be in either of two modes.  If your
terminal supports SMG$ routines then NEWS will start automatically in screen
mode, otherwise NEWS starts in line mode.  You can also use the command

      $ NEWS/NOSCREEN

to begin a session in line mode.  When you invoke NEWS it will normally
restore the screen to the state of the previous exit from NEWS.

At the highest level, users can obtain a directory of the available newsgroups
using the command

      NEWS> directory/all

which displays all the available newsgroups, or

      NEWS> directory/register

which displays all the newsgroups which you have registered an interest in. 
The display will show the newsgroup name, index number and number of items
within each newsgroup.  You can browse through the list of newsgroups by, in
screen mode, using the arrow keys or previous and next screen keys, or in line
mode, hitting the <return> key to see the next screenful of newsgroups, or
using the commands

      NEWS> top           or           NEWS> bottom

Once you have found the newsgroup you wish to read, move the screen pointer
down or up to the newsgroup and hit the <return> key, or use the command

      NEWS> select <news.group.name>

where upon you will enter the items in the newsgroup can be displayed -
automatically in screen mode or, in line mode, by using the command

      NEWS> directory/item

The display will have information about the news item title, index number,
sender, size (lines) and date.  Once again you can browse through the items in
a similar fashion to looking at the newsgroups and choose the item you wish to
read by, again, moving the screen pointer down or up to the item number and
hit the <return> key, or by using the command

      NEWS> read <n>

where <n> is the item number.

The news item text will scroll through on the screen and hit the return key to
continue reading.  There is also a option to use the editor in read-only mode
to display the text.  This will allow you to scroll up and down, search for
strings, and other editor search and display operations on the text.  At any
stage the text display can be aborted, and you may reset the screen to either
display the list of news items or newsgroups.  There are also commands to go
forward, back and skip news items as you are reading them.

Since the number of newsgroups can be quite large, there is a facility to
subscribe to a small number of newsgroups.  You can do this by using the
command

      NEWS> register <news.group.name>

or moving the pointer to the newsgroup and just type register.  Then you can
use

      NEWS> dir/reg       or           NEWS> newsgroups

commands to list the subscribed newsgroups.  Once you have chosen your
newsgroups then you can quickly check for new or unread items by the command

      $ NEWS/SCAN         or           $ NEWS/UNSEEN

the difference being: /SCAN will only print a one line message indicating the
number of new items and /UNSEEN will immediately enter a NEWS session if there
are any unread items.  Items themselves can be tagged to facilitate retrieval
at a later date by using the command

      NEWS> mark

which marks the current news item.


3. Posting news


There are two commands which allow the user to create a NEWS posting:

      NEWS> post          or           NEWS> followup

where post implies that the item refers to a new subject which has not been
discussed before and followup implies that the user is posting a follow-up
item to the current item.  Post invokes a text editor to create a news item
and you will be prompted for the newsgroup or newsgroup list to which the item
will be posted, and you will be prompted for the title of the posting.

NEWS also supports two commands which interface to VMS MAIL.  This allows the
user to forward NEWS items to other users via MAIL and also send direct
person-to-person mail to the original poster of the news item.  The commands

      NEWS> forward       or           NEWS> mail

are synonymous; the current news item is extracted and posted to the addresses
you supply.  The default is: the item text is loaded into an edit buffer for
editing before sending the mail - this may be omitted by using the /noedit
qualifier with the command.

The command

      NEWS> reply

extracts the From: address (or Reply-To: address, if specified) from the
current news item and invokes the editor to create a reply which will be
directed to the sender of the news item.  This command differs from the
followup command in that your response to an original posting is a private
response whereas followup posts a public response through the NEWS network.

Some newsgroups are moderated.  Moderated groups are ones that have one or
more individuals acting as editors or moderators who approve messages before
they are published on the net.  Moderators ensure that all messages conform to
the rules of the newsgroup.  This might mean that discussion messages are
removed from newsgroups that forbid them, and that software is checked before
publication on software newsgroups.  Postings cannot be sent to moderated
newsgroups directly, rather the messages are posted to the moderator for them
to post to the newsgroup.  ANU-NEWS posts items destined for moderated groups
to a central computer (munnari.oz.au) that automatically determines the
appropriate network address of the moderator.

4. Default Keypad Definitions



NEWS commands are, by default, configured into the VT keypad as follows:

      Key                 Command            Gold Command
      PF1                 GOLD key
      PF2                 help
      PF3                 skip
      PF4                 skip/newsgroup     skip/followup
      kp0                 read/new           read/new/header
      kp1                 read               read/header
      kp2                 down               bottom
      kp3                 read/next          read/next/header
      kp4                 dir
      kp5                 up                 top
      kp6                 directory/registered
      kp7                 GOLD key           print
      kp8                 help               extract
      kp9                 skip               extract/all
      minus (-)           skip/newsgroup     extract/append
      comma (,)           directory/all
      period (.)          read/new/followup  read/new/followup/header

The LK201 edit block is also defined in NEWS, with the keys as follows:

      Key                 Command            Gold Command
      Find                search
      Insert              register
      Remove              deregister
      Select              select             close
      Previous Screen     previous screen    top
      Next Screen         next screen        bottom


5. Customising NEWS


It is possible to customise NEWS in a number of ways.  This includes changing
the definitions of keys on the terminal, and changing the editor invoked by
NEWS to the one of your choice.  Customization can be done using three
mechanisms: setting your keypad; using set profile command; and defining
logical names.  As there is some overlap in what these methods can define, the
order of precedence is firstly any setting performed interactively overrides
profile settings, which in turn override logical name settings.


Key Mappings

The default set of key mappings is given in the previous section.  These
defaults may be altered in two ways: using the

      NEWS> define/key <key> <command>

command to bind a NEWS command to a key, or defining the logical name NEWS_INI
to a file containing a sequence of define/key lines (which will be executed on
startup of NEWS).  NOTE: there are six keys which should not be DEFINED from
the standard NEWS values: the four arrow keys and the PREV and NEXT SCREEN
keys (this restriction is due to VMS).


Logical Names

There are a number of logical names which users may define to alter the
behaviour of NEW.  All these logical names are intended to be defined on
pre-process basis as process logical names.  This would normally be configured
within the LOGIN.COM file:

      NEWS_INI  This can be defined as a file name which contains a set
      of define/key commands to change the default binding of news, eg:

             $ DEFINE NEWS_INI SYS$LOGIN:NEWSKPD.DEFS

      NEWS_EDIT  This logical name can be used to link an editor to
      NEWS.  The editor is used to generate new postings, and to edit
      forwarded mail, and (optionally) in readonly mode, to scan the
      item contents (ie, read/editor).  By default NEWS links the TPU
      editor, using the value of the logical name TPU$SECTION as the
      section file to use.  The logical name is used to either:
           - use the TPU editor with a section other than the
             default:

                 $ DEFINE NEWS_EDIT "TPU/SECTION=mysection"

           - use EDT as the configured editor:

                 $ DEFINE NEWS_EDIT CALLABLE_EDT

           - call any other editor using a command procedure
             in a subprocess:

                 $ DEFINE NEWS_EDIT "@dev:[dir]my_editor.com"

             whereupon NEWS will SPAWN the command:

                 $ @dev:[dir]my_editor.com filename

      see below for an example of my_editor.com command procedure.

      NEWS_VIEW  This logical name is only required if you are using a
      local editor command procedure such as NEWS_EDIT.  In this case a
      second procedure is required which invokes the same editor in
      read_only mode:

                   $ DEFINE NEWS_VIEW "@dev:[dir]my_reader.com filename"
      
               whereupon NEWS will SPAWN the command:
      
                   $ @dev:[dir]my_reader.com filename
      
      When TPU or EDT is configured as the editor, then NEWS will
      automatically add the /READONLY to create a readonly version of
      the editor.

      NEWS_SCANSIZE  NEWS will normally display the text of a news item
      on a page-by- page basis.  When scanning through items it is often
      useful to only display the first few lines of an item, to decide
      whether to view the complete text.  If the NEWS_SCANSIZE is
      defined as a number (n), then the first n lines of each new item
      will be displayed, and you will be prompted if you wish to see
      more of this item.  Commonly, a value of between 8 and 12 is most
      useful.

      MAIL_SIGNATURE  This logical name may be defined as the name of
      your mail signature file.  If this logical name is defined, then
      the contents of this file will be automatically appended to all
      postings and mailings made from within NEWS.

      NEWS_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY  NEWS will normally remember the last
      newsgroup directory setting across invocations of the program (ie,
      if you had executed dir/new before exiting NEWS, then when you
      next run NEWS, the initial newsgroup directory state will be
      restored to dir/new).  It is possible to specify a constant
      initial directory state be defining this logical as one of the
      strings:

        ALL        NEW        REGISTER   SINCE      SINCE=vms_date

      NEWS_POST_CC  This logical name directs NEWS to generate MAIL
      carbon-copies of NEWS postings.  The logical name value is
      interpreted by NEWS as the name of a CC control file.  This file
      consists of lines of the form:

             newsgroup    address

      The newsgroup name starts in column 1, and may be the name of a
      single newsgroup, or may specify a set of newsgroups be including
      the wildcard match character ("*").  The address is the address to
      receive a carbon copy of the posting.  It is separated from the
      newsgroup name be at least one space character.  The address may
      be a DECnet or internet- format address.  The interpretation of
      the file is such that any postings you make into any of the
      specified newsgroups will also generate mail to the matching
      address.

      NEWS_PERSONAL_NAME  Sets the personal name string.  This name is
      appended to your network address in all NEWS postings.  If this
      logical name is not defined, your VMS MAIL profile is examined to
      copy your MAIL personal name as your NEWS personal name.


NEWS_EDIT Command Procedures

An example command procedure to invoke an editor from NEWS is as follows:

      editor_example.com

      $!
      $!     Example command procedure to invoke an editor for NEWS
      $!
      $!     inputs:
      $!           P! = file name
      $!
      $!     Note that this procedure is run in the context of a subprocess.
      $!     LOGIN.COM is not executed.  However, all process logical names
      $!     and DCL global symbols are copied.
      $!
      $!     The default directory is the same as the parent process
      $!
      $!     Note that this will only be invoked if the user has placed in
      $!     LOGIN.COM (or similar):
      $!           $ DEFINE NEWS_EDIT "@dev:[dir]newsedit_example.com"
      $!
      $ DEFINE/USER SYS$INPUT 'F$TRNLNM("SYS$OUTPUT")'
      $ IF P1.EQS."" THEN EXIT
      $ EDIT/EDT 'P1'
      $ EXIT

In connection with the definition of a personal profile the following message
from Reg Quinton, <reggers@uwovax.BITNET> is relevant:

     "Many news users of ANU-NEWS (especially those new to VAX/VMS)
      have great difficulty posting their first article.  The problem is
      that NEWS assumes you know a bit about VAX/VMS already -- in
      particular that you know about the default editor.  This is often
      a faulty assumption and naive users are rightly distressed when
      they find themselves put into a strange environment.  Composing
      text can, and should be simpler than that!

      We have therefore defined a procedure for entered text which is
      easier to use but without all the power of a VAX/VMS editor).  We
      would encourage all beginning users to set their profile as
      follows:

             NEWS> set profile/editor=@news_manager:noedit

      There are several other profile settings discussed in both the
      help and manual.  If you have set your profile as above then the
      post command will use this procedure for composing you message --
      the procedure will say:

             Enter text, end with ^Z (Control-Z)
             -----

      You may then enter you message a line at a time with the usual
      line editing features of VMS.  You end your text with a Control-Z
      character which is constructed by typing a 'Z' while holding down
      the 'Control' key.

      Once you have learned an editor on the VAX/VMS environment you can
      set your profile accordingly, for example:

             NEWS> set profile/editor=emacs "

The following command procedure was submitted:

      news_manager:noedit.com

      $!     The most primitive editor for news -- read from your console
      $!
      $!     Reg Quinton <reggers@uwovax.BITNET>;  1-Aug-89
      $!
      $ if p1.eqs.""
      $ then
      $      write sys$output "Oops ... missing parameter"
      $      exit
      $ else
      $      write sys$output "Enter text, end with ^Z (Control-Z)"
      $      write sys$output "-----"
      $      copy sys$command 'p1'
      $ endif


6. Writing styles and conventions for messages and articles


There are certain styles and conventions used in netnews communications of
which you should be aware. Some of the more common styles are covered here but
for a fuller treatment, see 'A primer on How to Work With the Usenet
Community' and 'Hints on Writing Style for Usenet', both in the
news.announce.newusers newsgroup.

Most netusers have a signature that they place at the end of their posted news
message.  The signature is meant to convey who you are, what your affiliation
is, and what you network address is.  Some users have created very elaborate
signatures, but in general long signatures are considered to be in bad taste. 
The following sample signatures break the rules, but they are pretty:


  o,  ,,   ,      | Bernie Bernstein                     | ,    ,,
  L>o/  \,/ \    ,| University of Colorado at boulder    |/ \,,/  \
 o./  ,  / . `, / | office: (3030) 492-1218              |     /   \
,/   /  ,      '  | email: benard@boulder.colorado.edu   | /


' ) ) )      /          /)    ' )  )    ' )   /    _/_
 / / / o _. /_  __. _  //      /--'      / / / __. /  _   ____
/ ' (_(_(__/ /_(_(_(<_(/_     /  \ o    (_(_/ (_(_(__/_)_(_) /)

              Arpa:    mwatson@nswc-oas.arpa
              Usenet:  uunet!nsw-oas.arpa!mwatson

A signature should not be more than four lines long.  Apart from your name and
institution, the signature should contain your international network address. 
If you are posting an article to a newsgroup, and you are expressing an
opinion on a project or service, you are expected to disclose you association
and pecuniary interests.  This is commonly done as a disclaimer at the foot of
the message.

Humour plays a strong role in electronic communications, and it is used to
make the printed message more human.  This is often achieved by the use of the
smiley face ':-)'.  If it doesn't look like a smiley face to you, tilt your
head over to the left and look again.  It means that something is being said
in jest, as in:

      "... and both are 'documented' (read 'buried' :-))
       within the manual."

There are some other types of smiley in common use.  This is a sad smiley face
':-('.  It is used to express personal dismay as in:

      "... however 'Snowflakes' (white chocolate 'Flakes')
       are only available in NZ :-("

The winking smiley ';-)' is also used to mean that something has been said in
jest.

The embarrassed smiley ':-}' is used when you have made a faux pas.

Of course if someone has just told you off and your nose has really been put
out of joint, you use ':^('.

Another way of introducing persona into an electronic message is to use stress
marks.  The most common stress mark is '*', and it is put around the word you
want stressed.

      "... but MPW is *the* power development system."

Abbreviations are also used in electronic communications.  The most common are
BTW (by the way) and FYI (for your information).  Others which you may come
across include: IMHO (in my humble opinion), WRT (with respect to), and RTFM
(read the f***ing manual - an admonishment to an enquiry or complaint that
could have been answered by looking in the right place first).

When answering someone's query, or clarifying a point made by another, it is
conventional to quote from the message so that other readers do not have to
refer to the original.  This is called quoting.  The quote should be kept as
short as possible, prefixed with the '>' citation character or indented to
show that it is a quote, and original author and article should be referenced. 
ANU-NEWS automatically does this for you when you use the followup or reply
command to a news item.


7. Netiquette


Netiquette, as you may have surmised, is the etiquette of using the net. 
There are approximately 80,000 host computers on the net world-wide.  A
message posted to a newsgroup will travel to most and sometimes all of those
sites.  It is important that the messages are relevant and of general
interest, and that duplication is avoided.  For these reasons we have
netiquette.

Some of the rules and customs of netiquette have already been covered above
under Writing Styles and Conventions for Messages and Articles.  Here are some
others that are of general importance.

  a)  If you respond to a news item, consider responding direct to the author
      with mail.  Don't clutter up the network with information that is not
      widely required, or that my be duplicated by other responders.

  b)  If you post a news item asking for information, encourage responders to
      respond by mail and offer to summarise the responses in a follow-up news
      item.  That is, have:

             "Please respond to me directly, and I will summarise."

      within the body of your news item.

  c)  If you are summarising, summarise!  Don't just concatenate all your
      responses.  Remove duplicated information, edit what you get so it is
      succinct, and include thanks and credit to everyone that responded.  It
      is also useful to include parts of the original request for those
      readers who didn't see it.  When posting a summary, some netfolk make
      the subject the original descriptive title preceded by the word

             "Summary:"

  d)  Give some thought to the descriptive title you put on the subject line
      of your posting.  General terms such as 'Fortran problem' are not as
      helpful as 'Fortran index file read problem' but keep the descriptive
      title short as it will be truncated at 40 characters.

  e)  Select the most appropriate newsgroup for your news item.  Don't post to
      more than one group unless it is absolutely necessary.

  f)  Don't post controversial statements that are likely to start a flaming
      session.  eg,

             "It's obvious that automobiles are dangerous and
              should be banned."

Spelling mistakes also annoy some people, so check your message before posting
it.


8. Tips on how not to spend all day reading news


The problem with reading news is that there is so much of it - megabytes
daily.  The trick to reading news quickly is to not read it all.  Hence the
first step is to only subscribe to those newsgroups that are of vital
importance to you.  When you need to, you can still look at other groups by
using the news command:

      NEWS> directory/all

The second tip refers to how often you read news.  About once a week is
usually adequate.  It means that your reading time is confined to one slot per
week and it puts an upper limit on how long you can spend reading.  Decide how
much time you are willing to spend reading news, and do it all in one session.

Third tip: be selective about what you read.  Every news item has a subject
line that indicates (to a lesser or greater degree) what the item is about. 
Obviously, you don't read the items that you are not interested in, but
skipping from one item to the next can seem slow especially when generally you
could expect to read between two and five percent of the items.  That's right!
2-5%

Fourth tip: read moderated newsgroups in preference to unmoderated newsgroups,
if one is available.  As one moderator from comp.sys.mac.digest put it,

      "one of the goals of a moderated [newsgroup] is to reduce the
       signal-to-noise ratio in the postings we send out"

And take my word for it, there is a lot of junk on some of the unmoderated
newsgroups.  Moderated newsgroups take a number of forms.  One, the digest, is
a compendium of news items put out as a periodical.  For example, Comp.risk is
a digest which is put out three times a week, and consists of news items about
risks to the public from computers and users that have been mailed to the
moderators.  A digest appears as a single item and the article can be quite
long, typically 3-400 lines.

Tip five: share the work of accessing the net with colleagues.  If the digest
meets the needs of a group of people, then having one person print the digest,
and then circulating it, is much more time efficient than all members of the
group accessing the same digest online.  In any case, it's quicker to scan a
printed document that it is to scan a digest on the screen.

The sixth tip relates to extracting news items on a specific topic.  Sometimes
you will only be interested in the follow-up articles to a specific news item,
eg, someone asks a question to which you would also like to know the answer,
so you want to pick out all the follow-up articles that relate to that
question.  You can use the

      NEWS> search <target>

command with various qualifiers to contain the search list.

The seventh and last tip is from a long time user of the net.  His strategy is
to only read articles with subjects lines beginning with 'Re:'.  This is based
on the premise that if no-one has responded to the item then its probably not
that interesting, and the follow-up articles are always in context since they
quote from the original.  It is a good idea in theory.


9. Concluding remarks


Participating in the netnews can be a lot of fun, as well as being useful in
the pursuit of knowledge and in obtaining current information.  As an
introduction to news, try following a newsgroup for a while before attempting
to post a message.  You may feel silly sending an erroneous message to a
colleague, but that will be nothing compared with doing the same thing in
front of your peers all over the world.

One important aspect of news that has not been covered in this document is the
access to public domain software.  The net is an extremely rich source for
UNIX, VAX/VMS, MS-DOS, Macintosh, and other computer systems software.
