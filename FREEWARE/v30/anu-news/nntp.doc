NNTP NOTES

2 - Temporary files

    NNTP will use the file template SYS$SCRATCH:NNTP_hex_hex.TMP for all
    temporary files. (If SYS$SCRATCH is not defined then the filename
    without any device specification will be used instead).

3 - Output files

    All NEWS transfers to the local node over NNTP will NOT be added to the
    NEWS database by NNTP. Instead NNTP will append all such transferred
    items to the file NEWS_MANAGER:NNTP.BATCH.

    The local NEWS addition command procedures should check for the existance
    of this file and scan it into NEWS if found.


    the NNTP_proto.EXE files require to be installed WITH sysprv.
