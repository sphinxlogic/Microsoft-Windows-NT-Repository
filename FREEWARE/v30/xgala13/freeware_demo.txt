XGALAGA under OpenVMS                     May 1995
=====================

Here is the OpenVMS port of Xgalaga, a Shareware game.

You can run XGALA13 via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure

Sources are available under [.SRC] directory in XGALA13.ZIP file.


You need to define XGALA_DIR logical to point in a directory where the global
score file will be located. You can copy the example score file in this
directory and give it the right protections. 

For example:

$ CRE/DIR disk:[GAMES.XGALA]
$ SET PROT=(g:RW,w:RW) disk:[GAMES]XGALA.DIR 
$ DEFINE/SYS XGALA_DIR disk:[GAMES.XGALA]
$ SET DEF disk:[XGALA]       ! the xgala source directory
$ COPY XGAL.SCORES XGALA_DIR:* /lo/prot=(g=RW,w:RW)

Two score files are maintained, a global score file, shared between users,
and a personal score file created under your SYS$LOGIN directory.

Enjoy,
