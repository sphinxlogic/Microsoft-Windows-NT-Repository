 Hi Wizards,
     Can anyone recommend me vendors that produces FTP utilities that can 
 accept proxy setup on a Solaris and Netware ??
     Many thanks.

Sorry, but this is NOT a UNIX vs. VMS issue.  It's an IP vs. DECnet issue. 
IP on VMS has the same problems, and DECnet on UNIX has the same advantages:
 
Anyone can open a socket in IP and exchange data with no authentication 
mechanism.  Many standard IP utilties such as TELNET and FTP are smart enough 
not to exchange data without first finding out who's at the other end.  Some 
implementations of FTP provide proxy-like secure techniques for making this 
transperant, others are foolish enough to think that no world read access on 
a file is protection enough.
 
No one can open a DECnet logical link without going through authentication. 
This can be made transparant via proxies or default accounts, but DECnet 
doens't open the link until it has some idea why the user at the other end 
should be allowed access to the system.
 
Security holes in standard IP utilities have been ported to VMS by careless 
vendors.
