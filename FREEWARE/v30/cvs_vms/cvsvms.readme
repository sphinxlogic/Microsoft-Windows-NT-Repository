The copies of CVS (cvsvms-951010.tar-gz and cvs-960301.tar-gz)
in this directory can be considered obsolete; we recommend CVS 1.8.85
on VMS (see ../cvs-1.8.85/).

In this directory you will find a pre-compiled binary for GNU patch,
which you will need to use CVS.  In case it is helpful, we've also 
include binaries for diff, gzip, and grep, along with a version of tar
written for VMS.  All files are for OpenVMS/AXP 6.X.

Please send comments, bugfixes and reports to <bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu>.
