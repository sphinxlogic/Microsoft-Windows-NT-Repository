XBLOCKBUSTER103, GAMES, Break out type game under X

    XBlockbuster is a variation of the break-out type games, only a bit more
    complex in the type of bricks it has and effects the bricks have.  It is
    X11 based.
 
    The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by
    busting through blocks of various types with a ball that reflects from
    the blocks and from a pallet controlled by mouse movement.

    The ball must be seen as a high-energy particle that penetrates the block
    before being repelled.
    If it gets repelled into another block it will find its own way out again.
    This process, which often leads to surprises, is known as tunnelling.

    (By design, tunnelling only occurs along a horizontal connection between
    blocks or along the vertical sides, so never vertically between blocks.)

    As the game progresses, balls are launched faster and faster.
    When the speed has reached it maximum, the pallet is gradually,
    though cumulatively, shrunk.
    Be aware that the maximum launch speed (see below),
    and hence the point from which the pallet is shrunk,
    is only 2/3 of the speed limit, and the effect is much larger than that of
    hitting a speeder (but of course you may hit them often).

    The pallet is convex.
    Hence reflection is a function of both the incoming angle and the
    excentricity of the point of impact.
    If the pallet is sufficiently convex (differs from stage to stage), the
    ball may even rebound.

    The mouse buttons control the pallet:
    LEFT moves it up one row, MIDDLE moves it all the way down again.
    Each ball is launched with the RIGHT mouse button.

    A stage can be halted by closing the window.
    Be advised however, that the game will resume immediately upon opening the
    window.
    If no-pause has not
    been selected (see below), moving the pointer out
    of the XBlockBuster window will also stop the action.

    During a game, the score, number of balls left and speeds are shown.
    The speeds are represented by up to 3 thin lines (one for each ball),
    above a thick line representing the speed limit.
    The short vertical bar indicates the launch speed
    (black upon reaching the maximum launch speed, white below that).
    If, during a stage, you have busted a 'double' or 'triple' brick, your
    bonus multiplier will also be displayed at the top.

    A game can be saved in between stages with the Escape key.
    At this point, as well as at the end of the game, your score is logged.
    The score board shows scores, number of balls left between parentheses if
    any and user name.
    Finally, an indication of your current pallet shrinkage is given.

    At any time, 'q' or 'Q' may be pressed to quit the present game.  This
    quits
    the game immediately, so may be useful if your boss is closing in.  Also
    useful if you mess up on the first stage, and thus, continuing play of that
    game is no longer worth it.

    'P' or 'p' may be pressed during the game to toggle the no-pause option.
    When no-pause is active, the game will continue even when the mouse pointer
    is outside the window.  With it turned off, action stops once the mouse
    pointer is outside the window.
