SPIDER11, GAMES, Play double deck solitaire under X WINDOW

    Spider
    is a particularly challenging double-deck solitaire.  Unlike most
    solitaires, it provides extraordinary opportunities for the skillful player
    to overcome bad luck in the deal by means of careful analysis and complex
    manipulations.  The spider
    program does not actually play the game for you,
    but rather takes the place of the cards (by displaying the tableau on the
    screen) and keeping a record of the game so that you can follow out long
    lines of play without losing track of where you started from.
