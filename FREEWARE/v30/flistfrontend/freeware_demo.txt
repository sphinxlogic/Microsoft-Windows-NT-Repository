There's no ready-to-run demo.  To run FLIST, you'll need a C compiler
(I've tested with VAX-C and DEC-C).  It's nice but not essential to
have MMS (or its clone, MMK).

Documentation:
-------------
	This release contains two subdirectories, [.DOC] and [.SRC]. 
	All documentation for FLIST and its associated BROWSE utility
	are found in the [.DOC] subdirectory.  Precompiled versions of
	the ".HLP" and ".MEM" files are included, though you may wish to
	recompile these (since the underlining is omitted in my release
	versions):

		$ SET DEFAULT [.DOC]
		$ @BUILD CLOBBER
		$ @BUILD

Building without MMS:
--------------------

        If you simply want to build FLIST, run the script:

		$ SET DEFAULT [.SRC]
                $ @BUILD

        The build-scripts attempt to determine which of three
        configurations you may have:

                VMS with VAX-C
                VMS with DEC-C on a VAX
                VMS with DEC-C on an AXP (alpha)

	I've tested directly on the first and last configurations; my
	information for the second (DEC-C + VAX) comes from user
	feedback for other programs I've worked on.  You'll probably
	have to adjust the librarian options (I'd appreciate feedback
	for the next version).

	The release version uses the file NORMAL.OPT; I've also built a
	shared version with SHARABLE.OPT (the main thing in either case
	is that FLIST requires a lot of stack space).

        The result of the build is an executable, FLIST.EXE

Building with MMS:
-----------------

        The source distribution includes DESCRIP.MMS, which is the MMS
        script.  Run MMS in the source directory; it'll find this file
        and compile/link FLIST.EXE, e.g.,

		$ SET DEFAULT [.SRC]
                $ MMS

	I've only used MMK installed as a foreign command; it doesn't
	work well with the recursive macros set in DESCRIP.MMS, in the
	"all" target.  In this case, I'll type a command such as

		$ SET DEFAULT [.SRC]
		$ MMK [-.BIN]FLIST.EXE
		$ MMK [-.BIN]BROWSE.EXE
		$ MMK [-.BIN]HELPLIB.HLB

        The standard targets in the MMS script are: "all", "clean",
        clobber".

Running the program:
-------------------

	You don't have to install the program to run it.  FLIST can run
	from the build directory.  You must define a foreign command to
	run FLIST (otherwise it won't get command-line arguments).

	The top-level directory (which should include this file)
	contains a script "SETUP.COM", which when run will define
	foreign commands for the executables in [.BIN], e.g.,

                $ @SETUP
                $ FLIST

	Most of FLIST's documentation is in the online help library
	(generated into [.BIN]HELPLIB.HLB).  It assumes that you already
	know something about the VMS command set and concentrates on the
	additional functions and features that FLIST provides. The
	help library is accessible from FLIST by typing a "?" followed
	by a carriage return.

Installing:
----------
        You can install the executable for FLIST in the directory where
        you normally install user programs or tools.  Define (e.g., in
        your LOGIN.COM) the foreign command to point to it, e.g.,

                $ FLIST :== "$ SYS$LOGIN:FLIST.EXE"

        if you put it in your home directory (not tidy, but workable).
	I normally define abbreviations for these programs, e.g.,

		$ FL*IST  :== "$ SYS$TOOLS:FLIST.EXE"
		$ BR*OWSE :== "$ SYS$TOOLS:BROWSE.EXE"

	FLIST looks for its help-file in a location that depends upon
	where its executable is located:
	
		If it is run from a system directory (e.g., SYS$SYSTEM),
		it looks for SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB
		
		Otherwise, it looks for the file HELPLIB.HLB in the
		directory from which it is run (e.g.,
		[.BIN]HELPLIB.HLB).

	(I wrote a vmsinstal script several years ago, but don't have it
	available anymore -- if I get enough user feedback I'll make a
	new one).
