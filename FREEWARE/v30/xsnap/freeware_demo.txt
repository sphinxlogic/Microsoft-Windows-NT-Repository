You can run XSNAP via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure.

The xsnap program allows one to take a snapshot of a  speci-
fied region of the screen.  If xsnap is run without a region
being specified,  the  user  is  prompted  to  interactively
drag  one out with the mouse.  In this case, pressing button
1 will select one corner of  the  region,  and  an  opposite
corner  will  be  selected upon the release of button 1.   A
window whose contents are a copy  of  this  region  is  then
created.   Pressing  "Q",  "q", or "^C" in this  window will
exit the program.
