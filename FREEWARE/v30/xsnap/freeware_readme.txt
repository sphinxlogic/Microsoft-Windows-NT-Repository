XSNAP, MOTIF TOYS, snapshot of a  specified region of the screen



       The xsnap program allows one to take a snapshot of a  speci-
       fied region of the screen.  If xsnap is run without a region
       being specified,  the  user  is  prompted  to  interactively
       drag  one out with the mouse.  In this case, pressing button
       1 will select one corner of  the  region,  and  an  opposite
       corner  will  be  selected upon the release of button 1.   A
       window whose contents are a copy  of  this  region  is  then
       created.   Pressing  "Q",  "q", or "^C" in this  window will
       exit the program.
