This utility displays the configuration of a VMScluster through
the World-Wide Web (WWW). The displayed information is generated
using a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script running
on the Web server host.
<p><h2>Functions</h2>
This utility can:<ul>
<li>List the nodes of the cluster with their name, DECnet address, hardware model and OpenVMS version.
<li>List all system disks in the cluster with their OpenVMS version and the list of nodes booting on them.
<li>List all software products which are installed on a selected system disk with their version.
<li>List all versions of a selected software product with the list of system disks where they are installed.
</ul>
Use the <b>Options</b> bar on top of the page to select a function.
<p><h2>Products Configuration File</h2>
The <i>Products Configuration File</i> describes a set of known
software products. This is a text file.
Each product is described by one line of text.
This line has three fields. Fields are separated by spaces
or tabulations.
<ul><li>First field: Identifier. This is a unique alpha-numerical name, internally used for CGI callback.
<li>Second field: Product name, between double quotes. This is the
name which will be displayed.
<li>Third field: List of image files. The default specification is
<tt>[vms$common.sysexe].exe</tt> on the system disk. Separate
multiple specifications with spaces.</ul>
<p>Comments may be used anywhere in the file. A comment extends
from an exclamation mark <tt>!</tt> to the end of the line.
Empty lines are ignored.
<p>The <i>Products Configuration File</i> must be placed in the
same directory as the CGI script.
The configuration file must have the same name as the script's
executable image, with a <i>.PRODUCTS</i> extension.
<p><h2>Installing the Show-Cluster CGI Script on your Web Server</h2>
This script is written in C. There is only one source file.
<a href="show-cluster.com?getsource">Click here</a> to get a copy.
<p>Simply compile and link this file using the DEC C compiler.
Then place the executable file in a script directory of your Web
Server. To allow further distribution of the source file, also
place it in the same directory.
<p>The last thing you need is the Products Configuration File.
<a href="show-cluster.com?getprodfile">Click here</a> to get a copy of
the file used by this Web server. Also place it in the same
directory
<p>The script directory should consequently contain the following three files:<ul>
<li><tt>show-cluster.exe</tt>
<li><tt>show-cluster.products</tt>
<li><tt>show-cluster.c</tt> (optional)</ul>
