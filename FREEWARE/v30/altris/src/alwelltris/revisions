  [Oct 21, 93]  V1.0.0 --
	Updated altetris (3.1.0) and xvwelltris to alwelltris.
	Things not ported:
	1.	No 3D look. If you know how to do this for variable
		size trapazoids with 4 orientations let me know.
	2.	No prefill. (Although I have some ideas).
	New things besides the 3D well:
	1.	A grid. (toggles with an 'r')
	Things not implemented:
	1.	Soviet Union flags or test questions.
	2.	The current keyboard mapping, uses right for CW,
		left for CCW, down for drop. In the unimplemented
		mapping, for CW, one has to hit right->down->left->up,
		if one started from the top. (I just don't like it,
		but if you would like it in there let me know).
	3.	No gray walls. (Probably not that hard to do. If
		you think it will add to the "perspective" let
		me know). 
	See altetris for more history.
	I acknowledge that Q. Alex Zhao's code and presentation
	(azhao@cc.gatech.edu) was the basis for this program.
