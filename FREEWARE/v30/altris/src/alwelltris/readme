	GENERIC WELLTRIS
	================	Yet Another Tetris Game on X, V1.2.0


WHY ANOTHER?

    Because "different is good"...

    Because this one is simple, easy to build, portable, and deep.
    It only uses Xlib -- no "toolkit" kind of thing.  The most updated
    source could be found on ftp.x.org under /contrib/games/altris .

    A 3-D well and different kinds of polyominoes than Q. Alex Zhao's
    tetris and its this program is patterned after.  That original
    tetris can be found ftp.x.org under /contrib/games .

HOW TO BUILD?

    Edit the Imakefile (or Makefile.std, see below) for appropriate
    settings of variables SCOREFILE, UP, and DOWN, then do:
	xmkmf
	make
	welltris

    If that does not work then:
	mv Imakefile Imakefile.r5
	sed 's/^XCOMM/\/\*\*\/#/' > Imakefile < Imakefile.r5
	xmkmf
	make
	welltris

    Note: if you don't have 'xmkmf' or the "Makefile" it generates
    doesn't work well, try:
	make -f Makefile.std

    "Welltris" is the game.  It only lists the top 15 players at the
    end, each player may has at most three scores.  With the option
    "-s", "welltris" will list all the scores.


ANYTHING SPECIAL IN PLAYING?

    Use 'j' to move left; 'l' to move right; 'k' to rotate; 'i' to 
    reflect.  Left-handed people may want to use 's', 'f', 'd', 'e'
    respectively.  Use the space bar to drop a block quickly.  Do you
    want to try the arrow keys or keypad?


    Use CTRL-L key combination to redraw -- in case the program messes
    something up.

    As usual, '+' and '-' will speed up or lower down the speed.  Note
    that you don't need to press the SHIFT key -- '=' and '_' also
    work.  The 'b' key can be used to toggle "beep" and 'n' toggles
    "show next".  '>' and '<' will increase or decrease the number of
    squares in a polyomino.  'g' key toggles "diagonal", 'm' toggles
    "mixed", 'o' toggles "bonus", and 'r' toggles grid.

    If you press 'p', the game will be paused, and the window will be
    iconified -- just in case your boss suddenly appears at your door.
    ;o) When the tetris window loses its focus, it also goes to
    "paused" mode except it doesn't iconify itself.

    Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.


FOUND A BUG?

    Send bug reports (or fixes) to the author (well, a lot was taken
    from Q. Alex Zhao's tetris (azhao@cc.gatech.edu) but many of the
    algorithms were taken from xvwelltris written by me):
