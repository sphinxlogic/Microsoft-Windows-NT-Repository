Bagley:
  [Dec 28, 95]  V1.2.0 --
	Random generator fixed for 64 bit machines.  Minor patches.
	New mail account.
  [Jun 21, 95]  V1.1.0 --
	The different altris games will now have consistent numbers
	for major releases.
	tetris -fg white -bg black, should now work on monochrome monitors.
	Now provide a random number generator.
	Took out unbundled Sun cc and lint warnings.
	Format to data file changed.

  [Feb 22, 95]  V3.1.2(Altered) --
	Updated "unofficial patch" to contain V3.1.2. A major difference
	is a different kind of bonus. Try "tetris -n 5" to see the
	biggest major difference between this and the unaltered version.
	Instead of "-rightRotation" use "-ccw". See the "CHANGES" file for
	a more complete list.
	(Thanks to Patrick Forsberg <d9fors@dtek.chalmers.se> for a patch
	to XrmMergeDatabase that I missed in Zhao's version.)

  [Feb 21, 95]  V3.1.2 --

  [Feb  3, 94]  V3.1.1 --
 
	Fixed a scorefile checking problem suggested by Richard
	Huveneers <huveneer@math.ruu.nl>.
 
	Changed to use regular (normal) "select"...
 
	Enforced bonus mode so it would be hard to get high scores for
	players who use intensive pausing. As brought up by Herbert
	Ruessink <Herbert.A.Ruessink@let.ruu.nl, Henrik Lautrup
	<u930550@daimi.aau.dk>, and many other people.
 
  [Sep  1, 93]  V3.1.0 --

	David W. Sanderson <dws@ssec.wisc.edu>.

	Option to set which score file to use.

	Option to set the basic rotation direction.

	Minor improvements...

	In general: added a "bonus mode" inspired by an unofficial
	patch from David Bagley <bagleyd@perry.njit.edu>.

	Imakefile, "SYS_LIBRARIES" changed to include "$(XLIB)".
	Suggested by Dr. Horst Spandl <spandl@uisu00.lfu-bw.de>.

	tetris.c, correct resource lookup for "startLevel",
	"preFilledLines", "showNext", and "beep". Suggested by Reuben
	Worley <reuben@bugs.merit-tech.com>.

	playing.c, destroying window before closing connection.
	Suggested by Elwood C. Downey <ecdowney@hwking.cca.cr.rockwell.com>.

	utils.c, tetris.c, brought back the old "plain" bitmaps.
	Suggested by David W. Sanderson <dws@ssec.wisc.edu>.

	utils.c, better rotation (looks more "natural"). Suggested by
	Alberto Hernandez <alberto@TITAN.tid.es>.

	Many minor changes...

    Since the days of V1.8, I have got many responses over the net.
    Thanks go to people who helped me in improving the program.

  [Nov 13, 92]  Black Friday -- V1.8.1: numerious minor changes. Made
		score listing built in.

  [Oct 08, 92]  V1.8: Corrected some typos, <herbison@erlang.enet.dec.com>.
		Added man-page.  Gregg Townsend <gmt@cs.arizona.edu>
		provided hints for some problems on HP-UX. Imakefile.
		Richard van Denzel suggest modifications for HP-UX.

  [Sep 30, 92]	V1.7: Richard van Denzel <raet-sh!richard@relay.nluug.nl>
		reported bugs on HP-UX 8.0.

  [Sep 27, 92]  V1.6: Changed speed coefficients. Improved window
		manager hints. Several rows at once worth more points.

		<raet-sh!richard@relay.nluug.nl>. Added 'b' to toggle

		Green" <darylg@amex-trs.com>).

  [Sep 23, 92]  V1.3: Scoring -- a line in a higher level worth more
		points; "tscores" program. Submitted to
		comp.sources.games (volumn 15, issues 1-2; it has
		nothing to do with GNU, but it was called "gtetris",
		pronounced as "Gee, tetris", by the newsgroup
		moderator).

  [Sep ??, 92]  First set of versions, 1.0 through 1.2 -- developed and
		tested at the University of Arizona. Put on
		export.lcs.mit.edu.

		I studied an old tetris game for X10, wrote by Wayne
		Christopher <faustus@cs.berkeley.edu> in 1988; then I
		adopted the ideas in representing those "blocks" and
		rotating them, and added X11 stuff.  Also I learned a
		lot from Nathan Sidwell's great game "xmris", e.g.  the
		"iconifying pause".
