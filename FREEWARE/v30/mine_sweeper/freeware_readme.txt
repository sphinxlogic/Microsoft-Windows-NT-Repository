MSWEEPER, GAMES, Character Cell Mine-sweep like game.

DESCRIPTION:
This game started out as a "learning" tool for programmers.  I wanted them to
have something fun to work on and learn some 'C' tricks at the same time.  I
designed the program to be written with different techniques given the same
situation.  This way we could see how the optimizer would handle the different
techniques so we would know how to code 'real' programs.

USAGE:
         arrow keys - to 'drive' the cursor
                  F - to flag a bomb
<space> or <RETURN> - to select a spot to clear
	    <ctrl>H - to 'help'
	    <ctrl>R - to restart the game from the begining
	    <ctrl>U - to undo an explosion
	    <ctrl>W - to We-draw the screen
            <ctrl>Z - to exit any screen

If you have mouse control, you can use the following:
        Left Button - to select a spot to clear
      Middle Button - to flag a bomb
       Right Button - to undo an explosion
