VFYMAIL, UTILITIES, Check for missing or extra MAIL$xxxxxxxx.MAI files.

This utility checks a mail directory for extra and missing
MAIL$xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.MAI files.  When the 'repair' feature is used,
the utility can move messages that have lost their external file and
rename external files that have lost their message header (for easy
identification).
