XTARTAN, MOTIF TOYS, Draw various tartans as window backgrounds

Xtartan generates a pixmap containing a Scottish tartan and sets it as the
background of a new window (or the root window if -r is used).  Tartan sett
information and color information are specified using X11 resources, allowing
you to easily add your own tartan if it is not already included, or to modify
the pattern or individual colors of existing tartans.

The standard applications default file for Xtartan includes descriptions for
over 240 setts.
