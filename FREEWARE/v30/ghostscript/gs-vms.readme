			GNU GHOSTSCRIPT FOR VMS

	Ghostscript wasn't hacked by me, but I might start at it during
	the summer or somesuch.  I put it here because Ron Fox
	<fox@foxsun.bscl.msu.edu> asked me to.  I have made no control
	whatsoever, so I don't want to be flamed about it.

	Just get gs-vms.tar-gz and you have it.

	You can find instructions on how to unpack and what you need
	to do that in the file [.GNU-VMS]00_HOW_TO.
