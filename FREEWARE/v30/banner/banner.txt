A new version of Banner for DECwindows V3 is now available. This kit will run
only against DECwindows V3.

The kit can be copied from :-

	FIZBUZ::FIZBUZ$DUA0:[SAUNDERS.DECW$BANNER]BANNER008.A

Changes :-

	o Banner now saves resources in files who format is 
	  DECW$BANNER_nodename.DAT. Resource names all begin with 
	  DECW$BANNER_node.xxxxx as apposed to the original form of 
	  DECW$BANNER.xxxxxx. 

	  Therefor if you have already a SYS$LOGIN:DECW$BANNER.DAT or
	  a SYS$LOGIN:DECW$BANNER_node.DAT you may care to rename it to the 
	  above format, and change all the resource names to the new format 
	  after upgrading to BANNER008.

	o Banner now creates a dedicated terminal for trapping broadcaste
	  messages, which means that the message window can now be used 
	  no matter how you are running banner, or on which node in a 
	  cluster environment.

	o Most of the reported problems with the 006 kit have been fix.

	o Banners default mode is Borderless. This may be changed using 
	  the setup options, however this will result in Banner occupying 
	  a much larger portion of the available workstation screen space.
	  In the borderless mode Banner windows can be moved by pressing 
	  MB3 and pulling the window to its desired possition. The new 
	  possitions will become the default startup possitions if the
	  'Save Settings' is then performed. 

	  If Banner window cover some other application windows, they can be 
	  forced to stay below all other windows, by using the restart window 
	  manager option, of the DECwindows V3 window manager.

Known Problems :-

	o NI monitor is no longer operational, I hope to get the information
	  to update the NI monitor, but until then it is out of service.
