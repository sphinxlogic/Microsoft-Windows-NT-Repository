   MadGoat KILL lets you delete or $FORCEX other processes anywhere on a
   VMScluster. KILL accepts usernames on the command line; each process
   running under that username is displayed and you are given the chance
   to kill it or force an exit for the process. Includes the ability to
   kill only disconnected processes, processes on a particular node, etc.
   
   
   The BLISS sources are distributed with the software.
