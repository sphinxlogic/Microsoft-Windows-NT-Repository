<h1 align=center>Preface</h1>

<a name="index_x_1"></a>

<p>
<b>INTOUCH 4GL</b> is a next generation database language for VAX 
and Alpha AXP computers.  It includes a fourth-generation database language 
and an advanced development environment. 

<p>
The INTOUCH language: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> is concise and powerful. 
  <li> promotes structured programming. 
  <li> is easy to use--even for computer novices. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
<a name="index_x_2"></a>
INTOUCH includes a transparent interface to the RMS file management system 
as well as other database engines.  The interface includes: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> simple structure statements for complex data manipulations. 
  <li> numerous extensions which allow the technical programmer to develop 
        advanced applications. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
<a name="index_x_3"></a>
The INTOUCH environment is designed for developing complex applications 
rapidly.  The interactive environment: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> allows immediate response and fast development. 
  <li> allows you to interrupt program execution, change code and then 
        continue execution. 
  <li> has high level debugging facilities for pinpointing program bugs 
        quickly and accurately. 
  <li> returns errors immediately--like an interpreter--while code is 
        optimized by the compiler. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
<a name="index_x_4"></a>
Development cycle time is the time it takes to edit, compile, 
link, run and debug code.  INTOUCH reduces this time by providing an 
interactive and fast response environment.  INTOUCH offers features 
that cut cycle time significantly--up to 80%.  

<p>
You will find INTOUCH an exciting and powerful programming tool. 
<h2>About this Manual</h2>

<p>
This manual is one of two reference manuals describing the INTOUCH 
system.  Both manuals are designed to provide the information you 
need in a manner that is concise and easy to use.  The manuals are: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> <i>A Guide to the Language</i>
  <li> <i>Specifications</i>
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
<b>A Guide to the Language</b> describes the INTOUCH system and 
how to develop programs with it.  The Guide explains the development cycle 
and INTOUCH's features for speeding up this cycle.  It describes the 
INTOUCH environment, program elements and the INTOUCH language and 
debugging system.  

<p>
<a name="index_x_5"></a>
INTOUCH's <b>Specifications</b> contain a brief description of 
the INTOUCH system, statements, commands, etc., and some background 
on how the system operates.  

<p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this Guide is to present the information you will need to 
develop programs with INTOUCH.  The intent is to provide you, the user, 
with simple and concise explanations of the INTOUCH system, features, 
and language.  This manual is designed to provide a basic and thorough 
explanation of each element.  This manual can also be used as a reference 
guide by advanced users. 
<h2>Intended Audience</h2>

<p>
This Guide is written for both experienced programmers and those 
self-learners who have had some exposure to computers and programming 
languages.  If you have little programming experience, or are using 
this manual to teach yourself, please start with chapter one. 

<p>

Either pairs of single quotes ('xxx') or pairs of double quotes ("xxx") 
can be used both in INTOUCH immediate mode (e.g. SAVE 'x.int' or SAVE "x.int") 
and within an INTOUCH program for string values (e.g. print 'hello' or 
print "hello").

INTOUCH will display an <i>error message</i>.  At this point, you can 
either retype the line, or you can correct the line.  To correct this error, 
use the UP arrow key to recall the line, use the left arrow key to move over 
to the second <b>t</b>, use the delete key to delete the second 
<b>t</b> and then press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key. 

<p>
Now that you have typed in the sample program, you are ready to run it.

<a name="index_x_39"></a>

<p>
You can interrupt an INTOUCH program while it is running, make immediate 
changes and continue execution.  This can be done because INTOUCH compiles 
each statement as it is entered.  And, as you have seen previously, it 
returns any compile-time errors immediately. 

<p>
The following shows how to run the sample program, iterrupt it, make a 
change and continue execution. 

<p>
<h2>Interrupting the Program</h2>

<a name="index_x_40"></a>
<a name="index_x_41"></a>

<p>
To interrupt an INTOUCH program, enter <kbd>Ctrl/C</kbd> while the program 
is running. 

<p>
To interrupt the sample program, RUN the program and at the "Please enter 
your name?" prompt, enter <kbd>Ctrl/C</kbd>.  INTOUCH will interrupt program 
execution and tell you where it stopped. 
<a name="example_1-7"></a>

<b>INTOUCH</b>
 
 
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
<b>BREAK at 10</b> tells you that the program was stopped when 
it was executing line 10. 

<p>
You are now at the INTOUCH prompt and can make changes. 

<p>
<h2>Listing Program Lines</h2>

<a name="index_x_42"></a>
<a name="index_x_43"></a>
<a name="index_x_44"></a>

<p>
Before making changes, you can list the current program lines by entering 
the word <b>LIST</b>.  For example: 
<a name="example_1-8"></a>
Example 1-8  Listing Program Lines

<p><pre>

<b>INTOUCH</b>
 
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
<h2>Changing the Sample Program</h2>

<p>
You can change the sample program by entering the following two lines: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> 10  name$ = 'Sunny' 
  <li>  <li> 25  print day$ 
</ul>

</dl>

<p><pre>
<hr>
 
10  name$ = 'Sunny' 
25  print day$ 
 
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Resuming Program Execution</h2>

<a name="index_x_45"></a>
<a name="index_x_46"></a>
<a name="index_x_47"></a>

<p>
You have changed the sample program and are now ready to resume execution. 
You want the program to start running at line 10.  To continue program 
execution, enter <b>GOTO 10</b> and press <kbd>Return</kbd>. 

<p>
<a name="example_1-9"></a>
Example 1-9  Resuming INTOUCH Program Execution

<p><pre>
<hr>
<b>INTOUCH</b>
 
10  name$ = 'Sunny' 
25  print day$ 
goto 10 
Hello, Sunny 
Sunday 
 
<b>INTOUCH</b>
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
INTOUCH started program execution at line 10 and ran all the program lines 
including line 25, the line you added. 

<p>
As you can see, INTOUCH makes it easy to add and change program code. 

<a name="heading_1.6"><h1>1.6 Using EXIT and Back</h1></a>
<a name="index_x_48"></a>
<a name="index_x_49"></a>
<a name="index_x_50"></a>

<p>
When you want to get out of the INTOUCH environment, enter 
<b>EXIT</b> and you will be returned to the system prompt 
(the $ prompt). 

<p>
When you EXIT out of INTOUCH, you lose the environment you have set up. 
Any unsaved changes you have made to the environment are lost.  When you 
re-enter INTOUCH, you will begin again with the default INTOUCH environment. 

<p>
<h2>Summary Message Line</h2>

<p>
When you are in INTOUCH and at the INTOUCH prompt or in an INTOUCH 
program, utility or routine, you will see a summary message line at 
the bottom of the screen frame. 

<p>

<pre>
<hr>
 
 
<b>INTOUCH</b>
 
 
<b>                                                                                </b>
<b>EXIT = Exit                                                \ = Back  HELP = Help</b>
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
The summary message reminds you that, while you are in INTOUCH: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> you can enter HELP to get help. 
  <li> you can enter EXIT to exit. 
  <li> you can use the <b>\</b> (backslash) to backup 
        to a previous prompt or menu. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
You also have access to these three commands from within your own INTOUCH 
programs.  Here is an example of how they are used in a program: 

<p>

<pre>
<hr>
        10  DO 
              INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$ 
              IF  _HELP  THEN  MESSAGE 'Type in your name' 
              IF  _HELP  or  _BACK  THEN  REPEAT DO 
              IF  _EXIT  THEN  EXIT DO 
              PRINT 'Hello '; name$ 
            END DO 
        20  END 
 
        RNH 
        Please enter your name? help 
        Please enter your name? \
        Please enter your name? exit 
 
 
                        Type in your name 
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
When in an INTOUCH program or routine, you can also press the <kbd>Help</kbd> 
key to get help and press <kbd>Ctrl/Z</kbd> to exit. 

<p>
<i>Summary</i>

<p>
You can enter EXIT or press <kbd>CTRL/Z</kbd> from within a program to do one 
of the following: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> Exit a procedure within the program. 
  <li> Exit the program and return to the INTOUCH prompt. 
  <li> EXIT the program and return to the system prompt if you are running 
        a compiled program. 
</ul>
