                  version 4.5 or greater. The following items are included with
                  this installation package:

                       o  An INTOUCH distribution tape

                       o  The "Installation Instructions"

                       o  INTOUCH reference manuals

               __________________________________________________________________

       2.1     Instructions

                  To install INTOUCH on your VAX computer, you will need to work
                  from a DEC VT100 or compatible terminal. Follow the steps
                  listed below. You should type the commands shown. The VAX
                  system is space conscious, so be sure to type the commands
                  exactly as shown.

                       1  Log onto the system account

                                  Username:   SYSTEM
                                  Password:

                       2  Create the INTOUCH directory:

                                  $ CREATE/DIRECTORY SYS$SYSDEVICE:[INTOUCH]



                       3  Enter the INTOUCH directory:

                                  $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSDEVICE:[INTOUCH]


                       4  Verify you are in the new directory. You should
                          see the message No files found.









                                                                              2-1

 


               INSTALLING INTOUCH ON YOUR VAX





                                  $ DIR
                                    No files found.


                       5  Put the INTOUCH distribution tape on your
                          computer's tape drive.


                       6  Make the tape drive available.

                                  $ MOUNT MSA0:/FOREIGN
                                    Volume is write locked
                                    INTOUCH mounted on _MSA0:

                            "MSA0" may have to be replaced with the
                            appropriate identifier for your system.


                       7  Backup the distribution tape-transfer INTOUCH to
                          disk.

                                  $ BACKUP/LOG MSA0:*.* *.*/NEW_VERSION


                            The backup will take about 5 minutes. As
                            INTOUCH is transferred to disk, you will see
                            a list of the files being transferred.


                       8  Build INTOUCH utilities:

                                  $ @INTOUCH_BUILD

                       9  Activate INTOUCH by executing the following
                          command:

                                  $ @INTOUCH


                      10  Add the above command to your system-wide login
                          command procedure. This will cause INTOUCH to be
                          available to other users when they log in.


                      11  INTOUCH has now been installed on your computer.
                          Verify this by typing the command "INTOUCH_DEMO"
                          at the VAX system prompt.

                      12  If you are new to INTOUCH, we encourage you to try
                          each of the INTOUCH DEMO menu items. The BENCHMARK
                          item is especially impressive. It shows that
                          INTOUCH is truly "faster than ALL other OpenVMS
                          languages" when doing I/O operations!
