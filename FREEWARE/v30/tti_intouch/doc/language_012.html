<a name="index_x_710"></a>
Use the <b>IF</b> construct when you want to execute a statement 
or block of code only under specific conditions. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
The simplest form of the IF construct is a one-line statement: 

<p><pre>
        IF cond_expr THEN statement 
</pre>

<p>
<i>cond_expr</i> is a conditional expression.  INTOUCH evaluates this 
expression as either <b>TRUE</b> (1) or <b>FALSE</b> (0). 
If the condition is TRUE, INTOUCH executes the statement following the 
<b>THEN</b>.  If the condition is FALSE, INTOUCH skips the 
statement following the THEN and goes to the next line. 

<p>
In the example program, when INTOUCH executes the first IF statement, 
it evaluates the conditional expression, SEX$[1:1] = 'M'.  IF the user is 
'Male' the condition is TRUE and INTOUCH executes the statement following 
the THEN and jumps to DONE:. 

<p>
IF can be used to execute a block of code.  The IF block construct 
looks like this: 

<p><pre>
        IF cond_expr THEN 
              ---       
              ---  block of code 
              --- 
        END IF 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="index_x_711"></a>
If the conditional expression is TRUE, INTOUCH executes the block of code 
beginning on the next line.  <b>END IF</b> marks the end of 
this block of code.  If the expression is FALSE, INTOUCH skips to the 
statement following the END IF. 
</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_11.5.1"><h2>11.5.1 ELSE Option</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_712"></a>
<dl>
<dd>

<p>
The <b>ELSE</b> option executes a statement if the conditional 
expression is FALSE.  The format of the IF statement with the ELSE option 
is: 

<p><pre>
        IF cond_expr THEN statement ELSE statement 
</pre>

<p>
When INTOUCH executes the IF statement, it evaluates the conditional 
expression.  If the expression is TRUE, the statement following the THEN 
is executed.  If the expression is FALSE, the ELSE statement is executed. 
(Please refer to previous example.) 

<p><pre>
        RNH 
        Enter your age: 19 
        Enter your sex: Female 
 
        Please go to line A. 
</pre>

<p>
In the above program, when INTOUCH executes the first IF statement, 
it evaluates the expression, SEX$[1:1] = 'M'.  Since the user is Female, 
the expression is FALSE, so INTOUCH skips the THEN clause and jumps to 
the ELSE clause.  INTOUCH executes the code between the ELSE clause and 
the END IF. 

<p>
The ELSE option can be used to execute a block of code if the conditional 
expression is FALSE.  The IF construct with the ELSE option looks like this: 

<p><pre>
        IF cond_expr THEN 
              --- 
              ---  block of code 
              --- 
        ELSE 
              --- 
              ---  block of code 
              --- 
        END IF 
</pre>

<p>
If the conditional expression is TRUE, INTOUCH executes the block of code 
between the IF and the ELSE statements.  If the expression is FALSE, 
INTOUCH executes the block of code between the ELSE and the END IF. 

<p><pre>
        10  INPUT PROMPT 'Enter your age: ': age 
            INPUT PROMPT 'Enter your sex: ': sex$ 
        20  IF  UCASE$(sex$[1:1]) = 'M'  THEN  GOTO the_end 
            PRINT 
        30  IF  age &lt; 40  THEN 
              PRINT 'Please go to line A.' 
            ELSE 
              PRINT 'Please go to line B.' 
            END IF 
        40  the_end: END 
 
        RNH 
        Enter your age: 45 
        Enter your sex: female 
 
        Please go to line B. 
</pre>

<p>
In the above program, when INTOUCH executes the second IF statement, it 
checks to see if "AGE &lt; 40".  Since AGE is not less than 40, the condition 
is FALSE.  INTOUCH skips the code following the THEN and jumps to the ELSE 
clause.  INTOUCH executes the code following the ELSE clause. 
</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_11.5.2"><h2>11.5.2 ELSEIF Option</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_713"></a>

<p>
<dl>
<dd>

<p>
The <b>ELSEIF</b> option sets up a new condition to check.  The 
format of the IF construct with the ELSEIF option is: 

<p><pre>
        IF cond_expr1 THEN 
              --- 
              ---  block of code 
              --- 
        ELSEIF cond_expr2 THEN 
              --- 
              ---  block of code 
              ---            
        ELSE 
              ---                                                 
              ---  block of code 
              ---               
        END IF 
</pre>

<p>
ELSEIF establishes a new condition.  INTOUCH evaluates this condition.  If 
the condition is TRUE (1), INTOUCH executes the code following the ELSEIF. 
If the condition is FALSE (0), INTOUCH jumps to the next clause in the IF 
construct. 

<p><pre>
        10  INPUT PROMPT 'Enter your age: ': age 
            INPUT PROMPT 'Enter your sex: ': sex$ 
        20  IF  UCASE$(sex$[1:1]) = 'M'  THEN  GOTO the_end ELSE PRINT 
        30  IF  age &lt; 20  THEN 
              PRINT 'Please go to line A.' 
            ELSEIF  age &gt; 19  AND  age &lt; 40  THEN 
              PRINT 'Please go to line B.' 
            ELSE 
              PRINT 'Please go to line C.' 
            END IF 
        40  the_end: END 
 
        RNH 
        Enter your age: 25 
        Enter your sex: Female 
 
        Please go to line B. 
</pre>

<p>
In the above program when INTOUCH executes the second IF statement, it 
checks to see if "AGE &lt; 20".  Since AGE is not less than 20, the first 
condition is FALSE.  INTOUCH skips the code following the THEN and checks 
the condition set up by the ELSEIF.  Since "AGE &gt; 19" and "AGE &lt; 40", the 
second condition is TRUE and INTOUCH executes the code following the 
ELSEIF and prints 'Please go to line B.', then exits the conditional.

<p>
Sometimes you need to compare one main expression with several values and 
execute a different block of code for each possible match.  Use 
<b>SELECT CASE</b> to check a set of conditions and execute code 
depending on the results. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
The SELECT CASE statement begins the construct and gives the main 
expression (<i>main_expr</i>).  In the example, the main expression 
is INCOME.  The <b>CASE</b> statements are compared with the 
main expression.  The first CASE expression (<i>expr1</i>) is 0.  
Following this CASE is a block of code.  If INCOME = 0 the block of code 
following CASE 0 is executed. 

<ul>
  <li> The main expression and all CASE expressions must be the same data type. 
        For example, if the main expression is a string expression, all the 
        CASE expressions must be strings also.  If the data types do not 
        match, an exception is generated. 
  <li> If the main expression is an integer and a real numeric CASE expression 
        is given, the CASE expression is rounded and the integer portion 
        is compared. 
  <li> There must be at least one CASE expression. 
  <li> If none of the CASE expressions match (and there is no CASE ELSE), an 
        exception is generated. 
</ul>

</dl>

<a name="index_x_717"></a>
<a name="index_x_718"></a>

<p>
Each <b>CASE</b> statement can include several expressions 
separated by commas.  INTOUCH compares each of the expressions in a CASE 
statement.  If any of them match, the block of code following the 
CASE is executed. 

<p><pre>
        10  DO 
              INPUT 'Procedure (add, del, exit)': pro$ 
              IF  _EXIT  THEN  EXIT DO 
              pro$ = UCASE$(pro$) 
        20    SELECT CASE pro$ 
              CASE 'ADD' 
                PRINT 'Adding...' 
              CASE 'DEL', 'DELETE' 
                PRINT 'Deleting...' 
              END SELECT

The following example illustrates how to check for a range of 
values: 

<p><pre>

            SELECT CASE a 
              CASE 1 : PRINT 'one'

              CASE ELSE : PRINT 'else' 
            END SELECT 
        20  b$ = 'c' 
            SELECT CASE b$ 
              CASE 'a' : PRINT 'a' 
              CASE 'b' to 'e' : PRINT 'range'

<p>
The <b>CASE ELSE</b> option executes a block of code only if 
none of the CASE expressions match.  SELECT CASE with the CASE ELSE option 
looks like this: 

<p><pre>
        SELECT CASE main expr

            --- 
        END SELECT 
</pre>

<p>
CASE ELSE must follow the last CASE statement.  If none of the CASE 
expressions match, INTOUCH executes the block of code following 
the CASE ELSE statement.

Use <b>PASS</b> to perform system commands without leaving 
the INTOUCH environment or exiting a program. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
PASS passes the specified string expression to the operating system 
command interpreter.  Generally, it passes the string to DCL.  The 
operating system will respond to the string as it would if you entered 
it at the DCL $ prompt.  When the system finishes, control returns to 
the INTOUCH program. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_728"></a>
<a name="index_x_729"></a>
When you use the <b>NOWAIT</b> option with PASS, the operating 
system executes the passed command and immediately returns to INTOUCH       
without waiting for the passed command to finish.

<a name="heading_11.9"><h1>11.9 Branching</h1></a>
<a name="index_x_732"></a>

<p>
Branching means jumping from one part of a program to another. 
Branching is especially useful when combined with conditionals.  For 
example, you can ask the user to choose a procedure.  You can branch 
to different subroutines in your program, depending on the procedure 
chosen. 

<p>
There are several statements used for branching:  GOTO, GOSUB, 
DISPATCH, ON GOTO, and ON GOSUB.  GOTO causes INTOUCH to jump to the 
specified location and continue normal program execution from there. 

<p>
GOSUB and DISPATCH execute routines and subroutines.  Subroutines are 
blocks of code that INTOUCH branches to, executes, and then returns from. 

<p>
GOTO, GOSUB, and DISPATCH cause unconditional branching.  When they 
are executed, INTOUCH jumps to the statement specified.  To 
conditionally branch, combine these statements with conditional 
statements.  Two other constructs, ON GOTO and ON GOSUB, are 
conditional.  Both ON GOTO and ON GOSUB branch to one of a number of 
places in the program depending an integer expression.  When the 
ON GOSUB construct is used, INTOUCH will return to the statement 
following the ON GOSUB when the subroutine has finished executing. 

<p>

<a name="heading_11.9.1"><h2>11.9.1 Branching and Code Blocks</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_733"></a>

<p>
Certain constructs (such as GOSUB) include a block of code which is 
executed within the construct.  You can transfer control within these 
code blocks and out of these code blocks.  For example: 

<p><pre>
                           10  DIM name$(4) 
                           20  FOR i = 1 TO 4 
                                 INPUT 'Your name, please': name$(i) 
       branches within block --    IF  name$(i) &lt;&gt; ''  THEN  GOTO hello 
       branches out of block --    IF  _EXIT  THEN  EXIT FOR 
                                 hello: 
                                   PRINT 'Hello!' 
                           30  NEXT i 
                           40  PRINT 'Finished' 
                           50  END

<p>
Sometimes you want to jump to one of several places in your program.  
<b>ON...GOTO</b> lets you jump to one of several locations 
depending on a condition you set up. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
<i>int_expr</i> is the integer expression or condition to check. 
<i>target1, target2 ...</i> is a list of places to jump to.  Each 
target can be a label or line number. 

<p>
ON..GOTO branches to one of several targets depending on the value of 
an integer expression.  The simplest version of ON..GOTO is, 

<p><pre>
        ON int_expr GOTO target1, target2... 
</pre>

<p>
<i>int_expr</i> is an integer expression whose value determines where 
control is transferred.   When INTOUCH executes the ON GOTO statement, 
it evaluates the integer expression.  If the value is 1, INTOUCH branches 
to the first target in the list.  If the value is 2, INTOUCH branches to 
the second target, and so on. 

<p>
If the expression does not evaluate to an integer, INTOUCH rounds it.  The 
value must be from 1 to the number of targets (unless there is an ELSE 
clause).  For example, if there are five targets, the integer value must 
be from 1 to 5. 

<p>
If the value is less than 1 or greater than the number of targets, and 
there is no ELSE clause, INTOUCH generates an exception.  

<p>
Targets can be labels or line numbers. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_738"></a>
<a name="index_x_739"></a>
INTOUCH supports 128 targets for ON...GOTO.  More targets than 128 gives 
an "expression too complex" exception.

<a name="index_x_740"></a>
<a name="index_x_741"></a>

<p>
The <b>ELSE</b> option executes a statement if the integer 
expression does not find a target.  ON GOTO with the ELSE option looks 
like this: 

<p><pre>
        ON int_expr GOTO target1 [, target2...] ELSE statement 
</pre>

<p>
ELSE must be followed by a <i>statement</i>.  The ELSE is executed if 
the integer value exceeds the number of targets in the list, is zero or 
is negative.

If the <i>target</i> in the GOSUB statement does not exist, an
