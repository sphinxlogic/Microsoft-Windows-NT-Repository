This is a Motif color editor.  It can be used in various ways, but the most
interesting feature is the ability to pick an existing application window,
get a pixmap copy of it, and play with the colors.  You can get a feel for
how the whole application will look like with new colors.  There is also
a special window that shows the system's rgb.txt file and the resulting
colors.  This can be used as a reference palet when experimenting with
new colors.

This, of course, is not a commercial application.  It is pretty much hard
wired for 8-bit displays w/ read/write color maps.  It should be easy
though to change a bit of code to make it work for other display setups.

Distribution and copying policy:

	1.  Have fun and don't sell it.
	2.  Don't tell anybody I wrote it.
