 * Description:
 *
 *    Basically, it's combination spirograph and string art.
 *    Instead of doing lines, we just use a complex polygon,
 *    and use an even/odd rule for filling in between.
 *
 *    The spirograph, in mathematical terms is a polar
 *    plot of the form r = sin (theta * c);
 *    The string art of this is that we evaluate that
 *    function only on certain multiples of theta.  That is
 *    we let theta advance in some random increment.  And then
 *    we draw a straight line between those two adjacent points.
 *
 *    Eventually, the lines will start repeating themselves
 *    if we've evaluated theta on some rational portion of the
 *    whole.
 *
 *    The number of lines generated is limited to the
 *    ratio of the increment we put on theta to the whole.
 *    If we say that there are 360 degrees in a circle, then we
 *    will never have more than 360 lines.   
 *
 * Return:
 *
 *    The number of points.
