Hello Patrick!

	Just looked at the Xscreensaver-program you ported to VMS. 
	This one is really funny for running on  a workstation and 
	several of the graphics hacks are quite impressive. I 
	noticed quite a number of informationals/warnings, when 
	compiling with DEC C. I append a list of the changes to this 
	mail, but since there is a number of these I've put also 
	a zip-archive of the changed sources in the incoming directory 
	of your server. Actually one problem remains with getpwnam.c.
	If you have an  idea how to cure this I would be most interested 
	to hear about it.
	
        I've noticed your define XPointer=char* in the DEC C and VAX C 
	compile files. Actually this one is not related to the compiler 
	but to the Xrelease. I would therefore suggest to put an
	#if Xlibspecificationrelease<5 
	(you'll have to look in xlib.h for the exact spelling) in the 
	appropriate places. Then one could use one file for all compilers.

					Greetings, Martin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In compile_decc.com remove the definiton XPointer=char* from the 
compile directive for grabscreen.c (this definition prevents a 
successfull compile at least with Moftif 1.2).

In the utils-subdir:

 grabscreen.c 

Add a 

#ifdef VMS
# include <signal.h>
#endif

at the beginning of the file to get the function prototype for sleep.

 strings.c

Add a 

#include <string.h>  

at the beginning of the file to get various function prototypes right.

In the driver subdirectory:

Remove all the defines from the compile*.com files.
VMS gets defined anyhow and the redefinition of the macros already defined in config.h
produce nasty messages during compilation.

 demo.c 

add at line  539     
 
 void (*notice_events_timer_ptr)() = notice_events_timer;

and change line 561 to 

         XtAppAddTimeOut (app, notice_events_timeout, notice_events_timer_ptr,

 lock.c 

Change to
 
#ifndef VMS
#include <pwd.h>
#else
#include "pwd.h"
extern char *getenv();
extern int validate_user(char *name, char *password);
extern void ungrab_keyboard_and_mouse P((void));
#endif

 to get the function prototypes for validate_user and ungrab_keyboard_and_mouse.

 subprocs.c

#include "config.h"

to pick up the no_setuid macro.



In the ifndef VMS-part add 

#include <unixio.h>  /* to pickup close */
#include <unixlib.h>  /* to pickup getpid */

remove there  

#include "resource.h"

since this only causes troubles with undefined structures.

 
 visual.c

#ifdef VMS
#include <string.h> /*to pick up strcmp*/
#endif 

 windows.c

#ifdef VMS
#include <unixlib.h> /*to pick up getpid*/
#endif

 xscreensaver.c 

add

#ifdef VMS
#include <signal.h>     /*for sleep*/
#include <unixlib.h>    /*for getpid*/
#endif

add 
  void (*notice_events_timer_ptr)() = notice_events_timer;
  void (*activate_lock_timer_ptr)() = activate_lock_timer;
 
at the beginning of the demo_mode function and change the subsequent 
XtAppAddTimeOut invocations to use the pointer instead of the function

	    cycle_id = XtAppAddTimeOut (app, cycle, cycle_timer_ptr, 0);

	    lock_id = XtAppAddTimeOut (app,lock_timeout,
				       activate_lock_timer_ptr,0);


chane the definition of now in timestring to
 
  const time_t now = time ((time_t *) 0);

to keep the subseqent ctime happy.

 getpwnam.c 

#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <starlet.h>

 make explicit casts to unsigned long in ItemList structure.

 hpwd.c

Add 

#include <starlet.h>
#include <string.h>

 to get the sys$... and strlen function prototypes.
Change sys$getsyiw to lowercase.
make VMS_VERSION a static char

 validate.c

Add a 

#ifdef VMS
#include <string.h>  
#include "vmsutil.h"
int hash_vms_password(char *output_buf,char *input_buf,int input_length,
                      char *username,int encryption_type,unsigned short salt);
#endif

at the beginning of the file to get strlen, bcmp and hash_vms_password 
function prototypes right.

In the hacks subdir:

In compile_decc.com remove the definiton XPointer=char* from the 
compile directive for screenhacks.c (this definition prevents a 
successfull compile).

screenhack.h

add

#include <math.h>
#include <signal.h> 
#include <unixlib.h>
char *index(char *string, char *c);

to the VMS specific part (it is needed e.g. for sin, sleep, getpid)

Change '\n' to (char *)'\n' to stick to the function prototype.

 In noseguy.c

#ifndef VMS'd the from_program case since this uses popen and pclose and 
if we ever enter there the program will bomb anyhow.
