A short guide on how to build and install XPaint.

First, *read* the comments in README.
Check that all paths etc. in 'Local.config' are correct.
Be sure to add any flags needed for your machine.
Then do

	xmkmf
	make Makefiles
	make
	make install
	make install.man

===  General Problems

Undefined symbol strerror:
	
	Edit Local.config and define MISSING_STRERROR

Undefined symbol strcasecmp:
	
	Edit Local.config and define MISSING_STRCASECMP

===  SCO Unix:

From: Tom Kelly <tom@sco.com>

Since SCO does not ship the Athena widgets with the system, they have
to be obtained.  They are available for free from sosco.sco.com  and
various mirrors (including ftp.uu.net) in the TLS directory.  Both the
R4 and R5 widgets are available.

====  Sun machine:

Undefined symbol:
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass

I don't have the "Fixed 12" font in my XFree86 system, so I've patched

I don't recommend this for everyone, but including the following in the
distribution can help others get different startup fonts:
