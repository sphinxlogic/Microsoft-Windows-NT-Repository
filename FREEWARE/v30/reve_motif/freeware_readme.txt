REVE, GAMES, An othello game under MOTIF


         Reve is a version of the popular Othello game.  It  contains
         graphical  interfaces for SunView, X11 and XView, as well as
         being able to function on normal display terminals  using  a
         termcap interface.

         Reve is played on an 8 x 8 board, with stones  which  should
         be  considered  to  be  black  on  one side and white on the
         other. A legal move consists of placing a stone of one's own
         color  on  the  board  so  as to "sandwich" one or more rows
         (orthogonal or diagonal) of stones  of  the  opposite  color
         between  the stone just placed and another stone of the same
         color. All stones so sandwiched are flipped over  to  reveal
         the color of the other side (your own color).

         The object of the game, is to  have  more  stones  than  the
         opponent  at the end of the game (ie. when the board is full
         or neither side has a legal move).  If  you  have  no  legal
         move, you simply miss a turn.  Black goes first.

         With reve, to place one of your own stones simply click with
         the  mouse  over  the square in which you want your stone to
         go. Note that it is also possible to supply a number  and  a
         letter pair, to indicate where you would like your new stone
         to go. This is the only method to place stones with the dumb
         tty  interface.  The square containing the last move will be
         shown with a black outline. This is updated  with  each  new
         move.  If  you hold the mouse button down as you move around
         the board,  the  square  you  are  currently  over  will  be
         highlighted.

         There are various buttons, choice, toggles and cyclic selec-
         tions  available.   Their  meanings are given below, plus an
         indication of their keyboard equivalents.  With  the  cyclic
         selections,  clicking  over  the left half of the cycle item
         increments the selection, and clicking over the  right  half
         of  the  cycle item decrements the selection. Control-l is a
         keyboard accelerator for redrawing the reve windows.

         By default, a human will play black, and the  computer  will
         play  white.  If  you  want a human vs human startup or some
         other combination, then you should use the appropriate  com-
         mand line options.
