/* ODS-2 reader. To use in VMS, 
  $ define disk$users dka0:
  $ getvms -l [000000]
... etc.
 *
 *  Copy files from VMS (ODS-2) filesystem.  Files may be copied to
 *  disk or to standard output.  Transfer modes supported are "text"
 *  (RMS stuff is thrown away, newline is tacked on the end of each
 *  VMS record), and "image" (straight byte-by-byte transfer).	There
 *  were once plans to support a third mode ("binary"), but this has
 *  not yet been implemented.  Defaults for the output destination and
 *  transfer mode are set by #defines, but the destination/mode can be
 *  specified at runtime by using various flags (see "options()").
 *
 *  The input device and directory, if omitted, will default to that of
 *  the previous filespec.  Note that this means that the first filespec
 *  MUST have a directory specified, and (if DFLTDEV is not defined) also
 *  a device as well.  The filename syntax is the same as the standard
 *  VMS naming scheme, except that a "." may be used to separate the
 *  filetype from the version number, and some delimiters may be changed
 *  via #defines, if desired.  (This is all to avoid the possibility of
 *  having to escape some of the characters that the shell treats as
 *  special.)  The device name is the name of the UNIX special file in
 *  /dev, rather than what VMS thinks it would be.
 *
 *  If the first character of argv[0] is "l", or if the "-l" option is
 *  used, the program lists the contents of the directory rather than
 *  copying a file.  At present, only one directory may be listed per
 *  command.

Options:
  -l - list directory
  -d file - output to disk file
  -f file - out to file
  -s      - out to stdout
  -t      - transfer mode = text.
  -T      - transfer text; remove line numbers
  -I      - Image RMS mode
  -b      - binary mode. (Note: use binary mode for stream files
			also.)
  -c      - copy
