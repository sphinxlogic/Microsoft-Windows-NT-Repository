1. AVAILABILITY

	SHS is provided as a VMSINSTAL kit, and available for VAX/VMS 5.5, 
	VAX/OpenVMS 5.5-2 and later, and Alpha/OpenVMS 6.0 and later. 


2. HOW TO TRY

	Generally you have to install the kit in order to try the features 
	and functions of SHS. However SHS may also be implemented as a 
	foreign command(via DCLsymbols :== $<wherever>SHS.EXE or DCL$PATH). 
	The module to parse the DCL command qualifiers is built into the 
	image. Users may use it as a way to exercise the utility without 
	performing the VMS installation procedure. If you have DEC Fortran 
	V6.2 or above (DEC Fortran V6.1 has a bug and it will crash while 
	trying to handle a recursive rountine), you may simply use the 
	DESCRIP.MMS or BUILD.COM and the rest of the source code attached 
	with the kit to build the SHS image. Assign a symbol to it, and you 
	are ready to go. If you do not have DEC Fortran V6.2 or above, you 
	may have to alter the DESCRIP.MMS or BUILD.COM to simply link the 
	object files in the save set SHS011.A. With some common system 
	management knowledge, it should not be a big task to figure it out. 

3. INSTALLATION

	To extract the SHS V1.1 on line release notes, login to a privileged
	account, and under DCL enter:

		$@SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SHS011 source OPTIONS N

	When VMSINSTAL procedure prompts you - "Do you want to continue the 
	installation [N]:", you may answer NO to quit the installation.

	To install the SHS kit, login to a privileged account.  You need 
	1400 blocks of disk space during the installation and 700 blocks net 
	system disk space after installation. Make sure you have enough disk 
	space before pursuing any furthter. Install time may vary depending 
	on different hardware platforms, but on an AlphaStation 200 4/233, 
	it takes about 3 minutes. To install, under DCL enter:
	
		$@SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL SHS011 source [install-options]


4. POST INSTALLATION

	See SHS V1.1 on-line release notes which have been placed in
	SYS$HELP by the VMSINSTAL procedure.


5. HOW TO USE

	SHS includes a standard OpenVMS help file that explains all of the 
	SHS functions and parameters. I believe it is pretty self-
	explanitory and ease to use.
