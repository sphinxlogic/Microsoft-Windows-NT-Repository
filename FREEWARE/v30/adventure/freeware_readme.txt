ADVENTURE, GAMES, The original Adventure game

Adventure is the original magic / exploration simulation game. It hit
the streets back in the mid 1970s and no doubt was responsible for the
loss of countless software engineering hours. For a classic piece of
nostalgia and entertainment...

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.

This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther.  Most of the
features of the current program were added by Don Woods (DON @ SU-AI).
The current version was done by Kent Blackett and Bob Supnik.
