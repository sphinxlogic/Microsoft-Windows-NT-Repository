<h3>/FILE=file-id</h3> 
Specify a complete file-id (num,seq,rvn) of the file which must be  
deleted.  
This qualifier allows the deletion of lost files or files marked for  
delete. Example :

<p> 
<h3>/KEEP</h3> 
Preserve the directory tree; only delete the contents. /KEEP  
is only valid with the /DIRECTORY qualifier. /KEEP works  
for DELETE/DIR and DELETE/DIR/TREE.  
<h3>/NOLOG</h3> 
Do not log succesfull deletes to SYS$OUTPUT. /LOG is the default.  
<h3>/NOREMOVE</h3> 
Can only be used with /FILE. Default DELETE/FILE will try to  
remove the file from the parent directory. If the file's backlink  
no longer points to a valid directory this will generate an error.  
The /NOREMOVE qualifier overrules this behaviour allowing such  
files to be deleted.  
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3> 
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed  
Time,  
I/O and PageFaults.  
<h3>/TREE</h3> 
Can only be used with /DIRECTORY. The delete command will delete  
all subdirectories within the directory file specified. DFU will first  
sort out the subdirectory tree and than delete the files in the proper  
order.  
Thus a complete directory tree is deleted with one command.

<a name="chapter_7"><h1>Chapter 7<br>DIRECTORY</h1></a> 

<p> 
This chapter describes the DIRECTORY command with the related  
parameters  
and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd7_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_7.1"><h1>7.1 Introduction</h1></a> 

<p> 
The DIRECTORY command offers 6 major functions. 3 functions deal with  
all directories on a disk, the other 3 functions are used for  
manipulating individual directories. These functions  
are activated by special qualifiers:  

<ul> 
  <li>Individual directory functions :  

  <ol> 
    <li>/COMPRESS : Rebuild one or more directory files. Directories  
are alphabetically sorted lists of filenames and file id's. Because  
file  
names are randomly inserted and deleted, holes will occur in directory  
files.  
Such holes will only be reused if a file can be alphabetically fitted  
into  
it. As a result directory files will grow. Especially MAIL  
subdirectories  
suffer from this behaviour.  
      <br>To make matters worse directory files above 127 blocks will  
no longer be  
cached by the file system. This will degrade performance on such  
directories  
dramatically. The COMPRESS function will rebuild the complete directory  
file.  
The /TEST qualifier can be used to preview the results of a possible  
COMPRESS command.  
    <li>/CREATE/ALLOCATE=n : Create a directory with a preallocated  
size  
of 'n' blocks. Note that 'n' will be rounded up to a multiple of the  
disks cluster size.  
    <li>/DUMP : Make a dump of the directory blocks and formats the  
output.  
This option is usefull for debugging directory files which are  
suspected  
or corrupted. This function is equivalent to the previously  
undocumented  
VMS command DUMP/DIRECTORY, although the layout of the output is  
different.  
  </ol> 
    <br>  <li>Disk-wide directory functions :  

  <ol> 
    <li>/ALIAS : Scan all directories on the disk for alias file  
entries.  
    <li>/EMPTY : Scan the disk for empty directories  
    <li>/VERSION=n : Scan all directories on the disk for files which  
have  
at least 'n' versions.  
  </ol> 
    <br></ol> 

<p> 
The diskwide function qualifiers can be used in one command; other  
combinations  
of qualifiers are not possible.  
Note that the diskwide directory functions can take several minutes to  
complete  
because a complete directory scan uses a lot of disk I/O (approximately  
2 I/O's per directory).  

<p> 
An indirect command file containing a list of  
files can be used as a parameter to /COMPRESS or /DUMP. Such a list  
can be generated with the SEARCH command. Example:  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; SEARCH disk/FILE=*.DIR/SIZE=MIN=50/OUT=x.x  
DFU&gt; DIRECTORY/COMPRESS @x.x  
</pre> 

<p> 
Caution: Care should be taken when compressing critical system  
directories.  
To be safe you should first use the /TEST qualifier before compressing  
the directory. Another problem may be caused by a systemcrash just when  
DFU  
is rewriting the new compressed directory (although the chance that  
this  
happens is very small). When this happens you can recover the files by  
executing the following procedure:  

<ol> 
  <li>Do a $SET FILE/NODIR of the corrupted directory  
  <li>Delete the directory and create a new one  
  <li>Do a $ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR ; this will move all the lost files to  
[SYSLOST].  
  <li>Move the files from [SYSLOST] to the newly created directory.  
</ol> 

<p>

<a name="heading_7.2"><h1>7.2 Discussion of directory compression</h1></a> 

<p> 
Version V2.2 of DFU introduced a major change in the directory  
compression  
process (issued by the DIRECTORY/COMPRESS command). Previously versions  
always performed a maximum compression , and then truncated the  
resultant directory. This may be usefull on a dormant directory ,  
but on an active directory this method introduced new problems:  

<ul> 
  <li>When new files were added to the directory it must very quickly  
be extended. Not only is this a slow operation, but on a fragmented  
disk this can lead to DIRALLOC errors.  
  <li>Active directories where files are inserted in a random  
alphabetical  
order very quickly lead to expansion of the just compressed directory.  
</ul> 

<p> 
The first problem is now solved by NOT doing an automatic TRUNCATION  
of the directory. The /TRUNCATE qualifier has been added to allow  
truncation on the users request. Also /TRUNCATE=blocksize is possible  
to perform partial truncation; DFU will not truncate below the  
blocksize  
issued in /TRUNCATE. (The actual blocksize will be rounded up to a  
multiple of the disks cluster size.)  
The second problem is solved by the new /FILL_FACTOR qualifier.  
Here a user can direct DFU to fill each directory block up to a  
certain percentage (between 50 and 100). Not specifying /FILL_FACTOR  
is the same as doing /FILL_FACTOR=100 (full compression).  
Note however that the directory's allocated size must be large enough  
to allow a lower fill factor. If that is not possible DFU  
will issue a DFU-E-EXTERR error, and you must use a higher fill  
factor.  
So, what strategy should be used when comnpressing directories?  

<ol> 
  <li>Inactive directories : use DIR/COMPRESS/TRUNCATE.  
  <li>Not very active diredctories : use DIR/COMPRESS (/TRUNCATE=n).  
  <li>Active directories, files added at the end (such as MAIL  
directories) :  
use DIR/COMPRESS  
  <li>Active directories, files added in random alphabetical order :  
use DIR/COMPRESS/FILL_FACTOR=n  
</ol> 

<p> 
<a name="hd7_3"></a> 

<a name="heading_7.3"><h1>7.3 Output formatting</h1></a> 

<p> 
A new qualifier /FORMAT can be used with DIRECTORY/VERSION.  
This allows the build up of a command procedure directly from the  
output generated by the DIR/VERSION command. /FORMAT has the following  
restrictions :  

<ol> 
  <li>/FORMAT is only valid with the /VERSION and the /OUTPUT  
qualifier.  
  <li>The format string used must contain the !AS directive (in  
uppercase).  
The file found will be substituted at the !AS location  
</ol> 

<p> 
Example:  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; DIR/VERSION=4/OUTP=PURGE.COM/FORMAT="$PURGE/KEEP=3 !AS" mydisk  
</pre>

<h2>Format</h2>

<hr> 
<h2>PARAMETERS</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>device</h3> 
The device on which to perform one of the diskwide directory  
functions.  
<h3>directory-files(s)</h3> 
The file specification of the directory on which to perform  
the /CREATE , /COMPRESS or /DUMP function.  
Wildcard file specifications may be used.  
DFU will automatically add .DIR to the filespecification if a filetype  
is not provided.  
</blockquote> 
<hr> 
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>/ALIAS</h3> 
The /ALIAS qualifier directs DFU to scan all directories for alias  
file entries. Only alias files in DIFFERENT directories will be found  
(this is the most common situation).  
Normally only the system disk should contain alias files. This  
qualifier  
can be combined with /VERSION=n and /EMPTY.  
<h3>/ALLOCATE=n</h3> 
Used in combination with /CREATE. Creates the new directory with  
an allocated size of 'n' blocks.  
<h3>/COMPRESS</h3> 
Performs the directory compression unless /TEST is also specified.  
The output will show the results in terms of file sizes. Example:  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; DIR/COMP OWN$:[000000]MAIL  
  
%DFU-S-DONE, OWN$:[000000]MAIL.DIR;1: 31 files; was : 4/9, now : 3/3 blocks  
  
DFU&gt;  
</pre> 

<p> 
<h3>/CREATE</h3> 
Create a new , empty directory. The allocated size will be 1 cluster  
unless  
/ALLOCATE is specified.  
<h3>/DEVICE</h3> 
The device on which the files reside. The device name is added to the  
file name. If you generate a file list with the DFU SEARCH command  
you don't need this qualifier. However you may have a list  
of files produced from another source and thus need to append a device  
name to it. This qualifier can only be used in combination with  
/COMPRESS  
or /DUMP.  
<h3>/DUMP</h3> 
Produce a block level dump of a directory. /DUMP will interpret the  
directory  
entries found in each block. A directory entry contains a size,  
version-limit,  
type and name field. Next the directory entry contains a list of  
versions and file ID's for this entry. /DUMP will produce a rather  
low level output of this information. Example :  

<p><pre>

<p> 
<h3>/EMPTY</h3> 
The /EMPTY qualifier will produce a list of empty directories.  
This qualifier can be combined with /ALIAS and /VERSION=n.  
<h3>/FILL_FACTOR=n</h3> 
Specifies ,in percentage, the filling of directory blocks during  
a /COMPRESS operation. Fill factor may be between 50 and 100. Omitting  
this qualifier is the same as /FILL_FACTOR=100 (maximum compression).  
If the directory has not enough allocated space a low fill factor  
may result in failure of the Compress operation. DFU will issue  
a DFU-E-EXTERR error, and the directory file will not be modified.  
<h3>/FORMAT=format-string</h3> 
Create an output file in a format described by the format string.  
The string must contain the !AS directive (this must be uppercase).  
At the !AS location the resultant filename will be filled in.  
The /OUTPUT qualifier is required.  
<h3>/OUTPUT=filename</h3> 
This qualifier redirects the output to a file. The output will  
also go to SYS$OUTPUT.  
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3> 
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed  
Time,  
I/O and PageFaults.  
<h3>/TEST</h3> 
The /TEST can only be used in conjunction with /COMPRESS. The qualifier  
will show the results of the /COMPRESS but will not compress  
the directory file.  
<h3>/TRUNCATE=blocksize</h3> 
During a compress operation truncate the directory back to the  
blocksize  
specified. If blocksize is not specified, the file will be truncated  
back to the end-of-file block number. Truncation will always be rounded  
up to the next highest multiple of the disks cluster size.  
<h3>/VERSION=n</h3> 
The /VERSION qualifier directs DFU to scan all directories on the  
device  
to produce a list of files which have at least 'n' versions. This  
qualifier  
can be combined with /ALIAS and /EMPTY.

<p> 
This chapter describes the REPORT command with the related parameters  
and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd8_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_8.1"><h1>8.1 Description</h1></a> 

<p> 
The REPORT command function generates a report of the  
file and free space fragmentation of the disk. Also a  
graph may be generated by the /GRAPH qualifier; this  
visualises the free space distribution on your disk.  
The /USAGE qualifier will generate a diskspace usage  
report. This is especially usefull if DISKQUOTA is not  
enabled on the disk.  

<p> 
The default report contains information of the Volume, files  
and the bitmap. This output can be suppressed by the new  
/NOVOLUME, NOFILE and NOBITMAP qualifiers.  
Also the /USAGE qualifier can be used by displaying information  
of a specific UIC or Identifier simply by specifying /USAGE=&lt;uic&gt;  
or /USAGE=&lt;identifier&gt;.  
<a name="hd8_2"></a>

<p> 
The various items have the following meaning :  

<ol> 
  <li>The header count is calculated based on the size  
of INDEXF.SYS. If more headers are needed INDEXF.SYS has to be  
extended.  
  <li>The free headers gives the number of free entries in INDEXF.SYS  
before it has to extend.  
  <li>The INDEXF.SYS number of fragments and mapwords in use are very  
important  
figures to determine if the INDEXF.SYS file can be extended. The  
theoretical  
maximum number of mapwords is 155. This value may be less if there are  
ACL's on INDEXF.SYS. Each fragment, and therefore each retrieval  
pointer  
must be in the mapword area. As the size of a retrieval pointer depends  
on  
the physical size of a disk, it is not easy to say how many fragments  
INDEXF.SYS can store in the mapwords area.  
If the mapword area is full the INDEXF file can no longer extend,  
and creating new files may result in a SYSTEM-W-HEADERFULL error.  
  <li>Files which have exactly 1 retrieval pointer are considered  
to be contiguous. This doesn't mean that the  
CONTIGUOUS bit is set in the file header.  
  <li>The average  fragments per file give some  
indication about the total file fragmentation.  
  <li>The file and free space fragmentation index classifies your disk  
as follows :  

  <ul> 
    <li> 0-1 : Excellent  
    <li> 1-2 : Good  
    <li> 2-3 : Fair  
    <li> 3-4 : Poor  
    <li> &gt;4  : Bad  
  </ul> 
    <br>If your index is greater than 3 you should consider  
defragmenting the disk  
using Digitals DFO software, or by performing an Image BACKUP /  
Restore.  
  <li>The largest free extent is a usefull figure for  
defragmentation purposes. You cannot defragment a file when its size is  
greater than this value.  
</ul> 

<p> 
The disks free space distribution as a bar graph. On the horizontal  
axis  
the Logical Block Number (LBN) is shown, running from 0 to the maximum  
block number. Each * represents a certain number of contiguous free  
blocks.  

<p> 
If you use the /USAGE qualifier a usage table will be added.  
Per Identifier / UIC the blocks used/allocated , and the number of file  
headers are shown. If Diskquota is enabled a third column will be  
included  
which shows the blocks used/permitted allowing to QUOTA.SYS.  
Normally quota should satisfy the following rule :  

<p><pre> 
 Quota used = blocks allocated + # of file headers

<h3>/GRAPH</h3> 
This qualifier generates a graph table which visualizes the free space  
distribution on the disk. /NOGRAPH is the default.  
<h3>/NOBITMAP</h3> 
The /NOBITMAP qualifier suppresses the "Free space statistics" output.  
<h3>/NOFILE</h3> 
The /NOFILE qualifier suppressed the "File Statistics" output.  
<h3>/NOVOLUME</h3> 
The /NOVOLUME qualifier suppresses the "Volume info" output.  
<h3>/OUTPUT=filename</h3> 
This qualifier redirects the output to a file. The output will  
also go to SYS$OUTPUT.  
<h3>/STATISTICS</h3> 
This qualifier displays the performance statistics: CPU time, Elapsed  
Time,  
I/O and PageFaults.  
<h3>/USAGE(=uic or identifier)</h3> 
The /USAGE qualifier will generate a diskspace usage report based on  
Identifiers/UIC. If diskquota is enabled on the disk the blocks  
used/permitted allowing to QUOTA.SYS will also be shown. /USAGE  
is very usefull when diskquota is not enabled on the disk. When  
a uic or identifier is specified only the information for this uic or  
identifier will be displayed.

<a name="chapter_9"><h1>Chapter 9<br>SEARCH</h1></a> 

<p> 
This chapter describes the SEARCH command with the related parameters  
and qualifiers.  
<a name="hd9_1"></a> 

<a name="heading_9.1"><h1>9.1 Introduction</h1></a> 

<p> 
The search function allows very quick disk-wide  
searches for specific files. You can use almost any  
possible file attribute as a search qualifier.  
<a name="hd9_2"></a> 

<a name="heading_9.2"><h1>9.2 Syntax and Output</h1></a> 

<p> 
The command syntax for SEARCH is:  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; SEARCH device/qualifiers  
</pre> 

<p> 
The output is displayed on your terminal. You can also sort  
the output with the /SORT qualifier.  
The output is shown in 2 or 3 columns eg:  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; SEARCH MYDISK/FILE=X.X/FRAGMENT  
 .  
 .  
$1$DUA102:[USER.COMMAND]X.X;1             1/3               1/1  
 .  
 .  
</pre> 

<p> 
The first column shows the full file name . As of this version of DFU  
the  
device name is included in the file name. The second  
columns shows the file size as actual/allocated size. The 3rd column  
is optional and will only be shown when the /FRAGMENT qualifier is  
used. It  
shows the number of fileheaders / number of file fragments.  
<a name="hd9_3"></a> 

<a name="heading_9.3"><h1>9.3 Volume Set processing</h1></a> 

<p> 
SEARCH checks if the device to-be-searched is member of a  
volume set. If so, the complete volume set will be processed,  
starting with Relative Volume Number 1 up to the last  
member in set. You can override this behaviour with the /NOVOLSET  
qualifier.  
<a name="hd9_4"></a> 

<a name="heading_9.4"><h1>9.4 Output formatting</h1></a> 

<p> 
A new qualifier /FORMAT can be used with SEARCH.  
This allows the build up of a command procedure directly from the  
output generated by the SEARCH command. /FORMAT has the following  
restrictions :  

<ol> 
  <li>/FORMAT is only valid with the /OUTPUT qualifier, and can not be  
used  
together with the /FULL or the /SORT qualifiers.  
  <li>The format string used must contain the !AS directive (in  
uppercase).  
The file found will be substituted at the !AS location  
</ol> 

<p> 
Example:  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; SEARCH/OUTP=DEL.COM/FORMAT="$DELETE/CONF !AS"/FILE=*.LOG mydisk  
</pre> 

<p> 
<a name="hd9_5"></a> 

<a name="heading_9.5"><h1>9.5 UIC and identifier processing</h1></a> 

<p> 
This version introduces an improved handling of UIC's. Previous  
versions  
of DFU only accepted a numeric UIC in the /OWNER qaulifier or an  
identifier in the /IDENT qualifier. V2.4 now accepts all valid uic and  
identifier formats (numeric and alphanumeric) in the /OWNER and /IDENT  
qualifiers. Technically there is no longer any difference between these  
two qualifiers, but they will be left in for compatibility reasons.

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> 
<blockquote> 
The SEARCH command is used for quick disk-wide searches for specific  
files.  
The qualifiers describe the file attributes used as the search  
criteria. You can combine almost all of the possible  
qualifiers, unless otherwise specified. Eg.:  

<p><pre> 
DFU&gt; SEARCH DISK1/SIZE=MIN=10/OWN=[1,4]/CREATED=SINCE=YESTERDAY  
</pre> 

<p> 
is a valid command. Note that qualifiers will be used  
in a logical AND manner, that is, SEARCH will only display files which  
obey to all qualifiers and options specified.  
</blockquote> 
<hr> 
<h2>QUALIFIERS</h2> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>/ALLOCATED</h3> 
Default, SEARCH will use the actual file size. The /ALLOCATED qualifier  
forces SEARCH to use the allocated filesize. This qualifier is only  
meaningfull if you combine it with /SIZE.  
<h3>/APPEND=filename</h3> 
This qualifier redirects the output to be appended to an  
already existing file. If the output file does not exists it will  
be created. You can use /APPEND or /OUTPUT but not both.  
<h3>/BACKUP=option(,option)</h3> 
The /BACKUP qualifier is used to search files depending  
on their backup date. The possible options are :  

<ul> 
  <li>/BACKUP=BEFORE=date  
  <li>/BACKUP=SINCE=date  
  <li>/BACKUP=NONE  
</ul> 

<p> 
The NONE option gives files which don't have a backup  
date recorded.The other 2 options can be used to get  
files which have a backup date before or after a  
specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option can be  
combined in one command.  
<h3>/BAKFID=backlink-file-id</h3> 
You can use this qualifier to look for a file with a  
specific backlink. Only the first part of the file id  
must be specified, that is, if the file id is (x,y,z)  
you must specify 'x' as the file id. You can use this  
qualifier to get files from a specific directory. If  
you use /BAKFID=0 you will get files not belonging to a  
directory (often temporary files).  
<h3>/CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)</h3> 
This qualifier is used to get files with specific file  
characteristics.The characteristics can have the  
following values:  

<ul> 
  <li>Directory    : directory files  
  <li>Nobackup     : files marked nobackup  
  <li>Contiguous   : files marked as contiguous  
  <li>Erase        : erase file before deletion  
  <li>Spool        : spool files  
  <li>Badblock     : files which contain suspected bad block(s)  
  <li>Badacl       : files with a corrupted ACL  
  <li>Besttry      : files marked contiguous-best-try  
  <li>Scratch      : files marked as scratch files  
  <li>Nocharge     : files not charged against quota  
  <li>Nomove       : files marked NoMove (VMS 5.5+)  
  <li>Locked       : files with the deaccess lock bit set  
  <li>Marked       : files marked for deletion  
  <li>Noshelvable  : files which can not be shelved  
  <li>Isshelved    : files which are shelved  
</ul> 

<p> 
The several characteristics can be combined in one  
command.If you want a logical OR behaviour in stead of  
the default AND behaviour, you can use the special  
option  MATCH=OR eg:  

<p><pre> 
  SEARCH disk/CHAR=(NOMOVE,DIR,MATCH=OR)  
</pre> 

<p> 
<h3>/CREATED=option(,option)</h3> 
The /CREATED qualifier is used to search files  
depending on their creation date. The options are :  

<ul> 
  <li>/CREATED=BEFORE=date  
  <li>/CREATED=SINCE=date  
</ul> 

<p> 
These 2 options can be used to get files which have a  
creation date before or after a specific date. The  
BEFORE and SINCE option can be combined in one command.  
<h3>/EXCLUDE=(file1,file2...)</h3> 
This qualifier is used to exclude files from the  
search. You can use wildcard filenames ; you can also  
specifiy a list of files.  
<h3>/EXPIRED=option(,option)</h3> 
The /EXPIRED qualifier is used to search files  
depending on their expiration date. The options are :  

<ul> 
  <li>/EXPIRED=BEFORE=date  
  <li>/EXPIRED=SINCE=date  
  <li>/EXPIRED=NONE  
</ul> 

<p> 
The NONE option gives files which don't have a  
expiration date recorded.The other 2 options can be  
used to get files which have a expiration date before  
or after a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option  
can be combined in one command.  
<h3>/FID=file-id</h3> 
The /FID qualifier is a special function of SEARCH.  It  
directs SEARCH to go directly to the specified file  
without processing the rest of the Index file.  
Therefore, you cannot combine this qualifierwith other  
search qualifiers such as /FILE. Normally a file-id  
consists is in the form (x,y,z) where x is the number  
of the file header within INDEXF.SYS y is the sequence  
number, and z is the Relative Volume Number. You only  
need to specifiy the x value in the /FID qualifier.  
<h3>/FILE=(file1,file2...)</h3> 
This qualifier is used to search for files with a  
specific file name.You can use wildcard file  names;  
also you can specify a list of files.  
<h3>/FORMAT=format-string</h3> 
Create an output file in a format described by the format string.  
The string must contain the !AS directive (this must be uppercase).  
At the !AS location the resultant filename will be filled in.  
The /OUTPUT qualifier is required.  
<h3>/FRAGMENT(=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr))</h3> 
This qualifier displays the number of fragments and file headers of  
each  
file found. You can further limit the files found by  
using the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM= options. For example:  

<a name="bottom_001"></a>
