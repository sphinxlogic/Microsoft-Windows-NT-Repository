            This program is a flight simulator. It puts more emphasis on
            the dynamics than on the cosmetics: just wire-frame. It  can
            run on any machine but a 386DX is the minimum for any decent
            performance. A fast video controller is a boon as  the  pro-
            gram,  when  running  on a 386DX/40Mhz, spends 70-80% of its
            time pushing pixels. On non-intel machines you can  try  and
            see if it is fast enough...
            The  program  was  written  for  fun.  I borrowed ideas from
            everywhere and hope to hear some more. The basic  design  is
            based  on  a  program  I wrote more than 20 years ago at uni
            (the Technion). I had an excellent coach (Danny Cohen) and I
            still have fond memories of those times. But now my computer
            has more than 24Kbytes of memory! so Fly8 is  written  in  C
            (Fly8  was the name of the last version of the original pro-
            gram dated 12-JAN-1974, it was written in PDP15  assembly  -
            macro15 - for a VT15 graphics processor).
            The actual purpose of the program was to give me an opportu-
            nity to experiment with various aspects  of  flight  simula-
            tion, but mostly with (1) the HUD symbology (or, more gener-
            aly, with man-machine interaction) and (2) the  studying  of
            basic  aerodynamics (as well as general real time simulation
            techniques). This explains why there are so many HUD options
            and  such a proliferation of flight dynamics models, as well
            as why the simulation parameters are user definable as input
            files at run time. Of course, the experimental nature of the
            program means that it must be distributed in source form.
            On the  PC  the  basic  screen  drawing  uses  the  standard
            Microsoft  graphics library. It is OK but not very fast; the
            main advantage is that it will support most video  adapters.
            The  fast  graphics  driver was built from the routines from
            DJGPP with much personal additions. The flight dynamics  was
            influenced  by  an SGI program I saw and ACM. The timer rou-
            tines come from a microsoft journal article, the  user-input
            routine (notice how you can use arrow keys etc? use up-arrow
            to retrieve history.. I will document it one day) comes from
            DDJ (or was it CUJ? author name is Bob Bybee). Well, I avoid
            re-inventing wheels unless it is fun. The  program  compiles

            with Microsoft C, Borland C, gcc on a friends Amiga, Sun and
            Linux and I hope on other platforms; it  is  written  to  be
            portable.  It runs under MSDOS, MSWindows, Amiga and unix/X-
            Windows.
            What? what? WHAT? you want to see some action? OK. just skip
            to the next chapter then come back.
            The full set of commands is detailed in the 'commands' chap-
            ter. Here we will look at the program areas in general.
            There are two rather distinct kinds  of  commands  that  one
            uses:  commands  that drive (fly) the game and commands that
            configure, set options and so on (which are used  with  less
            urgency).  It  was  attempted  to get the important commands
            into the keyboard (a one keystroke command) while the others
            go  into  the  main menu system (accessed with the Esc key).
            Some of the urgent commands may bring up a  menu  which  you
            may ignore if you know the keystokes.
            The  urgent commands will control the vehicle flight and the
            other subsystems (radar, HUD, HDD, weapons etc.).  You  will
            notice  early that the program lacks the traditional instru-
            ment panel: it is intended to be driven  from  the  HUD  and
            other digital displays.
            The vehicle is also driven by a pointing device (a mouse or,
            preferably, a joystick). It will run off the keypad when you
            have  no such device.  The pointer is used only for steering
            control although the buttons  can  be  mapped  to  auxiliary
            functions (by default both 'fire').
            The  display area is typicaly divided into the main view and
            a number of secondary Head Down Displays (HDD).  The  design
            has  a dozen or so on board instruments that generate visual
            data; you select which ones should  be  displayed  on  which
            HDD.  The main view is what you see through the cockpit. The
            HUD can be overlaid onto this view (as is the  case  with  a
            real  plane).  Other  data may also be shown here for conve-
            nience.
            One other instrument is designated as an alternate main view
            (use  the 'v' command to see it). The 'windows' menu handles
            the screen format and configuration.
            The program generates various messages  as  it  goes  along,
            these  will  appear at the bottom of the main view and stack
            up. Each message has a time-out for deletion but you can use
            'c'  to  clear the lot. When the program needs user input it
            will open a prompt line at the very bottom of the main  view
            (in  magenta  color)  where your data will show. You can use
            the normal editing keys while entering data here -  previous
            entries  are  accessible with the up/down arrows. See 'input
            line editing' later.
            You may find some of the commands/options  strange  (if  not
            outright  insane);  this  will  be  related  to  my taste or
            (mostly) to much history and quick fixing that did not  com-
            pletely  settle  yet.  I have looked at other programs (like
            F3, JF2, ACM and SGI f.s.) but this was after the first ver-
            sion of this program was finished, so some good ideas missed
            the bus this time. In the future I hope to polish  the  user
            interface  (especialy  after  other people get to use it and
            express an opinion).

            Being as the program is still evolving you  will  find  some
            areas less complete than others. I hope that there is enough
            of it to make it useful. I expect to see  contributions  (of
            ideas  and  code)  from  other  people;  I  will continue to
            develop the program (at least for a while) and would like to
            see it take it's own path in life [heavy stuff :-)].



            22..  QQuuiicckk ssttaarrtt
            In  this  chapter the symbol '@' is used to denote the Enter
            key. This will give you a quick feel for what the program is
            like.  With the program installed, type
                 ffllyy --zz55
            This  starts  the program in a demo setting and is useful to
            see if all is OK and also great as a screen blanker :-)
            If the fly.ini options are correct then your plane will take
            off  and  start  looking  for action. Some messages are dis-
            played during startup - these will disappear after  a  short
            while.  The  screen will show a simple view of the runway, a
            ground grid (in gray) and an overlaid HUD.
            If there is no picture, try hitting 'Enter'. Then try  'Esc'
            'x'  'y'.  If  no  luck then reboot (I guess). Now check the
            fly.log file which may have an error message in it.  It  was
            found  that  with  some  accelerator cards the program hangs
            (don't know why, I use the MicroSoft C graphics library  and
            most  advanced cards should emulate VGA). Try installing the
            correct video VESA bios.
            Do not run this program in a  dos  window  of  MSWindows  or
            OS/2,  use  the MSWindows version for MSWindows (although it
            probably will work fine, there is a chance of  locking  your
            machine up by not doing so).
            The scene will include you and 5 other planes (drones). Your
            auto-pilot will track and shoot the drones. As they are shot
            down,  new  ones  take  off.  To  take control back from the
            autopilot hit Shift-C. Now use  the  joystick  (or  whatever
            input device you choose) to fly the plane. One mouse or joy-
            stick button shoots (same as F1). When the target is in  the
            correct  position  the autopilot will shoot (unless you tell
            it not to with 'k'). The idea is to fly your plane  so  that
            the  target  is inside the aiming reticle (the small circle)
            and then shoot. A SHOOT cue will flash when your aim is cor-
            rect.
            You  may  want  to know the current settings (like throttle,
            flaps   etc.)    Turn   on   the   'misc'    display    (Esc
            hud/options-2/misc).  The  'Esc' key activates the menu sys-
            tem. most selections can be used as a short sequence of  the
            associated letters; the last sequence can be entered as Esc-
            u-2-m-Esc. The hud menu is also directly  available  as  the
            'u' command.
            This  how  you  fly  the plane: moving the joystick sideways
            will start the plane rolling. The further you move the stick
            the faster the roll. Once you center the stick the roll will
            stop. In order to fly level you  need  to  roll  either  way
            untill you are level and then center the stick.

                                       _P_a_g_e _4



            Moving  the  stick  away  from you will puch the nose of the
            plane DOWN, pulling the stick back will pull  the  nose  up.
            When  the  stick  is  centered  the plane will maintain it's
            climb angle.
            So far we roll and pitch but we did not yet turn.  In  order
            to turn one needs to use both controls. To turn right, first
            roll to the right, then pull the plane 'up'; at  this  point
            'up' is actualy 'right'. Remember that the joystick controls
            the plane relative to itself (the pilot if you wish) and NOT
            relative  to  the ground. Once you turn in the desired dirc-
            tion you can roll left to resume level  flight  in  the  new
            heading.
            Because  the plane has weight, if you roll and start turning
            the plane will also start falling down (the wings no  longer
            support  the  full  weight of the plane) so a realistic turn
            will call for a moderate roll and not a full 90 degrees. The
            harder you will pull the stick, the faster you will turn and
            the larger roll you should execute to maintain level  during
            the turn.
            You  probably  do  not want more instructions at this 'quick
            start' section, not to mention that I never  flown  a  plane
            and  am not qualified for much in the way of flight instruc-
            tion. Any volunteers for writing a flight manual chapter.
            Knowing how to fly the plane is not enough, you also need to
            know  how  to  partcipate  in  the game (fight). Actualy, in
            order to start winning you will need to be able to fly with-
            out  thinking,  you  will  need your logic powers to control
            your situation and plan your moves.   Your  strategy  is  to
            avoid  being hit and try and kill all enemy planes. There it
            is, as simple as can be. I wonder why people fill books with
            chat about Basic Flight and Air Combat Maneuvering :-)
            Now  a  quick look at controlling other equipment. For take-
            off, release the wheel brakes (b) and set full throttle  (1)
            or  even  light the afterburner (a few hits on the '.' key).
            You may want to set the flaps (a few ']',  then  reset  with
            '[') but it is not necessary. At a speed of 150-200 pull the
            nose up gently (not more than 10-15 degrees)  and  wait  for
            takeoff.  After you gain some high (but rather soon) retract
            the landing gear (g). There you are in the air. Do not try a
            sharp  turn  too  soon as you may loose altitude and hit the
            ground, unless you are exoerienced with this sort of  thing.
            To  land,  reduce  speed and approach the runway as a steady
            descent. Just before touchdown reduce  the  descent  to  the
            bare  minimum (don't forget to lower the landing gear (g) in
            time but not too early).  Once  on  the  ground  engage  the
            speed-brakes (+) and reverse (just hit 3 until you have -100
            power showing). When your speed is  low  enough  engage  the
            wheel  brakes  (b) and towards the end idle your engines (0)
            and release the speed brakes (+). Once you are stationary on
            the  ground  with the engine idle your fuel will start to be
            replaced and finally your wepons will be replaced  and  your
            damage will be reset.
            When flying, use 'r' to switch the radar on and off, use 'w'
            to select your weapon and use 'v' to switch to a map view of
            the  world (with you at the center) and back to normal view.

            This should do you for starters.
            While we are here, do 'Esc' 'i' 'Enter'. Some  numbers  will
            show  at  the top of the screen. The first is the total time
            (in milliseconds) for one frame, the second  is  the  video-
            drawing time. If the total time goes over 100 often then you
            should buy a faster machine (actually, if it is  the  second
            numbers  that dominates, a faster video card may be a better
            investment). If it stays under 60-70 then all is fine.
            On MSDOS, if you have a TsengLab ET4000 based card then  try
            running
                 ffllyy ddvvggrrffaasstt::eett44kk VVggrreett44kk mm880000xx660000xx225566 zz55
            and if it works you will notice the speedup. Other cards are
            supported but only the ET4000 and S3 got any testing. Follow
            the instructions in the readme for other cards. The standard
            Microsoft  library  does  not  do  double  buffering   above
            640x350x16  (even  in  C8);  don't  know why - the memory is
            there. You may wish to edit the  file  'fly.ini'  with  your
            preferred  setup  so that you will not need to specify it in
            the future.

            To exit hit 'Esc' 'x' and 'y'.

            On most environments all you need to do is unpack  the  dis-
            tribution  archive  into your prefered directory and you are
            set. Refer to the README file for specific instructions, you
            will  peobably want to enable support for your graphics card
            (on MSDOS).

            Fly8 commands are one keystroke each but  some  expect  some
            data  or options to follow, which may bring up a prompt or a
            menu.
            Some commands are used only when the 'keypad' is selected as
            the  pointing  device for flying. Otherwise the commands are
            grouped here by their physical location and organized alpha-
            betically.
            The  program  usually  runs  with  the NumLock engaged which
            means that the keypad keys duplicate the digits 0 through  9
            and the period '.'.
            There  is  no  current facility to redefine the usage of the
            keys but the keyboard macros can be of use here.  See  under
            F7/F8.

                      turned off) then the plane will wander around  the
                      airport  perimeter.  If  there  are ground targets
                      then these will  be  chased  and  the  plane  will
                      crash!  This mode is activated by the command line
                      option '-z'. If the  kill-mode  is  enabled  ('k')
                      then the auto-pilot will fire at the target.

                      zoom keys), or you can jump to the  landing  phase
                      with  this  command. If you land before your plane
                      crashes then you will have to wait (a WAIT  notice
                      will be shown).

                      the real thing... in this mode all visible targets
                      are identified even when outside of the HUD  area.
                      You need to have HUD data mode enabled to get info
                      about the targets.
            j         Radar sees only real pilots (ignores drones) (tog-
                      gle).  The  program can generate drones for target
                      practice. If you want the radar  to  ignore  these
                      and  only  show  (and select) real planes then use
                      this command.  There are other  pilots  only  when
                      you are networked.

                      selected weapon will be fired at this  point.  The
                      radar  must  be  active  with a locked target (you
                      should see a piper).
            l         Lock target (toggle) The radar can operate in  two
                      modes,  either  it  continuously  selects a target
                      according to  the  designated  target  acquisition
                      mode or it stays locked on the current one. In the
                      locked mode, the first  selected  target  will  be
                      locked on and no more searching will be done. When
                      not locked the target designator will be shown  as
                      a  broken  box.  You  can  use the un-lock command
                      (usually attached to one of the buttons and to the
                      space-bar)  to  release  the  current  target  and
                      acquire a new one.

                      is  presented.  Hit  Enter  to  abort or select an
                      object. The selection 'c' will return you to  your
                      controlled  plane.  'l' will select your target as
                      the view object (if there is  a  target).  In  the
                      list,  piloted  planes  have a 'c' and your target
                      has an 'l'. Note that you cannot use this  command
                      if  networking is active. Also as objects come and
                      go, by  the  time  you  select  an  object  (by  a
                      sequence  number in the list) it may have moved up
                      the list - you end up with the wrong  object.  The

            A menu has a list of options, each associated with a key and
            a function.  To select a function use the  Up/Dn  arrows  to
            highlight  it  and  then Enter, or directly press the corre-
            sponding key. When on the up-front, the  associated  letters
            are  NOT  shown but are recognized; use the F-keys to select
            left column functions and AltF-keys for  the  right  column.
            See under HDD later.
            Menus  can  be nested, in which case the previous selections
            are listed first (in a  staggered  fasion  and  highlighted)
            followed  by  the current menu. The selected option is high-
            lighted (white) while the others are displayed in gray.
            The Esc key brings up the top menu  but  later  is  used  to
            abort a menu.  During menu navigation use these keys:
            Esc                 aborts the menu
            Enter               accept the current selection option
            UpArrow             select previous option
            DnArrow             select next option
            other               select the corresponding option
            If  a  command  is  invalid (top/bottom of list or undefined
            option) then a beep is emited and the keystroke is  ignored.
            The  menu system is changing rapidly so the following may be
            incomplete.
            Some other commands may pop up a  menu,  in  which  case  it
            behaves  in a similar way.  If you have the up-front instru-
            ment active then the menus will appear on it rather than  on

            the  main menu. This is a stupid attempt to make your inter-
            action look similar to what happens in a modern fighter.  It
            is  often the case that the pilot has a panel which can dis-
            play about 10 alpha-numeric words in bright white  (daylight
            readable).  These  will  usually use special LEDs and a more
            elaborate font than the 7-seg digits (9 segment?). There are
            pushbuttons  beside  these  words. The words are arranged in
            two columns, each with 5 words, with 5 buttons on the  right
            and  5 on the left. As you press a button new information is
            displayed.  Other planes use a real CRT but still  have  the
            5-buttons  arrangement  (mostly  on all four sides, totaling
            20).  In Fly8 the up-front device has two columns of  words,
            each  column  can show 10 words, each word can be 10 charac-
            ters long. There are 10 buttons on the left (F1 through F10)
            and  10 on the right (AltF1 through AltF10).  Use these keys
            to make selections. You can still  use  the  normal  command
            letters  (if  you know them, as they are not displayed here)
            as well as move about with the Up/Down keys:  a  small  dash
            between the key number and the text identifies the currently
            selected option.

            Various objects can be created with this menu. These objects
            are used as targets.
            Emit.target    create one random target
            del            delete all targets
            Emit.gtarget   create one random ground target
            del            delete all ground targets
            Emit.box       create one random box. Boxes are  cubes  that
                           hop around which can be shot down.
            del            delete all boxes
            Emit.del tgts  delete all targets, ground targets and boxes.
            Emit.drone     create one random plane (drone)
            del            delete all drones. This  will  also  set  the
                           number of automatic drones to zero.
            Emit.drones    specify  how  many drones should be automati-
                           cally maintained in the air.  Whenever one is
                           lost another one takes off.
            Emit.killers   specify  how  many  of  the  drones should be
                           killers. These will be set to Chase and  Kill
                           mode.

            Various aspects of the HUD can be set. Each option is either
            set, reset or toggled. The default is to toggle  the  option
            but  the  first  three menu items can be used to change this
            mode. This menu can be accessed from the main menu  as  well
            as  directly  with  the 'u' command. The following selection
            appear on some of the sub-menus:
            0 turn off          turn option off
            1 turn on           turn option  on
            2 toggle            toggle option on/off
            This top level menu will bring  up  a  number  of  sub-menus
            which are described further down this doco.
            HUD.off             turn  the  HUD off. When turned off, the
                                radar symbols will still show.  This  is
                                a  feature of the game which is not like
                                the real thing; it allows  you  to  play
                                with  a  very  clean view. Not only will
                                the radar  stuff  still  show,  but  the

                                symbols  will now move freely across the
                                full screen rather than  being  confined
                                to the HUD area. To get rid of the reti-
                                cle/TDB use the 'parts' menu.
            HUD.on              turn the HUD on
            HUD.type            Select HUD style.  Although  the  styles
                                are named after planes, each plane actu-
                                aly displays many  styles  depending  on
                                the mode of operation.
            HUD.parts           The  HUD  has many components. This sub-
                                menu allows  you  to  choose  which  are
                                included in the HUD display. Selecting a
                                HUD type will automatically adjust these
                                to what is appropriate for that style.
            HUD.options 1       This (and the next) selection allows you
                                to set some parameters which modify  the
                                appearance  of  the  HUD. The most often
                                used ones are in this sub-menu  and  the
                                rest are in the next.
            HUD.options 2       See description of "options 1" above.
            HUD.radar           This  will configure the radar symbology
                                on the HUD.
            HUD.ils             Will let you select the ILS  beacon.  In
                                the future there should be a more elabo-
                                rate NAV facility instead.

            Fly8 supports a number of HUD styles. The name  of  the  hud
            does not necessarily correspond with the plane type but this
            is what I found on the various videos that I saw. If anybody
            has  more  knowledge or can provide other detail PLEASE feel
            free to advice me.
            HUD.type.Classic This one I made up before seeing  any  real
                           HUD. The basic data is laid close to the edge
                           and  leaved  most  of  the  area  free   from
                           obstruction.  My original aiming reticule was
                           8 dots in a circle but I discontinued  it  in
                           favour  or  the  more common piper style. The
                           numerals on the pitch ladder  do  not  rotate
                           and  the fast font is used. On a slow machine
                           this hud (especially in low detail) will per-
                           form much faster that any other.
            HUD.type.FA18  This  HUD does not use tapes for the altitude
                           and speed. The pitch ladder is narrower  than
                           usual  and slanted toward the horizon. A good
                           feature is the fact  that  the  pitch  ladder
                           stays  always in view: if the velocity vector
                           goes off the screen (easily done on the FA-18
                           which has no trouble flying at high AOAs) the
                           pitch ladder adopts (temporarily) the  water-
                           line  mark.  Another  feature  is the closure
                           speed which is shown under the  piper  rather
                           than  on a radar ranging scale. Optionally, a
                           pendulum (or what do you  call  it?)  can  be

                           displayed  which  shows  you  your roll angle
                           with good resolution up to 45 Degrees  either
                           way.  This  is  a wide angle hud - 20 degrees
                           side to side.
            HUD.type.F16   This HUD uses simple  scales  (no  baseline).
                           The heading scale can be at the top or at the
                           bottom.
            HUD.type.F15   This HUD is probably used for air to  air  on
                           other planes. The speed scale is upside-down.
                           The heading scale can be set to two different
                           positioned at the top.

            The  various  HUD  symbols  can be individually selected for
            display.
            HUD.parts.ladder Select pitch ladder (and related)  options.
            HUD.parts.altitude Show altitude scale (or box).
            HUD.parts.speed Show speed scale (or box).
            HUD.parts.heading Show heading scale.
            HUD.parts.gnd ptr Only  for  the FA18 style, show the pendu-
                           lum.
            HUD.parts.border Show the HUD border (in gray color).
            HUD.parts.vv   Show the plane's velocity vector. A must  for
                           accurate flying.
            HUD.parts.vw   This  activates  a  mode  that the FA18 uses:
                           when the vv goes off screen, a waterline mark
                           will  appear  and  the  pitch  ladder will be
                           drawn around it.  This way the  ladder  never
                           goes  completely  off screen (which can often
                           happen when flying at high AOAs).
            HUD.parts.plus Show a 'plus'  sign  at  the  center  of  the
                           screen.
            HUD.parts.pointer Show  a  small  (red) mark that tracks the
                           joystick  (or  mouse  or  whatever   pointing
                           device you  use).
            HUD.parts.beta Show the sideslip angle (beta) on FA18 style.
            HUD.parts.Xbreak Show the Xbreak symbol if at risk  of  hit-
                           ting the ground.
            HUD.parts.Xgrid Show  the warning grid if at risk of hitting
                           the ground. This is a  red  grid  which  will
                           overlay the ground if you fly too low.

            These options modify some aspects of the HUD appearance.
            HUD.options1.heading The  heading  scale  shows  the  planes
                           heading. The numbers  displayed  are  in  the
                           range  000-350  in  increments  of  10.  This
                           option selects between  showing  the  full  3
                           digits  of  using  an  abbreviated  form. The
                           abbreviated form will only show the  top  two
                           digits  (09 for 90 and 27 for 270). The Clas-
                           sic HUD style will show the full  number  but
                           without the leading zeros.

                                       _P_a_g_e _1_8



            .HUD.options1.knots Internally all data is stored in meters.
                           This option requests  that  all  numbers  use
                           knots/feet  (as  appropriate)  instead. It is
                           the default for the standard HUDs.
            HUD.options1.top This will further modify the heading scale.
                           The scale will show at the top or at the bot-
                           tom depending on this option.  For  the  FA18
                           HUD style, this option will cause a base-line
                           to be drawn under the scale (the  scale  will
                           stay at the top regardless).
            HUD.options1.fine For  some  of  the scales this option will
                           show more detail. The standard detail  is  to
                           show  a  tick  every 5 units. The fine detail
                           will show a tick every two units.
            HUD.options1.xfine This is a further refinement of the above
                           'fine'  level  and  will show a tick for each
                           scale unit.
            HUD.options1.big [obsolete]The  name  is  completely  wrong.
                           This option defines the style of the ticks on
                           the scales (for some of the HUDs  only).  The
                           usual  way  is  to have the ticks go from the
                           base-line to the outside. In the 'big'  style
                           the  scale  will  be  along the edge with the
                           ticks towards the inside.
            HUD.options1.scale This defines the number  of  units  along
                           the scale. This affects only the Classic HUD.
                           The more units, the longer the scales.
            HUD.options1.area The HUD has  a  fixed  area  (measured  in
                           field-of-view  degrees).  You  can alter this
                           size. Note that although the HUD size changes
                           when you zoom in/out, it still keeps the same
                           FOV. This option defines how many degrees are
                           from  the  center to the edge of the HUD (all
                           HUDs are square).

            These options modify some aspects  of  the  HUD  appearance.
            These are the less used options.
            HUD.options2.a alarm Enable  aural  alarms.  If you hate the
                           GLIMIT beeps etc. then  use  this  option  to
                           turn these alarms off.
            HUD.options2.v alarm This  will  Enable/disable  the  visual
                           alarms that show on the HUD.
            HUD.options2.panel Request to show the panel HDD on the main
                           window.  This  will  show at the bottom right
                           side as digital  flight  data  (and  as  some
                           indicators at the top left).
            HUD.options2.font Select  the font for the stroke characters
                           used on the screen
            HUD.options2.fontsize Select the stroke font size. A size of
                           8 means 'use the default' and all other sizes

            The  radar  symbology  on  the  HUD is controlled with these
            options.
            HUD.radar.corner Radar target data can be at the bottom-left
                           corner  of  the  HUD or can follow the target
                           designator.
            HUD.radar.data Request to show target data.
            HUD.radar.distance Request to show target distance in  intel
                           mode (mainly used in the radar/map modes).
            HUD.radar.name Request  to  show  target  type in intel mode
                           (mainly used in the radar/map modes).
            HUD.radar.accvect Show target acceleration vector as a  hand
                           inside the reticle piper.
            HUD.radar.reticle Show aiming reticle piper.
            HUD.radar.target Show the target designator.
            HUD.radar.ross Use  Ross's  method  for  the aiming reticle.
                           This mode will show a small box in  front  of
                           the  target where it is expected to be when a
                           bullet hits it. If you  aim  the  reticle  at
                           this  box  and  shoot then you should hit the
                           target.
            HUD.radar.limit Unlike real HUDs, the radar symbols  can  be
                           displayed  all  over  the  screen rather that
                           just inside the HUD area. 'limit' will  spec-
                           ify which way it should be.
            HUD.radar.thick This  is  an experimental option to draw the
                           radar reticle thicker.
            HUD.radar.hidetgt When active, if the TD box  is  under  the
                           reticle  then  it  is  not  shown.   This de-
                           clutters the area of interest.

            Some of the requests in this menu will need you to  identify
            a  player.  A  numbered list of players is displayed and you
            should select one by entering their number. If you Enter '*'
            then  you will select 'all' of them. If you give a null then
            you secl 'none'. If there is only one player then it wil  be
            selected  automatically.   A message 'no net' means that the
            program was started withou the net option (or  possibly  all
            net  connections  are  inaccessible).  A message 'no player'
            may be displayed which means that there are  no  players  in
            the  needed  status  (eg.  you try to 'quit' but you are not
            currently playing with anyone).
            Net.ping       find out who else is playing.  A  message  is
                           broadcasted  and for each responding player a
                           message is displayed.
            Net.play       join another player's game (or all players)
            Net.quit       stop playing with a player. If there are more
                           than  one  players  then you will be asked to
                           choose.
            Net.message    send a message to a player (or all). You will
                           later  be  notified how long it took the mes-
                           sage to reach each player and return a  noti-

            When  a  command  needs to receive a parameter which is more
            than one keystroke it uses a line input facility. It  allows
            you  to  use history and editing. You can use the arrow keys
            and insert/delete keys to move about and edit your response.
            The  up/down  keys  will retrieve history.  Finally you will
            need to press Enter for the program to accept the input. The
            history queue has 20 entries. If you key the start of a line
            and hit PgUp then a search will be done for a previous entry
            with the same beginning.

                           is higher then a red ground grid  is  flashed
                           to  give  the pilot better orientation (there
                           is not enough scenery to build proper  visual
                           awareness).

            This chapter explains in detail how planes  are  handled  in
            this program.
            The  plane is controlled by your pointing device, preferably
            a joystick.  The basic  controls  will  have  the  following
            effect:
            Left/right  controls  will cause the plane to roll. The roll
            will continue while the controls are engaged. When the  joy-
            stick  is  centered the rolling will stop and the plane will
            stay in the current situation. If  you  want  to  fly  level
            after rolling to the right then you will have to do the fol-
            lowing:
                 --   roll right (the horizon will roll left).
                 --   stop rolling (the horizon will  stay  at  a  fixed
                      angle).
                 --   roll left (horizon rolling back to the right).
                 --   stop rolling (when the horizon is level).
                 As  the plane has momentum, the response is not immedi-
                 ate and you will have to get a feel for it.
                 To start climbing you will pull the  stick  toward  you
                 until the climb angle is what you want and then release
                 the stick. The plane will continue climbing  until  you
                 push  the nose down for level flight. If you are rolled
                 over to one side then the pulling will cause the  plane
                 to  turn into that side. If you are upside-down and you
                 pull the stick then you will start  descending  towards
                 the  ground. In other words: the up/down controls (ele-
                 vators) are used for  any  change  of  direction,  both
                 left/right and up/down.
                 To  turn  right,  first roll right, then pull the stick
                 until the desired heading is reached, then release  the
                 elevators and roll back to level flight. Of course, due
                 to gravity and plane dynamics any change  in  situation
                 will  probably  cause  the plane to move in a direction
                 slighly different from what the controls suggest -  you

                 should  learn  to compensate for this. The flight-path-
                 marker (the little circle with three wings)  tells  you
                 where  the plane is heading and this is hardly ever the
                 direction where your plane is pointed at.
                 To control your engine you set the  throttle  with  the
                 9/3  keys. The throttle can be set to between -100% and
                 100%. Reverse setting only works on  the  ground.  Each
                 keystroke is 5% change. The 1 key will set the throttle
                 to 100% and the 0 key to 0%. The planes speed will pick
                 up slowly (depends on the planes weight and the engines
                 power). You can engage the after-burner  with  the  '.'
                 key.  To  slow  down  you may use the speed brakes ('+'
                 key).
                 About the AfterBurner: light it with '.' (will also set
                 throttle to 100%). Then each '.' or '3' (power-up) will
                 add a notch. Each '9' (power-down) will take it down  a
                 notch.  There are five steps (say 20% each). The throt-
                 tle display will show '103' for '100% +  AB3',  105  is
                 full  AB.  The  engine display will show thrust in % of
                 mil thrust (full AB is about 150%-160%). If you use '1'
                 (max  throttle)  or  '0' (idle engine) the ab is turned
                 off. NOTE that AB5 uses about 6 times as much  fuel  as
                 MIL for 60% extra power!

                 The Classic plane is an over-simplified vehicle. It has
                 no  momentum  and  no  aerodynamics characteristics, it
                 goes where you point it and is a good way  to  get  the
                 hang  of  the controls. It will never crash either (you
                 can fly underground of course). But don't get too  used
                 to  it,  the  real  planes handle very differently (the
                 Classic is more  like  a  weightless  spaceship  of  an
                 arcade-game).

            The program displays a number of HUD styles. These are named
            according to a plane type but this is just because  I  first
            saw  this  HUD  on  a video tape dedicated to that plane. In
            reality each plane has a number of HUD modes. You can change
            the  HUD  style through the hud menu regardless of the plane
            type.
            The HUD is a piece of glass that is positioned at  an  angle
            in front of the pilot. The pilot looks through it to see the
            front view from the cockpit and at the same time  a  reflec-
            tion  of  a  video screen is seen (this CRT is in the 'dash-
            board' facing up). The dual-image is  similar  to  when  one
            looks  outside  through a window at night and sees a reflec-
            tion of some part of the room as well as  the  outside.  The
            HUD  can be displayed by itself on one of the auxiliary HDDs
            (sometimes refered to as the 'HUD repeater'), which is  use-
            ful when the HUD optics is not operational (damaged).
            In  practice,  the  HUD  is a flat image superimposed on the
            front view, and it uses a special (usually green but you can

            change  this)  color.  It  does not cover the full field-of-
            view.
            The image projected onto  the  HUD  contains  two  kinds  of
            information.  One type is data that the pilot will otherwise
            have to look for in some cockpit  instruments  (thus  taking
            his  eye  off  the  outside  scene); this is simply a way of
            putting the most  important  information  if  front  of  the
            pilot.  An  example is the display of plane speed. The other
            kind is information directly related to  the  outside  image
            and  meaningfull  only  in  relation  to  it, for example: a
            bounding box is displayed such that it coincides with a vis-
            ible target that the radar is locked on.
            The  prominent  features  on  the HUD are a number of scales
            which are usually diaplayed along the  edge.  Sometimes  the
            detail  of  the  scales  can  be  controlled in three levels
            through the Hud menu (see there).
            The HUD symbols will relate to flight data or  to  auxiliary
            systems (weapons, radar, fuel etc.). The data related to the
            flying of the plane is described first.

            Your compass. It will be shown as a  horizontal  ruler  that
            moves  as  you  turn.  The  current heading is marked with a
            'tick' or a 'V'. It can be at the top or at  the  bottom  of
            the  HUD  (Top  option  in Hud menu). North is 360, South is
            180, East is 90 and West 270. Some modes  do  not  show  the
            trailing  zero (270 is shown as 27) and NO, there is no sup-
            port for radians or other units...

            Your height above sea level, a vertical ruler at  the  right
            edge  of  the  HUD.  It  may  be accompanied by a second bar
            (immediately to its left) that shows your  climb/fall  rate.
            This ruler moves up and down as the plane moves, the current
            altitude is to be read at the 'tick'  in  its  middle.  High
            altitudes  show in thousands (with a possible decimal point)
            while low ones will show exact. The FA-18  style  HUD  shows
            the  altitude in a box at the right side of the HUD with the
            climb rate above it. Some HUDs will show a radar-range scale
            adjacent  to  (and  to the left of) the altitude scale. This
            will indicate the distance to the  target  (the  full  scale
            range  is  shown  just  above  this scale) as a sliding tick
            while the target closure speed is shown inside the tick.
            Climb rate is in meters (or feet) per minute!


            1100..33  SSppeeeedd
            Your speed is shown as a ruler at the left edge of the  HUD,
            a tick marks the current value. The FA-18 style HUD shows it
            in the left box. Some HUDs do not  show  the  trailing  zero
            while others show have the scale run from top to bottom.
            This information may be in meters/kmh of feet/knots (use the
            Hud Knots  command  to  toggle).  The  F16/FA18  default  to

            The  orientation of the plane is displayed as a ladder, each
            step relates to a different pitch. The steps are always par-
            allel  to  the  horizon.  Each  step is marked with a number
            which is your pitch angle (90 degrees is straight up, -90 is
            down  and  zero  is  level).  The step's angle represent the
            planes roll. When you are upside-down the steps are too,  as
            you  roll  the  steps turn in the opposite way to follow the
            horizon. The negative-pitch steps (when you are going  down)
            are dashed while the positive ones are solid. Small winglets
            at the tips of the steps point toward the ground. The  zero-
            pitch  step  is  larger and is your artifical horizon if you
            cannot see the real one. The FA-18 style  HUD  tries  a  bit
            harder  by  bending  the steps toward the ground: the higher
            your pitch the larger the slant. It also shows a small  cir-
            cle  at  the straight up/down directions (the down one has a
            cross through it).
            Although the pitch ladder follows the horizon  (meaning  the
            zero-step  is on the horizon) there is some freedom in where
            on the horizon  to show it. Unless you disable the  velocity
            vector  (flight path) marker (see below), the ladder will be
            centered on it. This means that at a high  angle  of  attack
            the pitch ladder may be out of view (as will the vv).
            In  the  case of the FA18, if the vv goes out of view then a
            waterline marker will appear at the center of the HUD (it is
            a  W  marker  in a fixed position) and the ladder will shift
            (smoothly) toward it. Once the vv is back in view the ladder
            will return to it and the waterline mark will disappear (the
            transitions take about two seconds maximum). The FA18 ladder
            shows  an  extra-long  zero-step  while  the landing gear is
            down.

            A plane rarely moves straight ahead due to gravity and aero-
            dynamic  forces.  This  marker  (sometimes called the 'plane
            marker') is a tiny circle with wings on either side  and  at
            the  top (it is a stylized shape of a plane from behind). At
            any time, this marker shows you where the plane is  heading.
            You will most of the time use this marker as a reference for
            flying the plane. The center of the view is  rather  useless
            for flying (you can bring up a cross-hair with the 'u+' com-
            mand) but can be  helpful  in  aiming  the  cannon  (in  the
            absence of the aiming reticle).
            The Classic plane always goes ahead, so the vv will be fixed
            at the center of the HUD. By default it will  not  be  shown
            for this plane.

            HUD).  It comes on whenever the landing gear is lowered. The
            FA-18 HUD shows it whenever the Velocity Vector  is  outside
            the HUD.

            When the radar is active, some symbols related to its opera-
            tion are displayed. The main features are the target  desig-
            nator box and the aiming reticle (the Piper).

            This is a square that is centered on the target. If the tar-
            get is not locked then the box will have only  corners.  The
            target  should  be  visible inside the box, unless it is off
            screen. When off screen, the box has a '+' through it and it
            crawls  along  the  HUD edge showing you the direction where
            the target is. If the target is actualy behind you then  the
            '+' is replaced with an 'X'.

            If  a  target  is close enough (within weapon range) then an
            aiming reticle appears.  The reticle is  a  circle  with  12
            ticks.  Each tick represent a distance of 1000 to the target
            and the range is marked with a tick  that  moves  along  the
            inside  edge  of  the  reticle. A tick at 11 o'clock means a
            distance of 11,000 etc. You should fly the plane so that the
            center  of the reticle (has a dot) is on the target and then
            shoot (actually,  the  cannon/radar  computer  will  display
            'shoot' above the reticle when you have a good aim). If this
            sounds simple it is because it is a  simple  procedure;  the
            problem  is  that  in order to get the target in the reticle
            you will NOT be flying the  plane  directly  toward  it.  In
            practice you forget about where the plane should go and play
            a game of follow-the-target with the reticle (just  try  and
            not hit the ground).
            The  F16  will  also  show  a 'hand' inside the circle which
            indicates the direction and magnitude of the target acceler-
            ation (this one is very jiterry at times). You can turn this
            hand on/off with the Hud menu "acc vect" command.
            The FA18 HUD shows the closure speed outside the lower right
            side  of the reticle. The F15/F16 shows the same information
            on the radar range scale (beside the altitude) marked with a
            large  '>'  symbol.  The closure speed measures how fast you
            are catching up (positive) with the target.
            However, in order to complicate the situation we  have  some
            variations possible:
            There  is an alternate piper: Ross's reticle. This is a dif-
            ferent aiming method altogether. A square reticle  is  shown
            with only the corners visible. It is ahead of your target at
            all times on its projected position. You  have  to  aim  the
            piper  at  the  box and then shoot. With this one you do not
            care where  the  real  target  is  because  the  aiming  box
            replaces  it.  The  piper will be fixed at the center of the

            HUD.  You may want to turn off the  target  designator  with
            'ut'.
            The target designator and aiming reticle are part of the HUD
            display, however you may choose to ignore this  and  request
            that  these  use  the  full  screen. Use the 'uL' command to
            limit these to inside the hud area or use the whole  screen.

            The radar measures the distance and relative (closure) speed
            of the target. The range is shown as an extra scale  on  the
            right  side  on  the  HUD  while  the closure speed is shown
            beside the '>' mark on it. The FA18 HUD does not  show  this
            scale  but  shows  the  closure speed under the piper with a
            'Vc' mark.

            When a target is selected, some digital information  may  be
            displayed  (it  can be disabled by the hud/radar menu). This
            data shows at the left bottom corner of the HUD and has  the
            following items:
                 --   distance to target (units or k's with one decimal)
                 --   closure speed (meters/knots)
                 --   time to meet (seconds with one decimal).
                 --   target type or pilot name
                 When the target is in range the time  shown  is  bullet
                 time-to-impact rather than plane flight time.
                 If  the  Corner  option  is not selected (uC) then this
                 data will show under the target designator box. If  the
                 target  is  too  close  to the bottom then the data may
                 show above it.
                 If you activate the Intel mode  (i)  then  all  visible
                 targets  get a box with the following data (the MAP and
                 RADAR diplays always have this mode):
                      --   distance to target (units  or  k's  with  one
                           decimal)
                      --   target type or pilot name
                      You  can  use  'un'  to disable the display of the
                      second line.

            In addition to the above features, the HUD may show the fol-
            lowing:
            The  FA18  type HUD shows as standard, on the left low edge,
            the angle of attack (aoa), the mach number and  the  pilot's
            vertical  Gs.  The  selected weapon (and available units) is
            displayed at the low center of the HUD.
            The F15/F16 HUD shows the aoa at the  top  right  above  the
            altitude  scale.  The weapon selected is shown at the top of
            the data list ('XXX' means none selected)

            The Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a  system  that  pro-
            vides enough information about your approach to guide you to
            the touchdown point with great  accuracy.  The  system  com-
            prises  two  separate  facilities:  the Localizer beam which
            tells you how well you are aligned with the runway  and  the
            Glide  Path  beam  which monitors your descent rate. The two
            components measure your approach error and display it as two
            bars.
            The  Localizer  deviation  bar is a vertical line that moves
            accross the HUD and indicates which way of the correct  line
            you  are.  If the bar is left of center then this means that
            you are to the right of the Localizer beam,  so  you  should
            correct  your approach to the left. When the bar is right of
            center you will need to move to the right too. You are  cor-
            rectly  aligned when the bar is at the center. You can judge
            the bar's position by noting the number of ticks  along  the
            horizontal  bar.  The larger middle one is where you want to
            be. The bar is at full deflection when  your  error  is  2.5
            degrees.
            The Glide Path deviation bar is a horizontal line that indi-
            cates where the correct descent line  is.  If  the  line  is
            above  center  then  the  you  should be flying higher (your
            descent is too rapid or you are descending toward a point on
            the  ground  too  short of the runway); you should gain some
            height or reduce your descent angle. In the same  way,  when
            the line is below HUD center you are above the correct path.
            The bar is at  full  deflection  when  your  error  is  0.75
            degrees.
            Note  that  the ILS system does not know where you are head-
            ing, it just tells you how close  you  are  to  the  correct
            approach path. The system does not even know if you are com-
            ing or going! So make sure that you approach the runway from
            the correct end or the ILS Localizer deviation bar will show
            reverse reading and the Glide Path will direct you  to  land
            at the far end of the runway.
            Real  ILS systems have very narrow beams and will only oper-
            ate when you are reasonably aligned. These systems will tell
            you  when  you  are  out of range. The one in Fly8 is active
            within a radius of about 25 kilometers around the runway.
            When the ILS is operating a marker along the  heading  scale
            will  direct  you  to  the  airport;  use it for the general
            approach but then identify the correct runway carefully.
            To select the desired runway use the  ILS  menu  and  choose
            from  the list.  There are now two airports (A is home and B
            is for the drones) and each has two runways: 18 (approach at
            heading 180) and 27 (approach at 270).  You can turn the ILS
            off and it will still remember the last active runway  which
            will be offered when you use the command again.

            The  radar  in  this program does NOT try to simulate a real
            radar. The real thing has many types and modes of operation.

            This one just cheats to get its data.
            When  enabled  ('r')  the radar measures distance, direction
            and speed of possible targets.
            In the basic mode, the radar constantly selects the  closest
            target.  This may cause it to 'jump' between targets as they
            change distance. You can put  the  radar  in  'locked'  mode
            ('l')  which  will  make it stick to the selected target. In
            this mode, when a target is destroyed,  the  nearest  target
            will  be  selected  and  stay locked. Use 'l' to release the
            lock (or you can turn the radar off/on with 'rr').
            There are 3 other acquisition modes controlled  by  the  'f'
            command.
            0         pick closest target (old way, as described above).
            1         3.3deg circle: boresight. Only targets inside  the
                      small circle are detected.
            2         20deg  circle:  HUD.  Any  target inside the large
                      circle (which covers most  of  the  HUD  area)  is
                      detected.
            3         5.3deg  wide  by  60deg  high:  vertical.  Targets
                      inside the narrow band (+-5.3 degrees wide but  60
                      degrees tall) are detected.
            In  modes 1-3, a target is highlighted when it is within the
            designated area. The limits of the modes 1-3  are  drawn  on
            the HUD.
            If  you  are  in  locked mode then the first detected target
            will immediately be locked, otherwise you will have  to  hit
            'l'  to  lock  the highlighted target. Only when a target is
            locked you get the aiming reticle (if it is close enough).
            It should be made clear that the 'locked' mode is  set/reset
            by  you with the 'l' command. Once engaged, there is no need
            to lock on targets because the first  one  to  qualify  will
            immediately be locked on. If you want then to select another
            target then use 'l' to release the target and then later 'l'
            to lock on the new one.
            Once  a  target  is locked, the selection markings disappear
            and the piper shows.
            A target is identified with a box around it (the target des-
            ignator).   When  the  target  is  out of view the box has a
            large '+' crossing it which changes to a large 'X' when  the
            target is actually behind you.
            If  you  issue Shift-C then the plane will chase the current
            target (there must be one or  the  plane  will  just  patrol
            round  the  runway).  Use the 'k' command to allow automatic
            firing ('k' works even when not in Chase mode, and is useful
            if  you want to practice the chase and let the auto-pilot do
            the shooting).
            When the reticle goes off-screen it gets a '+' inside it.
            You can shoot at various objects. Use the emit menu to  cre-
            ate these objects.
            When  you  hit  something it gets damaged and fragments fall
            off. When enough damage is done  the  object  is  officially
            HIT.  It  blinks  red/white  and  starts  falling toward the
            ground. Practice targets are  destroyed  immediately.  These
            fragments are lethal and can hit any other object!  Normally
            you can fly through any object EXCEPT a bullet  -  so  don't

            As others said before, playing with oneself is fun  but  you
            don't  make as many friends (they said you'll go blind too).
            The program will let you play with others using a variety of
            communication  media.  Once  networked,  objects  are shared
            between the players. The number of players is  only  limited
            by the capability of the network medium.
            Below  here, numeric parameter values can be given in C for-
            mat, i.e. if it starts with 0x it is hex, starts with  0  is
            octal, else it is decimal.
            At the bottom of the pile is the PC to PC serial connection.
            Only two players can combine in this way. You can choose two
            drivers for this:
                 --nnccoomm..NN::bbaauudd::ppaarriittyy::bbiittss::ssttoopp::xxmmooddee::iinnbbuuff::oouuttbbuuff
            Direct  control  over the com port. It can handle any speed,
            but slow machines will drop charaters if you  go  too  fast.
            Slow machines should NOT use output buffering.
            Positional parameters:
            N              com port number: 1...4
            parity         e, o or n
            bits           8
            stop           1
            xmode          xon or xoff; do not specify!
            inbuf          4000 is enough. experiment.
            outbuf         very  little  needed  if  at  all.  Very fast
                           machines will benefit from output  buffering,
                           slow  ones will choke unless the baud rate is
                           low. At 115200 most machines cannot cope with
                           output buffering.
            Other  parameters  can  follow,  the  parameter name MUST BE
            GIVEN:
            irqN           irq number (use 4/3 as usual)
            baseNNN        port hardware  address  (use  0x3f8/0x2f8  as
                           usual)
            Example:
                 --nnccoomm..22::111155220000::nn::88::11::::44000000::::iirrqq33::bbaassee00xx22ff88
            Note that no 'xmode' was given and no 'output buffering'.
            If you prefer, you can use SLIP when you have SLIP8250:
                 sslliipp88225500 00xx6655 --hh SSLLIIPP 33 00xx0022ff88 3388440000 1100000000

            This is the same as
                 ffllyy88 --rr --nnsslliipp..11
            because the driver will then be searched for.
            Slip is not too fast, you need both machines to be 386DX for
            full speed and even then it is touch and go. It does no out-
            put buffering.
            If  you  have  a  'real' network then install your favourite
            packet driver and do
                 ffllyy88 --rr --nnppkktt..11::00xx6655
            In this mode you can have as many players as you  wish.  The

            program  talks  packet level. It uses packet type 0x5a5a. In
            the future there may be support for IP level  or  more  (but
            not soon).
            OK,  you  started  the  program  with  networking. It really
            enjoys it but then it is a computer. You want  to  enjoy  it
            too.  Here  is  how.  The Net menu has a set of commands for
            managing your connections with other players.
            P         This is a broadcast ping to all players. All other
                      programs  will  respond with their identification.
                      Now you know who is active on the net. How do  you
                      tell  who's who? the parameter -Nxxx supplies your
                      handle (nickname, etc.) and you will be  known  by
                      it in this game.
            Y         Request  to  play with another player. If there is
                      only one then the program will go ahead and estab-
                      lish connection. Otherwise you will be prompted to
                      select a player from a list. To have  the  program
                      know  who  is  playing  you should have used the P
                      command first.
            Q         Quit playing. If there are more players  then  you
                      will  get a list to choose from. An empty response
                      will assume you want to quit all players.
            M         Send a message to a player.  Right  now,  an  echo
                      message  will also be sent and the turnaround trip
                      time (in milliseconds) will be shown. This time is
                      end-to-end including program delay.
            When  you  exit  the  program it will automatically quit all
            players and notify the net of your exit.
            If long delays are observed then a player may  be  automati-
            cally  timed out. You will see messages about this. Use Y to
            re-establish contact.  Proper use of Q and Y  will  let  you
            pop  out of sight in danger and re-join in a more favourable
            position...
                 IMPORTANT NOTE: the comms at this point is one-on-
                 one.  If  you  connect to three other players then
                 they all show in your world and you show in  their
                 but  they  do  not  know of each other unless they
                 establish connections too. If a  group  plays  and
                 each  one  joins  with  a global 'Y' then everyone
                 will know about everyone else.
            There  is  a  need  for  proper   'game'   management   (co-
            ordination),  now  completely  lacking. Once on the net, you
            can accept/decline a player and you can quit a player  ('Q')
            that  you  do  not  wish  to play with. See the net menu for
            details.

            The program accepts options at start up from three  sources,
            in order:
            Init file
                      A  file (by default 'fly.ini') is read which has a
                      list of options. Each  option  is  on  a  separate
                      line.  A  hash  '#' starts a comment line, a blank

                      delimits  the  line  (but   leading   blanks   are
                      skipped).  The file is searched for in the current
                      directory, then in your home directory (using  the
                      HOME  variable)  then in each directory along your
                      PATH.  You can explicitly nominate a file  as  the
                      first  parameter  on  the  command  line (the only
                      parameter accepted without a preceding hyphen).
            FLY8 environment variable
                      This variable, if defined, is a list of  semicolon
                      separated options.
            Command line
                      Finally  the  command  line  options are accepted,
                      each must be preceded by a hyphen.
            All options can be defined in all sources. The command  line

            The options are as follows:
            IIniFile       Specifies  the  name  of  an  init  file. The
                           default is 'fly.ini'. The  file  is  searched
                           for  in  the  current  directory, then in the
                           home dir (uses HOME env. var.) then the  PATH
                           directories  are checked. Only the first file
                           found is used. This option can only  be  used
                           on the command line.
            LLogFile       name  of log file. Default is 'fly.log'. This
                           option can only be used the command line.
            MMacroFile
                           name of keyboard macros file.  This  file  is
                           read  at  program  startup and written during
                           shutdown. default is 'fly.max/fly.mac']
            XNavFile
                           name  of  the  nav  data  file.  Default   is
                           fly.nav.
            YLandFile

            fly.ini
                           This  file serves as an extension to the com-
                           mand line options.  The  command-line  option
                           -I can set a user selected file name.
            fly.log
                           This  file  logs the activity of the program,
                           problem messages and final  stats.  The  com-
                           mand-line  option  -L can set a user selected
                           file name.
            fly.mac
                           This file is  read  at  program  startup  and
                           written  at program shutdown.  It is the list
                           of keyboard macros. Use the 'mac2max' program
                           to  list  the  contents  of this file. At the
                           moment there is no macro editor so you should
                           use the redefine-macro for updating. The com-
                           mand-line option -M can set a  user  selected
                           file  name.  It  is  easier  to  maintain the
                           fly.max (see  later)  manually,  the  fly.mac
                           file may be removed in the future.
            fly.max
                           This  is  a  text file which defines the key-
                           board macros. If  present  then  it  is  read
                           instead  of  the  fly.mac  file.  However, on
                           exit, it is NOT overwritten but  the  fly.mac
                           IS.  Use  the  program mac2max to convert the
                           fly.mac file to a text format.
            fly.nav
                           Lists the navigation waypoints which have ILS
                           beacons.  Should  really  be  merged with the
                           landscape file. Maybe one day. It is  created
                           from the fly.nac file using an awk script (in
                           the 'parms' directory).
            fly.lnd
                           Defines the contents of the landscape. It  is
                           created  from  the  fly.lnc file using an awk
                           script (in the 'parms' directory).
            *.vxx
                           These files define the shape  of  the  corre-
                           sponding objects.
            *.prm
                           These  files define the behaviour of the cor-
                           responding plane type. The files MUST  reside
                           in  the  current  directory. They are created
                           from the *.prc text  files  (in  the  'parms'
                           directory).

            When you eject ('E') you will find yourself on a  parachute.
            When  you land, you will move to a new plane. You can accel-
            erate the descent with 'd' but if  the  plane  did  not  yet
            crash  then  you  will (have to) wait on the ground until it
            crashes and a new one is provided.
            The IBMPC uses a timer chip with three counters. Fly8  reads
            counter  0 to get high resolution interval timing and writes
            counter 2 to generate speaker sound. Counter 0 is often  set
            to  the wrong mode by various programs (some examples: Land-
            mark 1.14 sets the mode to 3 while version 2.00 sets  it  to
            2)  .  The standard is mode 3, but it is sometimes set to 2.
            Fly8 needs to have the timer in the standard mode or it gets
            bad timing information.
            The  program  'gettimer' will report the current mode. If it
            is 36 or b6 then the mode is correct.  The  usual  bad  mode
            will  show  34  or b4 (the mode is the last digit divided by
            two).
            The program settimer will set the timer to mode 3.

            o    On a 486DX50 the serial driver fails at 115200  but  is
                 ok at 57600.  Output buffering at high speed looses the
                 comms. It is now fixed  with  a  kludge  in  the  comms
                 driver.
            o    On  fast machines attempting to read the joystick twice
                 in a row produces unexpected results. A  special  delay
                 option was introduced to get around this problem.
            o    The  stroke  character generator will not handle stroke
                 sizes above 128 pixels. May be a  problem  if  you  try
                 running at very high resolutions (say 1600x1200).
