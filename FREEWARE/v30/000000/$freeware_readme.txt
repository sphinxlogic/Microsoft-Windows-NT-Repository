
              OpenVMS Freeware for VAX and Alpha Systems

              The OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM contains free software tools
              and utilities to aid software developers in creating
              applications and managing and using OpenVMS systems.

              Many of these tools are popular packages already widely
              known and in use, while others are internally developed
              Digital tools our engineers are making available to our
              OpenVMS customers. For example, the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM
              includes Bliss-32 for OpenVMS VAX, Bliss-32 for OpenVMS
              Alpha, and Bliss-64 for OpenVMS Alpha.

              Features of the Freeware CD-ROM

              The Freeware CD-ROM includes the following features:

              o  Includes an easy-to-use 4GL-based menu system for
                 examining the contents of the CD-ROM.

              o  Is in Files-11 format to make it readable on OpenVMS
                 systems.

              o  Contains binaries, source code (except for the Bliss
                 compilers), and documentation.

              o  Represents some of the most popular, most often
                 requested free packages, plus new items never before
                 made public.

              Disclaimer on Testing, Quality, and Licensing

              free of charge and without warranty. Included in the
              [FREEWARE] directory on this CD are the GNU software
              licenses. Unless otherwise stated in sources or source

	      Note: The menu system provides some insight into what is on
		this disk, but for best information read the files in
		this ([000000]) directory, AAAREADME.V3 and the abstract
		which contain much more information. The 60 character
		limitation in the menu system loses a vast amount of
		information. The abstract tries to do better and still
		be readable in a short time.

	      How to use the menu system included with the Freeware CD-ROM

	       1. Mount the freeware CD-RMOM in a disk drive

		   $MOUNT DKA100: FREEWAREV20

	       2. Invoke the menu command file.

		   $@DKA100:[FREEWARE]FREEWARE_MENU

	      OpenVMS Web site located at:  http://www.openvms.digital.com

              Note too that the freeware CD contains a directory [000TOOLS]
	      which contains many unpacking tools, and a file
              [000000]AAAREADME.V3 which contains the text of all the
              FREEWARE_README.TXT files. It can be browsed from any text
              viewer or editor.
