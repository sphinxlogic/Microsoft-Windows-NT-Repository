Subj:	SDL release note

	I wrote up the following release note text and had Anne review it for
accuracy. She mentioned that we could also provide a source patch or new C
back-end source as another alternative, but I don't think I want to commit to
that in the release notes. We can probably still provide an updated source on
the WWW if we want. This note should at least explain the problem and some
possible workarounds:

--------------

	Alpha SDL Version EV1-50 on V2 of the OpenVMS Freeware CD has a problem
which was just recently discovered. When using the default mode of operation
(not using either /C_DEVELOPMENT or /VMS_DEVELOPMENT qualifiers on the SDL
command), any "quadword" datatypes will generate incorrect C language output.
Instead of an array of two integers, SDL will generate a single "int" type.
Not only is this incorrect, but the space allocated by the int is only half of
what should be allocated.
	A fix for this exists and will be incorporated in Version EV1-51 of
SDL. In the meantime, there are several possible workarounds. Using either of
the /C_DEVELOPMENT or /VMS_DEVELOPMENT qualifiers on the SDL command results in
correct output. However, this introduces other differences to the C language
output. Another possible workaround is to modify the SDL source and replace
the quadword declaration with two longword fields or a single field which is
an array of two longwords.
