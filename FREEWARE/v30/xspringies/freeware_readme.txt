XSPRINGIES, MOTIF TOYS, A mass and spring simulation system for X windows

xspringies is a simulator which allows you to interactively create and edit a
system of masses and springs.  The parameters of the masses and springs (such
as mass elasticity and spring K) as well as those of the surrounding system
(such as air viscosity and gravity) can be changed.

These systems can be loaded and saved into a file.

I guess you could use xspringies for real work, but it's really intended to be
a time waster.
