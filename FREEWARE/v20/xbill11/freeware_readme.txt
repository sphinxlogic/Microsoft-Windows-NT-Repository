XBILL, GAMES, Battle against "Viruses"

Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin, and
someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people running around
the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus
cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.  Your objective is to
click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat. If one of the people
reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the
virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with your vital
software.

Clicking the button on one of the little people will cause it to cry out in
pain and melt (id software eat your heart out!), dropping the stolen os if it
is carrying one.  If a computer is running Wingdows or is temporarily off, the
os can be dragged back to the computer (or another computer originally running
the same os).
