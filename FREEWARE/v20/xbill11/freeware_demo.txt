You can run XBILL via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure

Clicking the button on one of the little people will cause it to cry out in
pain and melt (id software eat your heart out!), dropping the stolen os if it
is carrying one.  If a computer is running Wingdows or is temporarily off, the
os can be dragged back to the computer (or another computer originally running
the same os).  

The status bar at the bottom tells the following:
	Number of Bills on and off the screen
	Number of computers running their OS, off, and Wingdows
	Level
	Score

Command line options:
	-l<n>, -L<n>	Start on level n
	-s		Only redraw half as often.  May help on slow networks
	-v		Print version number and exit
