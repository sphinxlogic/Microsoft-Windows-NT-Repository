The FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure only defines Xhost symbol.

  OPTIONS

    Xhost accepts the following command line options described below.  For
    security, the options that effect access control may only be run from the
    "controlling host".  For workstations, this is the same machine as the
    server.  For X terminals, it is the login host.

        -help
    Prints a usage message.

       "[+]" "name"
    The given name (the plus sign is optional)
    is added to the list allowed to connect to the X server.
    The name can be a host name or a user name.

        - "name"
    The given name is removed from the list of allowed
    to connect to the server.  The name can be a host name or a user name.
    Existing connections are not broken, but new
    connection attempts will be denied.
    Note that the current machine is allowed to be removed; however, further
    connections (including attempts to add it back) will not be permitted.
    Resetting the server (thereby breaking all connections)
    is the only way to allow local connections again.

        +
    Access is granted to everyone, even if they aren't on the list
    (i.e., access control is turned off).

        -
    Access is restricted to only those on the list
    (i.e., access control is turned on).

        nothing
    If no command line arguments are given,
    a message indicating whether or not access control is currently enabled
    is printed, followed by the list of those allowed to connect.
    This is the only option that may be used from machines other than
    the controlling host.
