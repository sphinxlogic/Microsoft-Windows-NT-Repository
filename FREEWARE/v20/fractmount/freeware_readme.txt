Fractal mountains in 3D, by brownian motion.
--------------------------------------------

It was mainly written with a colour capacity in mind, but allows the colours
on the command line to be set for monochrome dispays:

e.g. for monochrome: xmntn -ba black -mn black -se black)

Use 'xmntn -help' for a full list of options.

There is a simple interaction to allow new generations of mountain data without
having to quit and restart: simply click any mouse button in the pointer window
at the point along the scale for the dimension. The scale is graduated at the
integer values 1.00 and 2.00, and the scale allows for values entered up to
3.00. Clicking on the 'New Mountains' window will cause new data to be
generated and the mountains drawn. On a lowly GPX, this takes 30 seconds or
so for each phase. On a MIPS box, its INSTANT!

There is an alternative perspective to the mountains shown by the executable
'xlmntn'. This attempts to bring the viewer down to the level of the
mountains. It takes many of the same options, but also allows for the distance
of the observer to be changed.
