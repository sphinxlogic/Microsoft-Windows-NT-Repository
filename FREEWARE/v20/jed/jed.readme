This version of JED requires slang version 0.99-19 or greater.  If you do
not have the library, pick up the slang distribution as well and compile it
first.

jedXXX.zip contains DOS executables (bin/jed*.exe, bin/rgrep.exe), necessary
library files, etc... It does not contain any source code.  The source code
is available in the tar file.
