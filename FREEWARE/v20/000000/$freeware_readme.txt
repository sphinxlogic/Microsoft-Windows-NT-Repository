
              OpenVMS Freeware for VAX and Alpha Systems

              The OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM contains free software tools
              and utilities to aid software developers in creating
              applications and managing and using OpenVMS systems.

              Many of these tools are popular packages already widely
              known and in use, while others are internally developed
              Digital tools our engineers are making available to our
              OpenVMS customers. For example, the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM
              includes Bliss-32 for OpenVMS VAX, Bliss-32 for OpenVMS
              Alpha, and Bliss-64 for OpenVMS Alpha.

              Features of the Freeware CD-ROM

              The Freeware CD-ROM includes the following features:

              o  Includes an easy-to-use 4GL-based menu system for
                 examining the contents of the CD-ROM.

              o  Is in Files-11 format to make it readable on OpenVMS
                 systems.

              o  Contains binaries, source code (except for the Bliss
                 compilers), and documentation.

              o  Represents some of the most popular, most often
                 requested free packages, plus new items never before
                 made public.
