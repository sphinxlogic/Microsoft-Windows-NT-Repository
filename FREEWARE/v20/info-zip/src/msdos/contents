Notes:

(1) As of UnZip 5.1, Borland project files are no longer included.  They
    were not as flexible as the makefiles, and the binary ones caused prob-
    lems for both the comp.sources.misc moderator and the UnZip maintainer.
    By way of compensation, what used to be called simply "makefile" has
    been split into makefile.msc and makefile.tc (the latter for old Turbo C
    compilers).

(2) As of UnZip 5.11, makefile.gcc (for djgpp/GNU make) is no longer provided.
    Instead use the gcc_dos target in the Unix makefile (unix/Makefile) after
    copying it to the main UnZip directory.  Note that, because of bugs in
    the MS-DOS port of GNU make, the gcc_dos target does not make use of the
    MAKE variable; therefore users of other makes (e.g., nmake) will have to
    edit the target or rename their make utility to "make".

(3) The Unix makefile also has an msc_dos target which can be used for MSC 6.0
    or later, but such use is discouraged and the target may disappear in the
    future--use makefile.msc instead.

(4) For DOS emx+gcc use the gccdos target in the OS/2 makefile.os2.  This
    target has only been tested in cross-compilation from OS/2 to MS-DOS,
    but it should work under plain MS-DOS with a proper make utility.  The
    resulting executables require emx.exe to run (akin to djgpp's go32.exe).

(5) The binary patches in Borland.fix are NOT required; they may be useful
    if you regularly deal with Unix sources, but casual users should probably
    make use of an external utility like Rahul Dhesi's FLIP to convert between
    Unix and DOS/OS2 end-of-line characters.  If you know how to patch binary
    executables, you should be able to figure out how to use these patches.
    Presumably they don't work for more recent versions of the executables
    anyway; they'll probably be removed in the next version.
