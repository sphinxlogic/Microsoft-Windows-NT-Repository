  rsrc.hqx          resource file for Macintosh unzip (BinHex)
  thinkc.hqx        Think C project file (BinHex)

The resource file and the Think C project file are in BinHex form because
they contain Macintosh resource forks (only) and as such can not be simply
stored a normal file on a non-Macintosh system.  BinHex form is the
traditional way for transferring such files via non-Macintosh systems.  It's
also the safest since it uses only printable characters.  Both of the ".hqx"
files must be converted with BinHex 4.0 (or equivalent) on a Macintosh
system prior to attempted use.
