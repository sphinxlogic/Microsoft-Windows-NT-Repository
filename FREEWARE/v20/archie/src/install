 This is the minimal set of things you need to build an Archie client
that takes advantage of the Prospero system.  It is derived from the
4.2beta version of Prospero, currently available as the file prospero.tar.Z
on the host cs.washington.edu.

 * To make the client under Unix:
   * edit the Makefile, changing CC, OPTIONS, LDFLAGS, and RM if
     necessary (odds are you won't have to do this..see below)
   * edit the DEFINEs as necessary
   * if archie.ans.net isn't "close" to you netwise, please edit
     ARCHIE in the Makefile appropriately.  This is particularly important
     if you're not in the US.  You don't need to touch archie.h anymore.
   * type `make'

 I've tried to make this as portable as possible.  I'd encourage you
to try doing a "make" without any changes to the Makefile, and see how
it goes.  If it pukes, and you have to define something, please drop
me a line---my goal is for anybody to just type "make" and not have to
worry about things like what functions their system supports.

 * To make the client under VMS, just type @MAKE and it'll ask you
   which of the available Archie servers is closest.  That's it!

 * To make the client under MSDOS or OS/2:
   * with FTP Software's PC/TCP for MSDOS (version 2.1 or higher) and
     OS/2 (version 1.1 and higher), use makefile.os2 or makefile.dos
   * with CUTCP (NCSA telnet), use makefile.cut
