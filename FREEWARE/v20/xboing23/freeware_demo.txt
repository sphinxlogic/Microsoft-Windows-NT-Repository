You can compile under VAX with GCC (tested with GCC 2.5.8) or DEC C , however
DEC C 4.0 has probably problem with input characters handling. Undec AXP, DEC C
4.0 is fine.

XPM object libraries are provided for the 2 compilers. VAX (GCC 2.5.8 under VMS
5.5-2) and AXP (DEC C 4.0 under VMS 6.1) are provided.

Define XBOING23_DIR somewhere and put level files here (all the content of
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[.LEVELS] directory

(Nota: xpm.h header needs to be invoked before X11 headers under OpenVMS.) 

Enjoy !!
