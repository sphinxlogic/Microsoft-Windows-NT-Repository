Unknown Index Type
Sorry, no <xxx> indexing supported
                                The information you requested is not
                                properly indexed at this time, making it
                                appear to the Internet Gopher that it is
                                expected to process indexes for which it is
                                not configured.  This  is most certainly an
                                oversight, or perhaps the  dynamic nature
                                of the Internet Gopher has  allowed you to
                                request a file which is being  reconfigured
                                at this time.  Please try again  later, and
                                if you still encounter the error,   contact
                                <GopherAdmin@              >, and  report
                                this Internet Gopher server error.
