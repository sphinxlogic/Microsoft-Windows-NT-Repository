DCLOCK, MOTIF TOYS, Digital clock for X WINDOW

    The dclock
    program displays the time in digital format only.  The time is
    updated on a per second basis or on a per minute basis.  This program is
    nothing more than a wrapper around the dclock widget not associated with
    any particular widget set.

    When the clock is running, the user may change attributes by typing:

      r Toggles Reverse Video.
      s Toggles the seconds display.
      b Toggles the bell attribute.
      j Toggles the jump/scroll attribute.
      f Toggles the fade attribute.
      d Toggles the date format.
      m Toggles the military time format.
      a Toggles the alarm clock.
      t Toggles the tails attribute.
      q quit the program.
