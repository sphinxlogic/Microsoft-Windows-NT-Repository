Subject: XPOSTIT - Post-it notes for X11 (part 1 of 2)
Date: Tue, 03 Jan 89 13:09:20 -0800


Well, I finally got around to rewriting my xpostit program for X11.
Xpostit allows you to place small "Post-it note" windows all over
your screen, as opposed to sticking real Post-it notes all over your
workstation.

This version is for X11 Release 3 and uses the Athena widgets.  It
will not run under X11 Release 2, since it uses the List widget,
which didn't exist then.
