MAHJONGG is an ancient chinese game usually played by four players with tiles

This is version 2 of the game xmahjongg.  It has been almost totally rewrit-
ten.  I have run this program on SUN systems (3 and 4) and Michael Campanella
has provided VMS help for xmahjongg.

Xmahjongg has 2 new features which will make life enjoyable:
	1) we now have COLOR (well its about time)
	2) we now have different board layouts
See the man page for information on these features

The layout files are a generalization of the board layout.  The default is
the standard "pyramid".  You can create you own layouts.  See the man page
on how to do this.

I would appreciate hearing about new layouts and any bugs which are found.
I will post a patch when enough data comes in.

Remember that Mark A. Holm has the original copyright on the look of the tiles.
See his README file which is included below.

Enjoy!
