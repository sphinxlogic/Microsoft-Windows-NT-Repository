MadGoat MaKe utility (MMK) V3.4-6, TOOLS, An MMS-like MAKE
                                       
   [05-OCT-1995]
   
   MMK is a "make" utility for VMS systems. It is used for building
   software systems based on a "description file" (or "makefile") you
   create that lists the sources and objects of a system and the
   dependencies between them.
   
   MMK provides a subset of the functionality of Digital's DEC/Module
   Management System (DEC/MMS); the description files MMK uses are
   syntactically compatible with DEC/MMS.
   
   MMK runs on VAX/VMS, OpenVMS VAX, and OpenVMS AXP systems. It requires
   VAX/VMS V5.0 or later, or OpenVMS AXP V1.0 or later.
   
   MMK is written entirely in C. Complete source code is provided.
