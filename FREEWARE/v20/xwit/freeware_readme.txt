XWIT, MOTIF TOYS, Pop or iconify this xterm window or named windows

    xwit is an X window interface tool.
    By default when used with no arguments in an xterm it
    de-iconifies and raises the window.
    You can specify a different function to do, such as iconifying the window,
    and apply it to several windows whose name begins with one of the given
    strings, or a particular window id given, or the window id found
    in the environment variable WINDOWID.
    (This variable is set by xterm for the program, usually the shell, it
    runs.)
