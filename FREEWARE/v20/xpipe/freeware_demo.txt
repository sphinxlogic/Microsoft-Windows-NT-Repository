XPIPE for VMS
=============

PIPE_WIDGETS.UID and PIPE_ICONS.UID files must be installed under CENA_X
directory. Idem for PIPE_HELP. file

You can modify this in COMPILE.COM file (but you need to recompile) if
you don't want to define CENA_X logical

.................................................................

You can run XPIPE via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure (CENA_X is defined here)

Sources are available under [.SRC] directory in XPIPE.ZIP file
