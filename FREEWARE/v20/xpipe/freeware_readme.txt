XPIPE, GAMES, Build pipe for the fluid to flow through 

  OBJECT_OF_THE_GAME


      When the fluid flows through all the pipe you've built, the
      level is over.  If the fluid went through enough pipes
      before the end of the level, you get to move on to the
      next level.  Otherwise, "Game over!"

      Fluid will start to flow though the only pipe in the large grid
      after a short while.  (See the status window to see how long
      until the fluid starts to flow.)

      On the left, you will see a small window with four pipes.
      When you click in the main window, the lowest pipe is placed
      where you clicked.  The other three pipes then move down and
      a new pipe is placed at the top of this "preview" window.
      The lowest pipe in the small window is always the next tile
      that will show up on the big grid.  The next higher pipe will
      show up next.  Since there are four pipes in the preview
      window, you always know what the next four pipes will be.

      If you manage to fill enough tiles, you get to move on to the
      next level.
