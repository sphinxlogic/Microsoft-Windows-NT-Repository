The server demonstration requires that you have a web browser available
in order to view the documents being served.  The demo configuration starts
the server on port 8080 (assumes a non-privileged user), so enter the
URL as "http://your-hostname:8080/".  Note that disk access to a CD is
slower than standard disk.

Before starting the server, the demo asks you to enter which TCP/IP package to
use.  If your vendor is not among the choices, choose UCX as most packages
now support UCX emulation.

The server uses DECnet to generate some of it's documents dynamically via
command procedures and programs, generically known as scripts.  In order
to run the scripts the demonstration will ask you for your username and
password and create a procedure, demowwwx.com in your sys$login directory.
If you do not wish to run the script-based demos, simply hit return when 
prompted for the username.  Note also that the freeware CD must be mounted 
shareable in order for the DECnet processes to access the scripts.
