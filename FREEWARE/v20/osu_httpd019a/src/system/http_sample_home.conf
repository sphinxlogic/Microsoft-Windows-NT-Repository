# Since second argument in TraceLevel rule is null, trace data will go

#	0 - No trace, errors only (default).
#	1 - Show connect open and close and URL path info requested.
#	6 - Trace script execution
#	11 - Trace rule file translation steps.

# Disable reverse host lookup.  When enabled, hostnames appear in log file

# Format of rules file: {see configfile.html}
#
# Operation:
#    At server startup, rules file is read sequentially.  The presence and/or
#    values of any 'search', 'authenticator', 'suffix', and 'presentation'
#    commands is noted/saved.  All other rules are tokenized and saved
#    in a table for processing in the same order that they occur in the rules
#    file when a URL is to be translated.  Comments are discarded.
#
#    The ident portion of a URL is translated by making a copy of it in a work
#    area and testing the work area copy against each entry in the tokenized
#    rule list.  A rule that matches against the translation in the work area
#    may rewrite the translation (see map rule), subsequent tests for
#    triggering rules will be made against the new translation.
#
#    The data from suffix rules is kept in a different data structure optimized
#    for finding highest quality representation supported by a client request.
