BLOCKADE, GAMES, X window version of the `blockade' Macintosh game

This is an X version of the `blockade' Macintosh game by Christer
Ericson.

This is known to build on SunOS 4.1.  It should build on any mostly-BSD
UNIXish system.

As noted in the credits screen, the first 80 built-in scenes are not my
work.  The exact details of the pictures used are my work, but the
basic designs of the levels were taken from the Macintosh version.  All
the code is mine; when I was told the original was in Pascal, I decided
it would be easier to write it from scratch.
