   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
within.

   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

   No system should be without one!

   Dungeon was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science by
Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was
inspired by the Adventure game of Crowther and Woods, and the long
tradition of fantasy and science fiction games.  The original version
was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated
from MDL into FORTRAN by Digital engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.
