	to only install, execute @nmlphasev_support, and modify your
			 startup file to include nmlphasev_startup
	to relink, 	 delete the executable file in your distribution
			 directory , execute @nmlphasev_build and reinstall
	to rebuild, make your changes to nmlphasev_support.c, rebuild with
			 nmlphasev_build, and reinstall.

	the supported commands are:
	show node <address>
	show node <name>
	show kno node	(uses only DNS for now)
	show executor 
	copy kno nod from
---
	the logicals affecting this program are:
	NMLPHASEV_CIRCUIT_NAME		circuit name of the node
	NMLPHASEV_DNS_DIRECTORY		DNS directory of links to use
						for sho known node
		if this name is not defined, the logical 
			DECNET_MIGRATE__DIR_SYNONYM is used.
		if this name is not defined either,
			the directory .dna_nodesynonym is used
	NMLPHASEV_IDENTIFICATION	executor identification
