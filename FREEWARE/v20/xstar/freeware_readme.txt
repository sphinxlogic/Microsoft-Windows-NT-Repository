XSTAR, MOTIF TOYS, Stars into a gravitational field

XStar by Wayne Schlitt, wayne@backbone.UUCP (wayne@cse.unl.edu)


This program "solves" the n-body problem, and displays the results on
the screen.  It starts by putting a bunch of stars on the screen, and
then it lets the inter-body gravitational forces move the stars
around.  The result is a lot of neat wandering paths, as the stars
interact and collide.

XStar can be used to animate the root window, as a screen saver or just
to display stuff in a regular window.
