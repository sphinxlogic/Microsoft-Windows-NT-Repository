1 IMAGEMAGICK
ImageMagick is an X11 package for display and interactive
manipulation of images.

2 DESCRIPTION
ImageMagick is an X11 package for display and interactive manipulation
of images.  The package includes tools for image conversion,
annotation, compositing, animation, and creating montages.  ImageMagick
can read and write many of the more popular image formats (e.g. JPEG,
TIFF, PNM, XPM, etc.).  ImageMagick is available via anonymous FTP as
ftp.x.org:contrib/applications/ImageMagick/ImageMagick-3.3.tar.gz.

VMS distribution is available via anonymous FTP as 
ftp.x.org:contrib/vms/ImageMagick/imagemagick3.3.zip
 
 
   Mdisplay
Display is a machine architecture independent image and display
program.  It can display an image on any workstation display
running an X server.  Display can read and write many of the more
popular image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, Photo CD, etc.).  You can
perform these functions on the image:

    o display information about the image
    o write the image to a file
    o print the image to a Postscript printer
    o delete the image file
    o load an image from a file
    o display the next image
    o display the former image
    o display a sequence of images as a slide show
    o select the image to display by its thumbnail rather than name
    o undo last image transformation
    o restore the image to its original size
    o refresh the image
    o toggle the colormap type: : Shared or Private
    o half the image size
    o double the image size
    o resize the image
    o trim the image edges
    o crop the image
    o cut the image
    o flop image in the horizontal direction
    o flip image in the vertical direction
    o rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
    o rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
    o rotate the image
    o shear the image
    o invert the colors of the image
    o vary the color brightness
    o vary the color saturation
    o vary the image hue
    o gamma correct the image
    o sharpen the image contrast
    o dull the image contrast
    o perform histogram equalization on the image
    o perform histogram normalization on the image
    o negate the image colors
    o reduce the speckles within an image
    o eliminate peak noise from an image
    o detect edges within the image
    o emboss an image
    o oil paint an image
    o convert the image to grayscale
    o set the maximum number of unique colors in the image
    o annotate the image with text
    o add a border to the image
    o composite image with another
    o edit an image pixel color
    o edit the image matte information
    o add an image comment
    o display information about this program
    o discard all images and exit program
    o change the level of magnification
 
   Mimport
Import reads an image from any visible window on an X server
and outputs it as an image file.  You can capture a single
window, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the
screen.  You can use display (see display(1)) utility for
redisplay, printing, editing, formatting, archiving, image
processing, etc. of the captured image.

The target window can be specified by id, name, or may be
selected by clicking the mouse in the desired window.  If
you press a button and then drag, a rectangle will form
which expands and contracts as the mouse moves.  To save the
portion of the screen  defined by the rectangle, just
release the button.  The keyboard bell is rung once at the
beginning of the screen capture and twice when it completes.
 
   Manimate
Animate displays a sequence of images on any workstation
display running an X server.  Animate first determines the
hardware capabilities of the workstation.  If the number of
unique colors in an image is less than or equal to the
number the workstation can support, the image is displayed
in an X window.  Otherwise the number of colors in the image
is first reduced to match the color resolution of the
workstation before it is displayed.

This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits/pixel image can
display on a 8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome device.
In most instances the reduced color image closely resembles
the original.  Alternatively, a monochrome or pseudo-color
image sequence can display on a continuous-tone 24
bits/pixels device.
 
   montage
Montage creates a composite image by combining several
separate images.  The images are tiled on the composite
image with the name of the image optionally appearing just
below the individual tile.
 
   Mconvert
Convert converts an input file using one image format to an
output file with a differing image format. By default, the
image format is determined by it's magic number. To specify
a particular image format, precede the filename with an
image format name and a colon (i.e.  ps:image) or specify
the image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).
Specify file as - for standard input or output.  If file has
the extension .Z, the file is decoded with uncompress.
 
   mogrify
Mogrify transforms an image or a sequence of images.  These
transforms include image scaling, image rotation, color
reduction, and others.  The transmogrified image overwrites
the original image.

  Midentify
describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files.
It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.  The
information displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the
width and height of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not,
the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in the image,
the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of
seconds it took to read and process the image.
 
   Mcombine
Combine combines images to create new images.
 
   Msegment
Segment segments an image by analyzing the histograms of the
color components and identifying units that are homogeneous
with the fuzzy c-means technique.  The scale-space filter
analyzes the histograms of the three color components of the
image and identifies a set of classes.  The extents of each
class is used to coarsely segment the image with
thresholding.  The color associated with each class is
determined by the mean color of all pixels within the
extents of a particular class.  Finally, any unclassified
pixels are assigned to the closest class with the fuzzy c-
means technique.
 
   xtp
Xtp is a utility for retrieving, listing, or printing files
from a remote network site, or sending files to a remote
network site.  Xtp performs most of the same functions as
the ftp program, but does not require any interactive
commands.  You simply specify the file transfer task on the
command line and xtp performs the task automatically.
