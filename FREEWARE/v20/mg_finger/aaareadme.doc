MG_FINGER V1.2 -- MadGoat FINGER utility for NETLIB

This kit contains all the files necessary for installing the MG_FINGER
software.  Requires VMS V5.2 or later and MadGoat Software's NETLIB
V2.0 or later.

MG_FINGER consists of two programs, FINGER.EXE and FINGER_SERVER.EXE.
FINGER.EXE is the local finger utility, set up to run as a VMS foreign
command:

    $ FINGER :== $disk:[directory]FINGER

FINGER_SERVER.EXE is the finger daemon, which listens on port 79 for
finger requests from other hosts.

The FINGER command has the following form:

    $ FINGER [/NOCLUSTER] [/OUTPUT=filespec] [username][@hostname...]

Optional information is shown in square brackets.  The /NOCLUSTER qualifier
is only valid on local FINGERs; it causes FINGER to collect information only
about the local host, rather than the entire VMScluster.  The /OUTPUT
qualifier can be used to redirect FINGER output to a location other than
SYS$OUTPUT.  Qualifiers MUST be placed BEFORE any username or hostname on
the command line.

Installing MG_FINGER
---------------------

The command procedure LINK.COM can be used to link the MG_FINGER
images from the object libraries supplied with this kit. The original
BLISS source is provided if you wish to rebuild the images from
source.

You must have already installed NETLIB.  You can get NETLIB via
anonymous ftp from ftp.spc.edu in [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]NETLIBvvu.ZIP.

You can install FINGER.EXE and FINGER_SERVER.EXE in any directory; the
FINGER_STARTUP.COM procedure provided assumes that they are installed
in MADGOAT_EXE:.  You should modify FINGER_STARTUP.COM as needed for
your site and include that procedure in your system startup at some
point AFTER NETLIB is started.
