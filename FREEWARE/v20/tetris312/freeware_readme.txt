TETRIS312, GAMES, GENERIC TETRIS - Yet Another Tetris Game on X

    This is a game of "Tetris" for the X Window System.

    The program lists the top 15 players at the end, each player may has at
    most three scores. With the option -s, it shows all the players
    and scores.

    Key "j" moves the block left, "l" moves right,
    "k" rotates. Left-handed people may want to use "s",
    "d", "f" respectively. Or maybe someone wants to try the
    arrow keys...  The space bar drops a block quickly. Use "CTRL-L"
    key combination to redraw - in case the program messes somthing up.

    As usual, "+" and "-" speed up or lower down the speed. Note
    that you don't need to press the "SHIFT" key - "=" and
    "_" also work. The "b" key toggles "beep", and "n"
    toggles "show next".

    If you press "p", the game will be paused, and the window
    will be iconified - just in case your boss suddenly appears at your
    door ;o). When the tetris window loses its focus, it also goes to
    "paused" mode except it doesn't iconify itself.

    To get high scores, don't use "show next" mode, try starting at a
    higher level and try to let "tetris" eat more than one line at a time.
    Play fast and see how well you can do in the bonus mode
    (what is that? ;-). Warning: some blocks in the bonus mode will rotate
    differently than you would expect.
