You can run TETRIS via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure

ANYTHING SPECIAL IN PLAYING?

    Use 'j' to move left; 'l' to move right; 'k' to rotate. 
    Left-handed people may want to use 's', 'd', 'f' respectively. 
    Use the space bar to drop a block quickly.  Do you want to try the
    arrow keys?

    Use CTRL-L key combination to redraw -- in case the program messes
    somthing up.

    As usual, '+' and '-' will speed up or lower down the speed.  Note
    that you don't need to press the SHIFT key -- '=' and '_' also
    work.  The 'b' key can be used to toggle "beep" and 'n' toggles
    "show next".

    If you press 'p', the game will be paused, and the window will be
    iconified -- just in case your boss suddenly appears at your door. 
    ;o) When the tetris window loses its focus, it also goes to
    "paused" mode except it doesn't iconify itself.
