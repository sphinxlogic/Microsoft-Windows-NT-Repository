   Glogin is a systems management tool that allows a privileged user to login
to another account without knowing the password on that account.  By logging
in to the other account the privileged user inherits the other user's complete
environment, (privileges, logical names, dcl symbols, process quotas etc.).
   GLOGIN requires the use of a pseudo terminal and will work with either the
public domain PY/TW driver or the DEC supplied FTA driver.  Prior to VMS 5.5
the FTA driver didn't exist but the PY/TW drivers were supplied with the
DECWindows distribution as well as at many anonymous FTP sites worldwide.
   To use GLOGIN you need to declare it as a foreign command and you need to
have SYSPRV and CMKRNL enabled.  Then enter the command

$ GLOGIN targetuser

where target user is the userid you wish to login as.  For Example:

$ GLOGIN :== $disk:[dir]GLOGIN.EXE
$ SET PROC/PRIV=(SYSPRV,CMKRNL)
$ GLOGIN HGC0015


   Logging out will return you to your own session.

   GLOGIN runs under openVMS/VAX version 5.1 - 6.1 and should assemble under
any of these versions without any changes.  To the best of my knowledge it
doesn't work correctly under openVMS/AXP although you are free to give it a
try.  I don't have an AXP machine yet to test it on.
   This version of GLOGIN was assembled and linked under VMS 6.1 to build it
for another version simply assemble and/or link it.  For example:

$ MACRO GLOGIN
$ LINK GLOGIN
