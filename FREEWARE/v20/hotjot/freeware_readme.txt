HOTJOT, MOTIF TOYS, Motif Desktop note Jotting Utility supports dual head, color

HOTJOT is a Motif desktop note jotting utility which allows you to
create multiple jot windows.

Some of the neat features include 
   Saves automatically every 15 minutes but only if there have 
    been edits  (prevents losing your notes).
   Supports up to 100 notes each having up to 10,000 characters.
   Shrinks notes down to a single line button so you can 
    have many on screen without taking up lots of space.
   Can switch screens on dual head systems.
   Allows different colored notes.
   Can print individual notes or all notes.
   Remembers color, size and location.
   Stores in flat ASCII file using character 255 as a note separator.

Helpful hints when using the program.
   Program uses minimal borders to lesson screen space usage so
    to move and resize a window you must use MB3 on the minimal
    border and bring up the windowing systems menu.  You can
    also use keyboard accellerators - 

         Alt+F7 Move   Alt+F8 Size
    
    Once you get the jots where you want, you probably won't move
    them much.

   Only resize when open or the new size will not be remembered.
   Add HOT JOT to your menus and Autostart and your daily notes
    will appear when you log in.
