          OpenVMS Freeware for VAX and AXP Systems

          The OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM contains free software
          tools and utilities to aid software developers in
          creating applications and managing and using OpenVMS
          systems.

          Many of these tools are popular packages already
          widely known and in use, while others are internally
          developed Digital tools our engineers are making
          available to our OpenVMS customers. For example,
          the OpenVMS Freeware CD-ROM includes Bliss-32 for
          OpenVMS VAX, Bliss-32 for OpenVMS AXP, and Bliss-64
          for OpenVMS AXP.

          The Disk and File Utilities (DFU) is a high perfomance
          tool meant as an aid to the system manager who is
          responsible for monitoring and maintaining disks,
          files and directories. It makes use of low level
          I/O features of VMS. As a result a high level of
          performance is reached with minimal overhead on the
          system. DFU supports all types of disk sets which
          comply to the VMS ODS-2 standard such as volume
          sets, stripe sets , shadow sets and RAID sets, and
          combinations of these.

   1.2    General description   1.2    General description   1.2    General description

          DFU provides the following functions (in alphabetical
          order) :

          o  DEFRAG : This function allows simple defragmentation
             of a file or a list of files.

          o  DELETE : This function allows either a delete by
             file-id, or a fast delete of a complete directory or
             directory tree with all its subdirectories.

          o  DIRECTORY : This function has 7 options :

            1  COMPRESS a directory

            2  DUMP a directory block by block

            3  CREATE a directory with a preallocated size

            4  Search all directories on the disk for files
               which have multiple versions

            5  Search all directories on the disk for alias file
               entries

            6  Search all directories on the disk for empty
               directories

            7  Search all directories on the disk for problem
               directories.

          o  REPORT : Generates a file and free space report for
             a disk. Also a disk space usage report, based on
             UIC/Identifier, can be generated, even on a disk
             which has disk quota disabled.

          o  SEARCH : Look up files on a disk by specific file
             attributes (eg. files sizes, dates, ownership, and
             so on)

          o  SET : This functions allows setting of file
             attributes which are not available through DCL
             commands.

          o  UNDELETE : A safe file recovery function.

          o  VERIFY : This function performs a fast disk
             structure verification and can optionally repair
             certain disk structure errors (comparable with
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR).

          Each function is described in detail in the
          corresponding chapter.

          DFU is supported on OpenVMS VAX V5.5 through V7.0,
          and OpenVMS AXP V6.1 thru V7.0. DFU has been tested on
          the Field test versions of VMS 7.0; so far no problems
          have been found. The official freeware release of
          DFU will distributed with the official release of VMS
          V7.0.

   1.3    New features of V2.2   1.3    New features of V2.2   1.3    New features of V2.2

          This version of DFU offers several improved and new
          features, as well as a couple of bugfixes. The most
          important new feature is the implementaion of Screen
          Management (SMG) routines to perform all output to the
          user. Secondly , the DIRECTORY/COMPRESS command has
          been enhanced such that the user has more control over
          the compress process. The table below lists all new
          features :

          o  SMG oriented output : Optionally DFU uses SMG
             routines to perform a window-style output. See
             chapter 3 for a description of the SMG capabilities.

          o  DIRECTORY/CHECK has been improved. Also, the new
             /REPAIR qualifier allows automatic removal of all
             invalid directory entries. Such entries are usually
             seen with a 'nosuchfile' error.

          o  DIRECTORY/VERSION now also shows the number of
             blocks of the found files.

          o  DEFRAG file : added /LBN to force moving a single
             file to a specific LBN (logical block number).

          o  SEARCH/CHARACTERISTICS : two new characteristics ,
             /NOSHELVABLE and /ISSHELVED are added. These can be
             used on a system where file shelving is used.

          o  SEARCH/VERSION_NUMBER : this qualifier allows a
             search for files with a version number within
             a specific range ,eg. SEARCH/VERSION=MIN=30000
             produces all files with a version number of at least
             30,000.

          o  SEARCH/NOOWNER, /NOIDENT : this allows searching for
             files NOT owned by a certain UIC or Identifier.

          o  SET : added /OWNER_UIC and /IDENT qualifiers. This
             allows setting of file ownership for open files such
             as INDEXF.SYS.

                                                              1-3                                                              1-3                                                              1-3

 


          Introduction          Introduction          Introduction





          o  SET : like DEFRAG and DIRECTORY SET now also
             allows the usage of a indirect file as input for
             the SET command. Such a file can be produced with
             SEARCH/OUTPUT.

          o  SPAWN : this new command creates a subprocess
             and thus allows a quick escape to DCL from an
             interactive DFU session.

          o  Different /OUTPUT behaviour : when used /OUTPUT=file
             the output will be send to BOTH the file and the
             screen.

          The following bugs are fixed :

          o  Under rare circumstances (usually seen during a
             minimum boot) DFU did not recognize that the DFU_
             ALLPRIV identifier was granted.

          o  The filename reported from a DIRECTORY/CREATE
             command could contain some bogus characters at the
             end.

          o  The calculation for the File Fragmentation Index
             in the REPORT command sometimes gives incorrect
             results. This was especially seen when a a disk
             contained a small number of small but fragmented
             files such as batchjob log files. This would result
             in a much too high value.

          o  Some commands such as UNDELETE and DEFRAG now check
             if the disk is write-locked or if erase-on-delete
             is set BEFORE performing any action. This results in
             better error reporting.

          o  The output filename from the SEARCH command on a
             volume set always gave the device-name of the volume
             set member currently being processed. Although this
             is not incorrect, RMS can't handle such a file name.
             Therefore using SEARCH/OUTPUT on a volume set and
             using the results in a DIRECTORY or DEFRAG command
             produced RMS-E-FNF errors. The behaviour is changed
             such that filenames are now given with the device

             name of the primary (RVN 1) member of the set, thus
             allowing RMS to find these files.

          o  Fixed a bug which could lead to an Access Violation
             error on all commands which do INDEXF.SYS
             processing. This error was rarely seen but showed
             up during testing on AXP F7.0.

   1.4    Restrictions and Parameters   1.4    Restrictions and Parameters   1.4    Restrictions and Parameters

          The DFU program has a few restrictions :

          o  DFU can not handle volume sets with more than 32
             members.

          o  Due to changes in VMS run time libraries on VAX
             DFU.EXE files linked on VMS 6.2 cannot run on VMS
             6.1 and lower without relinking the image.

          o  The SMG interface may not work at all on VMS 5.5.
             In that case you need to install CSCPAT_0320 and
             re-install DFU. Warning: CSCPAT_0320 replaces
             SMGSHR.EXE and may have side effects on other
             applications using SMG routines.

          The following minimum process quotas are recommended
          for DFU usage:

          o  WSQUOTA : 1500

          o  WSEXTENT : 3000

          o  DIOLM : 40

          o  ASTLM : 40

          o  FILLM : 40

          o  BYTLM : 30000

          o  PGFLQUOTA : 30000

                                                              1-5                                                              1-5                                                              1-5

 


          Introduction          Introduction          Introduction





          If you use DFU on volume sets with a large number of
          members you may need to increase the SYSGEN parameter
          CHANNELCNT.

          If you use the directory command on very large
          directory files (> 1000 blocks) and run into errors
          you may need to increase the following parameters:

          o  WSQUOTA at least 1000 + size-of-largest directory
             file

          o  WSEXTENT : WSQUOTA + at least 1000

          o  CTLPAGES (SYSGEN parameter) : at least 100

          o  WSMAX (SYSGEN parameter) : at least WSEXTENT

          Do not change parameters unless you run into errors
          such as EXCEEDED QUOTA or INSUFFICIENT WORKING SET
          LIMITS.

   2.1    Installation procedure   2.1    Installation procedure   2.1    Installation procedure

          DFU can be installed with the VMSINSTAL utility.
          During the installation VMSINSTAL does the following:

          o  Moves the documentation to SYS$HELP (Optional)

          o  Relinks DFU

          o  Creates the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier needed to perform
             the write functions. (See 2.2)

          o  Asks if you want a systemwide or private
             installation

          The DFU utility in fact contains just 2 files :

          1  DFU.EXE : the DFU program

          2  DFUHLP.HLB : the on-line help file

          The location of these files depend on wether a
          systemwide or private installation is performed.

          To install DFU log in into a privileged account and
          enter :

          You must grant any DFU user including yourself the
          necessary DFU_ALLPRIV identifier if a user be allowed
          to use all DFU functions. See 2.2 for the meaning of
          this identifier.

   2.2    Security and access   2.2    Security and access   2.2    Security and access

          DFU has some functions which must not be made
          available for general usage. Therefore DFU has 2
          groups of functions :

          1  Read-only functions

            1  DIRECTORY (except DIRECTORY/COMPRESS)

            2  REPORT

            3  SEARCH

            4  SPAWN

            5  VERIFY (except VERIFY/FIX and VERIFY/REBUILD)

          2  Write functions

            1  DEFRAG

            2  DELETE

            3  DIRECTORY/COMPRESS

            4  SET

            5  UNDELETE

            6  VERIFY/FIX and VERIFY/REBUILD

          The Read-only functions need SYSPRV or BYPASS
          privilege. The Write functions require BYPASS
          privilege as well as the DFU_ALLPRIV identifier.
          The DFU_ALLPRIV identifier is created during the
          installation procedure. To enable a user to perform
          Write functions the system manager must grant this
          identifier as follows :

              $ mc authorize
              UAF> grant/id DFU_ALLPRIV username

          It is highly recommended that Write functions are NOT
          made available to the world.

          or (if DFU is installed systemwide):

              $ MC DFU

          You can also define and use a symbol for DFU as

              $ DFU == "$DFU"
              $ DFU

          You can now enter DFU commands. HELP gives you online
          help. After each command DFU returns to the DFU>
          prompt. You can recall and edit commands, just as with
          DCL (20 commands will be stored in the recall buffer).
          Use EXIT or CTRL/Z to leave DFU. If you use a symbol
          for DFU , you also process a single command and return
          to DCL immediately:

              $DFU SEARCH disk/qualifiers

          During a DFU run , you can interrupt DFU with CTRL/C
          or CTRL/Y. These interrupts are catched by DFU to
          allow a correct rundown of the current command. It
          may therefore take some time before DFU responds to a
          CTRL/C or Y interrupt.

   2.4    Using an indirect file list   2.4    Using an indirect file list   2.4    Using an indirect file list

          There are 3 commands, DIRECTORY, DEFRAG and SET which
          accept an indirect file as input parameter. This is
          achieved by using the @ sign. An indirect file is
          a file containing a list of valid filenames (each
          line in such a file must contain exactly one file).
          Such indirect files can be the output file of the DFU
          Search command eg.:

              $ DFU
              DFU> SEARCH mydisk/CHAR=DIRECTORY/OUTPUT=x.x
              DFU> DIRECTORY/COMPRESS @x.x

          As of version V2.2 DFU uses SMG (Screen management
          routines) to perform output for an interactive DFU
          session. This chapter describes the layout of the
          DFU screen, the special commands used only in the
          SMG interface and other items with respect to the SMG
          interface.

   3.1    Enabling/Disabling SMG   3.1    Enabling/Disabling SMG   3.1    Enabling/Disabling SMG

          DFU automatically selects SMG output if you run an
          interactive DFU session on a terminal or workstation
          which supports SMG. In a batch job or a non-DEC
          terminal DFU will use normal line oriented output.
          You can explicitly disable SMG by defining the logical
          DFU$NOSMG to any value.

          You may prefer to perform interactive DFU sessions in
          SMG mode, and single DFU commands in normal line mode.
          This can be done by using the command procedure listed
          below:

             for the output from DFU commands. Also broadcast
             messages are send to this window.

          o  Statistics : the lower part contains statistics from
             the current command. During most of the commands
             this screen will contain a progress indicator and a
             status for the current command.

          o  DFU prompt : the bottom line is used as the input
             command line.

          o  DO : invokes a subprocess (same as the SPAWN
             command)

          o  HELP or PF2 : invokes a special SMG window for the
             help command.

          o  CTRL/W : redraws the screen

          o  PF4 : creates a screen dump into the file DFU_
             SCREEN.TXT

          o  PREV SCREEN : Scrolls back the output screen.

          o  NEXT SCREEN : Scrolls forward the output screen

          o  SELECT : Toggles between 80 and 132 columns.

          Although only some 20 lines are visible in the output
          (main) screen DFU in fact remembers 500 output lines.
          You can scroll back and forward through these lines
          with the NEXT and PREV SCREEN keys. At the beginning
          of each new DFU command these lines are cleared.

          On a workstation with DecWindows/Motif you can change
          the DecTerm size to be more than the standard 24
          lines. DFU's SMG screen will automatically adjust
          to the screen size of such a DecTerm.

   3.5    Side effects   3.5    Side effects   3.5    Side effects

          There are a few side effects when using SMG mode.
          CTRL/C and CTRL/Y are catched but not echoed. Also all
          broadcast messages are trapped and will be displayed
          in the main screen at the end of the current DFU
          command. Sometimes this may slightly disrupt the main
          screen, which can be repaired with the CTRL/W key.

          Further, during the execution of a DFU command the
          cursor will disappear. After the command finishes the
          cursor will reappear at the DFU> prompt.

          Note : this chapter is meant for first time users of
          DFU. If you already used DFU before you may probably
          skip this chapter.

          This chapter gives a brief overview of the commands
          which can be used with DFU, and how they can provide
          the system manager with the necessary information.

          One of most common actions by a system manager is
          trying to locate specific files eg. files with a
          certain file size. Although a lot can be done with
          the VMS DIRECTORY command this can be a time consuming
          process , especially if the complete disk much be
          scanned. The SEARCH command of DFU is exactly meant
          for this situation. It gives a very quick list of
          specific files, with their size, and if needed the
          number of file fragments. Some usefull SEARCH commands
          are :

              DFU> SEARCH disk/SIZE=MINIMUM=1000 (files > 1000 blocks)
              DFU> SEARCH disk/IDENT=SYSTEM (files owned by SYSTEM)
              DFU> SEARCH disk/FRAGMENT=MINIMUM=10 (files with at least 10 fragments)
              DFU> SEARCH disk/CHAR=MARKED (all files marked for delete)
              DFU> SEARCH disk/CREATED=SINCE=YESTERDAY (all files created since YESTERDAY)

          Of course these qualifiers can be combined to narrow
          the search. As the SEARCH command scans INDEXF.SYS
          , not directories, the output generated by SEARCH
          may look a bit random (but it is just the order in
          which the file headers are in the INDEXF.SYS file). To
          smooth the output use the /SORT qualifier.



                                                              4-1                                                              4-1                                                              4-1

          Another important action for a system manager is to
          gather some overall disk information , such as number
          of files , free space statistics and fragmentation
          information. The REPORT command will generate such
          a disk report. To get individual disk space usage
          information the /USAGE qualifier can be used. This
          will work even if there is no disk quota enabled on
          the disk.

          At regular intervals a system manager may need to
          check a disk with ANALYZE/DISK. The DFU VERIFY command
          provides more or less the same functionality but many
          times faster. The /FIX qualifier provides some REPAIR
          options which (unlike ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR) do NOT
          lock the disk, and thus do not interfere with other
          disk operations. However, the disk can be rebuild
          completely by using the /REBUILD qualifier.

          Occasionaly a user will delete the wrong file, leaving
          the system manager or operator with the tedious task
          of restoring the file from a backup set. The UNDELETE
          command may be able to recover the file if it has not
          yet been overwritten with a new one. Much care has
          been taken to make this command as safe as possible;
          therefore no disk corruptions will be the result of an
          UNDELETE. If DFU encounters a problem with a deleted
          file it will refuse to UNDELETE it.

          Another type of typical system manager problems deals
          with directories. The DFU command DIRECTORY can handle
          such problems. DIRECTORY can generate reports about
          empty directories (/EMPTY qualifier) or directories
          which contains files with a certain number of versions
          (/VERSION=n qualifier) or even check for corrupted
          directories (/CHECK). Also , directories may become
          internally fragmented. This can be quickly solved with
          the /COMPRESS qualifier.

          A second problem with directories is in deleting a
          directory with many files. This may take several
          hours using a DCL DELETE *.* command. This problem
          is solved by using DFU's DELETE/DIRECTORY command
          which can delete large directories some 10 times
          faster than the normal DELETE command does. Also,
          using DELETE/DIR/TREE will delete a complete directory
          tree with just one command.

          The last 2 commands deal with individual files. SET
          allows settings of some special file attributes.
          Since VMS V6.0 this functionality is also provided
          by the DCL SET FILE/ATTRIBUTE command, but DFU's SET
          offers some more options. The DEFRAG command is an
          interface to the MOVEFILE function offered by VMS 5.5
          and higher. This allows a simple defragmentation of
          individual files.

          The next chapters gives a detailed description of each
          individual DFU command.

          This chapter describes the DEFRAG command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

   5.1    Description   5.1    Description   5.1    Description

          The DEFRAG command can be used to defragment a single
          file or a group of files. You can also enter an
          indirect command file containing a list of files.
          This feature allows you to create an output file with
          SEARCH and use that as an input to DEFRAG.

          DEFRAG makes use of the file-primitive MOVEFILE
          function. Therefore files which are open, or which
          are marked NOMOVE will not be DEFRAGmented. Still you
          should be cautious about using DEFRAG. You should not
          make this function available for general usage.

          The most common errors returned by DEFRAG are :

          o  ACCONFLICT: File is open by another user

          o  DEVICEFULL: Device has not enough contiguous free
             space to move the entire file

          o  FILNOTACC: File has been set to NOMOVE.

          o  FILENUMCHK: You tried to move a reserved file (eg
             INDEXF.SYS).

          o  RMS Errors: Almost always caused by an invalid or
             wrong file specifcation.

          ________          /BESTTRY          /BESTTRY          /BESTTRY
          Normally DEFRAG tries to create a contiguous file.
          If there is not enough contiguous free space the
          operation will fail. With the /BESTTRY qualifier
          DEFRAG tries to move the file with the contiguous-
          best-try method. This means a maximum of 3 fragments.
          You should only use this qualifier when a normal
          DEFRAG fails. If a DEFRAG/BESTTRY also fails this
          is an indication that the disks free space is too
          fragmented. Run a REPORT to see what the largest
          contiguous free space is, and check the free space
          fragmentation index.

          The device on which the files reside. The device name
          is added to the file name. If you generate a file
          list with the DFU SEARCH command you don't need this
          qualifier anymore. However you may have a list of
          files produced from another source and thus need to
          append a device name to it. Example:

   6      DELETE   6      DELETE   6      DELETE



          This chapter describes the DELETE command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   6.1    Introduction   6.1    Introduction   6.1    Introduction

          The DELETE command is designed for 2 purposes:

          1  Delete a file by file id (with the /FILE qualifier).
             This functionality is needed to be able to delete
             files which no longer have a parent directory. This
             way 'lost' files and (sometimes) files marked for
             delete can be removed from a disk.

          2  A fast method to delete a complete directory or even
             a directory tree (with the /DIRECTORY qualifier).
             First all entries of a directory are deleted without
             removing the directory entry ; this saves a lot of
             unnecessary directory updates. Finally the directory
             file itself is deleted. This way a directory is
             cleaned up 2 to 3 times faster than with the DCL
             DELETE *.* command. On large directories DFU may be
             even 10 times (or more) faster. To delete a complete
             directory tree use the /TREE qualifier. The DCL
             command DELETE [.SUBDIR...]*.*;* will almost always
             fail to delete the intermediate subdirectory files
             forcing you to issue this command several times.
             The DFU DELETE command is smart enough to delete
             the files and the subdirectory files in the proper
             order; therefore only one command is sufficient to
             delete a complete directory tree.


                                                              6-1                                                              6-1                                                              6-1

          specifications may be used. DFU will automatically
          add .DIR to the filespecification if a filetype is not
          provided.

          Wildcards may be used but must be used very carefully.
          Make sure that the directory does not contain non-

          will become lost after the DELETE/DIRECTORY command
          (but can be recovered with ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR). Note
          that the directory file itself will also be deleted.

          the proper order. Thus a complete directory tree is
          deleted with one command.

   7      DIRECTORY   7      DIRECTORY   7      DIRECTORY



          This chapter describes the DIRECTORY command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   7.1    Introduction   7.1    Introduction   7.1    Introduction

          The DIRECTORY command offers 7 major functions. 4
          functions deal with all directories on a disk, the
          other 3 functions are used for manipulating individual
          directories. These functions are activated by special
          qualifiers:

          o  Individual directory functions :

            1  /COMPRESS : Rebuild one or more directory files.
               Directories are alphabetically sorted lists of
               filenames and file id's. Because file names
               are randomly inserted and deleted, holes will
               occur in directory files. Such holes will only
               be reused if a file can be alphabetically fitted
               into it. As a result directory files will grow.
               Especially MAIL subdirectories suffer from this
               behaviour.

               To make matters worse directory files above 127
               blocks will no longer be cached by the file
               system. This will degrade performance on such
               directories dramatically. The COMPRESS function
               will rebuild the complete directory file. The
               /TEST qualifier can be used to preview the
               results of a possible COMPRESS command.

            2  /CREATE/ALLOCATE=n : Create a directory with a
               preallocated size of 'n' blocks. Note that 'n'
               will be rounded up to a multiple of the disks
               cluster size.

                                                              7-1                                                              7-1                                                              7-1

            3  /DUMP : Make a dump of the directory blocks and
               formats the output. This option is usefull for
               debugging directory files which are suspected
               or corrupted. This function is equivalent
               to the previously undocumented VMS command
               DUMP/DIRECTORY, although the layout of the output
               is different.


          o  Disk-wide directory functions :

            1  /ALIAS : Scan all directories on the disk for
               alias file entries.

            2  /CHECK : Scan the disk for problem directories.

            3  /EMPTY : Scan the disk for empty directories

            4  /VERSION=n : Scan all directories on the disk for
               files which have at least 'n' versions.

          The diskwide function qualifiers can be used in
          one command; other combinations of qualifiers are
          not possible. Note that the diskwide directory
          functions can take several minutes to complete because
          a complete directory scan uses a lot of disk I/O
          (approximately 2 I/O's per directory).

          An indirect command file containing a list of files
          can be used as a parameter to /COMPRESS or /DUMP.
          Such a list can be generated with the SEARCH command.
          Example:

              DFU> SEARCH disk/FILE=*.DIR/SIZE=MIN=50/OUT=x.x
              DFU> DIRECTORY/COMPRESS @x.x

          Caution: Care should be taken when compressing
          critical system directories. To be safe you should
          first use the /TEST qualifier before compressing
          the directory. Another problem may be caused by
          a systemcrash just when DFU is rewriting the new
          compressed directory (although the chance that

          this happens is very small). When this happens you
          can recover the files by executing the following
          procedure:

          1  Do a $SET FILE/NODIR of the corrupted directory

          2  Delete the directory and create a new one

          3  Do a $ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR ; this will move all the
             lost files to [SYSLOST].

          4  Move the files from [SYSLOST] to the newly created
             directory.

          This version of DFU has some major changes in
          the directory compression process (issued by the
          DIRECTORY/COMPRESS command). Previously DFU always
          performed a maximum compression , and then truncated
          the resultant directory. This may be usefull on a
          dormant directory , but on an active directory this
          method introduced new problems:

          o  When new files were added to the directory it must
             very quickly be extended. Not only is this a slow
             operation, but on a fragmented disk this can lead to
             DIRALLOC errors.

          o  Active directies where files are inserted in a
             random alphabetical order very quickly lead to
             expansion of the just compressed directory.

          The first problem is now solved by NOT doing an
          automatic TRUNCATION of the directory. The /TRUNCATE
          qualifier has been added to allow truncation on the
          users request. Also /TRUNCATE=blocksize is possible
          to perform partial truncation; DFU will not truncate
          below the blocksize issued in /TRUNCATE. (The actual
          blocksize will be rounded up to a multiple of the

                                                              7-3                                                              7-3                                                              7-3

          disks cluster size.) The second problem is solved by
          the new /FILL_FACTOR qualifier. Here a user can direct
          DFU to fill each directory block up to a certain
          percentage (between 50 and 100). Not specifying
          /FILL_FACTOR is the same as doing /FILL_FACTOR=100
          (the 'old' DFU behaviour). Note however that the
          directory's allocated size must be large enough to
          allow a lower fill factor. If that is not possible DFU
          will issue a DFU-E-EXTERR error, and you must use a
          higher fill factor. So, what strategy should be used
          when comnpressing directories?

          1  Inactive directories : use DIR/COMPRESS/TRUNCATE.

          2  Not very active diredctories : use DIR/COMPRESS
             (/TRUNCATE=n).

          3  Active directories, files added at the end (such as
             MAIL directories) : use DIR/COMPRESS

          4  Active directories, files added in random
             alphabetical order : use DIR/COMPRESS/FILL_FACTOR=n

          The file specification of the directory on which to
          perform the /CREATE , /COMPRESS or /DUMP function.
          Wildcard file specifications may be used. DFU will
          automatically add .DIR to the filespecification if a
          filetype is not provided.

          ______          /ALIAS          /ALIAS          /ALIAS
          The /ALIAS qualifier directs DFU to scan all
          directories for alias file entries. Only alias files
          in DIFFERENT directories will be found (this is the
          most common situation). Normally only the system disk
          should contain alias files. This qualifier can be
          combined with /VERSION=n and /EMPTY.

          ___________          /ALLOCATE=n          /ALLOCATE=n          /ALLOCATE=n
          Used in combination with /CREATE. Creates the new
          directory with an allocated size of 'n' blocks.

          ______          /CHECK          /CHECK          /CHECK
          Perform a diskwide scan for corrupted directories.
          Directories with a first byte = 0, and directories
          which contain files out of alphabetical order are
          reported as being corrupt. Also directories with
          invalid file entries are reported. These last files
          can be removed by using the /REPAIR qualifier.

          _________          /COMPRESS          /COMPRESS          /COMPRESS
          Performs the directory compression unless /TEST is
          also specified. The output will show the results in
          terms of file sizes. Example:

              DFU> DIR/COMP OWN$:[000000]MAIL

              %DFU-S-DONE, OWN$:[000000]MAIL.DIR;1: 31 files; was : 4/9, now : 3/3 blocks

          _______          /CREATE          /CREATE          /CREATE
          Create a new , empty directory. The allocated size
          will be 1 cluster unless /ALLOCATE is specified.

          _______          /DEVICE          /DEVICE          /DEVICE
          The device on which the files reside. The device
          name is added to the file name. If you generate a
          file list with the DFU SEARCH command you don't need
          this qualifier. However you may have a list of files
          produced from another source and thus need to append a
          device name to it. This qualifier can only be used in
          combination with /COMPRESS or /DUMP.

          _____          /DUMP          /DUMP          /DUMP
          Produce a block level dump of a directory. /DUMP will
          interpret the directory entries found in each block. A
          directory entry contains a size, version-limit, type
          and name field. Next the directory entry contains
          a list of versions and file ID's for this entry.
          /DUMP will produce a rather low level output of this
          information. Example :

              DFU> DIR/DUMP C.DIR

          ______          /EMPTY          /EMPTY          /EMPTY
          The /EMPTY qualifier will produce a list of empty
          directories. This qualifier can be combined with
          /ALIAS and /VERSION=n.

          ______________          /FILL_FACTOR=n          /FILL_FACTOR=n          /FILL_FACTOR=n
          Specifies ,in percentage, the filling of directory
          blocks during a /COMPRESS operation. Fill factor may
          be between 50 and 100. Omitting this qualifier is the
          same as /FILL_FACTOR=100 (maximum compression). If
          the directory has not enough allocated space a low
          fill factor may result in failure of the Compress
          operation. DFU will issue a DFU-E-EXTERR error, and
          the directory file will not be modified.

          ________________          /OUTPUT=filename          /OUTPUT=filename          /OUTPUT=filename
          This qualifier redirects the output to a file. The
          output will also go to SYS$OUTPUT.

          ___________          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS
          This qualifier displays the performance statistics:
          CPU time, Elapsed Time, I/O and PageFaults.

          _____          /TEST          /TEST          /TEST
          The /TEST can only be used in conjunction with
          /COMPRESS. The qualifier will show the results of the
          /COMPRESS but will not compress the directory file.

          ___________________          /TRUNCATE=blcoksize          /TRUNCATE=blcoksize          /TRUNCATE=blcoksize
          During a compress operation truncate the directory
          back to the blocksize specified. If blocksize is not
          specified, the file will be truncated back to the
          end-of-file block number. Truncation will always be
          rounded up to the next highest multiple of the disks
          cluster size.

          __________          /VERSION=n          /VERSION=n          /VERSION=n
          The /VERSION qualifier directs DFU to scan all
          directories on the device to produce a list of files
          which have at least 'n' versions. This qualifier can
          be combined with /ALIAS and /EMPTY.

          This chapter describes the REPORT command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

   8.1    Description   8.1    Description   8.1    Description

          The REPORT command function generates a report of the
          file and free space fragmentation of the disk. Also a
          graph may be generated by the /GRAPH qualifier; this
          visualises the free space distribution on your disk.
          The /USAGE qualifier will generate a diskspace usage
          report. This is especially usefull if DISKQUOTA is not
          enabled on the disk.

          1  The header count is calculated based on the size of
             INDEXF.SYS. If more headers are needed INDEXF.SYS
             has to be extended.

                                                              8-3                                                              8-3                                                              8-3

          2  The free headers gives the number of free entries in
             INDEXF.SYS before it has to extend.

          3  The INDEXF.SYS number of fragments and mapwords in
             use are very important figures to determine if the
             INDEXF.SYS file can be extended. The theoretical
             maximum number of mapwords is 155. This value may
             be less if there are ACL's on INDEXF.SYS. Each
             fragment, and therefore each retrieval pointer must
             be in the mapword area. As the size of a retrieval
             pointer depends on the physical size of a disk, it
             is not easy to say how many fragments INDEXF.SYS
             can store in the mapwords area. If the mapword
             area is full the INDEXF file can no longer extend,
             and creating new files may result in a SYSTEM-W-
             HEADERFULL error.

          4  Files which have exactly 1 retrieval pointer are
             considered to be contiguous. This doesn't mean that
             the CONTIGUOUS bit is set in the file header.

          5  The average fragments per file give some indication
             about the total file fragmentation.

          6  The file and free space fragmentation index
             classifies your disk as follows :

            o  0-1 : Excellent

            o  1-2 : Good

            o  2-3 : Fair

            o  3-4 : Poor

             If your index is greater than 3 you should consider
             defragmenting the disk using Digitals DFO software,
             or by performing an Image BACKUP / Restore.

          7  The largest free extent is a usefull figure for
             defragmentation purposes. You cannot defragment a
             file when its size is greater than this value.

          The disks free space distribution as a bar graph. On
          the horizontal axis the Logical Block Number (LBN)
          is shown, running from 0 to the maximum block number.
          Each * represents a certain number of contiguous free
          blocks.

          If you use the /USAGE qualifier a usage table will be
          added. Per Identifier / UIC the blocks used/allocated
          , and the number of file headers are shown. If
          Diskquota is enabled a third column will be included
          which shows the blocks used/permitted allowing to
          QUOTA.SYS. Normally quota should satisfy the following
          rule :

               Quota used = blocks allocated + # of file headers

          enabled on the disk the blocks used/permitted allowing
          to QUOTA.SYS will also be shown. /USAGE is very
          usefull when diskquota is not enabled on the disk.
          /USAGE can not be used together with /NOFILE.

          The search function allows very quick disk-wide
          searches for specific files. You can use almost any
          possible file attribute as a search qualifier.

   9.2    Syntax and Output   9.2    Syntax and Output   9.2    Syntax and Output

          The command syntax for SEARCH is:

              DFU> SEARCH device/qualifiers

          The output is displayed on your terminal. You can also
          sort the output with the /SORT qualifier. The output
          is shown in 2 or 3 columns eg:

              DFU> SEARCH MYDISK/FILE=X.X/FRAGMENT
               .
               .
              $1$DUA102:[USER.COMMAND]X.X;1             1/3               1/1
               .
               .

          The first column shows the full file name . As of
          this version of DFU the device name is included in
          the file name. The second columns shows the file size
          as actual/allocated size. The 3rd column is optional
          and will only be shown when the /FRAGMENT qualifier is
          used. It shows the number of fileheaders / number of
          file fragments.

          SEARCH checks if the device to-be-searched is member
          of a volume set. If so, the complete volume set will
          be processed, starting with Relative Volume Number 1
          up to the last member in set. You can override this
          behaviour with the /NOVOLSET qualifier.

          The SEARCH command is used for quick disk-wide
          searches for specific files. The qualifiers describe
          the file attributes used as the search criteria. You
          can combine almost all of the possible qualifiers,
          unless otherwise specified. Eg.:

              DFU> SEARCH DISK1/SIZE=MIN=10/OWN=[1,4]/CREATED=SINCE=YESTERDAY

          is a valid command. Note that qualifiers will be used
          in a logical AND manner, that is, SEARCH will only
          display files which obey to all qualifiers and options
          specified.

          __________          /ALLOCATED          /ALLOCATED          /ALLOCATED
          Default, SEARCH will use the actual file size.
          The /ALLOCATED qualifier forces SEARCH to use the
          allocated filesize. This qualifier is only meaningfull
          if you combine it with /SIZE.

          _______________________          /BACKUP=option(,option)          /BACKUP=option(,option)          /BACKUP=option(,option)
          The /BACKUP qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their backup date. The possible options
          are :

          o  /BACKUP=BEFORE=date

          o  /BACKUP=SINCE=date

          o  /BACKUP=NONE

          The NONE option gives files which don't have a backup
          date recorded.The other 2 options can be used to
          get files which have a backup date before or after
          a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option can be
          combined in one command.

          ________________________          /BAKFID=backlink-file-id          /BAKFID=backlink-file-id          /BAKFID=backlink-file-id
          You can use this qualifier to look for a file with a
          specific backlink. Only the first part of the file id
          must be specified, that is, if the file id is (x,y,z)
          you must specify 'x' as the file id. You can use this
          qualifier to get files from a specific directory. If
          you use /BAKFID=0 you will get files not belonging to
          a directory (often temporary files).

          ________________________________          /CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)          /CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)          /CHARACTERISTIC=(char1,char2...)
          This qualifier is used to get files with specific
          file characteristics.The characteristics can have the
          following values:

          o  Directory : directory files

          o  Nobackup : files marked nobackup

          o  Contiguous : files marked as contiguous

                                                              9-3                                                              9-3                                                              9-3

          o  Erase : erase file before deletion

          o  Spool : spool files

          o  Badblock : files which contain suspected bad
             block(s)

          o  Badacl : files with a corrupted ACL

          o  Besttry : files marked contiguous-best-try

          o  Scratch : files marked as scratch files

          o  Nocharge : files not charged against quota

          o  Nomove : files marked NoMove (VMS 5.5+)

          o  Locked : files with the deaccess lock bit set

          o  Marked : files marked for deletion

          o  Noshelvable : files which can not be shelved

          o  Isshelved : files which are shelved

          The several characteristics can be combined in one
          command.If you want a logical OR behaviour in stead
          of the default AND behaviour, you can use the special
          option MATCH=OR eg:

                SEARCH disk/CHAR=(NOMOVE,DIR,MATCH=OR)

          ________________________          /CREATED=option(,option)          /CREATED=option(,option)          /CREATED=option(,option)
          The /CREATED qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their creation date. The options are :

          o  /CREATED=BEFORE=date

          o  /CREATED=SINCE=date

          These 2 options can be used to get files which have
          a creation date before or after a specific date.
          The BEFORE and SINCE option can be combined in one
          command.

          This qualifier is used to exclude files from the
          search. You can use wildcard filenames ; you can also
          specifiy a list of files.

          ________________________          /EXPIRED=option(,option)          /EXPIRED=option(,option)          /EXPIRED=option(,option)
          The /EXPIRED qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their expiration date. The options are
          :

          o  /EXPIRED=BEFORE=date

          o  /EXPIRED=SINCE=date

          o  /EXPIRED=NONE

          The NONE option gives files which don't have a
          expiration date recorded.The other 2 options can be
          used to get files which have a expiration date before
          or after a specific date. The BEFORE and SINCE option
          can be combined in one command.

          ____________          /FID=file-id          /FID=file-id          /FID=file-id
          The /FID qualifier is a special function of SEARCH.
          It directs SEARCH to go directly to the specified
          file without processing the rest of the Index file.
          Therefore, you cannot combine this qualifierwith other
          search qualifiers such as /FILE. Normally a file-id
          consists is in the form (x,y,z) where x is the number
          of the file header within INDEXF.SYS y is the sequence
          number, and z is the Relative Volume Number. You only
          need to specifiy the x value in the /FID qualifier.

          ______________________          /FILE=(file1,file2...)          /FILE=(file1,file2...)          /FILE=(file1,file2...)
          This qualifier is used to search for files with a
          specific file name.You can use wildcard file names;
          also you can specify a list of files.

          ___________________________________          /FRAGMENT(=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr))          /FRAGMENT(=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr))          /FRAGMENT(=(MINIMUM=nr,MAXIMUM=nr))
          This qualifier displays the number of fragments and
          file headers of each file found. You can further limit

                                                              9-5                                                              9-5                                                              9-5

          _____          /FULL          /FULL          /FULL
          If you use this qualifier , SEARCH will give a full
          output for each file found. This output is a look-
          alike of the output from DIRECTORY/FULL. You cannot
          combine this qualifier with /SORT or /SUMMARY.

          _____          /HOME          /HOME          /HOME
          This qualifier directs search to give output from
          the disk's home block. SEARCH uses the home block
          for calculating the free and used file headers within
          INDEXF.SYS.

          _____________________          /(NO)IDENT=identifier          /(NO)IDENT=identifier          /(NO)IDENT=identifier
          You can search for files owned by a specific
          identifier. Another way is the /OWNER_UIC qualifier;
          you cannot combine these 2 qualifiers in one SEARCH
          command. Issueing /NOIDENT directs DFU to search for
          files NOT owned by this IDENTIFIER, eg: DFU> SEARCH
          sys$sysdevice/NOIDENT=SYSTEM.

          _________________________          /LBN=logical-block-number          /LBN=logical-block-number          /LBN=logical-block-number
          The /LBN qualifier is a special function of SEARCH.
          This allows you to find a file which contains a
          specific LBN. This may be usefull if you have bad
          blocks logged in the error log. You cannot combine
          /LBN with search qualifiers such as /FILE.

          ____________________          /(NO)OWNER_UIC=[x,y]          /(NO)OWNER_UIC=[x,y]          /(NO)OWNER_UIC=[x,y]
          This qualifier is used to get files owned by uic
          [x,y]. You cannot combine this qualifier with /IDENT.
          Specifying /NOOWNER directs DFU to search for files
          NOT owned by this UIC.

          _________________________          /MODIFIED=option(,option)          /MODIFIED=option(,option)          /MODIFIED=option(,option)
          The /MODIFIED qualifier is used to search files
          depending on their modification date. The options are
          :

          o  /MODIFIED=BEFORE=date

          o  /MODIFIED=SINCE=date

          These 2 options can be used to get files which have
          a modification date before or after a specific date.
          The BEFORE and SINCE option can be combined in one
          command.

          _________          /MULTIPLE          /MULTIPLE          /MULTIPLE
          This qualifier searches for files which have more than
          1 file header.

          _________          /NOSEARCH          /NOSEARCH          /NOSEARCH
          This qualifier can only be used in combination with
          /HOME. It is used to get the Homeblock info, without
          searching the entire disk.

          _________          /NOVOLSET          /NOVOLSET          /NOVOLSET
          The default behaviour of SEARCH is to process an
          entire volume set. You can override this behaviour
          with /NOVOLSET. This may be usefull when doing a /LBN
          search.

          ____________          /OUTPUT=file          /OUTPUT=file          /OUTPUT=file
          This qualifier redirects the output from SEARCH to an
          output file.This file can later be used as input to
          the DEFRAG , DIRECTORY or SET command.

          _______          /PLACED          /PLACED          /PLACED
          Checks for files which have a placement control
          retrieval pointer.This is sometimes set by non-DEC
          disk defragmentation programs.

          The /SIZE qualifier is used to limit files found
          by their file size.You can either use minimum= or
          maximum= or use both options together. SEARCH will use
          the actual file size for selecting files, except when
          the /ALLOCATED qualifier is used.

          _____          /SORT          /SORT          /SORT
          This qualifier will sort the files found before
          being output. You can combine this with the /OUTPUT
          qualifier (the default output is SYS$OUTPUT).

          ___________          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS          /STATISTICS
          This qualifier displays the performance statistics:
          CPU time, Elapsed Time, I/O and PageFaults.

          ________          /SUMMARY          /SUMMARY          /SUMMARY
          This qualifier will limit the output to the total
          number of files found, with their size (and optional
          the fragmentation when /FRAG is used). You cannot
          combine /SUMMARY with /FULL.

          ___________________________________________________          /VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=version1,maximum=version2)          /VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=version1,maximum=version2)          /VERSION_NUMBER=(minimum=version1,maximum=version2)

          The /VERSION_NUMBER qualifier is used search for files
          within a range of specific file version numbers.
          Logfiles which are produced with the same name may
          pose problems when they reach the maximum version
          number (32767). Using /VERSION=MIN=32000 is a quick
          way to find such files.

          The SET command allows you to modify file attributes
          which can't be modified through DCL commands. Note
          that you should be carefull about using this function;
          you may easily corrupt files. NOTE: This much wanted
          functionality is finally introduced in VMS 6.0 with a
          new DCL command $SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES. Still DFU's SET
          has some options which are not in SET FILE/ATTRIBUTES
          (such as setting a BACKUP date).

          Controls whether a new backup date is assigned to the
          specified files. Specify the date according to the
          rules described in Chapter 1 of the VMS DCL Concepts
          Manual. Absolute date keywords are allowed. If you
          specify 0 as the date, today's date is used. If you
          specify /NOBACKUP_DATE the Backup date field will be
          cleared.

          Controls whether a request is issued before each
          individual SET operation to confirm that the operation
          should be performed on that file. When the system
          issues the prompt, you can issue any of the following
          responses:

                YES      NO     QUIT

          You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase
          letters for word responses. Word responses can be
          abbreviated to one or more letters (for example, T,
          TR, or TRU for TRUE). Affirmative answers are YES,
          TRUE, and 1. Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and
          <RET>. QUIT or CTRL/Z indicates that you want to stop
          processing the command at that point. When you respond
          with ALL, the command continues to process, but no
          further prompts are given. If you type a response
          other than one of those in the list, the prompt will
          be reissued.

          Controls whether a new creation date is assigned to
          the specified files. Specify the date according to the
          rules described in Chapter 1 of the VMS DCL Concepts
          Manual. Absolute date keywords are allowed. If you
          specify 0 as the date, today's date is used.

          Sets or resets the directory attribute of a file.
          This qualifier allows you to set the directory bit
          of a file which was mistakingly reset by the 'SET
          FILE/NODIRECTORY' command. If it is done on a non-
          directory file, then access to that directory will
          give a 'BADIRECTORY' error.

          This qualifier will set the end-of-file byte mark
          to the highest byte if it has not been specified.
          Otherwise the end-of-file byte mark will be set to the
          specified byte.

          Modify the file ownership. See also /OWNER_UIC. This
          allows modification of the file-ownership even if
          the file is open, eg. INDEXF.SYS. You cannot use both
          /IDENT and /OWNER_UIC.

          This qualifier will lock a file for future use.
          Nothing else can then be done with the file, until
          it is unlocked (which can also be done with the VMS
          'UNLOCK' command.

          _____________________          /ORGANIZATION=keyword          /ORGANIZATION=keyword          /ORGANIZATION=keyword
          The following keywords are used as parameters for the
          ORGANIZATION qualifier: DIRECT, INDEXED, RELATIVE and
          SEQUENTIAL. This will allow you to modify the file
          organization type in the file header. Of course this
          won't change the real organization of the file.

          ________________          /OWNER_UIC=[x,y]          /OWNER_UIC=[x,y]          /OWNER_UIC=[x,y]
          Modify the file ownership to UIC [x,y]. See also
          /IDENT. This allows modification of the file-ownership
          even if the file is open, eg. INDEXF.SYS. You cannot
          use both /IDENT and /OWNER_UIC.

          ______________________          /RECATTRIBUTES=keyword          /RECATTRIBUTES=keyword          /RECATTRIBUTES=keyword
          The following keywords are used as parameters for
          the RECATTRIBUTES qualifier: NONE, FORTRAN, IMPLIED,
          PRINT and NOSPAN. This will allow you to modify the
          file's record attributes in the file header. NONE,
          FORTRAN, IMPLIED and PRINT are mutually exclusive, but
          can be used in combination with NOSPAN. When NOSPAN
          is omitted SPAN is assumed (the default is to allow
          records to cross block boundaries).

          _____________          /RECSIZE=size          /RECSIZE=size          /RECSIZE=size

          header.

          ________________          /RECTYPE=keyword          /RECTYPE=keyword          /RECTYPE=keyword
          The following keywords are used as parameters for the
          RECTYPE qualifier: FIXED, STREAM, STREAMCR, STREAMLF,
          UNDEFINED, VARIABLE and VFC. This will allow you to
          modify the file's record type in the file header.

          Controls whether a revision date is assigned to the
          specified files. Specify the date according to the
          rules described in Chapter 1 of the VMS DCL Concepts
          Manual. Absolute date keywords are allowed. If you
          specify 0 as the date, today's date is used.

          after any modification to it. SET however disables
          this update (otherwise the REVISION date could not be

   11     UNDELETE   11     UNDELETE   11     UNDELETE



          This chapter describes the UNDELETE command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   11.1   Introduction   11.1   Introduction   11.1   Introduction

          The UNDELETE function is designed to recover deleted
          files, if possible. UNDELETE operates in a safe mode
          such that it first checks if the deleted file header
          and diskblocks are still available. Only in that case
          will the file be recovered. Otherwise UNDELETE will
          leave the disk unmodified. UNDELETE has some powerfull
          options:

          o  Generate a list of recoverable files with the /LIST
             qualifier. This qualifier will not undelete any
             file, and therefore it does not lock up the disk.

          o  Undelete multiple files in one pass.

          o  Make file selections based on the owner uic with the
             /OWNER or /IDENT qualifier.

          o  Undeleted files which cannot be entered back in
             their original directory will be moved to the
             [SYSLOST] directory. This saves an additional
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR action.

          The UNDELETE command operates as follows :

          1  Lock the volume. In the same manner as
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR and SET VOLUME /REBUILD Undelete
             locks the disk for other writers such that no
             modifications to the INDEXF, BITMAP or QUOTA file
             can be made.

                                                             11-1                                                             11-1                                                             11-1

          2  Search the INDEXF.SYS file if the requested file is
             still there. A check is made if it really is a valid
             deleted file header.

          3  Checks if the deleted file header and all possible
             extension headers are still valid.

          4  Checks if the blocks previously owned by this file
             are still free.

          5  If all these conditions are met DFU will display the
             file and asks for a confirmation.

          6  Rebuilds all of the deleted file headers and bitmaps
             in memory. If no errors are found all the file
             headers and bitmaps are written back to disk. The
             files original backlink is saved in a table in
             memory.

          7  If appropiate the blocks and headers are charged
             against diskquota.

          8  When all of INDEXF.SYS has been scanned the volume
             is unlocked.

          9  The file(s) is (are) entered in the original
             directory if possible, using the table build up in
             memory. If the enter command fails (probably because
             the original directory is gone) the file will be
             entered in [SYSLOST]. DFU will create this directory
             if needed.

          If the /LIST qualifier is used, DFU will just list the
          recoverable files without performing any action on the
          disk. The disk will not be locked.

          It is important to note that during the bitmap and
          file header processing any error will immediately
          terminate the recovery process, and unlock the disk.
          Files which have been recovered up to that point will
          still be entered in the appropiate directory. As no
          wrong information has been written back to the disk
          this should leave the disk in a proper state.

                                                         UNDELETE                                                         UNDELETE                                                         UNDELETE





          NOTE: The blocks recovered will NOT be subtracted
          from the Volume's free block count. To get the
          actual freeblock count a SET VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE
          is necessary. Also a complete reMOUNT will reset the
          freeblock count.

          IMPORTANT: DFU takes care to recover only files whose
          original blocks are free. However these blocks may
          have been modified in the meantime by another file
          which also has been deleted. Therefore each recovered
          file must be checked manually to check its integrity.

          The new SPAWN command creates an interactive
          subprocess. This allows a quick escape to the DCL
          level from within an interactive DFU session. The
          subprocess has a default prompr DFU_sub$. In SMG mode
          the <DO> key also performs a SPAWN command. You must
          logout explicitly to return to the DFU session.

   13     VERIFY   13     VERIFY   13     VERIFY



          This chapter describes the VERIFY command with the
          related parameters and qualifiers.

          __________________________________________________________________

   13.1   Introduction   13.1   Introduction   13.1   Introduction

          The VERIFY command makes an analysis of the disk,
          scanning for file and disk structure errors. VERIFY
          performs almost all of the checks normally done by
          a ANALYZE/DISK command. But VERIFY is several times
          faster than ANALYZE/DISK, and using less resources.

          VERIFY checks and reports the following errors:

          o  Checks the logical information contained in the
             disks HOME block

          o  Reports files marked for deletion

          o  Reports mismatches in the index file's bitmap

          o  Checks all backlinks.

          o  Reports multiple allocated blocks

          o  Reports blocks incorrectly marked free and allocated

          o  Reports all lost files

          o  Checks for mismatches between blocks used and blocks
             charged in QUOTA.SYS. (Only done when diskquota is
             enabled)

                                                             13-1                                                             13-1                                                             13-1

          The /FIX qualifier can be used to perform some basic
          repair actions. Unlike ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR is does not
          lock the disk! /FIX repairs the following errors:

          o  Deletes file marked for delete (if possible).

          o  Recovers lost files and directories into [SYSLOST].

          o  Recovers a very rare problem which will get
             ANALYZE/DISK/REPAIR into a computable loop (This
             problem is fixed in VMS V6.2 or with the VERI02_061
             patch kit).

          As of V1.8 the /REBUILD qualifier can be
          used to performs the same function as a SET
          VOLUME/REBUILD=FORCE command. It will lock the disk
          for a short period of time (usually less than 30
          seconds). /REBUILD repairs the following errors :

          o  Mismatches in the INDEXF.SYS bitmap (files reported
             with the NOBITSET and NOBITCLR errors)

          o  Blocks incorrectly marked allocated or free in the
             BITMAP.SYS.

          o  Mismatches in the diskquota file.

          Note that /REBUILD does NOT change the disks free
          block count.

          CAUTION: On a system (cluster) wide mounted disk
          there will probably be concurrent disk activity during
          the VERIFY command. Therefore VERIFY may report some
          errors which are not really errors. Try running VERIFY
          2 or 3 times to see if the errors are reported again.
          To get a really consistent report from VERIFY you can
          use the /LOCK qualifier. This will write-lock the disk
          during the VERIFY run, so don't use this qualifier
          too often. (The /REPAIR qualifier of ANALYZE/DISK also
          write-locks the disk). Even if DFU ends ungracefully
          the DFU exit handler will always UNLOCK the disk.

       QUOTAERR, UIC [x,y] has n blocks used, QUOTA indicates m blocks,

          Severity:          Severity:          Severity:                    WARNING

          Explanation:          Explanation:          Explanation:                       If a disk has diskquota enabled, VERIFY
          calculates the blocks used and compares them with
          the value in the QUOTA.SYS file. Any mismatch is
          reported. This error is often seen when VERIFY is run,
          and there is concurrent file activity on the disk.
          Also, if after a system crash the disk is mounted
          with /NOREBUILD such Quota mismatches may exist. ReRun
          VERIFY with /LOCK to see if the error is still there.

          User Action:          User Action:          User Action:                       Run VERIFY/REBUILD to rebuild the QUOTA
          file. Or run a DISKQUOTA> REBUILD command.

          Severity:          Severity:          Severity:                    WARNING

          Explanation:          Explanation:          Explanation:                       This error indicates that DFU has found a
          directory with a backlink pointing to itself. This
          feature is only allowed for the MFD 000000.DIR.
          This error will result in ANALYZE/DISK going into a
          COMputable loop.

          User Action:          User Action:          User Action:                       Run VERIFY/FIX to move the directory to
          the [SYSLOST] directory. Then remove the directory
          entry from itself with a SET FILE/REMOVE command. The
          files in the directory should be accesible again.
