     Abort with a core dump

Some systems can't abort() from a signal handler if the signal handler
installed catches the signal abort() uses to actually do the abort. That
is, even resetting the signal default doesn't occur until the program
leaves the handler routine. This winds up causing infinite loops. To
avoid this we just never catch SIGFPE which is assumed to be very rare
in Pine and just kill ourselves with it when we want to abort with a
core dump.

    kill(0, SIGFPE);
    exit(0); /* Just in case */
}
