               Platforms Pine has been ported to (or attempted).

Each platform is labeled with a three letter abbreviation.  This file
defines those names.  Not all items mentioned here represent full
ports, some are only place holders.  A different name should be chosen
for each software/hardware configuration that requires changes to
Pine, Pico or the C-client.  The list of software/hardware
configurations for a three letter name is kept here and can hopefully
be kept up to date.  That is, if you are getting something working
that's not listed here, let us know at pine@cac.washington.edu.  If
you're trying to build Pine for something not listed here, you might
just try doing "build" for the thing you think is closest.  In many
cases the differences are small and it will work.  If all else fails,
the generic port (gen) is a good place to start.

As of August, 1993, the released version of Pine is 3.85.  The last previous
release was 3.07.  There have been lots of changes in between and the
latest version is not heavily tested in production environments.


			 Primary Distribution

These ports have recieved at least limited production testing at the 
University of Washington.  They were done by us and we will do our best 
to fix bugs and keep them up to date.

a32   ---  AIX 3.2 on an RS/6000
  Many people contributed to this port.  We do have our own systems to
  try this on, but it has been only lightly used so far.  Contributors
  include (but aren't limited to) Markus Baertschi <markus@oahu.cern.ch>,
  Doug Carter <dougc@clam.com>, and
  Thomas Riemer <triemer@rose.chem.wesleyan.edu>.
 
msc  ---  MS DOS using Microsoft C
  Version 3.84 was the initial DOS release of Pine, so there are no
  doubt still some problems.  Most of the problems are related to
  handling low memory.  Support is currently provided for Novell's Lan 
  WorkPlace, FTP Software's PC-TCP, and the University of Waterloo's 
  WATTCP with Packet Drivers.  Support for Sun's PC-NFS and Windows 
  Sockets are forthcoming.
    
nxt  ---  NeXT MACH on Next 68030 and 68040 machines
  This version has been used quite a bit.

ptx  ---  Dynix/PTX V2.0.3 on a Sequent
  Donn Cave <donn@u.washington.edu> did much of the work for the original
  port.  This port is in heavy use at the University of Washington.

sun  ---  SunOS 4.1 on SPARCStations
  Since we don't have many Suns, this has not yet been heavily used and 
  may have some bugs.

ult  ---   Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2 on DECStations/Systems
  This version has been used extensively.  See vul below for VAX platforms.


			  Limited Use Ports

These ports are known to build and have recieved limited testing, but are
not in production use at the University of Washington.  We will do our 
best to fix bugs and keep them up to date, as resources permit.

bsd  ----  4.3 Berkeley UNIX
  Done but only very lightly tested.  The one BSD system we have is not
  a production time-sharing system, it is just a timekeeper.

hpp  --- HP/UX 8.0 on HP 710 (PA/RISC)
  Thanks to David Miller <dmiller@beta.tricity.wsu.edu> for this port.  
  David is now <dlm@cac.washington.edu> and is working on the Pine
  project.  As with most of the 3.85 ports, this has been only lightly
  tested.

lnx  ---  Linux 0.99.11
  This is based on an original port of Pine 3.05 by Birko Bergt 
  <bergt@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>.  This port has only been lightly
  tested.

osf  --- DEC OSF/1 V1.2A  (Rev. 10.41)
  This has been lightly tested on a DEC 3000/300AXP workstation.

pt1  ---  Dynix/PTX V1.4.0 on a Sequent
  Donn Cave <donn@u.washington.edu> did much of the work for the original
  port.  This is a slight variant of the ptx port.  Pine 3.88 has been 
  lightly tested at this time.

sol  --- Solaris 2.2
  This has been very lightly tested.  It is compiled with the Sun C compiler
  in BSD compatibility mode.  Contributors include Marc Boucher <marc@com.org>,
  Steven Fought <keeper@lighthouse.caltech.edu>, and
  Ross Wakelin <rossw@march.co.uk>.  Keith Christopher 
  <keithc@library.welch.jhu.edu> has successfully compiled it with GCC2.4.5.

vul  --- VAX Ultrix 4.1
  This is identical to the ult port except for slight differences in 
  compiler options between Ultrix/RISC and Ultrix/VAX.  Thanks to Ralph
  Sims <ralphs@halcyon.com> for use of his system to test this port.



			  Contributed Ports

These ports have been contributed by outside persons and/or are not in 
production use at the University of Washington.  We will assist with 
the diagnosis of bugs and incorporate necessary changes as time permits.

aix  ---  PAIX/370 1.2.1 on IBM 3090  #### NOT FOR RS/6000's (see a32) #####
  This port was done by us.  It has not been tried or tested for version
  3.85, since we are pleased to no longer have to support PAIX/370!

aux  ---  A/UX 3.0
  Thanks to Marcelo A. Gallardo <marcelo@sparcwood.Princeton.EDU> and 
  Alexis Rosen <alexis@panix.com> for the Pine 3.07 port to A/UX.  
  It is not included in this release, but full integration of this port 
  is expected soon.

bsi  ---  BSD/386 Gamma 4.1
  This is a BSD/386 port based on contributions of Michael F. Santangelo 
  <mike@cblcbos1.umd.edu>.  It is lightly tested.
  
cvx  ---  Convex
  This is a Convex port based on contributions from Pekka Kytolaakso 
  <Pekka.Kytolaakso@csc.fi>.  It is lightly tested.

dyn  ---   Dynix 3.0 and 3.1 on Sequent Symmetry
  This port was done by us.  Version 3.07 of the port was used extensively.
  We no longer have a system running Dynix, so the 3.85 version of the
  port is completely untested.

isc  --- Interactive Systems Corporation, UNIX
  Thanks to Andy Brager <andyb@wndrsvr.la.ca.us> for this port.  This port 
  is completely untested on Pine 3.85.

sgi  ---  Silicon Graphics IRIS with IRIX 4.0.1
  Thanks to John Benjamins <johnb@edge.cis.mcmaster.ca>, Melissa Harp,
  and others for this port.  IRIX is a mix of System V and BSD.  Didn't
  work on IRIX 3.3.1 as of 3.07 port.  Untested on 3.85 port.

s40  ---  SunOS 4.0 on SPARCStation and Sun 386i
  Just slightly different from the sun port.  No system to test on.

sv4  --- System V release 4
  This is based on the Solaris port, but differs in certain incompatibilities
  between Solaris and various SVR4 versions.  It has recieved light testing
  on SVR4.0 and SVR4.2 platforms.


		      Partial, New, or Obsolete Ports

These ports are partial, obsolete, and/or their state is unknown.

ami  ---  Amiga
  This is a placeholder for an AmigaDOS 2.0+ port.  Contact David Miller 
  <dlm@cac.washington.edu> for more information.

coh  ---  Coherent
  This is a starting point for a Coherent port of Pico based on diffs 
  from Dmitry L. Gringauz <dmitry@golem.com>.  It is completely untested.
  
gen  --- Generic port
  This may be a good place to start a new port.

mac  ---  Apple MacIntosh
  This is really a place holder. No port is likely since the user
  interface isn't even close and IMAP clients (MacMS and Maelstrom)
  exist for the MAC. The c-client and mtest run on the Mac.

mip  ---  MIPS RC3240 running Risc/OS 4.51+
  Works on MIPS box.  Compiled in BSD mode.  Thanks to Matthew Lyle
  <matt@dbaix.oc.com>.  This port has not been updated for Pine 3.0
  or later and is not included.

sco --- Santa Cruz Operation UNIX
  Some work has been done on this, in particular a version of the
  c-client has been ported by Ken Bobey, though it is not included 
  here yet.

sv3  --- System V release 3
  Included in contrib/port.sv3. This is a port of Pine 2.4, partially
  adapted for Pine 2.28. Thanks to J.J. Bailey <jjb@jagware.acco.com>for
  the original work.

t20  ---  TOPS 20 on a DEC 10 !!!
  The c-client has been ported, but not the rest of Pine.

ul3  ---  Ultrix 3.1 
  Thanks to Il Oh for this port.  The changes were mostly to adapt to
  an older compiler that didn't understand things like void.  This port
  has not been updated for Pine 3.0 or later and is not included.

vms  ---  DEC VMS/OpenVMS
  This is a place holder for an eventual port to VMS.  We have recieved 
  various reports that c-client and IMAPd have been ported to VMS, but 
  we have not heard of any successful ports of Pico or Pine.


		     Miscellaneous Contributions

The following patches and utilities are provided for your convenience in 
the contrib directory.

carmel  ---  Carmel c-client driver
  The Carmel mail file stores messages in individual files and
  implements folders or mailboxes with index files that contain
  references to the files a nd a full c-client envelope in an easily
  parsed form. It was written as a needed part of the pod mail file
  driver with hopes that it might be useful otherwise some day. It has
  only been run with the pod driver.

  Advantages over Berkeley format and driver:
    + Opening mail folder is very fast
    + Expunge is fast
    + Check point is very fast
    + Memory usage is much lower
    + Search of message headers is fast
  Disadvantages:
    - Fetching a large message is slow
    - Searching the message bodies is slow
    - Sorting the mailbox is slow

keypad.enable  ---  Enable application keypad
  These context diffs when applied to pico/tcap.c enable entrance
  and exit of "keypad mode".  This mode is especially useful (and
  necessary!) for HP terminals which require this mode to make the
  arrow keys useful.

  These changes are based on a bug report submitted by Jochiam Richter
  (zjr@rz.uni-jena.de).

utils/ansiprt.c
  Simple filter to wrap ANSI media copy escape sequences around
  text on stdin.  Writes /dev/tty to get around things that might be
  trapping stdout.  This is actually a feature because it was written
  to be used with pine's personal print option set up to take "enscript"
  output and send it displayward to be captured/printed to a postscript
  device.  Pine, of course, uses popen() to invoke the personal print
  command, and interprets stdout as diagnostic messages from the command.
 
  Michael Seibel, mikes@cac.washington.edu

utils/brk2pine.sh
  A filter to convert personal mail aliases in a .mailrc file into
  pine address book format.

  Usage: program [.mailrc] >> .addressbook

  Corey Satten, corey@cac.washington.edu, 9/25/91

utils/mailtrfc.sh
  mailtrfc.sh -- A shell script to analyze the mail traffic as logged in
  /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog*. This currently as the University of Washington
  domains wired in and needs to be made more general. Also, lots more
  formats of message ID's could be added.
