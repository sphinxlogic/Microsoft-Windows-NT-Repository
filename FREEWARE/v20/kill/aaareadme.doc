BUILDING KILL.EXE

KILL.EXE is generated from the KILL, KILL_CLD, and KILL_MSG object files.
A command procedure, LINK.COM, is provided to link these object files.  It
will create an OpenVMS VAX executable when executed under OpenVMS VAX and
an OpenVMS AXP executable when executed unter OpenVMS AXP.

SETTING UP THE KILL COMMAND

The KILL command can be set up as either a DCL verb or a foreign command.
KILL.CLD has been provided to set up KILL as a DCL verb.  For information
on adding verbs to a command table, see the documentation on the SET
COMMAND command.  You will need to edit KILL.CLD and change the line

	IMAGE		MADGOAT_ROOT:[EXE]KILL.EXE

if this is not where you put KILL.EXE.	To set up KILL as a foreign
command, you need to define a symbol that points to KILL.EXE.  For example,

	$ KILL:==$MADGOAT_ROOT:[EXE]KILL.EXE

This symbol should be defined in a command procedure that will be executed
by the segment of the user population that needs access to KILL.
