<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>

<p><pre>
        COMPILE 
</pre>

<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
Use <b>COMPILE</b> to compile your finished INTOUCH programs. 
Compiled INTOUCH programs can be run from outside the INTOUCH environment. 
</dl>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<dl>
<dd>

<p>
<a name="index_x_107"></a>
<a name="index_x_108"></a>
COMPILE converts the program in current memory into an INTOUCH 
<b>RUN</b> file.  This RUN file can then be executed from 
outside the INTOUCH environment.  COMPILE <i>only</i> works on 
the program in current memory. 

<p>
When INTOUCH executes the COMPILE command, it compiles the source code and 
saves the compiled copy with the current workspace name and the extension 
<b>.RUN</b> (i.e. PRINT_NAME.RUN).  If a compiled version of the 
file already exists, INTOUCH compiles the new version, saves it and 
increments the version number by 1. 

<p>
You can run compiled programs by typing INTOUCH followed by the filename 
at the system prompt.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        $ INTOUCH print_name 
</pre>

<p>
The above command starts INTOUCH and runs the compiled version of the 
PRINT_NAME program.  When execution is complete, INTOUCH will be exited 
and you will return to the system prompt.

<a name="heading_2.3.14.1"><h3>2.3.14.1 Compiled Images</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_109"></a>

<p>
INTOUCH procedures and programs can also be compiled into fast-starting 
memory images.  These images are activated within two seconds, regardless 
of the size of the INTOUCH procedure or program.  The drawback of using 
compiled images is that they are very large.  The minimum size is 
approximately 500 disk blocks.  Image sizes increase in 256 block 
increments. 

<p>
INTOUCH images are compiled from outside the INTOUCH environment. 
To compile into an image, use the following command: 
<a name="index_x_110"></a>
<a name="index_x_111"></a>

<p><pre>
        $ INTOUCH/COMPILE filename 
 
    Example: 
 
        $ INTOUCH/COMPILE print_name 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="index_x_112"></a>
<a name="index_x_113"></a>
<a name="index_x_114"></a>
Compiled image files have a file extension of <b>.INT_IMG</b>
for VAX systems and <b>.INT_IMG_AXP</b> for Alpha AXP systems. 

<p><pre>
        $ INTOUCH/COMPILE CUSTOMER 
 
    will create: 
 
            CUSTOMER.INT_IMG            &lt;--- on VAX systems 
 
            CUSTOMER.INT_IMG_AXP        &lt;--- on AXP systems 
</pre>

<a name="index_x_115"></a>
<a name="index_x_116"></a>

<p>
You can run INTOUCH compiled images from outside of the INTOUCH environment. 
To run an image, use the following command format: 
<a name="index_x_117"></a>
<a name="index_x_118"></a>

<p><pre>
        $ INTOUCH/IMAGE filename 
 
    Example: 
 
        $ INTOUCH/IMAGE customer 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="index_x_119"></a>
To set up a DCL symbol to run an INTOUCH compiled image, use the 
following command format: 

<p><pre>
        $ symbolname :== '$INTOUCH_IMAGE filename/IMAGE' 
 
    Example: 
 
        $ MAINTAIN :== '$INTOUCH_IMAGE TTI_RUN:MAINTAIN/IMAGE'

The following command entered at the system prompt: 
<a name="index_x_121"></a>
<a name="index_x_122"></a>

<p><pre>
        $ INTOUCH/DEVELOP filename.INT 
 
    Example: 
 
        $ INTOUCH/DEVELOP sample_print.int 
</pre>

puts you into INTOUCH, OLD's in <i>filename.INT</i> and automatically 
replaces the file when you enter EXIT to exit INTOUCH. 

<p>
This command streamlines the file change procedures by performing these 
steps for you: 

<p><pre>
        $ INTOUCH               gets into the INTOUCH environment 
 
        OLD 'filename'          brings the file into the workspace 
 
        REPLACE 'filename'      after you make your changes and enter 
                                EXIT, INTOUCH adds "1" to the version 
                                number and replaces the file

GO resumes program execution after it has been interrupted.  Once execution 
has stopped, you can enter immediate mode and debug commands, change code, 
etc.  GO lets you resume execution even after changing code.  If a HALT 
or BREAK statement was used, execution resumes at the first statement after 
the HALT or BREAK.

If no <i>file_spec</i> is given, INTOUCH uses the current workspace 
name and the default extension <b>.INT</b>.  When INTOUCH executes 
the UNSAVE command, it searches for the file specified and then deletes 
that file.  The source program will still remain in current memory.

<a name="chapter_3"><h1>Chapter 3<br>Program Elements and Data in INTOUCH</h1></a>

<p>
This chapter describes the basic elements that make up an INTOUCH program. 
It also describes the types of data used with INTOUCH programs and how the 
data is processed. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.1"><h1>3.1 INTOUCH Program Elements</h1></a>
<a name="index_x_127"></a>
<a name="index_x_128"></a>
<a name="index_x_129"></a>
<a name="index_x_130"></a>
<a name="index_x_131"></a>

<p>
A program is a series of instructions.  These instructions describe 
how to manipulate data to produce a desired result.  You determine 
what data the program will manipulate, how the program will manipulate 
it and what the results of these manipulations will be. 

<p>
When you create a program, you must use instructions that INTOUCH 
understands.  The INTOUCH language provides these instructions.  The 
language consists of statements.  These statements are something 
like the words in this manual.  You put them together in a meaningful 
order and INTOUCH executes the program you write.  Here is an example 
of an INTOUCH program: 

<p><pre>
        10  INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$ 
        20  PRINT 'Hello, '; name$ 
            PRINT 'Today is '; day$ 
            PRINT name$; ', have a good '; day$ 
        30  END 
</pre>

<p>
The <b>INPUT</b> statement tells INTOUCH to ask for a name. 
The <b>PRINT</b> statements tell INTOUCH to print the information. 
<b>END</b> tells INTOUCH it has reached the end of the program. 

<p>
With INTOUCH, when you execute this program, it will look like this: 
<a name="example_3-1"></a>
Example 3-1  Executing an INTOUCH program

<p><pre>
<hr>
<b>INTOUCH</b>
 
10  INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$ 
20  PRINT 'Hello, '; name$ 
    PRINT 'Today is '; day$ 
    PRINT name$; ', have a good '; day$ 
30  END 
 
<b>INTOUCH</b>
 
RUN

Please enter your name? Julian 
Hello, Julian 
Today is Tuesday 
Julian, have a good Tuesday 
 
<b>INTOUCH</b>
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
<b>RUN</b> is a command.  RUN tells INTOUCH to perform the 
instructions you have given.  You will need to use commands as well as 
statements to develop your programs. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_132"></a>
<a name="index_x_133"></a>
When you run the above program, you will notice that the day is not asked 
for.  <b>DAY$</b> is a reserved word that INTOUCH uses to store 
the day in.  There are several other reserved words that INTOUCH uses.  
You can refer to Appendix B, Reserved Words to see a list of the 
reserved words. 

<p>
INTOUCH programs are modular in structure.  Every program can be 
divided into program units.  The main unit is the main body of the 
program.  This unit begins with the first program line and ends 
with the END statement. 

<p><pre>
    First program line --   10  INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$ 
                            20  PRINT 'Hello, '; name$ 
                                PRINT 'Today is '; day$ 
                                PRINT name$; ', have a good '; day$ 
         END statement --   30  END 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="index_x_134"></a>
<a name="index_x_135"></a>
Each program unit is made up of program lines.  A program line consists 
of one or more statements.  In the above example, line 20 has three 
statements.  If you include more than one statement in a line, you must 
<a name="index_x_136"></a>
<a name="index_x_137"></a>
<a name="index_x_138"></a>
separate the statements with a line terminator (a carriage return).  You 
can terminate a line from the keyboard by pressing the <kbd>Return</kbd>
or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$&lt;Return&gt; 
        20  PRINT 'Hello, '; name$&lt;Return&gt; 
            PRINT 'Today is '; day$&lt;Enter&gt; 
            PRINT name$; ', have a good '; day$&lt;Return&gt; 
        30  END&lt;Return&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
When INTOUCH executes a program, it starts at the lowest line number 
and executes all the statements in that program line.  Then it goes 
to the next sequential line number and executes all the 
statements in that line and so on. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_139"></a>
Multiple statements can be placed on a single line, delimited by the 
\ (backslash).  CHR$(10) also signals the same as a \. 
A \ terminating the line implies an "&amp;". 

<p><pre>
        10  FOR z1 = 4. to 7. STEP .5 \ PRINT z1 \ NEXT z1 
        20  END

<blockquote><strong><p align=center>Note</p>
Putting multiple statements on a single line is not recommended.  It 
makes changing code difficult and the logic flow is not easy to follow. 
</strong></blockquote><hr>

<p>
<a name="index_x_140"></a>
<a name="index_x_141"></a>
INTOUCH accepts line numbers in the range of <b>1</b> to 
<b>999999</b>.  Line numbers must be integers. 

<p>
INTOUCH allows programs with NO line numbers execpt, there must be 
a line <b>1</b> at the beginning of the program.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        1  PROGRAM print_name 
                ------- 
                ------- 
                -------

<a name="heading_3.1.1"><h2>3.1.1 Continuing Program Lines</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_142"></a>
<a name="index_x_143"></a>

<p>
You can continue a statement on the next physical line by using an 
<b>ampersand</b> (&amp;).  This allows you to continue a statement 
that is too long to fit on one line. 

<p>
To continue a statement, place the ampersand at the end of the continued 
line.  You can also place an optional ampersand at the beginning of the 
next line.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$ 
        20  PRINT 'Hello, '; name$ 
            PRINT 'Today is '; day$ 
            PRINT name$; &amp; 
                  ', have a good '; &amp;      ! required ampersand 
                  &amp; day$                   ! optional ampersand 
        30  END

<hr>
<blockquote><strong><p align=center>Note</p>
In the above example, the comment text follows the line continuation 
character (&amp;).  Whenever you comment a continued line, the exclamation 
mark <i>must</i> come AFTER the ampersand. 
</strong></blockquote><hr>

<p>
You can continue statements between words; however, you cannot break 
up a word. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.1.2"><h2>3.1.2 Labels</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_144"></a>
<a name="index_x_145"></a>

<p>
A <b>label</b> is a way to identify a place in a program.  
Labels must: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> begin with a letter
  <li> can be up to 31 characters long
  <li> can contain letters, digits and underscores
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
To use a label, put the label name on a program line and separate it 
from the following statement with a colon.  The label name can also be 
put on a line by itself and followed by multiple statements.  Both options 
are shown in the example below. 

<p><pre>
        10  ask_input:  INPUT 'Please enter your name': name$ 
        20  do_print: 
            PRINT 'Hello, '; name$ 
            PRINT 'Today is '; day$ 
            PRINT name$; ', have a good '; day$

<a name="index_x_148"></a>

<p>
INTOUCH programs have a default extension of <b>.INT</b> so, 
you do not have to use a file extension with your file name when using the 
INTOUCH commands (SAVE, UNSAVE, OLD, etc.).  It is recommended that you use 
this extension for all of your INTOUCH programs. 

<p>
INTOUCH source programs are saved as <b>text files</b>.  You can 
print the text files with the TYPE and PRINT commands, and edit them with 
any text editor. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2"><h1>3.2 Data in INTOUCH</h1></a>

<p>
Programs manipulate data.  The data can be numeric or textual, but the 
data must be presented according to the rules of the INTOUCH language. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.1"><h2>3.2.1 Data Types</h2></a>

<p>
INTOUCH accepts three basic types of data: 
<dl>
<dd>
<a name="index_x_149"></a>

<ol>
  <li> integer numbers 
<a name="index_x_150"></a>
  <li> real numbers 
<a name="index_x_151"></a>
  <li> and string (textual) data 
</ol>

</dl>

<p>
The following sections describe each of the three types of data. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.1.1"><h3>3.2.1.1 Integers</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_152"></a>
<a name="index_x_153"></a>

<p>
An <b>integer</b> number is a whole number with no fractional 
part.  The following are examples of integers: 

<p><pre>
                +5%       894%       -369004% 
</pre>

<p>
Integers can be positive or negative.  Integer constants can end with 
a trailing percent sign (%).  About integers: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> Names for integer variables, arrays or functions must be designated 
     by a trailing percent sign (%) or declared with a DECLARE statement. 
  <li> A negative integer constant is designated by a leading minus sign. 
  <li> A positive integer constant can be designated by a leading plus sign 
     or by the absence of a sign. 
  <li> Integers have a size of 32 bits. 
  <li> INTOUCH allows integer numbers anywhere in the range of -2147483648 
     to +2147483647. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.1.2"><h3>3.2.1.2 Real Numbers</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_154"></a>
<a name="index_x_155"></a>

<p>
A <b>real</b> number can have a fractional part.  The following 
are real constants: 

<p><pre>
              5.4             894.0              -369004 
</pre>

<p>
Real numbers can be positive or negative.  Any number that is not 
designated as an integer or a string is treated as a real number. 

<p>
<a name="index_x_156"></a>
A real number without a decimal point is called an 
<b>ambiguous constant</b>.  About real numbers: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> A variable, array or function whose name has no trailing % or $ 
     is treated as a real number unless it is declared. 
  <li> A negative real constant has a leading minus sign. 
  <li> A positive real constant can have a leading plus sign or no sign. 
  <li> Ambiguous constants are treated as real numbers with a fractional 
     part of 0.  (5 = 5.0) 
  <li> Real numbers have a size of 64 bits, a precision 15 decimal digits 
     and correspond to the VAX double floating point number. 
  <li> Real numbers can be anywhere in the range of -1.7E38 to +1.7E38. 
  <li> Real numbers have a precision of .29E-38 to 1.7E38. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.1.3"><h3>3.2.1.3 String Data</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_157"></a>
<a name="index_x_158"></a>

<p>
<b>String</b> data consists of text.  Text can be any characters. 
All of the following are valid string constants: 

<p><pre>
                 'Hello, Fred.' 
 
                 'Account number (##-####)' 
 
                 '65' 
</pre>

<p>
About string data: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> String constants must be enclosed in single or double matching 
     quotes.  String variables must be designated by a trailing dollar 
     sign ($) or declared with a DECLARE statement.  
  <li> A string can  contain up to 65535 characters. 
  <li> String variables are dynamic in length. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.2"><h2>3.2.2 BOOLEAN</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_159"></a>

<p>
<b>Boolean</b> variables represent either a TRUE or FALSE) 
condition.  These variables can be expressed with a trailing "?".  
For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  done? = FALSE 
            DO 
              INPUT 'Ready': ans$ 
              IF  _EXIT  THEN  done? = TRUE 
              IF  _BACK  THEN  done? = TRUE 
            LOOP UNTIL done? 
        20  END 
</pre>

<a name="heading_3.2.3"><h2>3.2.3 Expressions</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_160"></a>

<p>
<b>Expressions</b> can be: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> constants 
  <li> simple variables 
  <li> array elements.  Array elements are a type of variable.  
  <li> structure references.  Structure references are a feature of 
        the INTOUCH data structure system. 
  <li> substrings. 
  <li> compound expressions.  Compound expressions are any combination 
        of the above operands separated by operators. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.4"><h2>3.2.4 Constants</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_161"></a>

<p>
A <b>constant</b> is a value that does not change during a 
program execution.  Constants can be any of the three data types:  
integer numeric, real numeric or string. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.4.1"><h3>3.2.4.1 Numeric constants</h3></a>

<p>
<a name="index_x_162"></a>
Integer numeric constants are written with digits, with no decimal fraction. 
An integer constant can end with a percent sign.  Examples: 

<p><pre>
                235             412% 
</pre>

<p>

Real numeric constants are written with a sign, digits, and a decimal 
point.  For example, 5.38 is a real numeric constant.

<a name="heading_3.2.4.2"><h3>3.2.4.2 E Notation</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_164"></a>

<p>
E notation is a shorthand way of representing very large or very small 
numbers.  Real numeric constants can be written in E notation.  INTOUCH 
displays any real value of greater than 12 decimal digits in E notation. 
The format of E notation is: 

<p><pre>
                +/- number E +/- n 
</pre>

<p><a name="table_3-1"></a>
<table border>
  <caption><b>Table 3-1 E Notation</b></caption>
  <tr>
    <th align=center>Notation </th>
    <th align=center>Description </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+/- </td>
    <td>is the sign of the number (positive or negative). If no sign is given, the number is assumed to be positive.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>number </td>
    <td>is the number on which exponentiation is performed. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E </td>
    <td>exponentiation means "times 10 to the power of".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+/- </td>
    <td>is the sign of the exponent (positive or negative). If no sign is given, the exponent is assumed to be positive.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n </td>
    <td>is the exponent represented as one or more integer digits.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
If you wanted to represent 1000 in E notation, you would use: 

<p><pre>
                +1E3 
</pre>

<p>
This means "take 1 and multiply it by 10 to the 3rd power" which is 
1*(10^3) = 1000.  If you wanted to represent .01, you would use a 
negative exponent. 

<p><pre>
                1E-2 = 1*(10^-2) = .01 
</pre>

<a name="heading_3.2.4.3"><h3>3.2.4.3 String Constants</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_165"></a>
<a name="index_x_166"></a>

<p>
String constants must be enclosed in quotes.  The quotes are called 
<b>string delimiters</b>.  They tell INTOUCH where the string 
begins and ends.  The quotes are not considered part of the string.  
Everything within the quotes <i>is</i> considered part of the string.  
Note that the following strings are different: 

<p><pre>
        10  PRINT 'Account number (##-####)' 
        20  PRINT '    Account number     (##-####)' 
        30  END 
 
        RNH 
        Account number (##-####) 
            Account number     (##-####) 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="index_x_167"></a>
An empty string is called a <b>null string</b>.  A null string is 
indicated by a pair of quotes with nothing between them (""). 

<p>
String delimiters can be single quotes (') or double quotes ("). 
However, the quotes must match and be paired. 

<p>
Quotes can be included as part of a string by using them within the string 
delimiters.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        "Message 'Time to go home!'" 
</pre>

<p>
The string part of this is: 

<p><pre>
         Message 'Time to go home!' 
</pre>

<p>
The delimiter quotes can be used within a string, by repeating them 
twice.  For instance: 

<p><pre>
        "Message ""Time to go home!""" 
</pre>

<p>
The string part of this is 

<p><pre>
         Message "Time to go home!" 
</pre>

<a name="heading_3.2.5"><h2>3.2.5 Variables</h2></a>
<a name="index_x_168"></a>

<p>
<b>Variables</b> are a way of storing values that can change in 
the program during execution.  A variable names a storage location.  The 
<i>value</i> of the variable is stored in this location.  Here are 
two types of variables: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> Simple variables such as:  AVERAGE and NAME$ 
  <li> Array elements such as:  AVERAGE(3) and NAME$(2,12) 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
Two other constructs are used in ways similar to variables---you can 
use them in expressions and assign values to them: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> Substrings such as: NAME$[7:12] 
  <li> Structure references such as:  SALES(AVERAGE) and CLIENT(PHONE) 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
Variables are represented by a name consisting of a letter or a series 
of letters, numbers and underscore characters.  Variables: 
<dl>
<dd>

<ul>
  <li> must start with a letter. 
  <li> can be followed by a proper data type designation (% for integers 
        and $ for strings). 
  <li> can be declared explicitly. 
</ul>

</dl>

<p>
Some examples of valid variables are: 

<p><pre>
                TODAY$           X% 
                Z                INDEX 
</pre>

<p>
Variables can be integer numeric, real numeric or string.  Integer variables 
can only contain integer values.  If a real numeric value is assigned to an 
integer variable, INTOUCH rounds the real number and uses the resulting 
integer. 

<p>
String variable names can have a trailing dollar sign ($).  If numeric data 
is assigned to a string variable, an exception occurs. 

<p><pre>
                TODAY$           X$ 
                LAST_NAME$       ANSWER$ 
</pre>

<p>
A variable that is not followed by a $ or a % is treated as a real numeric 
variable unless it is declared.  If you assign string data to a real numeric 
variable, an error will result.  If you assign integer data to a real 
numeric variable, INTOUCH treats it as a real number with a fractional part 
of 0.  The following are examples of real numeric variables: 

<p><pre>
                INDEX                Z 
                COUNTER              AMOUNT 
</pre>

<p>
INTOUCH uses the last assigned value when a variable is referenced. 

<p>

<a name="heading_3.2.5.1"><h3>3.2.5.1 Arrays</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_169"></a>
<a name="index_x_170"></a>

<p>
An <b>array</b> is a variable that consists of a group of elements. 
Each element represents a storage location.  A different value can be 
assigned to each element.  Here is an example of an array: 

<p><pre>
                QUANTITY(1) 
                QUANTITY(2) 
                QUANTITY(3) 
                QUANTITY(4) 
                QUANTITY(5) 
</pre>

<p>
<a name="index_x_171"></a>
To indicate which element you want to access, you use numbers after the 
array name called <i>subscripts</i>.  The subscripts are enclosed 
in parentheses.  Example:  AMOUNT(3,2) 

<p>
Subscripts must be given as integers.  If a real numeric subscript is 
given, it will be rounded and the integer portion used.  Arrays can 
contain real numeric, integer or string values.  String and integer arrays 
are designated by placing the appropriate symbols after the array name and 
before the subscript.  For example: 

<p><pre>
                A$(5,10)        A%(5,10) 
</pre>

<p>
About arrays: 
<dl>
<dd>
<a name="index_x_172"></a>
<a name="index_x_173"></a>

<ul>
  <li> Arrays must be defined with the DIM statement and can be redefined 
        with the REDIM statement. 
  <li> Arrays can have up to 32 dimensions.  
  <li> An array can have as many elements as memory allows. 
  <li> Integer and string arrays must be designated by the appropriate 
        symbol (% for integers, $ for strings) or else they must be declared. 
  <li> Subscripts must be integers.  Real subscripts are rounded. 
  <li> Multiple subscripts must be separated by commas. 
  <li> The default low bound for an array is 1 or the number indicated with 
        the OPTION BASE statement. (See Section 10.1.3)
  <li> You can indicate the low bound explicitly with a TO clause:  
<br>         
DIM COSTS(5 TO 10) 
</ul>

</dl>

<a name="heading_3.2.5.2"><h3>3.2.5.2 Substrings</h3></a>
<a name="index_x_174"></a>

<p>
<b>Substrings</b> are a way to refer to a part of a string. 
The format of a substring is: 

<p><pre>
                str_var [begin : end] 
</pre>

<p>
<i>str_var</i> is the name of a string variable.  <i>begin</i>
is the position in the string where your substring begins.  <i>end</i>
is the position at which the substring ends.  For example, here is a string 
called ALPHABET$: 

<p><pre>
        10  alphabet$ = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' 
        20  PRINT alphabet$[9:14] 
        30  END 
 
        RNH 
        IJKLMN 
</pre>

<p>
The substring ALPHABET$[9:14] tells INTOUCH to begin at the ninth character 
and count to the 14th character.  Everything between and including these 
two positions makes up the substring.  Therefore, the substring is "IJKLMN". 

<p>
<i>begin</i> and <i>end</i> are integers.  If you give real 
numbers for these positions, INTOUCH rounds them and uses the remaining 
integers.  You can manipulate a substring like any other expression.  
You can store data in the substring.  And, you can use substrings to 
change the value of a string.  For example: 

<p><pre>
        10  LET a$ = 'Your tests are in.' 
        20  PRINT a$ 
        30  LET a$[6:10] = 'results' 
        40  PRINT a$ 
        50  END 
 
        RNH 
        Your tests are in. 
        Your results are in.
