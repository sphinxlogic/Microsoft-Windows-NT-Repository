JPEG, GRAPHICS, JPEG release 5 Image Compression/Decompression

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"real-world" scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its
strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not necessarily
identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have
identical output bits.  However, on typical images of real-world scenes, very
good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and amazingly
high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.
For more details, see the references, or just experiment with various
compression settings.
