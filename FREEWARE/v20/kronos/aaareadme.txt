Dear fellow Kronosites,

This is the first release of Kronos on the alpha, using ZIP, and distributed
via our web server.  So... please inform me by EMail if there are any missing
files or other problems.  I will update the .ZIP file as quickly as possible. 
Also, please keep those cards and letters coming.  We ARE maintaining Kronos,
it just doesn't happen very rapidly these days due to workload and the fact
that it does a pretty good job of the basic stuff.

If anyone needs VAX executables and doesn't have a FORTRAN compiler, let me
know and I will try to help you.  We still use Kronos on a VAX, but it is the
old version.  Still, I know of no incompatabilites except that some of the jobs
previously released haven't been ported yet.

Kronos is maintained with the help of my FPP program (full release included in
the .SOURCE directory), ZIP/UNZIP (widely available), and Todd Aven's MAKE (not
included, but the functioning of the MAKEFILE in the .SOURCE directory is
fairly self-evident - run FPP {if needed}, compile, and link {see link commands
in the makefile}).
