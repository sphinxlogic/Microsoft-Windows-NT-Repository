!
! This file is read by the Gen_Calendar program to create a calendar
! file for the coming year.
!
! Format:
!    MM/DD [Hflag] [job] [Descrip]
!        or
!    MM/num/day [Hflag] [job] 
!
! 'MM' is the month number.  'DD' is the day of the month.  'num' is the number
! of the week for calculated dates (e.g., 4 for 4th Monday) - 'num' is negative
! to count from the end of the month; 'day' is the day of the week for
! calculated dates (e.g., MON for 4th Monday).
!
! 'Hflag' is H for holiday or R for a reminder; otherwise a onetime job is expected.  
! Note that you must enter only one of 'HFlag' or 'job'.  If there
! is a description, it will be copied to the calendar file.  A reminder is a 
! job that is submitted two days before the
! date to send a reminder mail message... reminders are always moved up to
! Friday if they would otherwise appear over a weekend.
!
! Holidays are moved if they would naturally occur on a weekend.  If they
! fall on Saturday, move them to Friday; on Sunday, move them to Monday.
!
! Note that some holidays (especially religous) can not be calculated and
! must be entered manually if desired.  Also, some holidays can be arbitrarily
! moved (e.g., Memorial Day).
