PNG081, GRAPHICS, PNG V 0.81 and ZLIB v 0.95 libraries

readme.txt - for libpng 0.8

This is the second beta version of libpng 1.0.  I've updated most
of the stuff I want to before the final 1.0 version.  Remaining
to do are the medium memory model support (which I'll put in
as soon as we test this version), better dithering, and any bug
fixes and makefile/include additions.  I expect a third (and
perhaps final) beta after zlib is officially 1.0.

===================================================================

zlib 0.95 is a beta version of a general purpose compression library.
This should be the last version before the first official
version (1.0), so please test it now. (At least compile and run it with
"make test"). This version has no known bugs.

The data format used by the zlib library is described in the
files zlib-3.1.doc, deflate-1.1.doc and gzip-4.1.doc, available
in ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/doc.
