How to use the Bookreader-format Documentation
----------------------------------------------

The NEWSRDR documentation set is provided in a form suitable for use with
the VMS DECwindows Bookreader program (VMS V5.3 and later).  To view the
documents with Bookreader, use the following commands:

    $ DEFINE DECW$BOOK disk:[directory]
    $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:DECW$BOOKREADER

Where "disk:[directory]" is the location of the NEWSRDR files.

To integrate the NEWSRDR documentation into your system-wide Bookreader
library, SET DEFAULT to where the NEWSRDR files are and issue the following
commands:

    $ DEASSIGN DECW$BOOK
    $ APPEND LIBRARY.DECW$BOOKSHELF DECW$BOOK:LIBRARY.DECW$BOOKSHELF
    $ COPY NEWSRDR.DECW$BOOKSHELF,*.DECW$BOOK DECW$BOOK:/PROTECTION=W:RE
