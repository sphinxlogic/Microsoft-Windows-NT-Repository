MGBOOK is based on DECUS VTBOOK V1.4.

BUILDING MGBOOK.EXE

A command procedure, LINK.COM, is provided to link the object
libraries.  It will create an OpenVMS VAX executatble when executed on
an OpenVMS VAX system and an OpenVMS AXP executable when executed on
an OpenVMS AXP system.

SETTING UP THE MGBOOK COMMAND

The MGBOOK command can be set up as either a DCL verb or a foreign
command. MGBOOK.CLD has been provided to set up MGBOOK as a DCL verb. 
For information on adding verbs to a command table, see the
documentation on the SET COMMAND command.  You will need to edit
MGBOOK.CLD and change the line:

	IMAGE		MADGOAT_EXE:MGBOOK.EXE

if this is not where you put MGBOOK.EXE.  To set up MGBOOK as a
foreign command, you need to define a symbol that points to
MGBOOK.EXE.  For example,

	$ MGBOOK:==$MADGOAT_EXE:MGBOOK.EXE

This symbol should be defined in a command procedure that will be executed
by the segment of the user population that needs access to MGBOOK

With the addition of the /TAB qualifier, MGBOOK needs to be installed with
LOG_IO (LOG_IO is required to changed terminal characteristics like Tab). 
For example,

	$ INSTALL:==$INSTALL/COMMAND
	$ INSTALL ADD MADGOAT_EXE:MGBOOK.EXE/PRIV=LOG_IO

You should add some equivalent of the above to SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM (or
SYSTARTUP_V5.COM, if you're running VMS v5) to install MGBOOK at boot time.

THE MGBOOK COMMAND

Unlike VTBOOK, MGBOOK allows you to specify the name of a
.DECW$BOOKSHELF or .DECW$BOOK file to read.  Specify the name of the
file (including the device and directory if it is not located in
DECW$BOOK) as a parameter.  You will need to use the /BOOK qualifier
to denote a .DECW$BOOK file.

Help is available within MGBOOK by pressing the HELP or ? keys.

BOOKREADER FILES

MGBOOK uses the same logical names that Bookreader uses to build its
menus of shelves and books (DECW$BOOK and DECW$BOOKSHELF).  If you
wish to set up a different starting location for MGBOOK, you can
define MGBOOK_LIBRARY to point to that starting location. 
MGBOOK_LIBRARY works like DECW$BOOKSHELF, i.e., if you do not specify
a filename, then all .DECW$BOOKSHELF files in that directory will be
chosen.

ARROW-KEY USAGE IN CONTENTS AND INDEX

The up- and down-arrow keys work in a hierarchical manner when
browsing the contents and index of a book.  For example, with the
cursor on Chapter 1, pressing the down-arrow will take you to Chapter
2.  To reach section 1.1 from Chapter 1, you can press the right-arrow
key to take you to that level. From there, pressing right-arrow will
take to 1.1.1, while pressing down-arrow will take you to 1.2.

If you prefer non-hierarchical keys, use KP5 and KP6 to navigate the
trees.

DISABLING TERMINAL WIDTH CHANGES

As MGBOOK reads shelf and book files, it adjusts the terminal width to
fit the information to be displayed on the screen.  Due to the delays
that terminal width switching can cause, support was added for
disabling width changes. First, a /RESTRICT_WIDTH qualifier was added
to the MGBOOK command.  This qualifier disables terminal width
adjustments.  Second, restricting the terminal width can be toggled by
pressing the KP9 key.
