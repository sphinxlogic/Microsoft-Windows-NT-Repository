XMFRACT14, MOTIF TOYS, A freeware fractal generation program


      This is xmfract 1.4, an X11R[5/6] Motif program based upon a
      popular DOS freeware program named Fractint. It is a true graphic
      user interface quite different from that program.

      The program will calculate, display and manipulate over 90 discrete
      fractal types with very fast algorithms. Other features include zooming,
      animation (color cycling), color editing, spherical projection, and an
      amazing wealth of parameters. There are too many features to list here.

      Also included are dozens of ancillary files such as color map files,
      parameter files, formula files, and an extensive on-line help system.

      System requirements:
        The program is known run to under the following operating systems:
