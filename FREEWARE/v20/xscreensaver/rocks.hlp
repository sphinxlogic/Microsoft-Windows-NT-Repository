1 ROCKS 
Animation of flying through an asteroid field

SYNOPSIS

  $ rocks [-display host:display.screen] [-foreground color] 
          [-background color] [-window] [-root] [-count integer] 
          [-delay usecs] [-speed integer] [-norotate]

2 DESCRIPTION
The rocks program draws an animation of an asteroid field moving past
the observer (or vice versa).  Sometimes the observer picks up spin on Z axis.

2 OPTIONS
rocks accepts the following options:

   -window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

   -root
Draw on the root window.

   -count integer
Maximum number of rocks to draw on the screen at once.  Default 100.

   -speed integer
A measure of the speed with which the observer and the rocks pass each other,
from 1 to 100.  Default 100, meaning ``very fast.''  If you're on a slow 
display connection (the animation looks jerky) then try making this number 
smaller, and/or decreasing the number of rocks.

   -delay microseconds
Number of microseconds to delay between each frame.  Default 50000, meaning
about 1/20th second.  Compare and contrast with -speed, above.

   -norotate
Don't rotate the observer; just fly straight through the field.

2 ENVIRONMENT

   DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.

   XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

2 BUGS
There should be an option to display doppler shift (a gravity rainbow.)

Speed of rotation should be settable.

Default speed of rotation should be relative to forward velocity.
