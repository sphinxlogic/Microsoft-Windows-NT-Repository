1 HYPERCUBE 
2D projection of a 4d object

SYNOPSIS

  $ hypercube [-display host:display.screen] [-foreground color] 
              [-background color] [-color[0-7] color] [-xy float] [-xz float] 
              [-yz float] [-xw float] [-yw float] [-zw float] 
              [-observer-z int] [-window] [-root] [-mono] [-delay usecs]

2 DESCRIPTION
The hypercube program displays a wireframe projection of a hypercube
which is rotating at user-specified rates around any or all of its four axes.

2 OPTIONS
hypercube accepts the following options:

   -window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

   -root
Draw on the root window.

   -mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.

   -delay microseconds
How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation.
Default 100000, or about 1/10th second.

   -observer-z int
How far away the observer is from the center of the cube (the cube is one
unit per side.)  Default 5.

   -color0 color

   -color1 color

   -color2 color

   -color3 color

   -color4 color

   -color5 color

   -color6 color

   -color7 color
The colors used to draw the line segments bordering the eight faces of
the cube.  Some of the faces have only two of their border-lines drawn in
the specified color, and some have all four.

   -xw float

   -xy float

   -xz float

   -yw float

   -yz float

   -zw float
The amount that the cube should be rotated around the specified axis at
each frame of the animation, expressed in radians.  These should be small
floating-point values (less than 0.05 works best.)  Default: xy=0.01,
xz=0.005, yw=0.01.

2 ENVIRONMENT

   DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.

   XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
