        [-no-xor] [-transparent] [-non-transparent] [-additive] [-subtractive]

2 DESCRIPTION
The qix program bounces a series of line segments around its window.
This is truly the swiss army chainsaw of qix programs.  If you know of one
with more display modes, I want to know about it.

2 OPTIONS
qix accepts the following options:

   -window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

   -root
Draw on the root window.

   -mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.

   -segments integer
How many line segments should be drawn.  Default 50.

   -spread integer
How far apart the endpoints of one segment should be from the next.
Default 8.

   -size integer
The maximum distance one endpoint of a segment is allowed to be from
the opposite end of that segment.  Default 0, meaning unlimited.

   -count integer
How many qixes to draw.  Default 1.

   -color-shift degrees
If on a color display, the color of the line segments will cycle through
the spectrum.  This specifies how far the hue of each segment should be
from the next, in degrees on the HSV wheel.  Default 3.

   -delay microseconds
How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation.
Default 25000, or about 0.025 seconds.

   -random
The qix will wander around the screen semi-randomly.  This is the
default.

   -linear
The opposite of -random: the qix will travel in straight lines
until it reaches a wall, and then it will bounce.

   -solid
If this is specified, then the area between the line segments will be filled
in with the appropriate color, instead of the qix simply being composed
of one-pixel-wide line segments.  This option looks really good in color.

   -hollow
The opposite of -solid; this is the default.

   -xor
If this is specified, then qix segments will be drawn and erased with xor,
instead of being drawn in some color and erased in the background color.
This implies -mono, in that only two colors can be used.

   -transparent
If this is specified, and -count is greater than 1, then each qix
will be drawn in one color, and when they overlap, the colors will be mixed.
This only works on \fBPseudoColor displays.  This looks best in
conjuction with -solid.

   -non-transparent
Turns off -transparent.

   -additive
If -transparent is specified, then this option means that the colors
will be mixed using an additive color model, as if the qixes were projected
light.  This is the default.

   -subtractive
If -transparent is specified, then this option means that the
colors will be mixed using a subtractive color model, as if the qixes were
translucent filters.

2 ENVIRONMENT

   DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.

   XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
