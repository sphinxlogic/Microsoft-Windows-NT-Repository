1 HOPALONG 
Draw real plane fractals

SYNOPSIS

  $ hopalong [-display host:display.screen] [-foreground color] 
             [-background color] [-window] [-root] [-mono] [-count integer] 
             [-ncolors integer] [-timeout seconds] [-delay microseconds]

2 DESCRIPTION
The hopalong program generates real plane fractals as described in
the September 1986 issue of Scientific American.

2 OPTIONS
hopalong accepts the following options:

   -window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.

   -root
Draw on the root window.

   -mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.

   -count integer
How many pixels should be drawn before a color change.  Default 1000.

   -ncolors integer
How many colors should be used (if possible).  Default 100.
The colors used cycle through the hue, making N stops around 
the color wheel.

   -timeout seconds
How many seconds we should generate for before clearing the screen
and starting over.  Default 20.

   -delay microseconds
How long we should wait between drawing each pixel.  Default 0.

2 ENVIRONMENT

   DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.

   XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
