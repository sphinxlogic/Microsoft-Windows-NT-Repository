QI_ADD_SOUNDEX.DOC

QI_ADD_SOUNDEX is an optional utility program that reads a sequential
database input file and creates new SOUNDEX fields for those entries that
don't have one.

QI_ADD_SOUNDEX reads the NAME field from the input file and writes one
soundex number for each word found.  A soundex number is associated with
how a word sounds for use in 'sounds like' matches.

QI_ADD_SOUNDEX takes its arguments on the command line, so you must first
create a symbol to invoke the program:

SOUNDEX := $device:[path]QI_ADD_SOUNDEX.EXE

The syntax of the database build is:

SOUNDEX input [output]

If omitted, the output file name is the same as the input file.
