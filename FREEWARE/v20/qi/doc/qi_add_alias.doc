QI_ADD_ALIAS.DOC

QI_ADD_ALIAS is an optional utility program that reads a sequential
database input file and creates new ALIAS fields for those entries that
don't have one.

The format of an alias file is arbitrary - this program tries to create an
alias field in the for First.Last.  Other formats such as f-last, etc. are
also valid. 

There are four settings that QI_ADD_ALIAS can be compiled for:

last first => f-last
first last => f-last
last first => first.last
first last => first.last

By default, the third setting is used.

Each alias is checked to be unique; if another alias of the same name
exists, a digit will be appended to create a unique alias.

QI_ADD_ALIAS takes its arguments on the command line, so you must first
create a symbol to invoke the program:

ALIAS := $device:[path]QI_ADD_ALIAS.EXE

The syntax of the database build is:

ALIAS input [output]

If omitted, the output file name is the same as the input file.
