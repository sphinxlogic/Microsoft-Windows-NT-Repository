Add a Whois application that uses the API for its info.  Make that WHOIS++
(RFC1835).

For the paranoid the encrypted attribute fields could be stored encrypted by
some key compiled into qi and decrypted as needed.

Add a switch to qi_add_alias that will query an existing index file for
uniqueness.

Write a utility that:
  for every public indexed(?) field that has < 100(?) unique values,
  create an entry with the alias "<field>-list" that contains a list
  of the unique values, one per "other" field record.
