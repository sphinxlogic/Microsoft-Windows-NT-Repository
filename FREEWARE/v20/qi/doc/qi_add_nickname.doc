QI_ADD_NICKNAME.DOC

QI_ADD_NICKNAME is an optional utility program that reads a sequential
database input file and creates new NICKNAME fields for those entries that
don't have one.

The program just builds a record of all the nicknames for the first name(s)
found in an entry's NAME field.

QI_ADD_NICKNAME takes its arguments on the command line, so you must first
create a symbol to invoke the program:

NICK := $device:[path]QI_ADD_NICKNAME.EXE

The syntax of the database build is:

NICK input [nicknames] [output]

If omitted, the output file name is the same as the input file.
If omitted, the nicknames file is NICKNAMES.TXT.
