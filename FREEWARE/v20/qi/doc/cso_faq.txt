Q1  QI_MAKE gets an ACCVIO in build_str.
A1  You must specify a virtual field number for each %s in the format string.

Q2  QI_BUILD either (1) gives SORT-E-LBL record too long errors
    (2) runs out of scratch disk space or (3) takes a very long time to sort.
A2  The sort routines appear to rely on the RMS LRL attribute, which can be
    wrong or set to 32767.  A work around is to (1) CONVERT the input file to
    itself or (2) SET FILE/ATTR=LRL=135 database.dat before running QI_BUILD.
    (1) generally applies to VAXC/VMS V5.x, (2) generally applies to
    DECC/VMS V6.x.  The utilities in V3.08 create a variable length record
    database file which solves this problem.

Q3  I get several "Duplicate index:" messages from QI_BUILD.
A3  If they are numeric fields, it is simply that multiple parts of a name
    field map to the same soundex value.  This is common and causes no harm.

Q4  I can't get qi to read the configuration file!
A4  You probably don't have the logical name CSO_CONFIG defined /SYSTEM/EXEC.
    See the troubleshooting section of WHAT.TXT.

Q5  The log file shows junk or UNKNOWN as the host name.
A5  MultiNet versions prior to V3.4 did not nave a private translation for
    getpeername() and MAKE_QI.COM had to include "/prefix=(all,
    except=getpeername)" to the CC command lines for certain modules.
    Since V3.4 came out, these switches have been removed.

Q6  I want to produce a report from the CSO data files.
A6  The .DATA file is a simple RMS indexed file that can be read sequentially.
    Anything that can generate reports (4GL, COBOL report writer, Datatrieve
    or even DCL scripts) can be used.

Q7  I want to restrict access to a field.
A7  If you define CSO_DOMAIN to be "my.domain", any field that is defined
    LocalPub will only be accessed by nodes in "my.domain".
