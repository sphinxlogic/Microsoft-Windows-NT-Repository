Hal,

The sendmail.el was modified to use run-dcl-command with
"emacs_sendmail". To use, compile the vmssendmail.c program with
sys$library:vaxcrtl/lib. Then setup a foreign symbol, e.g.:

	$ emacs_sendmail :== "$emacs_library:[etc]vmssendmail"

before starting Emacs. That should do it.

Please let me know if you make changes or find problems.

Enjoy.

Regards,

jam
