Fri Aug  5 14:39:01 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Changed the dependencies on HW_NAME to
	be dependent on HW_MODEL instead.  That is more accurate.
	Also, if the VMS version on AXP is other than 1.x, assume
	it is the regular VMS distribution with the same version
	numbering as for VAX, and thus use the `vms*.h' files instead
	of `avms*.h'.

	* descrip.mms_in(all, [.vms]runtemacs.com): Now builds
	[.vms]runtemacs.com, which is used by [.vms]testemacs.com
	from now on.
	* descrip.mms_in([.vms]config.dat): Do not write empty lines,
	nor the configuration string.
	* descrip.mms_in([.vms]): Added compilation of hackdebug.exe
	* descrip.mms_in([.vms]emacs_startup.com): Made
	gnu_generate_string.com write to emacs_startup.com_tmp
	instead of emacs_startup.com.
	clause.

	* README: Corrected a typo.

Tue Jun 28 13:17:46 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* kepteditor.com: Modified to allow several Emacs from one
	xterm when using DEC Windows.

Sat May 21 22:01:51 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Added [.vms]compvmslib.com as yet a file
	to be created by AC_OUTPUT.

	* descrip.mms_in(do-install): Correctly handle old directory
	entries to emacs-<version>.* and rebuild-emacs-<version>.com.

Fri May 20 13:46:46 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: corrected a few documentation errors.
	Made sure all the boolean strings were in upper case.
	Removed the crazyness with accumulating logical names.  It's
	done in the description file instead.  Removed
	[.vms]emacs_startup.dat from the AC_OUTPUT call.  It is also
	fixed in the description file.

	* descrip.mms_in: changed to setup a configuration file,
	called 	config.dat.  This one now holds the data about the
	paths we might need to resolve the logical names of.
	Now, the different subdirectory are represented as different
	tergets.
	The installation target has been divided in several targets,
	To make it possible to install with or without the GNU startup
	database.  Installation of the database file is a separate
	terget as well.
	The creation of emacs_startup.dat and emacs_startup.com is
	done here now.
	The file rebuild.com is installed as rebuild-emacs.com.
	The directory [.vms] is also cleaned now.
	MMS$QUALIFIERS has been corrected to MMSQUALIFIERS.
	$(vmssrcdir)delete.com is now fully used instead of `delete'.

Sun May  1 22:33:36 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Removed the processing of the startup data
	file, and the creation of config.logicals.

	* descrip.mms_in: Now creates the file config.data from all the
	values that are defined in descrip.mms.  Also handles all the
	creation and installation of the startup command file through
	the script vms/gnu_install_startup.com.

Thu Mar 24 10:47:41 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms_in: Now, mkdir also creates $(startupdir).
	Also, for those who do not want a startup database for GNU
	stuff, the installation target install_no_database can be
	used.

Sun Mar 20 18:34:50 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* aclocal_vms.m4: Changed the macro VMS_ACCUMULATE_LOGICAL so it
	wouldn't barf so hardly on bogus logical names.  Added the macro
	VMS_INSERT_LOGICALS which replaces @all_logicals@ with all the
	accumulated logical names in a given file.

	* configure.com_in: Removed som silly bugs.  Added the possibility
	to take arguments from a file.  Changed the argument parser to not
	use so much if..else..endif nesting.  Made some changes to addapt
	to the new startup file policy.

	* descrip.mms_in: Changed to produce the file emacs_startup.com.
	Changed the installation of the startup file.

Wed Feb 23 00:36:24 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* configure.com_in: Added the debug_hack feature, which permits
	us to make a runable Emacs with all the debug info included.
	Also added the reference to [.vms]makepaths.com.  And of course,
	a few bugs are fixed.

	* descrip.mms_in: A few bugs removed.  Also writes some info about
	how one might install Emacs during bootup.

Sun Feb  6 21:35:26 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* aclocal_vms.m4: New file, containing a few extra Autoconf
	macros which are used for the VMS configuration script.

	* configure.com_in: Added support to force creation of
	config.status, even if Emacs is already configured.  Also
	added two new directories:  `startupdir' to know where to
	put emacs_startup.com, and vuelibdir, to know where to put
	emacs_vue.com (used with DECWindows).

	* descrip.mms_in: General clean up, and added support for
	`startupdir' and `vuelibdir'.

	* Makefile.in (src/Makefile, lib-src/Makefile, oldXMenu/Makefile):
	  If these files are out of date, simply have config.status
	  rebuild them; don't rebuild them explicitly.

Sat Sep 25 12:00:38 1993  Brian Fox  (bfox@ai.mit.edu)

	and set vpath_sed to use vpath.sed script.

Fri Sep 10 01:18:13 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Test for availability of bcopy functions, searching
	the X libraries if we're using X.

	XScreenResourceString function.

Fri Jul 30 20:54:58 1993  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@frob.eng.umd.edu)

	* configure.in: If we found X on our own, set C_SWITCH_X_SITE and

	* Version 19.17 released.

	* Makefile.in (src/Makefile): Propagate C_SWITCH_SYSTEM to the src
	directory's makefile.  This allows the invocation of CPP which
	builds xmakefile to receive these switches.  The SunSoft C
	preprocessor inserts spaces between tokens if it doesn't get the
	-Xs flag requested in src/s/sol2.h.

Mon Jul 12 14:43:38 1993  Frederic Pierresteguy  (F.Pierresteguy@frcl.bull.fr)

	* configure.in (CPP): Autoconf sets this to a shell variable
	reference, which doesn't work when it's edited into a makefile.
	Expand that variable reference.

	* Makefile.in (CPP): New variable.
	(src/Makefile): Edit CPP into src/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in (src/Makefile): Don't bother exiting single quotes
	and entering double quotes to get the values of LD_SWITCH_X_SITE
	and the other make variables; make substitutes them in anyway.

	* Makefile.in (uninstall): Don't remove the lisp and etc
	directories if they're in the source tree.

        Bring mumbleclean targets into conformance with GNU coding standards.
	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean, clean): Separate these two; just have
	them pass the request to the subdirectory makefiles.
	(distclean): Pass the request down, and then get rid of the
	files configure built, and get rid of the Makefiles.
	(realclean): Pass the request down, and then do the same things
	distclean does.
	(uninstall, info, dvi): New targets.

	* configure.in: Move clause for PC-compatible i386 box to the end
	of the case statement, to avoid masking configurations below.

	* configure.in: Add support for HP/UX versions 7, 8, and 9 on
	the HP 68000 machines.

	* configure.in: Put the arguments to LD_SWITCH_X_SITE's and
	C_SWITCH_X_SITE's -L and -I switches in quotes, so the
	preprocessor won't fiddle with them.

Sun Jun 13 04:23:31 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (TAGS): cd to src to run etags.

Sat Jun 12 05:54:23 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	and random, and see if we have -lXbsd.

Fri Jun 11 02:35:54 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Pass "-Isrc" to the CPP we run to examine the
	s/*.h and m/*.h files.  Martin Tomes
	<mt00@controls.eurotherm.co.uk> says ISC Unix 3.0.1 needs it.

	* Version 19.13 released.

	* configure.in (CFLAGS): Don't set this according to the value of
	the GCC shell variable.  Instead, consult the machine and system
	files for the values of C_OPTIMIZE_SWITCH and C_DEBUG_SWITCH, and

Mon Jun  7 13:53:54 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in (machine): Fix the versions in hpux version number test.

	* Version 19.12 released.

	* Makefile.in (do-install): Correct previous etc-copying change.
	Partially rewrite using `if'.
	(src/Makefile): Insert --x-libraries option into LD_SWITCH_X_SITE.

	* Version 19.11 released.

	* configure.in: Handle 386bsd.

Sun May 30 15:37:57 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Use s/bsd4-3.h for mips-mips-riscos4, and add
	the configuration name mips-mips-usg* to represent USG systems.

	* configure.in: Fix logic to detect if srcdir is already configured.

	* Makefile.in: Pass in LD_SWITCH_X_SITE.

	* Makefile.in (mkdir, clean, mostlyclean, do-install): Use `(cd
	foo && pwd)` instead of `(cd foo ; pwd)` to get the canonical name
	of a directory; cd might fail, and have pwd print out the current
	directory.

Sun May 30 14:55:24 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: When looking for sources, use '.', not `.`.  Also '..'.

Sun May 30 14:23:50 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Complain if srcdir points at an already-configured
	tree.

Sun May 30 00:15:27 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 19.10 released.

Sat May 29 16:52:24 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Use Makefile comments, not C comments.

	* configure.in: Add case for the Tektronix XD88.

Sat May 29 16:30:13 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Handle sysv4.2 and sysvr4.2.

Sat May 29 15:30:00 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Traverse the argument list without destroying it;
	don't use shift.  It turns out that "set - ${saved_arguments}"
	doesn't work portably.

	* configure.in: Add missing "fi".

	* make-dist: Rebuild configure if configure.in is newer.

	* Makefile.in (src:, lib-src:, FRC:): force the src and lib-src
	targets to be executed even if make remembers that it has already
	stisfied FRC.

Sat May 29 02:09:15 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (do-install): Delete redundant code to copy etc twice.

Fri May 28 00:31:48 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Make a `site-lisp' directory in the distribution,
	instead of a `local-lisp' directory, which hasn't been the
	appropriate name for a long time.
	* Makefile.in (@rip_paths@locallisppath): Use site-lisp directory
	from the distribution first, then /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp.

	* Makefile.in (do-install): Correctly detect if ./etc and
	${srcdir}/etc are the same.

	* configure.in: Extract UNEXEC from the system configuration
	files, compute the name of the source file corresponding to the
	object file, and #define it as UNEXEC_SRC in config.h.

	* configure.in: If srcdir is '.', then try using PWD to make it
	absolute.

	* configure.in: Include ${srcdir} in the printed report, to help
	people notice if it's an automounter path.

Thu May 27 23:23:58 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in (prefix): Don't run pwd on srcdir unnecessarily.

Thu May 27 18:01:54 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (do-install): Delete the dest dir, not the source dir,
	when they are different.  Add  `shift' command.
	(COPYDESTS, COPYDIR): Delete external-lisp dir.
	(externallispdir): Var deleted.

	* configure.in: Delete spurious paren outputting short_usage.

Thu May 27 02:35:32 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 19.9 released.

Wed May 26 14:23:27 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (${SUBDIR}): Pass the value of the make variable to
	subdirectory makes.

	* make-dist: Check for .elc files with no corresponding .el file.

	* Makefile.in (mkdir): Make all the directories in locallisppath.

	* config.guess: New file.
	* configure.in: Use it, tentatively.
	* INSTNALL: Mention its usage.

	* configure.in (hppa-hp-hpux): Use uname -r instead of uname -m;
	the former gives you the operating system rev directly.  Use
	s/hpux.h if we don't recognize what we got.

	* Makefile.in (do-install): Don't remove a destination directory
	if it's the same as the source.  If ${srcdir}/info == ${infodir},
	don't try to copy the info files.

	* Makefile.in (COPYDIR, COPYDESTS): Don't mention etc twice; this
	doesn't work if you're not using a separate source directory.
	(do-install): Copy the build tree's etc directory only after
	making sure it's not also the source tree's etc directory.

Wed May 26 13:43:01 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Handle sunos4.1.3 specially.

Tue May 25 12:47:10 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (INSTALL): Add definition.

	* configure.in: Fix some messages.  Support -with-gnu-cc.
	At the end, use `set --', not `set -'.
	Delete spurious `.h' in hpux alternatives.

Tue May 25 05:15:14 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 19.8 released.

Tue May 25 00:55:45 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: When looking for source in the same directory as
	the configure script, make the path thus discovered absolute.
	If the user specifies the `--srcdir' switch, make that directory
	absolute too.

	* Makefile.in (srcdir): Remove comment saying this doesn't work.

	* Makefile.in (src/paths.h): Edit the `infodir' variable into this
	too, as the value of the PATH_INFO macro.

	* configure.in: Check to see if the source lives in the same
	directory as the configure script.

Mon May 24 12:14:41 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install): Split this into `install' and
	`do-install', to give people more control over exactly what gets
	done.
	(do-install): New target, containing the guts of `install'.  Don't
	remove and recreate the directories inside the copying loop - do
	it all before the copying loop.  Pass more flags to the lib-src
	make.
	(mkdir): Create ${infodir}, ${mandir}, and ${sitelispdir} here, to
	avoid errors and warnings.

	* configure.in: For generic IBM PC boxes, insist on "unknown" for
	the manufacturer - the more general case was blocking other i386
	configuration names below, and that's how the names are written in
	MACHINES anyway.

	* make-dist: When breaking links, remove the link before moving
	the copy onto it, to avoid interactive behavior.

	* Makefile.in: Doc fix.

	* configure.in: Doc fix.

	* INSTALL: Mention --exec-prefix option.

	* configure.in: Add support for the `--exec-prefix' option.
	* Makefile.in: Accept that support.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_PROG_INSTALL macro.
	* Makefile.in (INSTALL): Variable removed.
	(INSTALL_PROGRAM, INSTALL_DATA): Accept these values from configure.

	* configure.in: Distinguish between hp800's and hp700's by calling
	"uname -m".

Mon May 24 00:12:26 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

        * configure.in: Recognize configuration names for i860 boxes
	running SYSV.

Sun May 23 00:37:44 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Distinguish between hp800's and hp700's by the
	version of HP/UX they run, since that's something people are more
	likely to know - hp700's run 8.0.
	Add HP 700 configuration.

	* configure.in: Test for the presence of the `rename' function.

	* Makefile.in (C_SWITCH_X_SITE): New variable - get this from
	configure.in.
	(oldXMenu/Makefile): Edit C_SWITCH_X_SITE into this.

	* make-dist: Break intra-tree links.

	* configure.in: Explain that this is an autoconf script, and give
	instructions for rebuilding configure from it.  Arrange to put
	comments in configure explaining this too.

	* configure.in: Make the first line of the configure script be
	"#!/bin/sh".  Leaving the first line blank didn't work.

	* configure.in (long_usage): Removed; made short_usage describe
	the options briefly.

	* configure.in: Implement the --prefix option.
	* Makefile.in (prefix): Add support for it here.
	* INSTALL: Document it here.

	* Makefile.in (install): Don't assume that the files in the `info'
	subdirectory match  *.info.  They don't have that prefix.

Sat May 22 22:53:24 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Add case for version 5 of Esix.

Sat May 22 17:24:06 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

        * Version 19.7 released.

	* make-dist: There aren't any *.com files in lib-src anymore.

	* make-dist: Copy texinfo.tex and texindex.c, rather than linking
	them; they're symlinks to other filesystems on the GNU machines.

	* make-dist: Check that the manual reflects the same version of
	Emacs as stated in lisp/version.el.  Edit that version number into
	the README file.

Fri May 21 17:32:41 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Remove the hack of AC_DEFINE; use
	AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED.

Thu May 20 01:24:24 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't distribute precomp.com, compile.com, or
	link.com from ./src; they're in ./vms now.

	Some time-handling patches from Paul Eggert:
	* configure.in: Add AC_TIMEZONE.

Wed May 19 20:56:26 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Recognize Linux as a valid operating system for
	the i386.

Tue May 18 16:31:50 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Distribute some VMS files we got from Richard Levitte.

	* Makefile.in (oldXMenu/Makefile): Take oldXMenu/Makefile.in as
	the source for the sed command, not oldXMenu/Makefile.

Mon May 17 19:33:55 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* INSTALL: Don't claim the srcdir option doesn't work.

Sun May 16 18:41:27 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: Include remarks saying what order the autoconf
	tests should go in, and remind people to change config.h.in
	whenever they add autoconf tests which make #definitions.

	* make-dist: Distribute oldXMenu/Makefile.in, not oldXMenu/Makefile.

Sat May 15 16:47:50 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (oldXMenu/Makefile): Make this depend on
	${srcdir}/oldXMenu/Makefile.in, not itself.

	* PROBLEMS: Some updates from David J. Mackenzie.

	More changes from David J. Mackenzie.
	* Makefile.in (install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix): Targets
	removed; autoconf and config.h should specify all these
	differences.
	(buildlisppath): Make this path depend on ${srcdir}.
	(INSTALLFLAGS): Removed.
	(INSTALL): Include the -c flag.
	(install): Change the way we invoke install accordingly.

	Install ${srcdir} changes from DJM.
	* Makefile.in (SUBDIR_MAKEFILES): Add oldXMenu/Makefile to this
	list.
	(COPYDIR, COPYDESTS): Install files from both the etc directory in
	the source tree and the etc directory in the object tree.
	(${SUBDIR}): Pass the prefix variable down to submakes.
	(everywhere): Use `sed', not `/bin/sed'.  Not all systems have sed
	in /bin.
	(lib-src/Makefile, src/Makefile, oldXMenu/Makefile): Edit in
	values for srcdir and VPATH.
	(install): Add `v' flag to tar command.  Make sure that `dir'
	exists in ${srcdir}/info before copying it.  Remember that the man
	pages come from the source tree, not the object tree.
	* configure.in: Remove remarks saying that the --srcdir option
	doesn't work.
	Create the etc directory in the object tree.
	Recognize configuration names of the form *-sun-solaris*.
	Recognize sunos5 and solaris as operating system names.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME macro, for
	lib-src/getdate.y and src/systime.h.

Sat May 15 00:12:26 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Make links in info subdir.

Thu May 13 15:28:19 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: Call AC_STDC_HEADERS.

Mon May 10 15:19:03 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Sidestep autoconf's quoting of the second argument
	of AC_DEFINE, so we can specify the value to put there.  It would
	be nice if autoconf provided some way to specify computed values
	for macros.

Sun May  9 17:30:48 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (DEFS): Deleted; since we're using AC_CONFIG_HEADER,
	this is always just -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.

	The GNU coding standards specify that CFLAGS should be left for
	users to set.
	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure determine the default value
	for this.  Don't
	have it default to DEFS.
	(${SUBDIR}): Pass CFLAGS down to submakes, not DEFS.
	(lib-src/Makefile, src/Makefile): Edit the default value for
	CFLAGS into these files, not DEFS.
	* configure.in (CFLAGS): Choose a default value for this - "-g"
	normally, or "-g -O" if we're using GCC.  Edit it into the
	top-level Makefile.

	* configure.in: When scanning the machine and system description
	#include files, write their names to conftest.c properly.

Fri May  7 00:57:13 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: In configuration name case for Apallos running
	Domainios, set opsys, not opsysfile.

	* configure.in: Use the autoconf AC_CONFIG_HEADER macro to produce
	src/config.h, instead of AC_OUTPUT; the latter overwrites
	src/config.h even when it hasn't changed, puts a makefile-style
	comment at the top even though it's C code, and produces a
	config.status script which doesn't do the job right.

	* configure.in: Add AC_LN_S test, so we can tell whether or not we
	can use a symbolic link to get the X Menu library into src.
	* Makefile.in (LN_S): New variable.
	(src/Makefile): Edit the value of LN_S into this makefile.

Thu May  6 14:03:16 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Support *-sco3.2v4* as opsystem.

	* make-dist: Don't include calc directory.
	Exclude many files in the man directory; copy a few.

Tue May  4 10:15:32 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Use AC_HAVE_HEADERS to test for sys/time.h, and
	call AC_STRUCT_TM to see what's in time.h.

	* configure.in: Employ quoting stupidity to get the value of CPP
	to expand properly.

Tue Apr 27 13:00:28 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: Use the AC_PROG_CPP macro, and then use the CPP
	variable to scan the machine and system description files.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_HAVE_HEADERS to check for sys/timeb.h,
	so that getdate.y builds correctly.

Mon Apr 26 19:11:45 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in (tempcname): Change this to "conftest.c", so it will
	work properly on systems with short filenames; this is the name
	autoconf uses.

	* configure.in: Also detect the availability of dup2 and
	gethostname.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_ALLOCA test.
	* Makefile.in (ALLOCA): New variable, to be set by ./configure.
	(lib-src/Makefile): Edit the value of ALLOCA into lib-src/Makefile.

Sat Apr 24 23:41:48 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Distribute configure, as well as configure.in.
	Oversight.

Fri Apr 23 17:32:12 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install): Print out the name of the directory we're
	copying, so people can have some idea of whether we're making
	progress.

	* Makefile.in (install.aix, install.xenix, install.sysv, install):
	Don't forget to re-create the COPYDESTS directories after we clear
	them out.

Tue Apr 13 00:58:01 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Add autoconf cookies so that the configure
	script can comment out sections of path variable definitions to
	choose between the installable configuration and the run-in-place
	configuration.
	* configure.in: Add new option `--run-in-place', to select the
	run-in-place path definitions.

	* configure.in: Add a clause to the big configuration name case
	for the NeXT machine.

Mon Apr 12 22:20:30 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install, install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix):
	Make sure that each source directory exists, and is different from
	the destination directory; then, delete the destination before
	copying over the source.

	* make-dist: Distribute configure.in, instead of configure.

Sat Apr 10 04:29:06 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Don't set CC to "gcc -O" if the user specifies
	`--with-gcc'.  Add -O to DEFS if GCC is set.

Fri Apr  9 07:20:40 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (clean mostlyclean): Missing right paren.

	* configure.in: When checking for X windows, search for an X11
	subdirectory of ${x_includes}.

	* configure.in: Check for gettimeofday function, for getdate.y.

        Change `configure' to a mixture of custom code and autoconf stuff.
	autoconf can't derive all the information we need, but we'd really
	like to be able to take advantage of some of its tests, and its
	file-editing facilities.
	* configure.in: Renamed from configure.
	Quote the sections of shell script we want copied literally to 
	the configure scri
