   Basic instructions:
    It's Galaga, you know how to play Galaga, stop bothering me.
    (Ship follows the mouse, button fires.  Auto-fire by holding it
     down, so no-one accuses me of breaking their mouse!)
 
  Keyboard commands:

    p - pauses
    q - end this game
    b - Toggle buffering (flicker vs. speed.)
    o - Toggle OR mode.  Don't use this, it sucks.
