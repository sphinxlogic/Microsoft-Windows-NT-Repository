[Comments Section]

Disk parameters are as follows (in order of occurrence in the line):

bus       -   arbitrary character string of 1-15 bytes used to match disks & controllers
MTBF      -   in hours. Used in data reliability calculations
RPM       -   used in performance calculations
sectors   -   sectors per track (only user data sectors)
data rate -   spiral data rate in KBytes/second
seek time -   for reads (in msec)
seek time -   for writes (in msec)
capacity  -   in MBytes

(The disk name on the left side of the equals sign shows in the
Disk Type window. It is an arbitrary string of up to 15 bytes.)

Controller parameters are as follows (in order of occurrence in the line):

bus       -   arbitrary character string of 1-15 bytes used to match disks & controllers
bandwidth -   in bytes/second
drives    -   maximum physical connectivity
requests  -   controller capability in requests/second

(The controller name on the left side of the equals sign shows in the
Subsystem Type window. It is an arbitrary string of up to 15 bytes.)
