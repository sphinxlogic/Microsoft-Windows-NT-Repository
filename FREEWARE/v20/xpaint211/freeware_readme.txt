XPAINT211, MOTIF TOYS, Simple Paint program for X Window system

XPaint is a color image editing tool which features most standard paint program
options. It allows for the editing of multiple images simultaneously and
supports various formats, including PPM, XBM, TIFF, etc.

The functionality of XPaint is divided into a toolbox area for selecting the
current paint operation and paint windows for modifying/creating images.  Each
paint window has access to its own color palette and set of patterns, although
the paint operation in use is globally selected for all windows.

XPaint runs on a variety of displays.  It should be noted that saving images
will adapt them to the current display type (i.e. a color image loaded on a
greyscale screen will be saved as a grey image).

There is also an extensive on-line help system available.
