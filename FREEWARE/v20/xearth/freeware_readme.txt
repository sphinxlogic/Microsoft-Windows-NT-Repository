XEARTH, MOTIF TOYS, Displays a shaded image of the Earth in the root window

    Xearth sets the X root window an image of the Earth, as seen from
    your favorite vantage point in space, correctly shaded for the
    current position of the Sun. By default, xearth forks a child
    process that runs in the background, updating the displayed image
    every five minutes to reflect changes in the Sun's position.
    Xearth can also render directly into PPM and GIF files instead of
    drawing in the root window. See the man page for details.
