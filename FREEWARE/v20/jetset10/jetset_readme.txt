
	Jet-Set Willy, v1.0  by <Florent.Guillaume@ens.fr>


This is a version of Jet-Set Willy for the X Window System.

It is really a clone of "Jet-Set Willy 2" that I had on my Amstrad.  The
original Amstrad version was copyright 1985 Software Projects, the
programming was done by D.P.Rowson & S.Wetherill, from an idea by
Matthew-JET-SET-Smith.

The game can run on a color or monochrome display.  I don't know what
happens on a grayscale monitor ; if something is wrong, you can always
use the -mono command line option to force two-color display, which
should work everywhere.

There is a high score table, and a (non-scoring) discovery mode.  You
also have 500 lives instead of 8, which is a big improvement on the
8-bit version...


Please note that tvtwm has a bug dealing with colormaps which can make
it crash, read the PROBLEMS file.



Jet-Set Willy has been tested on the following platforms :

Sun SparcStation	(sparc)		SunOS 4.1.3
DECStation 5000/200	(R3000)		Ultrix V4.0
DECStation 3000/500	(alpha)		OSF/1 V1.2

with servers:

MIT X11R5	8-bit PseudoColor
MIT X11R5	Monochrome
