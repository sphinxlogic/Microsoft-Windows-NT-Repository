			ALPHA ONLY DEMO

The MPEG_PLAY viewer is supplied with a few example clips.  The demo
will play one of them.

The source is provided, as well as instructions on how to build the
player.  The player is from the Free Software Foundation.

NOTE:	The demo is built for the Alpha architecture only.  To use
	on the VAX, you will need to rebuild using VAXC.  MPEG
	decompression is very compute intensive, the Alpha systems
	are highly recommended.
