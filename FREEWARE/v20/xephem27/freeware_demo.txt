Xephem 2.7.1 for OpenVMS                             September 1995
========================

You can run XEPHEM via FREEWARE_DEMO.COM procedure.


Optionnaly:

XEPHEM.DAT may be placed under SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER] or under
SYS$LOGIN:

If you want an access to the stars and objects databases, you need to define
a directory tree pointed by the rooted logical XEPHEM_DIR:

$ define/trans=conc XEPHEM_DIR disk:[directory.xephem.]

Under XEPHEM_DIR, you need at least AUXIL, EDB and WORK directories:

$ dir xephem_dir:[000000]

Directory XEPHEM_DIR:[000000]

AUXIL.DIR;1         EDB.DIR;1           WORK.DIR;1

Total of 3 files.

You need to copy the content of original AUXIL and EDB directories from the
Xephem distribution. WORK directory may be under user's directory tree. In this
case, each user needs to update the resource file XEPHEM.DAT.

Sources and databases are available under [.SRC] directory in 
XEPHEM_271.ZIP file
