                            The VAX Software List

                                          (last updated: 1 April, 1994)

The following programs are available as described below.  If you have additions
or corrections to make, please contact me at GREG@POMONA.CLAREMONT.EDU.  Please
submit ALL application-specific questions to the originators of the codes.
Availability codes are at the end of the list.  

NOTE:   A current version of this file may be obtained via anonymous ftp
        from pomona.claremont.edu (134.173.4.160).  Please try to restrict
        ftp usage to times other than weekdays 10am-10pm, PST (GMT-0800).
        If you must ftp during these hours, please use acme.claremont.edu
        (134.173.4.162).
        It is also available by sending e-mail to VMSSERV@POMONA.CLAREMONT.EDU
        with the command SEND VAX_LIST.PACKAGE in the body of the message.
        On BITNET, the address is VMSSERV@POMONA, and either e-mail or an
        interactive message will do the trick.  If you use an interactive
        message and you are on a VMS system running JNET, you should use
        VMSDUMP in place of SEND.

NOTE 2: Many people cannot access files via FTP.  It would be nice if more
        sites obtained VMSSERV and/or NETSERVER and helped distribute some
        of these utilities.
        I have been informed that a BITNET FTP server exists.  Allegedly
        it will provide help if you send a one-line message containing the
        word HELP.  This service is available only to those sites with
        direct access to BITNET.   The server is: BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET.
        Also try FTPMAIL@gatekeeper.dec.com.  This is supposed to provide
        FTP access to non-internet sites

NOTE 3: Servers can be ugly.  There are some directions for using VMSSERV
        at the end of this message.  If you have trouble using VMSSERV or
        other mail servers, you might try to contact the author via email,
        or, if necessary, send a message to: POSTMASTER@HOST or 
        SYSTEM@HOST.  That ought to get someone's attention. %-)

NOTE 4: A variety of Software Utilities and programs are available from the
        vmsnet.sources archive.  Rather than try to merge them all into this
        list, I have included a message from Bruce Tanner, posted near the end
        of this file.  Be sure to take a look there if you don't find what
        what you're looking for below.

NOTE 5: For FTP users:  Many of the programs listed below are in a directory
        below the ANONYMOUS login directory.  It's too difficult for me to
        try to keep track of where everything is.  Therefore, people may have
        to hunt around a bit in the subdirectories to find what they want.
        It would be *helpful* if FTP sites maintained some kind of outline
        in the top-level anonymous directory that explained what is 
        available in the various subdirectories.

                At MIT, get "gcc-vms.tar.Z".  That's a compressed tar archive
                (ie, Unix packaging) which contains everything you'll need
                (compiler binaries for VMS, driver routine with CLD
                definition and some documentation, and '.h' header files;
                the latter have been improved but still need work--the next
                set should be better).  It does _not_ contain the gcc
                sources.

                gcc-vms currently contains executables for gcc v1.39 and gas
                v1.38.1+ (the "+" indicating that some essential
                VMS-specific buglied to 1.38.1) and also an old version of
                bison.  Bison is a yacc work-alike td gcc or gas from
                sources.  Gas is the GNU assembler; it's the backend code
                generator for gcc.  (gcc processes foo.c into foo.s; gas
                processes foo.s into foo.obj; the gcc driver executes both
                of them for you from a single invocation of the GCC command.)

JOBLOG          It's a terminal session logger, based on PHOTO,that provides
                for secure (untouched) log files.  This can be handy for
                homework assignments because an instructor knows that the user
                didn't edit the log file before turning it in.  It also fixes
                a bug in PHOTO that causes VT220 terminals to hang under
                certain situations.

VIRUS SCANNER   The Virus Scanner searches your VAX/VMS or PATHWORKS 
                fileserver for PC viruses.  It can scan any file on the
                fileserver. It runs interactively or automatically at 
                a scheduled interval as a detached process.  The
                advantage of scanning the fileserver is you can easily 
                detect a PC virus and prevent its spread by renaming it 
                outside the DOS naming conventions

(1) Requires compress/decompress and/or tar2vms or a tar utility.  Most
    sites supplying compressed files also supply decompressing tools.
    Not all compress/decompress utilities are equal!  The version from
    MIT will not work without modifications.  Charles Karney of Princeton
    University (see BOSS, above) was kind enough to send me a difference
    file between a working VMS version and the MIT distribution.  
    Probably MIT should fix their compress to work as well on VMS as it does
    on every other OS and computer (MIT, are you listening?).

D1      Spring 89 VAX SIG tape
D2      Spring 90 VAX SIG tape  [see FALL 90 SIG Tape too]
D3      Spring 1988 L&T SIG Tape

-----The following note is from Barton.Bruce@camb.com [Barton F. Bruce]------

In the anonymous tree we have DIR listings of the last 2 Decus CDROMS and
the Fall 90 sig tape. Also there, at least till we need the space,
is the ENTIRE F90 combined (VAX, L&T, RSX, etc) sig tape, visible
as the individual files.

The instructions in the [000000] anonymous directory also show how to
access the last 2 Decus CDROM collections either for anonymous FTP or
NFS mounting. It is best to FTP the CDROM's directory listing from
the ANONYMOUS tree first, and then FTP to (or NFS mount) the DISC
itself for individual files.

TGV's Multinet allows only one tree for the ANONYMOUS account, so we have
specific accounts for the Decus CDROMs each of which contains a particular
Symposium's SIG tape plus assorted other stuff.

Here are the 2 CDROMS we are currently trying to keep mounted:

FILESERV is a file distribution service that uses electronic mail
facilities to deliver files.  To communicate with FILESERV, send an
E-mail message to:
                      FILESERV@WKUVX1.BITNET

Commands are sent in the body of the message you send to FILESERV.
Several commands may be sent at one time; just put one command per line.

For a list of all the packages available, send the command DIR ALL.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to receive e-mail announcements of additions and updates to
the packages available from FILESERV, send the following command in the
body of a mail message to LISTSERV@WKUVX1.BITNET:

SUBSCRIBE FSUPDATE "Your real name"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILESERV Commands:

    SENDME package       Sends all parts of the specified package.
    SENDME package.n     Sends part 'n' of the specified package.

    LIST [pattern]       Gives brief description of all packages
                         matching "pattern".  If pattern is omitted,
                         a description of all packages is sent.

    QUIT                 Causes all remaining lines to be ignored (useful
                         for skipping signatures, etc.).

    HELP                 Sends this file.

Commands may be abbreviated.  DIRECTORY is a synonym for LIST.

For each request you make, a transaction log is returned to you
indicating the status of the request.  The status report will indicate
whether the request was successfully completed, and when the file was or
will be sent.

Problems, questions, and comments about FILESERV service on this system
should be directed to FILESERV-Mgr@WKUVX1.bitnet.

FILESERV Manager: Hunter Goatley, goathunter@WKUVX1.BITNET

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since so many sites offer VMSSERV, I am including the following set of
instructions for reference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     VMSSERV is a program which permits a user on a remote node  to  retrieve
     publicly  available  files.  VMSSERV requires VAX/VMS 4.+ and Jnet V2 or
     later.

     The user communicates with VMSSERV using a small vocabulary of commands.
     These  commands can be sent to VMSSERV either as interactive messages or
     via valid RFC822 format memos.  Commands sent via mail are  included  in
     the  body  of  the  memo, not in the Subject:  line.  A memo may contain
     more than one command as long as there is only one command per line.

     VMSSERV provides file service similar to that provided  by  LISTSERV  on
     IBM  VM  systems.  Currently, VMSSERV acts only as a file server.  There
     are no plans at this time to include any list serving features.


Commands

     VMSSERV currently  understands  the  following  commands  which  may  be
     abbreviated to the upper case portion in this list:

     DIRectory [file-spec]      Return a list of files available

     GET [file-spec]            Synonym for SENDME

     HELP                       Return a list of valid commands

     INDex [file-spec]          Return a files called 'file-spec' FILELIST

     SENdme [file-spec]         Return a file

     STATUS                     Return status information (Interactive only)

     VMSdump [file-spec]        Return a file in VMSDUMP format.  Recommended
                                for transferring files (especially binary)
                                to another VAX/VMS system running
                                Jnet V2 or later.

     PUNch [file-spec]          Return a file in IBM Punch format

     ?                          Synonym for HELP

     Please note that VMSDUMP and PUNCH within the body of a mail
message will not send the file in VMSDUMP or PUNCH format, the file
will be mailed back.

Transferring Binary Files

     You can transfer binary files (.EXE, .TSK, .SAV) to a remote system only
     if  you  are  running  Jnet  V2  or  later  system.  These files must be
     transferred with the VMSDUMP command.  For example,

     $ SEND VMSSERV@FHCRCVAX VMSDUMP FILE.PACKAGE

     VMSDUMP is recommended for all requests from Jnet nodes as  it  protects
     you from any non-standard character set conversion.


VMS File Specifications

     Filenames on DEC systems use a DOT ('.') to separate the  filename  from
     the filetype.  For example,

          SEND FILE PACKAGE          Is INCORRECT
          SEND FILE.PACKAGE          Is CORRECT

Large Files

        Files larger than 200 blocks will not be sent until after 20:00 PST

$PACKAGE files
        Files with the type of .$PACKAGE simply contain a list of files
that belong together (i.e. part of acomplete package). If you request the
file Utility.PACKAGE, the file Utility.$PACKAGE will be read, and all
the files it describes will be sent to you. Note that there is not really
a file called Utility.PACKAGE, however that is what you should request!

        For example, part of a DIR listing includes something like:
        HEADERS.$PACKAGE
        HEADERS.1_OF_2
        HEADERS.2_OF_2

        If you request HEADERS.PACKAGE, the file HEADERS.$PACKAGE will
be read (which simply contains the names of the HEADER.n_OF_n files),

As the nominal vmsnet.sources archive, we offer anonymous FTP from the cluster
Black.Cerritos.EDU, White.Cerritos.EDU and mail server access from
mailserv@cerritos.edu.

Mailserver access is via MAILSERV@Cerritos.EDU.  Place the mailserv
commands in the body of the message, one line per command.  You can start
with 'help' and 'index'; 'send [package]partnn.share' will get you one of
the parts.  Alas, no wild cards are supported.

        Announcing MRCserv, a mailserver based at Mount Royal College.
 
        MRCserv is a MAIL ONLY based server.  Mount Royal is not on
        the Internet so FTP access is not supported.  Anonymous UUCP
        is also not supported.
 
        All commands to the server must be in the BODY of the message.
        The subject line is ignored.
 
        The address of the server is MRCserv@Janus.MtRoyal.AB.CA
 
        MRCserv supports multiple operating systems including: AmigaDOS,
        PostScript, and VMS.  MRCserv also contains various incarnations
        of Kermit including: "C", MSDOS, and VMS.
 
        If you have any questions regarding MRCserv or the contents of the
        archive, send them to RForster@Janus.MtRoyal.AB.CA.

	To make submissions to the archive, send the uuencoded submission
	via email to RForster@Janus.MtRoyal.AB.CA or via BITNET to
	RFORSTER@UNCANET (VMS w/Jnet).

    MRCserv - Mount Royal College Mail Server       Last updated:  23-Jul-91
    -----------------------------------------       ------------------------
    Commands:
	CD	  -   change working directory
        DIR       -   list a directory
        DIR -d    -   list subdirectories only
	DIR -s nn -   list files added to archive in the last 'nn' days
        EXIT      -   finishes request
        GET       -   sends you one or more files
		      Adding the qualifer UUENCODE to the end of the GET
		      command will force the file to be uuencoded.  This is
		      good for long lines in source code.
|			ie GET [AMIGA.UTILS.MUSIC]MED_310.LZH UUENCODE
        HELP      -   sends you this help
        LS        -   briefly list a directory
        LS -d	  -   briefly subdirectories only
	LS -s nn  -   briefly list files added in last 'nn' days
	PATH	 -    Path from MRCserv to you.  (if your using "!" paths
		      make the address end with a .UUCP domain ie.
		      foo!bar.uucp) If PATH is not supplied, MRCSERV will
		      use the Return-Path: header.  This may cause problems
		      with UUCP sites.  If you have not received a response
		      within a reasonable time, send a message to
		      postmaster@janus.mtroyal.ab.ca.

	PARTSIZE  -   Size of the parts MRCserv sends out to you,
		      Default is 100 VMS disk blocks, which is approximately
		      750 lines.  (750 * 64 char/line = 48K char/part).
		      The maximum is 195 blocks or almost 100,000 bytes.
	PUT	  -   Put a file in the archive. (must be validated first).
		      Not implemented yet.
        VIEW      -   Allows you to view to contents of an ARC, LHARC, or
                      ZOO archive.

    Extensions:
	ZOO	- ZOO file	ZUU	- UUencoded ZOO file
	ARC	- ARC file	AUU	- UUencoded ARC file
	LZH	- LHARC file	LUU	- UUencoded LHARC file
	LHW	- LhWarp file   DIR	- VMS directory file
	WRP	- Warp file	UUE	- UUencoded executable
	ABC	- ABasiC file

|    MRCSERV is currently undergoing a restructuring of its' directory
|    trees.  Once the reorganization is complete, all archives will be
|    converted to LHARC archives.

|    Wildcards directory and file specifications are allowable with the
|    DIR command.  These follow standard VMS wildcard rules.

    Subdirectories can be accessed via the CD command.  For example, if you
    see a file with the extension .DIR (ie ARCHIVERS.DIR), CD to it by
    issuing the command CD [ARCHIVERS] (case insensitive, brackets are not
    required).  To move to the parent directory issue the command CD [-]
    (Brackets are required) To move to the root directory issue command
    CD [000000]

    Binary files (ZOO/ARC/LZH/EXE) will be uuencoded before being sent.

    Files larger than 100 VMS disk blocks will be sent in multiple parts.
    You will be informed of the number of parts in the server's response.
    You can change the 'split factor' with the PARTSIZE command.

    All files will be sent as separate messages (except HELP and DIR).

    You may only transfer 5000 VMS disk blocks during any one session.

    In the reply sent by MRCserv, your commands are preceded by a less-than
    sign "<".  MRCserv responses are preceded by a greater-than sign ">".

    MRCserv now places the request number in the 'personal name' header
    item, ie.  'FROM:  (MRCserv request 123) <mrcserv@janus.mtroyal.ab.ca>'
    The request number is displayed in the response file so you should now
    be able to figure out where those INDEX.LIS files are comming from.

    Any questions regarding the archive or MRCserv software can be directed
