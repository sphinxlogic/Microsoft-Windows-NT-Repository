GETCMD V3.5
Copyright © 1992--1995, MadGoat Software.  All rights reserved.

This  kit  contains  all  the  files  necessary for installing MadGoat
Software's GETCMD utility.   Requires  VMS  V5.0  or  later  (VAX)  or
OpenVMS Alpha V1.0 or later.

GETCMD.B32  is  a  BLISS-32  program that will display the DCL command
recall buffer for any interactive process on the system.

BUILDING
--------
To build GETCMD, just execute the LINK.COM procedure:

	$ @LINK

If  you  have BLISS and want to build from the sources, an MMS file is
provided in [.SOURCE].


USAGE
-----
To set up GETCMD, just define a foreign symbol to run it:

	$ getcmd :== $dev:[dir]getcmd.exe

where "dev:[dir]" is the device and directory where GETCMD lives.

To use it, simply specify a PID on the command line:

	$ getcmd 202000AF

Qualifiers  that  may  be  specified are /PAGE, to do pause the output
after each full screen, and /OUTPUT=xxx, to redirect the output  to  a
file.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
GETCMD  will  not yet work with processes on other nodes in a cluster,
though this functionality is planned for a future release.
