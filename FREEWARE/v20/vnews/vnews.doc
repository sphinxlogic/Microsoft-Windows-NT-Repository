0.0 DISCLAIMER

           "Remember Kids, This Is Done By Trained Professionals...
                           Don't Try This At Home!"

No one wrote this, it was generated by a large (but finite) number of 
monkeys using a even larger (but still finite) number of VAXstations.  Even 
if someone really did write this, he only wrote this because he thought it 
was correct.  It wasn't meant to represent the opinion of his employers, or 
the original developers of the VNEWS program.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

VNews is a native VMS news reading client that uses the network news
transport protocol to access news stored on a remote server.  It was
written by Michael Dorl at the Madison Academic Computing Center,
University of Wisconsin as a personal project to gain familiarity with
The Wollongong WIN/VX program interface to the TCP/IP network.

Much of the look and feel of the user interface was shamelessly 
borrowed from the many fine news reading programs in the Unix world.

2.0 USER DOCUMENTATION

News works best on screen oriented terminal.  It uses the DEC SMG
routines and supports all of the standard VMS terminal types.

The best way to learn VNews is to try it.

2.1 FIRST TIME VNEWS USERS

First time users of VNEWS do not have to perform any special actions.
Upon starting VNEWS the new user will be prompted on whether or not
they wish to subscribe to each newsgroup (See Section 2.2 SUBSCRIBING).
A XX.NEWSRC file, which contains the users subscription information
will be created when the user exits VNEWS.

New users should realize that there are over 1500 groups that are
distributed over the wide-area networks and many more local groups.
Some groups have subject matter which you may find offensive. A good
rule of thumb is if the name of the newsgroup sounds bad to you, you
may not want to read the group.

While reading any group, you can unsubscribe to it by entering the
command 'u'.

2.2 SUBSCRIBING TO GROUPS

At the "Group", "Article" and "End of Groups" prompt you can subscribe
to a new newsgroup by entering: 

	g (newsgroup name)

You can get a list of groups by using the directory/group command:

	d/g

When a user enters VNEWS and there are new groups available, he/she is
notified and prompted.  At this prompt, the following commands are
available:

	y		Subscribe to the group
	n		Do not subscribe to the group
			 (carriage return also works)
	?		Help
	h		Help
	q/s		Stop asking me about new groups, and subscribe me to the
			 rest of them.
	q/u		Stop asking me about new groups, and DON'T subscribe me to
			 the rest of them.

Since new users will receive notification about all the groups (over 1000)
it is a good idea for a new user to enter q/s or q/u when first
invoking VNEWS.

2.3 VNEWS COMMANDS

VNEWS is started up by entering the command:

	$ VNEWS

VNews starts up and performs a series of initialization operations,
including checking for any new newsgroups that may have been created.
Since the news is stored on a remote CPU, these operations may not
occur immediately.

A sample initialization screen:

	Welcome to VNEWS V1.4-b1 <carat.arizona.edu!jms> of  1-APR-1991 1:17

	Reading your XX.Newsrc file from disk$kludgey:[jms.news] ...

	Connecting to remote news server news.telcom.arizona.edu ...
	200 ANU NEWS/NNTP server arizona.edu (V6.0). Ready (posting ok).

	Retrieving active file...

	Last News execution at  1-JAN-1991 16:37:03.

	Retrieving new groups...


The user will now be prompted for an action in one of the newsgroups
(Group Prompt), or receive the DONE prompt if no new news is available.

A sample group prompt screen:

	Group alt.tv.prisoner                  available: 437 - 468 unread: 2


	GROUP alt.tv.prisoner action:

The group name, available article numbers and number of unread articles
appear on the first line.

Commands available at the group prompt are:

	<cr>          Start reading articles
	a [process]   attach to process
	b             go to previous group
	c [#]         catchup (mark unread articles up to # as read)
	d [#]         directory (list article numbers and subjects)
	d/g [pattern] group directory (list group names, and statuses)
	g pattern     go to group specified by pattern
	h             help
	j             Enable NNTP debugging (not normally useful)
	k [/pattern]  kill articles (mark them as read).  If no pattern is
	               specified the current subject is used as a kill
	               pattern.
	K [/pattern]  add pattern to kill file, so subject is always killed
	               when reading this group.
	key           keypad help
	m/g           mark all the active articles in the group as unread.
	M             move group (rearrange the order of how the groups
	               are presented to the user)
	n             go to the next subscribed group
	p             post a new article
	p/x           post a new article in rot13 mode.
	q             quit
	Q!            quit, and don't update the xx.newsrc file
	u             unsubscribe from the group
	Y             do not confirm catchups
	N             do confirm catchups
	#             read article number 
	               (e.g. 672 would bring up article 672)
	?             help
	^             read first unread article
	$             read last unread article
	/pattern      search for first unread article with a subject
	               containing pattern.
	![command]    spawn DCL command

"pattern" follows normal VMS rules for pattern matching.

If you answer with a <CR>, VNews will cycle through the unread articles
in this group.  After displaying each article, VNews will prompt you
for an action.

	Group alt.tv.prisoner                  available: 437 - 468 unread: 1
	article 467          16:49:24.83

	               containing pattern.
	![command]    spawn DCL command

"pattern" follows normal VMS rules for pattern matching.

When VNews has processed all groups, it displays a end of groups
prompt:

	DONE, action:


Commands available at the DONE prompt are:

	<cr>          Exit VNEWS
	a [process]   attach to process
	b             go to the previous group
	d/g [pattern] group directory (list group names, and statuses)
	g pattern     go to group specified by pattern
	h             help
	j             Enable NNTP debugging (not normally useful)
	key           keypad help
	n             Exit VNEWS
	q             quit
	Q!            quit, and don't update the xx.newsrc file

	![command]    spawn DCL command
	Y             do not confirm catchups
	N             do confirm catchups

"pattern" follows normal VMS rules for pattern matching.

When you quit with the "q" command from VNEWS, the closeout procedure will 
cut the connection to the remote NNTP server and update the NEWSRC files.
If you use the "Q!" command, the NEWSRC files won't be updated.

	Closing News server connection...

	Updating XX.Newsrc in disk$kludgey:[jms.news] ...
	Purging old XX.NEWSRC files out of disk$kludgey:[jms.news] ...

	VNEWS done after  117 minutes.
	You read 55 messages (9 groups) and composed 3 answers.
   
2.4 EXPLAINING THE DIRECTORY/GROUP COMMAND (d/g)

The d/g command provides a wealth of information, and is a tad confusing to the
beginner.  The syntax for the d/g command is:

		d/g [pattern]

Where [pattern] is an optional VMS search pattern to locate a group.  If
unspecified, [pattern] is "*" which lists all newsgroups.

The format of each line in the directory/group command is:

	group_number group_name		X Y Z   Active_Start Active_End
		Range
		Range
		.
		.
		.
		Range

"group_number" is the number of the newsgroup in question.  The group number
indicates when a newsgroup containing new news is displayed during a VNEWS
session.  The lower the number, the earlier the news is displayed.  The groups
may be reordered by using the M (move group) command.

"group_name" is the name/subject of the group.

"X Y Z" are flags indicating the newsgroups status:
	X = Active Flag.  If "A" the group is operational on the remote server.
			  If "-" the group has been deleted on the remote
			   server and will be deleted by VNEWS at the end of 
			   the current session.
	Y = Subscribed Flag.  If "S" you are subscribed to the group and you
			       will be notified when new news arrives for the
			       group.
			       If "-" you are not subscribed to the group.
	Z = Posting flag.  If "P" this is an unmoderated group.  If you
			    post/followup to this group it will immediately
			    be posted on the network.
			   If "M" this is a moderated group.  If you
			    post/followup to this group your posting will be
			    mailed to the moderator for review before it
			    is posted to the network.

"Active_Start" - The first available article in the group.

"Active_End" - The last available article in the group.

"Range" - List of articles you have read in this group.

2.4.1 SAMPLE DIRECTORY/GROUP COMMAND (d/g)

GROUP alt.tv.prisoner action: d/g news.announce.*

   422 news.announce.conferences        A S M    682    799
            1:         795
   423 news.announce.important          A S M     17     17
            1:          17
   424 news.announce.newgroups          A - P     67     75
            1:          72
   425 news.announce.newusers           A S M    263    263
          263:         263

In this example, four groups fit the requested pattern of "news.announce.*".

Group 422, named "news.announce.conferences" has articles 682 thru 799
currently active.  The user has read articles 1 thru 795 so far.  The group is
Active, the user is Subscribed to it and the group is Moderated.

Group 424, named "news.announce.newgroups" has articles 67 thru 75 active.  The
user has read articles 1 thru 72.  The group is Active and is Postable
(Unmoderated).  The user is not subscribed to the group currently.

2.5 VNEWS FILES STORED IN A USERS ACCOUNT

VNEWS stores a variety of files in a users account.

File:				Function:
-----				---------
SYS$LOGIN:.SIGNATURE		The file contains any information you would 
				like appended to the bottom of your postings.  
				Typical .SIGNATURE files are 2 to 4 lines long 
				and may contain your name, your e-mail address, 
				a short disclaimer, and a witty saying.  This
				file is optional and created by the user.

XX.NEWSRC			This file contains all of the information
				about what groups the user is subscribed
				to and what articles have been read.  The
				file is created by VNEWS and is mandatory.
				This file is kept in NNTP_NEWSRC_LOCATION,
				if that logical name is defined, or in
				SYS$LOGIN if it isn't.

XX.OLDNEWSRC			The previous version of XX.NEWSRC, it is
				saved in case VNEWS trashes the XX.NEWSRC
				file.  This file is created by VNEWS and
				is mandatory.
				(same location as XX.NEWSRC)

SYS$LOGIN:NEWS.DIR		This directory is created by VNEWS if you
				save an article to the default filename
				(e.g. use the 's' command without a
				filename) or establish a kill file for a
				newsgroup.  The directory is created by
				VNEWS and is mandatory if you want to save
				articles and/or maintain kill files.

[.NEWS]groupname.KILL		The name of this file indicated that it is
				a kill file for that group (e.g.
				COMP_VIRUS.KILL is a kill file for the 
				COMP.VIRUS group).  The file is created by
				VNEWS when the 'K' command is used.

[.NEWS]groupname		The default save file for a group.  The
				file is created by VNEWS when the 'S'
				command is used.


3.0 USER CUSTOMIZATION OF VNEWS

VNEWS can be modified by the use of logical names and qualifiers on the
command line.  In addition, if the user desires a signature file that
can be added (See previous section on VNEWS files).

3.1 USER LOGICAL NAMES IN VNEWS

	NNTP_VISUAL (synonym: NNTP_EDITOR)

		VNEWS uses the callable EDT editor by default.  VNEWS will
		check to see if NNTP_VISUAL has been defined to a callable
		editor and use that.  If NNTP_VISUAL is not defined, VNEWS
		will try to use the MAIL editor logical name MAIL$EDIT.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_VISUAL CALLABLE_TPU

		This example will have VNEWS use the TPU/EVE editor.

		Be careful here!  Your MAIL$EDIT may not be suitable
		for use in VNEWS!  If you get problems when you try
		to post or followup, check MAIL$EDIT and possibly 
		create an NNTP_VISUAL which is just CALLABLE_EDT or
		whatever.

	NNTP_NAME

		VNEWS uses your personal name in VMSMAIL, and if that's
		not there, the OWNER field from the system authorization
		file as your name when creating headers for posts and
		followups.  By defining the logical name you can override
		this.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_NAME "My name is Eddie"

		This example will have VNEWS use the name "My name is Eddie"
		instead of the name in the authorization file.
		
	NNTP_ORGANIZATION

		VNEWS uses an internal variable as your organization when 
		creating headers for posts and followups.  By defining the 
		logical name you can override this.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_ORGANIZATION "Banzai Institute"

		This example will have VNEWS use the organization 
		"Banzai Institute" instead of the internally defined
		organization.
		
	NNTP_MAILPOSTER

		VNEWS uses an internal variable to define the mail protocol
		that it uses for REPLY.  Usually this is SMTP% when using
		Multinet, or WINS% when using Wollongong TCP/IP.  This can
		be overridden by using the logical name, however it is not
		recommended.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_MAILPOSTER "SLUG%"

		This example will have VNEWS use the SLUG% protocol for 
		replying to mail instead of the internally defined
		protocol. 
		
	NNTP_SERVER

		VNEWS uses an internal variable to define the name or IP address
		for the remote NNTP news server.  This can be overridden by
		using the logical name, however it is not recommended.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_SERVER "news.comm.com"

		This example will have VNEWS contact the NNTP server at
		DNS address "news.comm.com." 

	NNTP_NEWS_PRINT

		VNEWS will by default direct any print commands to SYS$PRINT.
		By defining this logical to form a valid print command, VNEWS
		will use that to print files.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_NEWS_PRINT "PRINT/QUEUE=LASER"

		NNTP will use the command PRINT/QUEUE=LASER to print files.

	NNTP_TASK

		If you are using DECnet to read news, then (for some 
		strange reason) you may want to change the name of the
		task at the other end that you talk to.  In this case,
		change the logical name NNTP_TASK.  The default should
		be adequate all of the time.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_TASK "0=NNTP"

	NNTP_TIMEZONE

		You need to tell VNEWS what the difference is between
		the timezone your VAX thinks it is, and GMT.  You can
		do this with standard abbreviations, like PST, PDT,
		MST, MDT, etc.  Or you can simply specify the offset from
		GMT.  For example, in Arizona, we're always 7 hours before
		GMT:

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_TIMEZONE "-0700"

	NNTP_NEWSRC_LOCATION

		If you want to change where your xx.newsrc file gets
		stored, then do so by changing this logical name.
		The default is SYS$LOGIN:.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_NEWSRC_LOCATION "FUZZ:[JMS.NEWS]

	NNTP_HOST_NAME

		VNEWS attempts to figure out your DNS (domain name service)
		name by translating a whole set of logical names provided
		by major TCP/IP software vendors.  If you don't have such
		a logical name, or if you prefer that your postings appear
		to have come from another source (such as a cluster alias),
		then you can define NNTP_HOST_NAME.

		Example:	DEFINE NNTP_HOST_NAME "mis.arizona.edu"

3.1 COMMAND LINE QUALIFIERS IN VNEWS

	/HEADER=(LIST)

		Header selects which header lines you wish to see.  Since most 
		articles contain 10 - 15 header lines most of which you have 
		no interest in, you probably want to select only the few lines 
		you are interested in.

	A recommended use of /HEADER is:

			/HEADER=(SUBJECT, FROM, SENDER)

		This will only show the SUBJECT, FROM and SENDER lines in
		a posting.  All other headers will be filtered.

	/MARK

		Mark allows you to select the character to be used to 'mark' 
		the original text in followup articles.

	/AUTOCATCHUP

		Autocatchup has the same effect as giving the 'Y' command
		to VNEWS: 'c'atchup commands are not confirmed.  
		You may also /NOAUTOCATCHUP.

4.0 HELPFUL HINTS

One of the most productive ways to use VNews is to print a directory of unread
articles in the group with the d command.  Look at these and decide which ones
you want to read.  Read these by specifying their numbers or by using the z
command to follow all articles with the same subject.  When you have seen all
you want, answer c to skip  the remainder in the group.  

An alternative is to do a c # to catchup to all articles before the one you
wish to read, read that one with a <CR>, do another d to get a refreshed list,
and repeat until done.

5.0 NETIQUETTE

In the group news.announce.newusers, a regular series of articles
are posted each month.  A current version of these (June, 1991) has
been included with the VNEWS distribution.  You may want to peruse
these articles before posting and reading to get a better understanding
of how this whole thing fits together.

6.0 GLOSSARY

ALT - A set of "semi-network-wide" newsgroups which are open for people to
create new groups usually with non-mainstream subjects.  ALT groups are
popular, but are not carried by all sites due to some of the subject matter.

ARTICLE - A single message in a news group.

CLIENT	- A program which uses information stored on another node.  VNEWS is a
"client" USEnet news reader program, it retrieves news from a "server" node
somewhere on the network.

COMP - A set of "network-wide" newsgroups which cover the subject of computers.

CONTROL - The newsgroup where USEnet control messages are posted.  Mere USEnet
mortals should beware posting here.

DDN - A set of "network-wide" newsgroups which cover the subject of the Defense
Data Network, the military section of the Internet.

FLAME - A negative comment on an idea or person.

FOLLOWUP - To write an article which adds information to a previous article and
to submit it to a newsgroup.

FOOBAR - See Fubar.

FUBAR - Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition (Other Meanings Implied), indicates
that something/someone is badly messed up.  The term originated (supposedly) in
the U.S. Military.

GROUP - See Newsgroup.

JUNK - Catch-all newsgroup where broken postings are stored. 

HIERARCHY - A set of news groups.  All news groups in the same hierarchy have
the same prefix name (ALT., COMP., SCI., etc.).

KILL FILE - A file containing a list of subjects (or other info) that a news
reader should not display to the user.  If a user has a KILL file for group
COMP.OS.VMS which contains the word "ULTRIX" then any articles containing the
subject "ULTRIX" will be ignored.

MULTINET - A brand of TCP/IP software for VAX/VMS machines.

MODERATED - Term applied to a newsgroup that has an editor.  When posting to a
moderated group, your posting is sent to an editor/moderator who then approves
the posting for distribution to the network.

to communicate with a remote News server.  NNTP is layered on top of TCP/IP.
the protocols that the Internet are based on.

NEWS - A set of "network-wide" newsgroups which cover the subject of USEnet
news.

NEWSGROUP - One section of the USEnet that has a specific topic.  Groups can
be "Local", where they are only distributed to a few local servers.

for VNEWS.

NNTP - See Network News Transport Protocol.

POST - To write a new article and submit it to a newsgroup.

REC - A set of "network-wide" newsgroups which cover recreational subjects. 

ROT13 - A simple rotational cypher to prevent people from easily reading a
posting.  ROT13 is usually used to prevent persons from reading the punch line
to a joke too soon, or to "encode" potentially offensive material.  VNEWS
offers commands to translate ROT13 from/into regular text while reading and
posting.  The ROT13 cypher is fairly simple...

	Real:   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	Cipher: NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm

As you can see, the cipher is 13 places off from the actual text.

RN - Probably the most popular news reading program for UNIX currently
available.  Developed by Larry Wall.

RRN - See RN.

RTFM - At one point meant "Read The FSCK Manual", now means "Read The Freaking
(Other meanings implied) Manual".  This is a very negative response given to a
simple technical question asked in a newsgroup.  The response (translated)
means "Why are you wasting our time and network bandwidth asking a question
which you could have located in the manual".  Using "RTFM" is not a good way to
make friends and influence people on the USEnet.

SCI - A set of "network-wide" newsgroups which cover science subjects. 

SERVER - A program which provides data to a client program.  VNEWS retrieves
news data from a remote server.

SIGNATURE - A small file which contains information about you that is attached
to all of your postings.

SOC - A set of "network-wide" newsgroups which cover social subjects. 

SUBSCRIBED - When you are subscribed to a Newsgroup, VNEWS will actively scan
that group for new entries and notify you if there are any.

TCP/IP - See Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.

TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL - Two of the main protocols
used to pass data between nodes on the Internet/NSFnet.

UNIX - An operating system that is inferior to VMS.

UNMODERATED - Term applied to a newsgroup where no one edits the postings.  When
posting to an unmoderated group, the posting is immediately sent to the
network.

USENET - The psuedo-network of News sites.  USENET is not a true network, it
is a layer on top of other networks (UUNET, UUCP, The Internet, etc.).
  
WIN/VX - See Wollongong.

WOLLONGONG - A brand of TCP/IP software for VAX/VMS machines.


7.0 CONVERTING FROM EUNICE RRN TO VNEWS

VNews keeps your news database in file sys$login:xx.newsrc. This file
has the same format as a rrn .newsrc file except that its in RMS format
rather than in Eunice stream format. To make a xx.newsrc:

	$ SET DEFAULT SYS$LOGIN

	$ COPY .NEWSRC XX.NEWSRC

	$ UNIXTOVMS XX.NEWSRC

VNews keeps your saved articles in directory sys$login:news.dir instead
of the Eunice rrn sys$login:$n$ews.dir directory.  Create this
directory and copy your saved news articles there with the following
commands:

	$ SET DEFAULT SYS$LOGIN

	$ CREATE/DIR [.NEWS]

	$ COPY [.$N$EWS]*.*;* [.NEWS]*.*;*

	$ SET DEFAULT [.NEWS]

	$ UNIXTOVMS *.*;*

The files in your [.news] directory still have the old Eunice names. 
These include $ characters used as shift markers and also $5 pairs used
as second and subsequent . characters.  For example if you have been
saving your comp.os.vms articles in the default file, you will have
file $c$omp.os$5vms.  Since the VNews equivalent of this file is
comp.os_vms, you may want to rename files in your .news directory to
the VNews equivalents. No set of wild card cards will do this for you
but there is a command procedure which you can run to convert these
names.

	$ SET DEFAULT SYS$LOGIN

	$ SET DEFAULT [.NEWS]

	$ @CONVERT

(CONVERT comes with the VNEWS distribution kit, ask your system manager
for the location of the procedure on your system)

Once you satisfy yourself that news works and want to switch from
Eunice and rrn, don't forget to go back and delete the files in your
sys$login:$n$ews.dir and that directory.
