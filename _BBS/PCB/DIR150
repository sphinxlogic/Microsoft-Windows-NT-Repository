                               | environment.  Runs under 4.xBSD, System V,

BACKUP.TAR     245760  05-01-88   A program to handle running backups.  It
                               | reads a configuration file to see what needs
                               | to be dumped, and then runs dump(8) to do it.
                               |  Handles multiple tapes, multiple dumps on
                               | one tape, labeling tapes to be sure the right
                               | tape is used, and multiple sets of dump
                               | tapes.  Understands how to use remote tape
                               | drives. It currently runs on 4.3BSD, Gould
                               | UTX/2.0, and SunOS 3.4.  It would take a LOT
                               | of work to make it run under System V unless
                               | your System V has Berkeley pseudo-ttys.
