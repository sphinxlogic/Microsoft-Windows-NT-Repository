                               | itself to parity bits, erase, kill, and end
                               | of line characts.  Optionally detects baud

AUTOBAUD.TAR    16384  03-05-89   A program to do automatic baud rate
                               | detection under 4.3BSD.  This is done by
                               | using the carriage return character.  The
                               | code in 4.3BSD "getty" to do this has never
                               | worked right.  This program can function as a
                               | replacement for "getty". Contributor: Gregg

                               | Useful on failing disk drives, etc.

CHKPWD.TAR      32768  04-29-89   A password checking program inspired by the
                               | Internet worm.  Uses the algorithm the worm
                               | used for cracking passwords in order to look
                               | for obvious passwords. Contributor: Clyde

                               | files, "easy" passwords, bad .rhosts files,
                               | changes in setuid status, and more.
CORENOTC.TAR     8192  03-05-89   Script to find old "core" files and notify
                               | their owners. Contributor: Anonymous
CPUTT.TAR       40960  04-24-92   Monitor top 10 (by CPU time) processes on a
                               | SUN OS 4.1.1 system. Contributor:  Greg
                               | Vesper <vesper@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov>
CRON.TAR       155648  10-31-90   A version of cron known to run on 4.xBSD
                               | systems.  Functionally based on System V cron
                               | with per-user crontabs.  Version 2.0.
                               | Contributor: Paul Vixie
                               | <vixie@vixie.sf.ca.us>
DBGREP.TAR      24576  03-05-89   A disk block-based grep-like utility.  This
                               | program reads the raw file system device and
                               | examines all the disk blocks searching for a
                               | pattern. Regular expressions are not
                               | supported, although case may be ignored. The
                               | names of the files whose disk blocks contain
                               | the pattern, along with the names of their
                               | owners, etc. are printed.  This is faster
                               | than doing a find/grep combination, since the
                               | program does not do all the opens, plus it
                               | stops searching a file after the first match
                               | is found. This program works under 4.3BSD and
                               | SunOS 3.4. Contributor: Dave Curry
                               | <davy@erg.sri.com>
DUSAGE.TAR      24576  03-09-90   A program to filter the output of du(1) and
                               | produce a report about disk space in use,
                               | change since last run, etc. Contributor:
                               | Johan Vromans <jv@mh.nl>
FINO.TAR        24576  03-05-89   Find files and inode numbers.  This program
                               | reads the raw disk and prints out all in-use
                               | inodes and their file names.  The real reason
                               | it exists is to find large files being
                               | written but that have been unlinked and can't
                               | be found with conventional methods.  It's
                               | sort of a reinvention of what you can do with
                               | "icheck" and "ncheck", but it's sort of
                               | different too.  For 4.xBSD. Contributor: Dave
                               | Curry <davy@erg.sri.com>
FORCE.C          2527  03-22-89   Another program to allow running a command
                               | as the super-user; this one requires the
                               | password first. Contributor: Paul Summers
                               | <paul@wjvax.uucp>
FORKTEST.TAR    16384  03-05-89   A program to check for security holes in
                               | programs that call fork(). Contributor: Hugh

FSTAT.TAR       40960  04-29-89   Identifies open files by reading file and
                               | inode information from the kernel.  Will also
                               | identify open network connections.  Runs on
                               | SunOS 4.0, Dynix 3.0.14, and Ultrix 2.2.

INDIR.TAR       57344  05-18-90   A program which (allegedly) allows setuid
                               | shell scripts to work by sitting between the
                               | user and the shell script.  Use at your own
