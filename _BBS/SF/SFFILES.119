ACCESS.TAR     81,920  02-27-89   A program which interprets file permissions.  It interprets them through the whole path and tells you in the end just exactly who can read, write, and execute the named file.  Described in Winter '85 USENIX Proceedings. Contributor: Dave Curry <davy@erg.sri.com>
CD_KORN.KSH     9,329  03-22-89   Change-directory routines for the Korn shell to emulate the C-shell directory stack. Contributor: C. Bamford <cjb@mtuxo.uucp>
CHD.TAR        16,384  02-27-89   A directory browser with EMACS-style file name completion. Contributor: Marc Majka <majka@ubc-cs.uucp>
CLS.TAR        16,384  02-27-89   A "compressed ls" which prints long file names differently so that they don't alter the columnar format as they do with Berkeley "ls". Contributor: Jerry Peek <jerryp@cmx.npac.syr.edu>
DIR.TAR        24,576  02-27-89   A two-column directory listing program.  Runs under Berkeley UNIX and System V. Contributor: Ferd Brundick <fsbrn@brl.arpa>
DT.TAR          8,192  02-27-89   Another program to recursively descend a directory tree and display it graphically. Contributor: Michael A. Petonic <mikep@ism780c.uucp>
DTREE.TAR      40,960  02-03-90   A program to display directory hierarchy trees. Contributor: David J. MacKenzie <djm@abyss.eng.umd.edu>
ILS.TAR        73,728  03-22-92   Interactive ls and browser. Contributor:  Jack Alexander <alexj@equinox.unr.edu>
LC.TAR         16,384  02-27-89   A public-domain "ls"-type program. Contributor: Guy Middleton <gamiddleton@orchid.waterloo.edu>
LSARCHIV.TAR   32,768  04-23-92   Produces a recursive listing of a directory tree, similar to "ls -lR" but with differences.  This one shows complete file name (full directory path), mode of file, number of links, and owner. The date is presented in the format yy/mm/dd hh:mm and is at the beginning of each line.  Extremely useful for archive (UUCP) sites. Needs ANSI compiler. Contributor:  Kent Landfield <kent@sparky.imd.sterling.com>
LSDIR.TAR       8,192  02-27-89   List only the directories contained in the current directory. Contributor: unknown
NMKDIR.C        3,068  03-22-89   A program like "mkdir", except given the path "a/b/c", it will create any missing directories in the path.  A recursive mkdir in other words. Contributor: Robert Rother <rmr@sdcsvax.uucp>
SETD.TAR       57,344  03-22-92   Set directory and mark utilities.  Version 1.7. Contributor:  Sunil Savkar <sunil@hal.com>
SLS.TAR        57,344  04-29-89   Sls is a program designed to overcome the limitations of the standard UNIX ls(1) program, providing a more consistent interface to file inode information.  It is particularly designed for use by shell scripts to make obtaining information about files easier.  It uses printf(3)-style format strings to control the sorting and output of file information. Contributor: Rich Baughman <rich@cfisun.cfi.com>
VDD.TAR        32,768  08-31-90   Yet another visual directory tree browser.  Version 1.0. Contributor: <root@lsrhs.uucp>
