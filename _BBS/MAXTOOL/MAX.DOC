Dox for max :

        Maximus Mount :

        Creates FILES.BBS files and HCDAREAS.CTL from indexfile in
CD-ROM from Walnut Creek CDROM.

	Usage :

        max <CD-ROMdrive> <Directory for FILES.BBS files>

	Example :

        max G: C:\MAX\CDAREAS

Well, that's about all there is. max will build a number of index files
from the files.bbs file in each subdirectory pointed to by \dirs.txt.

The access level for all the areas is 'Disgrace/S'. I use this to exclude
the CD from the newfilescan since it doesn't update daily like the other
file areas.

The usual disclaimers and stuff apply. The simple rule is if it breaks you
own both pieces.

The format in which the Files.Bbs files are is modelled towards my own BBS.
Change the source if you don't like it. Don't spread modified versions.
