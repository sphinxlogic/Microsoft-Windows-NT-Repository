     _x_g_r_a_b lets you grab arbitrary rectangular images from  an  X
     server and writes them to files or commands (such as lpr) in
     a variety of formats.

     _x_g_r_a_b is a front for the xgrabsc program.  Read the man page
     for  _x_g_r_a_b_s_c  for  a description of the options presented by
     xgrab.

     After  selecting  options  from   the   various   categories
     presented,  press the _O_K button to have xgrab run xgrabsc to
     let you grab an image from the screen.  After you press  _O_K,
     xgrab's  window will disappear and xgrabsc will gain control
     until the grabbing process  is  finished.   Afterwards,  the
     xgrab window will reappear.

     Xgrab responds to the standard application options, such  as
     -_d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  See the man page for _X for a complete list.

     You can also override the default  xgrab  settings  in  your
     .Xdefaults.   See  the  examples  section below for instruc-
     tions.

     The XGrab  resource  file,  XGrab.ad,  contains  a  complete
     specification  of  the  resources of all the widgets used in
     the xgrab window.  Global resources, such  as  default  font
     and color, are at the bottom of the file.

     The _T_o _C_o_m_m_a_n_d output option may be  used  to  pipe  xgrabsc
     output  to  programs.   The most common commands are _l_p_r for
     Postscript output, and _x_w_u_d for X-Window Dump output.   Pro-
     grams  that  do not accept piped input should not be used in
     _T_o _C_o_m_m_a_n_d.

     You can also get fancy and pipe the output through more than
     one  command,  such  as  _t_e_e _s_c_r_e_e_n._d_m_p | _x_w_u_d, to store the

     grabbed image and get a preview window.


     Default settings for xgrab can be made  in  your  .Xdefaults
     file.   Toggle buttons can be set/unset through their ._s_t_a_t_e
     attribute, and text field strings can be set  through  their
     *_s_t_r_i_n_g  attribute.   For  example, to set the default paper
     size for postscript output, put these lines  in  your  .Xde-
     faults (and use xrdb to load them into the server!):

     XGrab*.pageWidthText*string:   8.5
     XGrab*.pageHeightText*string: 11.0

     To set the default output type to _X_W_D, put  these  lines  in
     your .Xdefaults:

     XGrab*.ps.state:  0
     XGrab*.xwd.state: 1
