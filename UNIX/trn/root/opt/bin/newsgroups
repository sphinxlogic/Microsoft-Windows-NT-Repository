: syntax: newsgroups [pattern] [pipeflag]

: System Dependencies

: You might want to change pager to a "make column" program if you have one.
: On the other hand, if your kernel does paging, cat would probably do.
pager="more"
active="~news/active"

case $active in
~*) active=`/opt/lib/news/filexp $active` ;;
esac



: End of system dependencies, hopefully


if test $# -ge 2 ; then
    pager=cat

: Throwing .newsrc into the pot twice is a lovely hack to prevent
: bogus newsgroups from showing up as unsubscribed.
