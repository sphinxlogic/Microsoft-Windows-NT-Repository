     Rnmail is a friendly interface for mailing replies  to  news
     articles.   It will ask several questions, then allow you to
     enter your letter, and then mail it off.  If you type h  and
     a carriage return at any point, _R_n_m_a_i_l will tell you what it
     wants to know.

     The  h form is used when invoked from _r_n.   If  your  editor
     can  edit  multiple files, and you want the article to which
     you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the
     environment  variable  MAILPOSTER as "Rnmail  h %h %A".  You
     can also modify the the MAILHEADER environment  variable  to
     change the header file that _r_n passes to Rnmail.

     DOTDIR  If defined, specifies a place other than  your  home
             directory  where 'dot' files may be stored.  This is
             primarily for accounts which are shared by more than
             one person.

             Default: $HOME

     EDITOR  The editor you want to use, if VISUAL is undefined.

             Default: whatever your news administrator installed,
             usually vi.

     HOME    Your home directory.

             Default: $LOGDIR

     LOGDIR  Your home directory if HOME is undefined.

     LOGNAME Your login name, if USER is undefined.

             Default: value of "whoami".

     MAILRECORD
             If defined, contains the name of a file to which the
             finished message will be appended.

             Default: message not saved
