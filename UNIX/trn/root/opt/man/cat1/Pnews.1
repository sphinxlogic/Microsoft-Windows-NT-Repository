     Pnews is a friendly interface for posting news articles.  It
     will  ask  several  questions,  then allow you to enter your
     article, and then post it using the  inews(1)  program.   If
     you  type  h  and a carriage return at any point, _P_n_e_w_s will
     tell you what it wants to know.

     The  h form is used when invoked from _r_n.   If  your  editor
     can  edit  multiple files, and you want the article to which
     you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the
     environment  variable  NEWSPOSTER  as "Pnews  h %h %A".  You
     can also modify the the NEWSHEADER environment  variable  to
     change the header file that _r_n passes to Pnews.

     DOTDIR  Where to find your dot files, if they aren't in your
             home  directory.   This  is  primarily  for accounts
             which are shared by more than one person.

             Default: $HOME

     EDITOR  The editor you want to use, if VISUAL is undefined.

             Default: whatever your news administrator installed,
             usually vi.

     HOME    Your home directory.

             Default: $LOGDIR

     LOGDIR  Your home directory if HOME is undefined.

     LOGNAME Your login name, if USER is undefined.

             Default: value of "whoami".

     blessing to the net.
