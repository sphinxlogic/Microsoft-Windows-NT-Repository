Modifications:

0. Running configure just doesn't work well enough:

   - the CFLAGS get set incorrectly
   - the prefix is wrong

   You can fix these with

      CFLAGS="-g -O3" configure --prefix=/opt

   - the man pages get installed in the wrong directory
   - the man pages don't get their security set correctly
   - the man pages don't get formatted
   - configure doesn't recognise getcwd, though it checks for it

   I consider this method of configuration to be broken. Since we
   don't have time to write an Imakefile, I have just modified the
   Makefile. If you re-run configure for any reason, be aware of the
   tidying up you'll need to do afterwards.

1. link fails with missing getwd.o. This is a result of an error in
   configure. Fix the Makefile and try again.

0. Copy configuration info (Makefile, config.status) from previous
   build. Fix Makefile (info file name changed), try to make depend.
   Dependencies were already there, but the Makefile has no depend
   target. Use makedepend *.c, and remove the junk caused by
   makedepend header line differences.
