     _B_t_o_a is a filter  that  reads  anything  from  the  standard
     input,  and  encodes it into printable ASCII on the standard
     output.  It also attaches a header and checksum  information
     used  by  the  reverse  filter _a_t_o_b to find the start of the
     data and to check integrity.

     _A_t_o_b reads an encoded  file,  strips  off  any  leading  and
     trailing lines added by mailers, and recreates a copy of the
     original file on the standard output.  _A_t_o_b gives NO  output
     (and exits with an error message) if its input is garbage or
     the checksums do not check.

     _B_t_o_a uses a compact base-85 encoding so  that  4  bytes  are
     encoded  into  5 characters (file is expanded by 25%).  As a
     special case, 32-bit zero is encoded as one character.  This
     encoding produces less output than _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e(1).
