     _B_a_d_t_a_r can be used to extract files from a  tar  tape  which
     contains  read  errors.  It is used as a filter whose output
     should be piped into tar thus:

          badtar -f /dev/rmt0 -l logfile | tar xvf -

     This program is not perfect. It cannot read what  cannot  be
     read,  but  it  will continue over read errors, pad files to
     suitable lengths when blocks are missing, ignore files whose
     header tar blocks are mangled, etc...

     It is possible to read from a pipe by giving -  as  argument
     to  -ffff.   However  in that case, you need another program to
     read the tape device (for instance _d_d) and read erros may be
     fatal.  Besides,  _b_a_d_t_a_r has some neat options which let you
     overwrite the owner of the files in the archive or strip the
     leading '/' in the path name to make them relative.  Here is
     a way of reading from a remote tape drive located on _m_o_o_n:

          remsh moon dd if=/dev/rmt0 conv=noerror,sync | \
          badtar -f - | tar xvf -


     The log file (-llll flag) gives a  list  of  all  files  found,
     indicates which of them were padded, shows where blocks were
     deleted (i.e. files were lost) and where bad blocks  occured
     on  the  tape.  You can get a good idea from this list where
     files will have been mangled or  lost.  All  error  messages
     begin  with  *** which makes life easier to find errors in a
     long list.  If the -llll flag is not given stderr is defaulted.
     If the -ffff flag is not given /_d_e_v/_r_c_t_0 is defaulted.

     -ffff _f_i_l_e   tells _b_a_d_t_a_r the output is to be taken  from  file
               _f_i_l_e.  Use  -  to read standard input. By default,
               _b_a_d_t_a_r attempts to read /_d_e_v/_r_c_t_0.

     -gggg _g_i_d    directs _b_a_d_t_a_r to overwrite  group  membership  to
               _g_i_d  on  file extraction.  The _g_i_d has to be given
               in numeric form. Use _0 to force  the  _g_i_d  of  the
               user running badtar.

     -hhhh        prints the usage message and exits.

     -iiii        makes _b_a_d_t_a_r ignore the end of tape blocks.  There
               is  a  risk _b_a_d_t_a_r enters in an infinite loop when
               this option is used.

     -llll _l_o_g_f_i_l_e
               sets a logfile for _b_a_d_t_a_r to  redirect  his  error
               messages. By default, the standard error is used.

     -oooo        directs _b_a_d_t_a_r to overwrite the ownership  of  the
               file (both _u_i_d and _g_i_d). It is a shortcut for -uuuu _0
               -gggg _0.

     -rrrr        builds relative paths  out  of  absolute  ones  by
               removing the leading slash in the file name.

     -ssss        asks for silent mode. No logging is done.

     -uuuu _u_i_d    directs _b_a_d_t_a_r to overwrite ownership  to  _u_i_d  on
               file  extraction.   The  _u_i_d  has  to  be given in
               numeric form. Use _0 to force the _u_i_d of  the  user
               running  badtar.  This  means  there  is no way to
               force the owner to _r_o_o_t unless _b_a_d_t_a_r  is  run  by
               the super-user. It is considered to be a feature.

     -vvvv        asks for verbose mode. The tar headers are written
               when found on the tape.

     -VVVV        prints version number and exits.
