     _M_d_e_l deletes a file on an MSDOS filesystem.

     _M_d_e_l will allow the following command line option:

     vvvv    Verbose mode.  Echo the  filenames  as  they  are  pro-
          cessed.

     _M_d_e_l will ask for verification prior to removing a read-only
     file.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either  the  '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the names to be enclosed in quotes  to  protect
     them from the shell.

     The _m_c_d command may be used to establish the device and  the
     current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
     default is A:/.

     _M_d_e_l returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on  par-
     tial failure.
