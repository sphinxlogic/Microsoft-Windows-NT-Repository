     Without arguments, _m_c_d will report the  current  device  and
     working  directory.  Otherwise, _m_c_d changes the current dev-
     ice and current  working  directory  relative  to  an  MSDOS
     filesystem.

     The environmental variable MCWD may be used  to  locate  the
     file where the device and current working directory informa-
     tion is stored.  The default is '$HOME/.mcwd'.   Information
     in  this  file  is  ignored if the file is more than 6 hours
     old.

     MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either  the  '/'
     or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
     will require the directory name to be enclosed in quotes  to
     protect it from the shell.

     _M_c_d returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

     Unlike MSDOS versions of CD, _m_c_d can be used  to  change  to
     another device.

     It may be wise to remove old .mcwd files at logout.
