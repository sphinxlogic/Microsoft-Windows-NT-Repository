Program:	Xw
Revision:	not identified
Date ported:	6 February 1994
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.5.8

Prerequisites:	X11

Documentation:	Preformatted documentation (PostScript) and man pages.

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		The HP Widgets are one of the precursors of Motif
		widgets, and have numerous similiarities. However, the
		lack of documentation and the (apparent) number of
		bugs make them less appetizing.

Modifications:

0. xmkmf, etc. Problems with Imakefiles with MButton; only partially
   solved.
