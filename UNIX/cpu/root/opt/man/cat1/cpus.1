     CCCCppppuuuussss pops up an X window showing details of CPU usage on the
     machines  given  as  arguments. If no arguments are given, a
     default set of machines is used. A ppppssss is  launched  on  each
     machine  via rrrrsssshhhh and the results are displayed. This is use-
     ful if you want to get a quick idea  of  the  state  of  the
     machines  on  your  network.   Each  machine's  CPU usage is
     represented as a series of vertical bars,  each  contains  a
     user  name and they are sized in proportion to the amount of
     CPU they are consuming.

     The display is static i.e. it does not update after  a  cer-
     tain  time.  This  is  intended  to  give a quick picture of
     what's going on, not to be a CPU hog itself.

     Your resource file can specify the color to use for a  given
     user.   If you have a user called jjjjkkkkhhhh then you can put some-
     thing like the following in your ~/.Xdefaults  (or  wherever
     you keep your application's defaults).

         cpus*jkh.background: red
         cpus*jkh.foreground: white

     Colors for the various machine names may  be  given  in  the
     same  fashion.  If you have a conflict with machine and user
     names, tough cookies!

     Doesn't attempt to make sure that a slice showing a  propor-
     tion of CPU usage is actually big enough to hold the name of
     that user.
