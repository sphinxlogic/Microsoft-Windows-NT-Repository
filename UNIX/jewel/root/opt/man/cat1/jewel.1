     _J_e_w_e_l is a droping block game akin to tetris.

     It is played by controling the motion of blocks  which  con-
     tinue to fall from the top of the screen.  One can move them
     left and right, as well as rotate the jewel segements.   The
     object is to get the most points before the grim reaper ends
     the fun.

     Death happens when the screen is no longer capable of  hold-
     ing  any more blocks.  To make high scores more interesting,
     you are given but three attempts to get points --  use  them
     wisely.

     As the game progresses, and more  jewels  are  removed,  the
     speed  of  the  game  will  increase.   This  is measured in
     seconds of delay between steps of block motion.

     The basic way to get points is to unite the jewels  to  form
     triplet (or higher) matches.  This can be done in any direc-
     tion, and can be accomplished in more than one part  of  the
     board  at  one  time.   As the jewels are removed, the board
     falls to fill the spaces -- matches may again occur.

     These teritiary matches provide an interesting part  to  the
     game due to the formula for calculating points:

         ( 300 (for base triplet) + 150 * (each additional jewel)
     ) * 2^order

         where order is the number of the  repeition  from  which
     the match
         occured.

     As a light at the end of the bleak tunnel, a  WILD  CARD  is
     available.   The  wild  block  will  be  given at infrequent

     intervals, and will give the user the points for one triplet
     by removing all the jewels of a particular shape/color.

     To add some interest to the game,  points  are  awarded  for
     dropping  the  block  from a height above its resting place.
     This is accumlated at 10 points per level above the place it
     will rest.

     There are no changes for the  higher  levels,  although  the
     speed   increases,   proportionaly   to  the  level.   Stage
     increases with the successful completion of  the  50  jewels
     required per level.  The current status is shown in the REST
     field.

     This game was originally written by Yoshihiro Satoh  of  HP.
     I  have  made  a modest attempt to replicate Domain/JewelBox
     under X.

     I have somewhat rudely taken the bitmaps from  the  original
     game and created this version.  I hold the copyright for the
     code, as I created it, but I hold no claim  to  the  bitmaps
     which were freely distributed with the Domain version.

     NOTE: I have attempted to reach the holder of  the  original
     copyright  to  ascertain  his  acceptance for the release of
     this game, he did not, or was not able to reply.

     REDISTRIBUTION in source or binary from is permited as  long
     as adequate notation of the originators is retained, includ-
     ing the developer of the original Domain/Jewlbox,  Yoshihiro
     Satoh.

     USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND PERIL, I MAKE NO CLAIM OF  USEABIL-
     ITY OR WARANTY.
