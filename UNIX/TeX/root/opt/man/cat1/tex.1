     TeX formats the interspersed text and commands contained  in
     the  named  files  and outputs a typesetter independent file
     (called _D_V_I which is short  for  _De_Vice  _Independent).   TeX
     capabilities  and  language  are described in _T_h_e _T_e_X_b_o_o_k by
     Donald E. Knuth, published by Addison-Wesley.

     TeX is normally used with a large body of  precompiled  mac-
     ros, and there are several specific formatting systems, such
     as LaTeX, which require the support of several macro  files.
     The basic programs as compiled are called _i_n_i_t_e_x and _v_i_r_t_e_x,
     and are distinguished by the fact that _i_n_i_t_e_x can be used to
     precompile macros into a ._f_m_t file, which is used by _v_i_r_t_e_x.
     On the other hand, _v_i_r_t_e_x starts more quickly and can read a
     precompiled  ._f_m_t file, but it cannot create one.  It is the
     version of TeX which is usually invoked  in  production,  as
     opposed to installation.

     Any arguments given on the command line to the TeX  programs
     are  passed  to  them  as  the first input line.  (But it is
     often easier to type extended arguments as the  first  input
     line,  since  shells tend to gobble up or misinterpret TeX's
     favorite symbols, like backslashes, unless you quote  them.)
     As  described  in  _T_h_e _T_e_X_b_o_o_k, that first line should begin
     with a file name or a \controlsequence.  The normal usage is
     to say ``tttteeeexxxx _p_a_p_e_r'' to start processing _p_a_p_e_r._t_e_x. The name
     ``paper'' will be the ``jobname'', and is  used  in  forming
     output  file  names.   If TeX doesn't get a file name in the
     first line, the jobname is ``texput''.  The  default  exten-
     sion,  ._t_e_x,  can  be  overridden by specifying an extension
     explicitly.

     If there is no paper.tex in the current directory, TeX  will
     look  look  through  a  search path of directories to try to
     find it.  If ``paper'' is the ``jobname''  a  log  of  error
     messages,  with  rather more detail than normally appears on
     the screen, will appear in _p_a_p_e_r._l_o_g, and  the  output  file
     will be in _p_a_p_e_r._d_v_i. The system library ////oooopppptttt////lllliiiibbbb////tttteeeexxxx////mmmmaaaaccccrrrroooossss
     contains the basic macro package _p_l_a_i_n._t_e_x, described in _T_h_e
     _T_e_X_b_o_o_k,  as well as several others.  Except when ._f_m_t files
     are being prepared it is hardly  ever  necessary  to  \input
     plain,  since  almost  all instances of TeX begin by loading

     _p_l_a_i_n._f_m_t.  This means that all  of  the  control  sequences
     discussed in _T_h_e _T_e_X_b_o_o_k are known when you invoke _t_e_x.  For
     a discussion of ._f_m_t files, see below.

     Several environment variables can be used to set  up  direc-
     tory  paths  to search when TeX opens a file for input.  For
     example, the _c_s_h command
         setenv TEXINPUTS .:/usr/me/mylib:/opt/lib/tex/macros
     or the _s_h command sequence
         TEXINPUTS=.:/usr/me/mylib:/opt/lib/tex/macros
         export TEXINPUTS
     would cause all invocations of TeX and  its  derivatives  to
     look  for  \input files first in the current directory, then
     in a hypothetical user's ``mylib'', and finally in the  sys-
     tem library.  Normally, you would place the variable assign-
     ment which sets up the  TEXINPUTS  environment  variable  in
     your  ._l_o_g_i_n  or  ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e  file.  The environment variables
     section below lists the relevant environment variables,  and
     their defaults.

     The _e response to  TeX's  error  prompt  causes  the  system
     default  editor  to  start  up  at  the  current line of the
     current file.  There is an  environment  variable,  TEXEDIT,
     that  can be used to change the editor used.  It should con-
     tain a string with "%s" indicating where the  filename  goes
     and  "%d"  indicating  where the decimal linenumber (if any)
     goes.  For example, a TEXEDIT string for _v_i can be set  with
     the _c_s_h command
         setenv TEXEDIT "/usr/ucb/vi +%d %s"

     A convenient file in the  library  is  _n_u_l_l._t_e_x,  containing
     nothing.   When  TeX can't find a file it thinks you want to
     input, it keeps asking you for another file name;   respond-
     ing  `null'  gets  you  out of the loop if you don't want to
     input anything.  You can also type your EOF character  (usu-
     ally control-D).

     The _i_n_i_t_e_x and _v_i_r_t_e_x programs can be used to  create  fast-
     loading  versions  of  TeX based on macro source files.  The
     _i_n_i_t_e_x program is used to create a _f_o_r_m_a_t (._f_m_t)  file  that
     permits  fast  loading  of  fonts and macro packages.  After
     processing the fonts and definitions desired, a  \dump  com-
     mand  will  create the format file.  The format file is used
     by _v_i_r_t_e_x. It needs to be given a format file  name  as  the
     first  thing it reads.  A format file name is preceded by an
     &, which needs to be escaped with \ to prevent  misinterpre-
     tation by your shell if given on the command line.

     Fortunately, it is no  longer  necessary  to  make  explicit
     references  to the format file.  The present version of TeX,
     when compiled from this distribution, looks at its own  com-
     mand  line  to  determine what name it was called under.  It

     then uses that name, with the ``.fmt'' suffix  appended,  to
     search  for  the  appropriate format file.  During installa-
     tion,  one format file with the name _t_e_x._f_m_t, with only  the
     _p_l_a_i_n._t_e_x  macros  defined,  should have been created.  This
     will be your format file when you  invoke  _v_i_r_t_e_x  with  the
     name  _t_e_x.   You can also create a file _m_y_t_e_x._f_m_t using _i_n_i_-
     _t_e_x, so that this will be loaded when you invoke _v_i_r_t_e_x with
     the  name _m_y_t_e_x.  To make the whole thing work, it is neces-
     sary to link _v_i_r_t_e_x to all the names of  format  files  that
     you  have  prepared.   Hard  links  will  do for system-wide
     equivalences and Unix systems  which  do  not  use  symbolic
     links.  Symbolic links can be used for access to formats for
     individual projects.  For example: _v_i_r_t_e_x can be hard linked
     to  _t_e_x  in the general system directory for executable pro-
     grams, but an individual version of TeX will more likely  be
     linked by a symbolic link in a privately maintained path
         ln -s /opt/bin/virtex mytex
     in a directory such as /_h_o_m_e/_m_e/_b_i_n.

     Another approach is to set up a alias  using,  for  example,
     the C shell:
         alias mytex virtex \&myfmt
     Besides being more cumbersome, however, this approach is not
     available  to systems which do not accept aliases.  Finally,
     there is the system known  as  ``undump''  which  takes  the
     headers from an _a._o_u_t file (e.g. _v_i_r_t_e_x) and applies them to
     a core image which has been dumped by the Unix QUIT  signal.
     This  is very system-dependent, and produces extremely large
     files when used with a large-memory version  of  TeX.   This
     can  produce  executables which load faster, but the execut-
     ables also consume enormous amounts of disk space.

     The defaults for all environment variables are  set  at  the
     time of compilation in a file named _s_i_t_e._h in the web2c dis-
     tribution.  All paths are colon-separated.  If  you  set  an
     environment  variable  to  a value that has a leading colon,
     the system default shown here is prepended.  Likewise for  a
     trailing colon.  For example, if you say
         setenv TEXFONTS /u/karl/myfonts:
     TeX will search
         /u/karl/myfonts:.:/opt/lib/tex/inputs  Furthermore,  the
     person  who  installed  TeX  at your site may have chosen to
     allow one level of subdirectories to be  searched  automati-
     cally  (by  defining  the  symbol  SEARCH_SUBDIRECTORIES  in
     _s_i_t_e._h).  In that case, subdirectories of directories in the
     environment  variable  TEXFONTS_SUBDIR are also searched for
     fonts, and subdirectories of directories in the  environment
     variable TEXINPUTS_SUBDIR are also searched for input files.
     All the programs in the base TeX distribution use this  same
     search method.

     Normally, TeX puts its output files in  the  current  direc-
     tory.   If  any output file cannot be opened there, it tries
     to open it in the directory  specified  in  the  environment
     variable  TEXMFOUTPUT.  There  is  no default value for that
     variable.  For example, if you say tttteeeexxxxpaper and the  current
     directory  is  not  writable,  and TEXMFOUTPUT has the value
     ////ttttmmmmpppp,   TeX   attempts   to   create   ////ttttmmmmpppp////ppppaaaappppeeeerrrr....lllloooogggg   (and
