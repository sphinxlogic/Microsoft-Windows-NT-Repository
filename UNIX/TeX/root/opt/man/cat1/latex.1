     The      LaTeX      language      is      described       in
     _L_a_T_e_X-_ADocument_P_r_e_p_a_r_a_t_i_o_nSystem  by  Leslie  Lamport,  pub-
     lished by Addison-Wesley.  LaTeX is a TeX macro package, not
     a  modification  to the TeX source program, so all the capa-
     bilities described in tttteeeexxxx(1) are present.

     The LaTeX macros encourage writers to think about  the  con-
     tent  of  their documents, rather than the form.  The ideal,
     not always realized, is to have no formatting commands (like
     ``switch to italic'' or ``skip 2 picas'') in the document at
     all;   instead,   everything    is    done    intensionally:
     ``emphasize'', ``start a section''.
