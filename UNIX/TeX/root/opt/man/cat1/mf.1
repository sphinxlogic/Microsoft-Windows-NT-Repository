     METAFONT reads the program in the specified files  and  out-
     puts  font  rasters  (in _g_f format) and font metrics (in _t_f_m
     format).   The  METAFONT  language  is  described   in   _T_h_e
     _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k  by  Donald  E.  Knuth,  published  by Addison-
     Wesley.

     Like TeX , METAFONT is normally used with a  large  body  of
     precompiled   macros,  and  font  generation  in  particular
     requires the support of several macro files.  The basic pro-
     gram  as compiled is called _i_n_i_m_f; it can be used to precom-
     pile macros into a ._b_a_s_e file.  The _v_i_r_m_f variant is used to
     reload  the ._b_a_s_e files quickly.  Typically, _v_i_r_m_f has links
     to it by the names of the various base files.  For  example,
     if  you  link _f_o_o to _v_i_r_m_f and then execute the program _f_o_o,
     you get the base file _f_o_o._b_a_s_e.  You can  load  a  different
     base by saying, e.g., _v_i_r_m_f&mybase.

     As described in _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k, the command line (or first
     input  line)  should  otherwise  begin with a file name or a
     \controlsequence.  The normal usage is to say

          mmmmffff   '\mode=<printengine>;  [mag=magstep(_n);]'   input
          _f_o_n_t

     to start processing _f_o_n_t._m_f.  The single quotes are the best
     way  of  keeping  your  shell from misinterpreting the semi-
     colons and from removing the \ character,  which  is  needed
     here to keep METAFONT from thinking that you want to produce
     a font called ``mode''. (Or you can just say mmmmffff and give the
     other stuff on the next line, without quotes.) Other control
     sequences, such as bbbbaaaattttcccchhhhmmmmooooddddeeee (for silent operation) can also
     appear.  The  name  ``font'' will be the ``jobname'', and is
     used in forming output file names.  If METAFONT doesn't  get
     a  file  name  in  the first line, the jobname is ``mfput''.
     The default extension, ._m_f, can be overridden by  specifying
     an extension explicitly.

     A log of error messages goes into the file _j_o_b_n_a_m_e...._l_o_g.  The
     output  files  are _j_o_b_n_a_m_e...._t_f_m and _j_o_b_n_a_m_e....<number>_g_f, where
     <number> depends on the resolution and magnification of  the
     font.   The ``mode'' in this example is shown generically as

     <printengine>, a symbolic term for  which  the  name  of  an
     actual  device or the name ``localfont'' (see below) must be
     substituted. If the mode is not specified or  is  not  valid
     for your site, METAFONT will default to ``proof'' mode which
     produces large character images for use in font  design  and
     refinement.   Proof  mode  can  be  recognized by the suffix
     ._2_6_0_2_g_f after the jobname.  Examples of  proof  mode  output
     can be found in _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_rModern_T_y_p_e_f_a_c_e_s, (Volume E of _C_o_m_p_u_-
     _t_e_r_sand_T_y_p_e_s_e_t_t_i_n_g), by Donald Knuth.  The  system  of  _m_a_g_-
     _s_t_e_p_s  is  identical to the system used by TeX , with values
     generally in the range 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and  5.0.   A
     listing of gf numbers for 118-dpi, 240-dpi and 300-dpi fonts
     is shown below.
                MAGSTEP        118 dpi   240 dpi   300 dpi
            mag=magstep(0)       118       240       300
            mag=magstep(0.5)     129       263       329
            mag=magstep(1)       142       288       360

            mag=magstep(5)       294       597       746

     Magnification can also be specified not as a magstep but  as
     an arbitrary value, such as 1.315, to create special charac-
     ter sizes.

     Before font production can begin, it is necessary to set  up
     the  appropriate  base files.  The minimum set of components
     for font production for a given print-engine is the _p_l_a_i_n._m_f
     macro  file  and  the  local `mode_def' file.  The macros in
     _p_l_a_i_n._m_f can be studied in an appendix to the  _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k;
     they  were  developed  by Donald Knuth, and this file should
     never be altered except when it is officially upgraded. Each
     mode_def  specification  helps  adapt  fonts to a particular
     print-engine.  There is a regular discussion of mode_defs in
     the  journal of the TeX Users Group, _T_U_G_b_o_a_t; the local ones
     in use on this computer should be somewhere in the directory
     ////oooopppptttt////lllliiiibbbb////mmmmffff////mmmmaaaaccccrrrroooossss.   With  only  _p_l_a_i_n._m_f and the ``modes''
     file loaded it is possible to create fonts of simple charac-
     ters,  such  as  those used for the METAFONT logo, and those
     used for the LaTeX  line and circle fonts, but  the  produc-
     tion of Computer Modern fonts would be facilitated by making
     a _c_m_m_f._b_a_s_e file (which includes the macros in _c_m_b_a_s_e._m_f  as
     well as those in _p_l_a_i_n._m_f).

     Several environment variables can be used to set  up  direc-
     tory  paths  to search when METAFONT opens a file for input.
     For example, the _c_s_h command
         setenv MFINPUTS .:/usr/me/mylib:/opt/lib/mf/macros
     or the _s_h command sequence
         MFINPUTS=.:/usr/me/mylib:/opt/lib/mf/macros
         export MFINPUTS

     would cause all invocations of METAFONT and its  derivatives
     to  look  for  \input  files first in the current directory,
     then in a hypothetical user's ``mylib'', and finally in  the
     system  library.   Normally, the user will place the command
     sequence which sets up the MFINPUTS environment variable  in
     his or her ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file.

     The _e response to METAFONT's error-recovery mode invokes the
     system  default  editor  at the erroneous line of the source
     file.  There is an environment variable, MFEDIT, that  over-
     rides  the  default  editor. It should contain a string with
     "%s" indicating where the filename goes and "%d"  indicating
     where the decimal linenumber (if any) goes.  For example, an
     MFEDIT string for the _v_i editor can be set with the _c_s_h com-
     mand
             setenv MFEDIT "/usr/ucb/vi +%d %s"
9     The environment variables section below lists  the  relevant
     environment variables, and their defaults.

     A convenient file in  the  library  is  _n_u_l_l._m_f,  containing
     nothing.   When _m_f can't find the file it thinks you want to
     input, it keeps asking you for another file name;   respond-
     ing  `null'  gets  you  out of the loop if you don't want to
     input anything.

     METAFONT can use most modern displays, so you  can  see  its
     output  without  printing.   Chapter  23 of _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k
     describes what you can do.  This implementation of  METAFONT
     uses environment variables to determine which display device
     you want to use.  First it looks for a variable MFTERM,  and
     then  for  TERM.  If it can't find either, you get no online
     output.  Otherwise, the value of the variable determines the
     device to use:  hhhhpppp2222666622227777, ssssuuuunnnn (for SunView), tttteeeekkkk, uuuunnnniiiitttteeeerrrrmmmm (for

     X11).   Some  of  these  devices may not be supported in all
     METAFONT executables; the  choice  is  made  at  compilation
     time.

     The default values for all environment variables are set  at
