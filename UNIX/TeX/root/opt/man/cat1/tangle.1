     The _t_a_n_g_l_e program converts a WEB  source  document  into  a
     Pascal  program  that  may be compiled in the usual way with
     the on-line Pascal compiler (e.g., ppppcccc(1)).  The output  file
     is  all in lower case and packed into lines of 72 characters
     or less, with the only concession to readability  being  the
     termination  of  lines  at  semicolons when this can be done
     conveniently.

     The WEB language allows you to  prepare  a  single  document
     containing  all  the information that is needed both to pro-
     duce a compilable Pascal program  and  to  produce  a  well-
     formatted  document describing the program in as much detail
     as the writer may desire.  The user of WEB must be  familiar
     with  both  TeX  and Pascal.  WEB also provides a relatively
     simple, although adequate, macro  facility  that  permits  a
     Pascal  program  to  be  written  in small easily-understood
     modules.

     The command line should have either one or two names on  it.
     The  first  is  taken  as the WEB file (and ._w_e_b is added if
     there is no extension).  If there is another name, it  is  a
     change  file  (and  ._c_h  is added if there is no extension).
     The  change  file  overrides  parts  of  the  WEB  file,  as
     described in the WEB system documentation.

     The output files are a Pascal file and a string  pool  file,
     whose  names  are formed by adding ._p and ._p_o_o_l respectively
     to the root of the WEB file name.

     The _w_e_a_v_e program is used to create a TeX file  for  viewing
     the  WEB  program.  It takes appropriate care of typographic
     details like page layout and the use of  indentation,  ital-
     ics,  boldface,  etc., and it supplies extensive cross-index
     information that it gathers automatically.  The command line
     arguments  are the same as for _t_a_n_g_l_e except for the option:
     ----xxxx says to omit the index, module name list,  and  table  of
     contents  pages.  (A _C_O_N_T_E_N_T_S._t_e_x file will still be written
     when the TeX file is processed, however, unless some  macros
     in _w_e_b_m_a_c._t_e_x are redefined.)

     The output TeX file name is formed by  adding  ._t_e_x  to  the
     root of the WEB file name.

     There are several macros that probably should  be  redefined
     by the programmer at the beginning of the WEB file.  It is a
     good idea to set \title to the name of the program.  And, to
     cause   output   of   only  changed  modules,  one  can  say
     \let\maybe=\iffalse (usually as  the  first  change  in  the
     change file).

     WEB was designed by Donald E. Knuth,  based  on  an  earlier
     system called DOC (implemented by Ignacio Zabala).  The _t_a_n_-
     _g_l_e and _w_e_a_v_e programs are themselves written  in  WEB.  The
     system  was  originally ported to Unix at Stanford by Howard
     Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.
