     The _v_p_t_o_v_f program translates  a  (human-oriented)  property
     list  file  to  a pair of (program-oriented) files in the VF
     (virtual font) and TFM (TeX font metric)  formats.  Thus,  a
     virtual  font  file can be edited and its exact contents can
     be displayed mnemonically.  New  virtual  fonts,  which  map
     characters  as  seen  by  TeX  into an arbitrary sequence of
     low-level typesetting operations, can  also  be  created  in
     this way.

     All  three  file  names,  _v_p_l__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e,  _v_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e,  and
     _t_f_m__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e, must be complete. No adding of default exten-
     sions or path searching is done.

     Donald Knuth wrote the program, based in part on an idea  of
     David  Fuchs,  starting  with  the code for ppppllllttttoooottttffff(1).  Karl
     Berry originally ported it to Unix.
