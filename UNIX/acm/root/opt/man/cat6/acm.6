     acm is an air combat simulator that runs under the X  window
     system.   Up to eight players can engage in simultaneous air
     combat.  Players fly jet aircraft equipped with radar,  heat
     seeking missiles and cannon.

     The program, "acm", calls a daemon already  running  on  the
     specified  server_hostname  and requests that your enter the
     game.  The shell variable "ACMSERVER"  optionally  specifies
     the name of the server host.

     Each player flies something close to either an F-16C  Falcon
     or MIG-23.

     To begin play, the flight simulator server must  be  started
     manually on a system that is accessible to all players.

     The following command line will do that:


          % acms

          The following command line options  are  recognized  by
          acm:

     -geometry geometry_spec
          An X compatible window geometry specification

     -team <1 or 2>
          Specifies the starting airfield.  Airfields  are  about
          50  nm  apart.   Team 1 flies F-16's, team 2 flies MIG-
          23's.

     -dv  Use the X server's  default  visual  for  your  screen.
          Normally,  acm  will hunt for a Visual that has a depth
          of eight planes.  It will also create a private  color-
          map  for acm's use.  If your screen's default Visual is
          an 8-plane PseudoColor Visual, using this  switch  will
          allow  acm  to  use the "public" Colormap so that other
          windows won't change color when acm is in use.

     Your mouse is the control stick.  The  neutral  position  is
     the center of your view display -- denoted by the dot in the
     center of your heads-up-display  (HUD).   Moving  the  mouse
     away from you pitches the plane down, moving it back pitches
     the plane up.  Left and right inputs roll  the  aircraft  in
     the  corresponding direction.  On the ground at speeds up to
     100 kts, nose wheel steering guides the aircraft.

     To take off for the first time, select 20 degrees  of  flaps
     (press H twice), then press the full throttle key (the 4 key
     on the main keyboard).  Keep the mouse in the neutral  posi-
     tion  until  you  are moving at about 140 kts, then pull the
     mouse about two-thirds of the way down the view window.  You
     should pitch up and lift off the ground fairly easily.  Gra-
     dually move the stick closer to the neutral position and let
     your  airspeed  build  --  don't move it back to neutral too
     quickly or you will end up back on  the  ground  again!   As
     your airspeed passes about 250 kts, raise the flaps (press Y
     twice) and landing gear (press G).  Congratulations,  you're
     flying a multi-million dollar jet.

     The following keys control your engine thrust:


          4    Full Power

          3    Increase Power (about 2 percent)

          2    Decrease Power (about the same amount)

          1    Idle Power

          A    Toggle Afterburner

     Your engine gauge displays the power that you  are  generat-
     ing.   Below that, you have displays showing your total fuel
     remaining as well as your  current  fuel  consumption  rate.
     The afterburner uses fuel at an amazing rate; use it wisely.

     It pays to look around when you're in a combat  environment.
     Your chances of staying alive increase remarkably.

     On the left side of the HUD is a ladder showing your current
     airspeed  in  nautical  miles  per  hour  (it  displays true
     airspeed).  Above that, in the upper left corner,  is  a  G-
     meter.

     The right ladder shows altitude; above that is a readout  of
     your  current angle-of-attack in degrees ("a=X.X"). Your jet
     will stall at a 30 degrees  positive  angle  of  attack  and
     negative 16 degrees.

     The airplane symbol (something like "-O-") shows the  direc-
     tion  that  the  relative wind is coming from.  The relative
     wind combines your current angles of attack and sideslip.  A
     ladder in the center of the HUD show your aircraft's current
     attitude.

     The lower, horizontal ladder  shows  your  current  heading.
     Discretes  in  the  lower left-hand corner show the state of
     your weapons systems.  Slightly above them is a  readout  of
     your  current thrust percentage as well as the state of your
     engine's afterburner -- the "AB"  symbol  means  the  after-
     burner is on.

     The radar system has a field of view of 130  degrees  verti-
     cally  and side-to-side.  Radar automatically locks onto the
     closest threat in its field of view.   A  locked  target  is
     displayed  as  a  solid  block.   Other  hostile targets are
     displayed as hollow squares.

     Targetting information  is  displayed  in  the  lower  right
     corner of the display.  The top number is the heading of the
     locked target, the next number is the relative  heading  you
     should  steer to intercept the target (displayed as "ddd R",
     and the third number is the rate that you are  closing  with
     this target, expressed in knots.

     You can lock onto  other  targets  by  pressing  the  target
     designator key (Q).

     Radar sets that are tracking your aircraft can be  detected.
     Your Threat Early Warning System (TEWS) display warns you of
     potential threats.  This circular display shows the relative
     direction  of  radars  (other  aircraft) that are looking at
     you.

     Your aircraft is equipped with heat-seeking missiles  and  a
     20  millimeter  cannon.   Weapon information is displayed in
     the lower left-hand corner of your HUD.   Different  weapons
     may be selected by pressing mouse button 3.

     The missiles are patterned after  U.S.  AIM-9M  Sidewinders.
     They can detect infared (IR) targets at any aspect (not just
     from the rear).  Their range varies  dramatically  with  the
     altitude  and  closure  rate.  The missile subsystem couples
     with your radar set to  provide  time-to-impact  information
     when AIM-9's are selected.
