Comments:

Modifications:

0. Configure for 16384x16384 spreadsheets.

1. Set optimisation on in Makefile.

2. Set install to be /usr/ucb/install

3. Program works immediately, but looks terrible. Change the default
   X11 colours to display black on white (was the other way around).

4. Modify Makefile to install documentation as well.
