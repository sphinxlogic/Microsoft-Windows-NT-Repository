     It  was  developed  by Sunil Podar of Department of Computer
     Science in S.U.N.Y at Stony Brook.

     EEPIC is an extension to  EPIC  and  LaTeX  picture  drawing
     environment  which  uses tpic specials as a graphics mechan-
     ism.  It was written by Conrad Kwok of Division of  Computer
     Science at University of California, Davis.

     EEPIC-EMU is an EEPIC emulation package which does  not  use
     tpic specials.

          and  at the end of the file is controlled by the confi-
          guration parameter "Preamble" and "Postamble".

     ----SSSS   Set the scale to which the figure  is  rendered.   This
          option automatically sets the _m_a_g_n_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n and size to
          _s_c_a_l_e / 12 and _s_c_a_l_e respectively.

          file.

     When variable line width  option  is  enabled,  "\\\\tttthhhhiiiinnnnlllliiiinnnneeeessss"
     command  is  still used when line width is less than _L_i_n_e_T_h_-
     _i_c_k. One potential problem is that the width of "\\\\tttthhhhiiiinnnnlllliiiinnnneeeessss"
     is  0.4pt  but  the  resolution of Fig is 1/80 inch (approx.
     1pt). If _L_i_n_e_T_h_i_c_k is set to 2, normal lines will  be  drawn
     in  0.4pt wide lines but the next line width is already 2pt.
     One possible solution is to set _L_i_n_e_T_h_i_c_k to 1 and  set  the
     width  of  the  those  lines you want to be drawn in "\\\\tttthhhhiiiinnnn----
     lllliiiinnnneeeessss"  to 0.

     Due  to  this  problem,  Variable  line  width  _V_a_r_W_i_d_t_h  is
     defaulted to be false.

     LaTeX cannot accurately represent all the  graphics  objects

     slopes which lines may have are limited.  Some objects, such
     as spline curves, cannot be drawn at all.  Fig2latex chooses
     the closest possible line slope, and prints  error  messages
     when objects cannot be drawn accurately

     PiCTeX uses TeX  integer  register  arithmetic  to  generate

     files.  The size of TeX's memory limits the number  of  plot
     symbols in a picture.  As a result, it is best to use PiCTeX
     to generate small pictures.

     With PostScript, Fig can be used to  create  large  posters.
     The  figure will be created by printing multiple pages which
     can be glued together.  Due to memory  limitations  of  most
     laser  printers,  the  figure should not be too complicated.
     Great for text with very big letters.

     Text can now include various ISO-character codes above 0x7f,
     which  is  useful  for  language  specific  characters to be
     printed directly.  Not all ISO-characters are implemented.

     Color support: Colored objects created by Fig can be printed
     on  a  color postscript printer. Currently 8 colors are sup-
     ported: black, blue,  green,  cyan,  red,  magenta,  yellow,
     white.   On  a  monochrome  printer, colored objects will be
     mapped  into  different  grayscales.   Filled  objects   are
     printed  using the given grayscale. If filled with grayscale
     set to 100%, the object will be filled with the  same  color
     as the enclosing line.

     ----cccc   option centers the figure on the page.   The  centering
          may  not be accurate if there are texts in the _f_i_g__f_i_l_e

          will  not  necessarily be inserted into a document, but
          can be sent directly to a  PS  printer.   This  ensures
          that  a  showpage command is inserted at the end of the
