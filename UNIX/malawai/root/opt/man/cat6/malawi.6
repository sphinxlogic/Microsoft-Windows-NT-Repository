     _m_a_l_a_w_i is a strategy board game  for  2  players  which  has
     fairly  simple  rules.   If  played  by somewhat experienced
     opponents a game can take one hour and more.

     The board is a 6x6 raster.  Each player has a bbbbaaaasssseeee  lllliiiinnnneeee  on
     the board, 6 ssssttttiiiicccckkkkssss, and 12 eeeeuuuummmmeeeellllssss.  Initially, the 6 sticks
     are positioned on the base line,  each  carrying  2  eumels.
     The 2 players' base lines are opposite rows on the board.

     The goal of the game is to move  a  stick  that  carries  at
     least  one eumel onto the opponent's base line such that the
     eumels carried by the stick can not be  captured  immediatly
     by  the  opponent.  To  achieve  this goal the sticks can be
     moved, eumels can be redistributed,  and  opponent's  eumels
     can  be  captured.   There are always 6 sticks per player in
     the game, but the number of eumels will decrease (and  never
     increase) as they get captured.

     The program watches the rules, so it is not possible  for  a
     player to do something against the rules.

     The two opponents alternate their turns.  White  begins  the
     game.   During  his  turn,  a  player  must  do one of three
     things:

     Move a stick
          The player moves one of his sticks.  It  can  be  moved
          only  horizontally  or  vertically.  It  must  be moved
          exactly as many fields as  eumels  are  on  the  stick.
          (Hence,  a stick without eumels or with 6 eumels cannot
          be moved.)  The direction of the movement must  not  be
          altered during the move. All fields on the path as well
          as the final field must be  empty,  i.e.  no  stick  of
          either player may occupy such a field, not even a stick
          that carries no eumels.

     Capture opponent's eumels
          The player removes aaaallllllll eumels of one of the  opponent's
          sticks.  This  stick  must occupy a field that could be
          reached, if it were empty, by a move of a stick of  the
          player  as  described  above.  It  is  not  allowed  to
          "remove" zero eumels. The captured eumels  are  out  of
          play and are never returned.

     Distribute eumels
          The player distributes aaaallllllll eumels of one of his  sticks
          onto  his  other  sticks. It is not allowed to "distri-
          bute" zero eumels. Each stick may receive at  most  one
          eumel.  The stick which was emptied must not receive an
          eumel (it remains, therefore, empty). A stick can carry
          at most 6 eumels. If 6 eumels are to be distributed the
          superfluous eumel is removed from play and is lost.  On
          the other hand, it is not allowed to remove eumels from
          play by not putting it on any stick if there are  still
          sticks  which  can take an eumel (because they have not
          received one yet and they are not  the  stick  that  is
          distributed).

     The game ends in two cases:

     No eumels
          If a player loses all eumels he has lost the game.

     Eumel survives on enemy base line
          If a player's eumel survives one opponent's turn on the
          opponent's base line the player wins the game; that is,
          if the player gets his turn and still has  a  stick  on
          the  opponent's  base  line  and  this stick carries at
          least one eumel.

     When a player's turn begins he selects one  of  his  sticks.
     Then he chooses what to do with the stick by pressing one of
     the buttons "Move Stick", "Distribute Eumels",  or  "Capture
     Eumels". Then he either selects the destination field(s) and
     presses "Execute Turn" or he selects "Cancel Turn" in  which
     case he again can choose a field.

     A message line displays errors and gives  hints  on  what  a
     player can do.

     The buttons "New Game" and "Quit Game"  have  obvious  func-
     tions.  However,  if  one  player  presses the button only a
     request  is  issued:  The  button  is  highlighted  on  both
     players'  displays,  but  the function is not executed until
     the other player also presses the button and  thus  confirms
     the  request.  A  request can be withdrawn by the player who
     issued it before the  other  player  confirms  it  by  again
     pressing the button.

     Since _m_a_l_a_w_i is built on top of the X Toolkit and the Athena
     Widget Set, all standard toolkit options are accepted. Addi-
     tionally, _m_a_l_a_w_i  understands  the  following  command  line
     options and application resources:

     There's no possibility for the players to communicate unless
     they sit in the same room where they can yell each other.

     There is no possibility to take back  moves  once  they  are
     "executed".

     It is planned that the game can be played against  the  com-
     puter.
