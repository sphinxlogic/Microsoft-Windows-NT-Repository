About Xpeg

  Xpeg is a X simulation of the pegboard you see in many offices.  It allows
  many people across an entire X-Windowed and NFS'ed network to keep track of
  the comings and goings of each other.


  Xpeg accepts all standard X toolkit command line parameters.  You must
  specify an Xpeg file, which Xpeg uses to track locations of people. You
  may optionally specify your name.  If your name matches one in the Xpeg
  file, then you may edit your location on the pegboard.  The Xpeg file and
  your name may be set using the environment variables XPEG_FILE and XPEG_USER.



Making Xpeg

   No imakefile yet.  Just type:
				 	make xpeg

   To test after the make type:

					xpeg sample_pegfile "Ken Nelson"




Starting an Xpeg File.

  When you start an Xpeg file, Xpeg will only have its name and command buttons
  showing.  Press the NEW button to add users.  Once you have added all the
  users, press the SAVE button to update the pegfile.
  
  NOTE: In XPEG 1.0 adding a new users does not automatically resize the
        window.  You have do do this by hand. When Xpeg starts up with
        the new Xpeg next time the window will be the correct size.


What it all means.


  The buttons:

     about  - Pops up a little "About" box about Xpeg.

     quit   - quits Xpeg

     update - rescans the Xpeg file to see if anybody else using
	      it has changed there location. An update before a 
	      save will erase any changes you have made.

     save   - saves any changes you have made to the Pegfile.

     new    - adds a new person to the pegboard.

     group  - Changes the name of the group this pegboard tracks.
	      (The 3rd pane in the window)


     Your Username:  - Your name.  If it is Unkown then you won't be
		       allowed to edit any locations. You can't edit
		       any locations but yours.



  The pegboard has 3 fields:

    Name		- who it is.
    Date Updated	- the date the location what last updated.
    Location		- where the user was when last updated.
