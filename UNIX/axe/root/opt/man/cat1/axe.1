     _a_X_e is a simple to use text editor for X that  represents  a
     significant  improvement  over  xedit. Also built around the
     Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other things,

        o multiple windows
        o multiple buffers
        o default menu interface
        o optional button interface, with choice and layout
          of buttons under user control
        o minibuffer for expert use and access to filters
        o provision for defining a keyboard macro
        o geometry specification and resizing in terms of
          characters
        o file selection via a browser
        o knowledge of line numbers
        o parenthesis matching
        o regular expression searching
        o restricted or unlimited undo
        o ability to change font
        o easy entry of control codes
        o xterm-like keymap feature
        o easy runtime setting of selected preferences
        o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
        o server mode with cooperating client programs
        o optional extension language using Tcl
        o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability

     By default aXe provides a menu interface to some common Text
     Widget  operations  and  most  of  its  extra  features.  An
     optional button interface, in  which  there  is  one  button
     present for every static menu entry, can be selected via the
     keyword -_b_u_t_t_o_n_s, or by setting the top level resource  _b_u_t_-
     _t_o_n_s. A reduced button interface is configurable.

     Individual file names on the command line will be  allocated
     to  separate windows. A list of file names introduced by the
     keyword -_b_u_f_f_e_r will be allocated to  buffers  belonging  to
     the  same window (an older, still supported feature, enables
     the same to be achieved by quoting the list of names).  Note
     that  files  destined  for  individual  windows must precede
     those for buffers if the -buffer keyword is used. An initial
     number  of  windows  to open can be specified on the command
     line by using the keyword -_w_i_n_d_o_w_s  or  by  giving  the  top
     level  resource  _w_i_n_d_o_w_s  a  numeric  value.   The  value of

     windows is ignored if the files  specified  on  the  command
     line require more than that number of windows.

     If a top level geometry resource is provided, e.g. by  using
     the  toolkit  keyword  -_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y,  then the width and height
     fields will be interpreted to mean the  numbers  of  columns
     and rows respectively that editing widnows are to have.

     aXe also acts as a server of editing windows to  cooperating
     clients.  Two,  coaxe  and faxe, are provided as part of the
     aXe suite. Server mode is the default, but can  be  switched
     off  by using the command line keyword -_n_o_s_e_r_v_e_r, or by set-
     ting the top level resource _s_e_r_v_e_r False

     aXe has comprehensive on-line help, so, to avoid  having  to
     keep  the  information up to date in two places, it will not
     be duplicated here.

     That aXe makes use of code from Byron Rakitzis'  rc  command
     interpreter that is based on AT&T's Plan 9 shell of the same
     name is duly acknowledged.
