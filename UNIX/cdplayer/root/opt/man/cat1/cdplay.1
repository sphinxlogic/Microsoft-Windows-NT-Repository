Audio cdplayer for Toshiba cd-roms running under UnixWare.
Requires headphones or speakers to be plugged into your 
cd-rom player.

It's quick, simple and very dirty, but it works. 

To configure, edit cdplay.c, search for:

#define CD_ROM 

and substitute my cd-device for your cd-device

To compile type "make"

To install type "make install" (You must be root).

This consists of 2 parts. The first is called "cdplay" and will
print all options with the help of a "-?" flag. The second is a
Windowing Korn Shell script which acts as a front end to cdplay.

Once installed, type "cdfront" and press return. A display will 
appear with Numbers representing track numbers, and pixmaps
representing functions, which are L to R:

Back  Play  Skip
Pause Power Eject

Selecting a number will play from that track on (Remember, it's 
quick, simple and very dirty). Selecting Back will play the track
previous to the one initially selected, Skip will play the track
after the initially selected track, Play will play from the initially
selected track or from the first track when started, pause once will
pause, pause re-selected will start play again, Eject will eject the 
disk and Power will exit the program. 

The screen will not re-map when putting in a new cd, you must exit
the application and re-start it to map a new cd.

Do what I did, make a symbolic link from /usr/X/bin/cdfront to the
"Applications" folder in your home directoy, and launch the app 
by double-clicking on the icon with your mouse.
