Modifications:

0. run configure. This flavour of configure doesn't understand CFLAGS
   environment variable: fix Makefile manually.

1. tclExpr.o fails to compile with undefined hypot (). Turns out to be
   a problem with the header file math.h. Fix math.h

2. Run tests. README was unclear about which directory to use to make
   test: correct answer is project root directory.

   Failure:

format.test


==== format-5.4 floating-point zeroes
==== Contents of test case:

    format "%.0e %.0f %.0g" 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

==== Result was:
0e+00 0 0e+00
---- Result should have been:
0e+00 0 0
---- format-5.4 FAILED


==== format-5.5 floating-point zeroes
==== Contents of test case:

    format "%#.0e %#.0f %#.0g" 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

==== Result was:
0.e+00 0 0.e+00
---- Result should have been:
0.e+00 0. 0.
