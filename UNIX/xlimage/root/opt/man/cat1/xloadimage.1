     _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e displays images in an X11 window  or  loads  them
     onto the root window.  See the _I_M_A_G_E _T_Y_P_E_S section below for
     supported image types.

     If the filename _s_t_d_i_n is given,  xloadimage  will  read  the
     image from standard input.

     If the destination display  cannot  support  the  number  of
     colors  in the image, the image will be dithered (monochrome
     destination) or have its colormap  reduced  (color  destina-
     tion)  as  appropriate.  This can also be done forcibly with
     the -_h_a_l_f_t_o_n_e, -_d_i_t_h_e_r, and -_c_o_l_o_r_s options.

     A variety of image manipulations can be specified, including
     gamma  correction,  brightening, clipping, dithering, depth-
     reduction, rotation, and zooming.  Most of  these  manipula-
     tions have simple implementations; speed was opted for above
     accuracy.

     If you are viewing a large image in a  window,  the  initial
     window will be at most 90% of the size of the display unless
     the window manager does not  correctly  handle  window  size
     requests  or if you've used the -_f_u_l_l_s_c_r_e_e_n option.  You may
     move the image around in the window  by  dragging  with  the
     first  mouse  button.  The cursor will indicate which direc-
     tions you may drag, if any.  You may exit the window by typ-
     ing 'q' or '^C' when the keyboard focus is on the window.

     It's possible to have a "slideshow" of many images by speci-
     fying the -_s_l_i_d_e_s_h_o_w option.

     A wide variety of common image manipulations can be done  by
     mixing  and matching the available options.  See the section
     entitled _H_I_N_T_S _F_O_R _G_O_O_D _I_M_A_G_E _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y_S for some ideas.

     _X_s_e_t_b_g is equivalent to _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e -_o_n_r_o_o_t -_q_u_i_e_t and  _x_v_i_e_w

     _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e uses the resource class name _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e for  win-
     dow  managers  which  need  this  resource  set.   This name
     changed in version 2.00 and  2.01;  some  previous  versions
     used the name _X_L_o_a_d_I_m_a_g_e (which was difficult to predict) or
     _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e (which conflicted with class naming conventions).

     The  following  options  affect  the  global  operation   of
     _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.   They  may be specified anywhere on the command
     line.

     -border _c_o_l_o_r
             This sets the background portion of the window which
             is not covered by any images to be _c_o_l_o_r.

     -default
             Set the root background to the default  root  weave.
             This is the same as _x_s_e_t_r_o_o_t with no arguments.

     -debug  Talk to the X server in synchronous mode.   This  is
             useful  for  debugging.  If an X error is seen while
             in this mode, a core will be dumped.

     -delay _s_e_c_s
             Automatically advance to the next image  after  _s_e_c_s
             seconds.

     -display _d_i_s_p_l_a_y__n_a_m_e
             X11 display name to send the image(s) to.

     -fit    Force image to use the default visual and  colormap.
             This  is  useful  if  you  do  not  want technicolor
             effects when the colormap focus is inside the  image
             window,  but  it  may  reduce  the  quality  of  the
             displayed image.  This is on by default  if  -onroot
             or -windowid is specified.

     -fork   Fork xloadimage.  This causes xloadimage to disasso-
             ciate  itself from the shell.  This option automati-
             cally turns on -quiet.

     -fullscreen
             Use the entire screen to display  images.   If  com-
             bined with -onroot, the image will be zoomed to fill

             the entire rootwindow.

     -geometry _W_x_H[{+-_X}{+-}_Y]
             This sets the size of  the  window  onto  which  the
             images are loaded to a different value than the size
             of the image.  When viewing an image  in  a  window,
             this  can be used to reduce the size of the destina-
             tion window.  When loading an image  onto  the  root
             window,  this option controls the size of the pixmap
             which will be loaded onto the root.  If the size  is
             smaller  than that of the display, the image will be
             replicated.

     -goto image_name
             Forces the next image to  be  displayed  to  be  the
             image named _i_m_a_g_e__n_a_m_e.  This is useful for generat-
             ing looped slideshows.  If more than  one  image  of
             the  same  name as the target exists on the argument
             list, the first in the argument list is used.

     -help [option ...]
             Give information on an option or  list  of  options.
             If  no  option  is  given, a simple interactive help
             facility is invoked.

     -identify
             Identify the supplied  images  rather  than  display
             them.

     -install
             Forcibly install the image's colormap when the  win-
             dow  is  focused.  This violates ICCCM standards and
             only exists to allow  operation  with  naive  window
             managers.   Use  this  option  only  if  your window
             manager does not install colormaps properly.

     -list   List the images which are along the image path.

     -onroot Load image(s) onto the root window instead of  view-
             ing in a window.  This option automatically sets the
             -fit option.  This is the opposite of -_v_i_e_w.  _X_S_e_t_b_g
             has this option set by default.

     -path   Displays the image path  and  image  suffixes  which
             will  be  used  when  looking for images.  These are
             loaded from ~/.xloadimagerc and  optionally  from  a
             systemwide file (normally /usr/lib/xloadimagerc).

     -pixmap Force the use of a pixmap as backing-store.  This is
             provided  for  servers where backing-store is broken
             (such as some versions of  the  AIXWindows  server).
             It  may  improve  scrolling  performance  on servers

             which provide backing-store.

     -private
             Force the  use  of  a  private  colormap.   Normally
             colors  are  allocated  shared  unless there are not
             enough colors available.

     -quiet  Forces _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e and _x_v_i_e_w to be  quiet.   This  is
             the default for _x_s_e_t_b_g, but the others like to whis-
             tle.

     -supported
             List the supported image types.

     -verbose
             Causes _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e to be talkative, telling you  what
             kind of image it's playing with and any special pro-
             cessing that it has to do. This is the  default  for
             _x_v_i_e_w and _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.

     -version
             Print the version number and patchlevel of this ver-
             sion of _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.

     -view   View image(s) in a window.  This is the opposite  of
             -_o_n_r_o_o_t and the default for _x_v_i_e_w and _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e.

     -visual _v_i_s_u_a_l__n_a_m_e
             Force the use of a specific visual type  to  display
             an  image.   Normally  _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e  tries to pick the
             best available image for a  particular  image  type.
             The   available   visual  types  are:   DirectColor,
             TrueColor, PseudoColor, StaticColor, GrayScale,  and
             StaticGray.  Nonconflicting names may be abbreviated
             and case is ignored.

     -windowid _h_e_x__w_i_n_d_o_w__i_d
             Sets the background pixmap of  a  particular  window
             ID.  The argument must be in hexadecimal and must be
             preceeded by "0x" (_e_g -windowid 0x40000b.   This  is
             intended  for  setting the background pixmap of some
             servers which use untagged  virtual  roots  (_e_g  HP-
             VUE), but can have other interesting applications.

          image.   If  this  is an option to the first image, and

          loaded at the given location on the display background.

     -background _c_o_l_o_r
          Use _c_o_l_o_r  as  the  background  color  instead  of  the
          default  (usually  white  but this depends on the image
          type) if you are transferring a monochrome image  to  a
          color display.

     -brighten _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Specify a percentage multiplier  for  a  color  image's
          colormap.   A  value  of more than 100 will brighten an
          image, one of less than 100 will darken it.

     -center
          Center the image on the base image loaded.  If this  is
          an option to the first image, and the -_o_n_r_o_o_t option is
          specified, the image will be centered  on  the  display
          background.

     -clip _X,_Y,_W,_H
          Clip the image before loading it.  _X and _Y  define  the
          upper-left  corner of the clip area, and _W and _H define
          the extents of the area.  A zero value for _W or _H  will
          be interpreted as the remainder of the image.

     -colors _n
          Specify the maximum number of  colors  to  use  in  the
          image.   This  is a way to forcibly reduce the depth of
          an image.

     -dither
          Dither a color  image  to  monochrome  using  a  Floyd-
          Steinberg dithering algorithm.  This happens by default
          when viewing color  images  on  a  monochrome  display.
          This  is  slower  than  -_h_a_l_f_t_o_n_e and affects the image
          accuracy but usually looks much better.

     -foreground _c_o_l_o_r
          Use _c_o_l_o_r as the foreground color instead of  black  if
          you  are  transferring  a  monochrome  image to a color
          display.  This can also be used  to  invert  the  fore-
          ground and background colors of a monochrome image.

     -gamma _d_i_s_p_l_a_y__g_a_m_m_a
          Specify the gamma  correction  for  the  display.   The
          default  value  is  1.0, a typical display needs 2.0 to
          2.5.

     -gray
          Convert an image to grayscale.   This  is  very  useful
          when displaying colorful images on servers with limited
          color capability.  The optional spelling -_g_r_e_y may also

          be used.

     -halftone
          Force halftone dithering of a color image when display-
          ing on a monochrome display.  This option is ignored on
          monochrome images.  This dithering algorithm  blows  an
          image  up by sixteen times; if you don't like this, the
          -_d_i_t_h_e_r option will not blow the image up but will take
          longer to process and will be less accurate.

     -idelay _s_e_c_s
          Set the delay to be used for this image to _s_e_c_s seconds
          (see  -_d_e_l_a_y).  If -_d_e_l_a_y was specified, this overrides
          it.  If it was not specified, this sets  the  automatic
          advance delay for this image while others will wait for
          the user to advance them.

     -invert
          Inverts a monochrome  image.   This  is  shorthand  for
          -_f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d _w_h_i_t_e -_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d _b_l_a_c_k.

     -merge
          Merge this image onto the base image after  local  pro-
          cessing.   The base image is considered to be the first
          image specified or the last image  that  was  not  pre-
          ceeded  by -_m_e_r_g_e.  If used in conjunction with -_a_t and
          -_c_l_i_p, very complex  images  can  be  built  up.   This
          option  is  on by default for all images if the -_o_n_r_o_o_t
          or -_w_i_n_d_o_w_i_d options are specified.

     -name _i_m_a_g_e__n_a_m_e
          Force the next argument to be treated as an image name.
          This is useful if the name of the image is -_d_i_t_h_e_r, for
          instance.

     -newoptions
          Reset options that propagate.   The  -_b_r_i_g_h_t,  -_c_o_l_o_r_s,
          -_d_e_l_a_y,  -_d_i_t_h_e_r,  -_g_a_m_m_a, -_n_o_r_m_a_l_i_z_e, -_s_m_o_o_t_h, -_x_z_o_o_m,
          -_y_z_o_o_m, and -_z_o_o_m options  normally  propagate  to  all
          following images.

     -normalize
          Normalize a color image.

     -rotate _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
          Rotate the image by _d_e_g_r_e_e_s clockwise.  The number must
          be a multiple of 90.

     -smooth
          Smooth a color image.  This  reduces  blockiness  after
          zooming  an  image  up.  If used on a monochrome image,
          nothing  happens.   This  option  can  take  awhile  to

          Zoom the X axis of an image by  _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e.   A  number
          greater  than  100  will  expand the image, one smaller
          will compress it.  A zero value will be ignored.   This
          option,  and the related -_y_z_o_o_m are useful for correct-
          ing the aspect ratio of images to be displayed.

     -yzoom _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Zoom the Y axis of an image by _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e.  See  -_x_z_o_o_m
          for more information.

     -zoom _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
          Zoom both the X and Y axes by _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e.   See  -_x_z_o_o_m
          for more information.  Technically the percentage actu-
          ally zoomed is the square of the number supplied  since
          the  zoom  is to both axes, but I opted for consistency
          instead of accuracy.

     Since images are likely to come from a variety  of  sources,
     they  may  be in a variety of aspect ratios which may not be
     supported by your display.  The -_x_z_o_o_m  and  -_y_z_o_o_m  options
     can  be  used  to change the aspect ratio of an image before
     display.  If you use these options, it is  recommended  that
     you  increase  the  size of one of the dimensions instead of
     shrinking the other, since  shrinking  looses  detail.   For
     instance,  many  GIF  and G3 FAX images have an X:Y ratio of
     about 2:1.  You can  correct  this  for  viewing  on  a  1:1
     display  with  either -_x_z_o_o_m _5_0 or -_y_z_o_o_m _2_0_0 (reduce X axis
     to 50% of its size and expand Y axis to 200%  of  its  size,
     respectively)  but the latter should be used so no detail is
     lost in the conversion.

     When zooming color images up you can reduce blockiness  with
     -_s_m_o_o_t_h.  For zooms of 300% or more, I recommend two smooth-
     ing passes (although this can take  awhile  to  do  on  slow
     machines).   There  will  be  a noticable improvement in the
     image.

     You can perform image processing on a small  portion  of  an
     image  by  loading  the  image  more than once and using the
     -_m_e_r_g_e, -_a_t and -_c_l_i_p options.  Load the image,  then  merge
     it with a clipped, processed version of itself.  To brighten
     a  100x100  rectangular  portion  of  an  image  located  at
     (50,50), for instance, you could type:

          xloadimage   my.image   -merge    -at    50,50    -clip
     50,50,100,100 -brighten 150 my.image

     If you're using a display with a small colormap  to  display
     colorful  images,  try  using the -_g_r_a_y option to convert to
     grayscale.

     The file ~/.xloadimagerc (and optionally a system-wide file)
     defines the path and default extensions that _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e will
     use when looking for images.  This file can have two  state-
     ments:  "path=" and "extension=" (the equals signs must fol-
     low the word with no spaces between).  Everything  following
     the  "path=" keyword will be prepended to the supplied image
     name if the supplied name does not specify an existing file.
     The  paths will be searched in the order they are specified.
     Everything  following  the  "extension="  keyword  will   be
     appended  to  the  supplied  image name if the supplied name
     does not specify an existing file.   As  with  paths,  these
     extensions  will  be  searched  in the order they are given.

     Comments are any portion of a  line  following  a  hash-mark
     (#).

     The following is a sample ~/.xloadimagerc file:

       # paths to look for images in
       path= /usr/local/images
             /home/usr1/guest/madd/images

     Versions of _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e prior to version  01,  patchlevel  03
     would  load  the  system-wide file (if any), followed by the
     user's file.  This behavior made it difficult for  the  user
     to configure her environment if she didn't want the default.
     Newer versions will ignore the system-wide file  if  a  per-
     sonal configuration file exists.

     _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e currently supports the following image types:

       CMU Window Manager raster files
       Faces Project images
       Fuzzy Bitmap (FBM) images
       GEM bit images
       GIF images
       G3 FAX images
       McIDAS areafiles
       MacPaint images
       PC Paintbrush (PCX) images
       Portable Bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM) images
       Sun monochrome rasterfiles
       Sun color RGB rasterfiles
       Utah Raster Toolkit (RLE) files
       X pixmap files
       X10 bitmap files
       X11 bitmap files
       X Window Dump (except TrueColor and DirectColor)

     Normal, compact, and raw PBM  images  are  supported.   Both
     standard  and  run-length  encoded  Sun rasterfiles are sup-
     ported.  Any image whose name ends in .Z is assumed to be  a
     compressed image and will be filtered through "uncompress".

     Zooming dithered images, especially downwards, is UGLY.

     Images can come in a variety of aspect  ratios.   _X_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e
     cannot  detect  what aspect ratio the particular image being
     loaded has, nor the aspect ratio of the destination display,
     so  images with differing aspect ratios from the destination
     display will appear distorted.  See  _H_I_N_T_S  _F_O_R  _G_O_O_D  _I_M_A_G_E
     _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y_S for more information.

     The GIF format allows more than one image to be stored in  a
     single GIF file, but _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e will only display the first.

     Only GIF87a format is supported.

     One of the pseudonyms for _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e,  _x_v_i_e_w,  is  the  same
     name  as  Sun  uses for their SunView-under-X package.  This
     will be confusing if you're one of those poor souls who  has
     to use Sun's XView.

     Some window managers do not  correctly  handle  window  size
     requests.   In  particular,  many versions of the twm window
     manager use the MaxSize hint  instead  of  the  PSize  hint,
     causing  images  which are larger than the screen to display
     in a window larger than the screen, something which is  nor-
     mally avoided.  Some versions of twm also ignore the MaxSize
     argument's real function, to limit the maximum size  of  the
     window,  and  allow the window to be resized larger than the
     image.  If this happens, _x_l_o_a_d_i_m_a_g_e merely places the  image

     in  the  upper-left  corner of the window and uses the zero-
     value'ed pixel for any space which is  not  covered  by  the
     image.   This behavior is less-than-graceful but so are win-
     dow managers which are cruel enough to ignore such details.

     The order in which operations are performed on an  image  is
     independent of the order in which they were specified on the
     command line.  Wherever possible I tried to order operations
     in  such  a way as to look the best possible (zooming before
     dithering, for instance) or to increase speed (zooming down-
     ward before compressing, for instance).
