Here are some sample photo-cd images 

They were copied from a kodak photo-CD on a 386 pc running SVR4.2 V1 and
using the cdfs package.  The CD-ROM player was borrowed from a mac - although
I think a multi-session player is needed.

(C) Peter Lord (plord@uel.co.uk) but feel free to copy them around ....

1	Folly near Plymouth, Devon (UK)
2	Trees
3	Spike the hedgehog
4	The folly again
5	View of Plymouth
6	Back lit trees
7	Calm sea
8	lightning
9	Durdle Door, Dorset
10	St Catherines Falls, Cornwall

Use hpcdtoppm to convert them to ppm format and then xv to view them - I suggest
you use a 256 colour display at least.

Enjoy!
