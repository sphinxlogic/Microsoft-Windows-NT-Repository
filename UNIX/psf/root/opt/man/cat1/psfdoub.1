     If the postscript filter _p_s_f is used  with  the  -d  (double
     sided) option, the output file _p_s_f_b_o_o_k._p_s_d must be passed to
     _p_s_f_d_o_u_b to print the generated file in "double  sided"  for-
     mat.  (See NOTE below.)

     The printing is done in two passes:   first  to  print  side
     one, second to print side two.

     The general sequence of commands is be:

             psf -d my.file
             psfdoub -1 psfbook.psd | lp
                        <-- re-feed the paper for 2nd pass
             psfdoub -2 psfbook.psd | lp

     _P_s_f generates the intermediate file _p_s_f_b_o_o_k._p_s_d.  The  first
     invocation  of  _p_s_f_d_o_u_b  with  the -1 option prints only the
     front side of the pages.  After the  printing  is  complete,
     the paper must be re-fed into the print hopper.  The psfdoub
     -2 command is then issued to print on the back side  of  the
     pages.

     If _p_s_f_d_o_u_b is used with the -3 option, the front  sides  are
     printed.   Automatically,  the printer is switched to accept
     input from the alternate print tray.  As soon as the  alter-
     nate  print  tray  is  loaded,  the  second side is printed.
     E.g.:
             psf -d my.file
             psfdoub -3 psfbook.psd | lp

     The -3 option may be used only if the printer has two  print
     trays.

          causes the specified printer definition file to be used
          rather that _p_s_f_p_r_i_n_t._d_e_f.


     ffffiiiilllleeee is the name of the file to be processed.  The file name
          generated  by _p_s_f is _p_s_f_b_o_o_k._p_s_d. If an input file name
          is not provided, the _p_s_f_b_o_o_k._p_s_d is assumed.

     If _p_s_f was compiled  with  the  "-DHOPPER"  option  and  the
     postscript  printer  has  at  least  two  paper hoppers, _p_s_f
     automatically calls _p_s_f_d_o_u_b to perform double  sided  print-
     ing. Manual invocation of _p_s_f_d_o_u_b is not necessary.

     If _p_s_f was not compiled with "-DHOPPER" or if the postscript
     printer  does  not  have  at  least  two paper hoppers, then
     _p_s_f_d_o_u_b must be used as described above.

     The use of option "-3" assumes that _p_s_f was compiled wwwwiiiitttthhhhoooouuuutttt
     the  "-DHOPPER"  option,  however the printer does, in fact,
     have at least two paper hoppers.

     Examine shell script _p_s_f_d_o_u_b_l_e as an example on  setting  up
     suitable shell scripts for double sided printing.
