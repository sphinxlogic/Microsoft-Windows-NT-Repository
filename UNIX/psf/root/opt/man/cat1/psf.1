     _P_s_f filters text files for display on  postscript  printers.
     Text  may  be  "1-up", "2-up", or "4-up" on a page. _P_s_f is a
     general purpose filter for most text and programme listings.
     By  using  various  escape  sequences (described below), any
     portion of the text may be printed in different fonts and at
     different point sizes.

     If "letter" sized paper is used, the page is assumed to have
     63  lines and 80 columns wide.  For "legal" sized paper, the
     effective size is 81 lines by 80 columns.  These  dimensions
     account  for  the  "print region" (excluding margins) of the
     page.

     The actual number of print lines and characters per line may
     be over-ridden by specifying suitable options.

     The most commonly used options are  page  rotation,  setting
     point size, column count and line count:  all of which allow
     you to place more printed information on a page.  Additional
     options  are for special formatting purposes and may be used
     if desired.

     By default, lines wider than the page width  are  truncated.
     Line wrap may be enabled with the ----eeee option.

     Special formatting  for  _n_r_o_f_f'_e_d  documents  and  mail  box
     printing  are encapsulated in shell scripts such as _p_s_f_n_r_o_f_f
     and _p_s_f_m_b_o_x. These scripts hide some  of  the  more  complex
     options.

     General text may be printed with a command such as:

          psf this.file that.fil | lp

     If page rotation and print scaling is desired, typical  com-
     mands are:

         psf -                  (show help information)
         psf my.file my2.fil    (normal print)
         psf -2  my.file        (print 2 up on a page)
         psf -2xn my.c          (typical source listing)
         psf -4x my.file        (print 4 up on a page)
         psf -p8 my.fil         (print 8 point)
         psf -l66 -c132 -w a.b  (print 66 lines, 132 cols, landscape)
         psf -M 1,1,1,1,c a.b   (set 1 cm margins)

     ppppooooiiiinnnntttt ssssiiiizzzzeeee (using the ----pppp option) is used, choosing a smaller
     point size than the default of 12 results in smaller letters
     and  more  printed  lines.   Choosing  a  larger points size
     results in larger letters and reduces the number of  printed
     lines and columns on a page.

     A table of various point sizes, page sizes and their associ-
     ated line and column count is printed with:

           psf -s

     If the ccccoooolllluuuummmmnnnn ccccoooouuuunnnntttt ((((----cccc)))) or the lllliiiinnnneeee ccccoooouuuunnnntttt ((((----llll)))) is adjusted,
     the  number  of printed rows and columns can be changed form
     the defaults for the paper size.  For example, a 132 column,
     60 line page in landscape layout may be selected with:

           psf -w -c132 -l60 my.fil | lp


OOOOPPPPTTTTIIIIOOOONNNNSSSS
     ----111122224444 Specify the number of logical  pages  that  are  to  be
          printed on a physical page.  By default, _p_s_f will print
          one logical page per physical page.

          If two logical pages are specified with ----2222 ,  then  two
          pages are printed in "landscape" format:

                +-----------+-----------+
                |           |           |
                |   pg 1    |   pg 2    |
                |           |           |
                +-----------+-----------+

          If two-up printing in portrait layout is  desired,  use
          -_2_n  (i.e. two up, narrow).  On letter sized paper this
          gives two logical pages: each  is  80  columns  by  126
          lines.   This  layout  may  be  preferred for programme
          listing.


          If four logical pages are specified with ----4444 , then  the
          pages are printed in "portrait format:

                +-----------+-----------+

          Each logical page printed in 2-up or 4-up  format  con-
          tains  the same number of lines and print columns as if
          it were printed in 1-up portrait format.   The  charac-
          ters may be compressed or expanded horizontally to fill
          to the logical page width.  For example, printing with:

                 psf -4 my.text | lp

          creates four miniature pages, each of which would  con-
          tain 63 print lines and 80 characters on a line.

          Printing 2-up or 4-up preserves the number of lines  on
          a logical printed paged. Identical results (in terms of
          lines and columns on a logical page) are realized  with
          1-up, 2-up or 4-up printing.

          Clipping is performed in 2-up and  4-up  printing.   If
          the  line  lengths  on the left half of the page exceed
          the logical page width, the lines will be truncated.


     ----aaaa   If psf is used as part of  a  spooler  filter  and  the
          filter  has  read  access to stdout, then the ----aaaa option
          allows the filter to read the actual  number  of  pages
          printed  from  the printer.  If this option is not pro-
          vided, the computed number of pages wll be  written  to
          the log file.

          If psf is used as part of the lpsched spooling  system,
          the  specified  file  is  used to record the accounting
          information.


     ----bbbb nnnn Select paper bin _n. If this option  is  not  specified,
          the default paper bin is used.


     ----cccc nnnn Sets the number of print columns on a line.  The  char-
          acter  width  is  based  on the Courier font (10 pitch,
          character width of 7.2 points).  The text is scaled  to
          print  the desired number of characters over the entire
          page width.  Setting the character count does NOT alter
          the number of print lines.

          The option ----cccc44440000  on  letter  sized  paper  horizontally
          elongates  the characters to twice normal width.  Simi-
          larly, ----cccc111166660000 on letter size paper compresses the  char-
          acters to one half normal width.

          stream  is  written to _p_s_f_b_o_o_k._p_s_d which must be subse-
          quently filtered with _p_s_f_d_o_u_b. Refer to  the  man  page
          for _p_s_f_d_o_u_b for operational details.


     ----eeee   By default, lines longer than the page width are  trun-
          cated.   This option enables line wrap: long lines will
          cascade onto successive print lines.  Each wrapped por-
          tion of the line is left-justified.


     ----EEEE   This operates similar to ----eeee however each  wrapped  por-

     ----iiii nnnn[[[[ppppiiiicccc]]]]
          Indent the physical page's left margin by _n points  ((((pppp))))
          ,  inches ((((iiii)))) or centimeters ((((cccc)))).... Text is scaled by the
          amount of the indentation to preserve nominal line  and
          column  counts.  This is useful to offset the left mar-
          gin for binding or hole-punch.

          If indentation is desired without causing scaling (i.e.
          a  true  "offset"  only),  then  a  point  size must be
          selected with ----PPPP....

     ----llll nnnn Sets the number of printed lines per page.  The default
          is  63  lines  for letter sized paper.  If more than 63
          lines  per  page  are  specified,  the  point  size  is
          automatically reduced to accommodate the line count.

          The number of printed lines specified by ----llll may be less
          than  the number of possible print lines specified by ----
          LLLL.... For example, the default total number of print lines
          is 63 (as though you had specified ----LLLL66663333 ).  If you used
          the option ----llll22220000 , then only the first 20 lines  of  the
          possible 63 would be printed.  A skip to new page would
          be performed for the 21st line and the remainder of the
          page would be blank.


     ----LLLL nnnn Specifies the number of possible print lines  available
          on  the  page.  If ----LLLL is specified, then the page scale
          is adjusted to accommodate the line  count.    However,
          only  the  number  of  lines specified by the ----llll option
          will actually print.

          the amount of the indentation to preserve nominal  line

          All four margins on the each logical page  (1,2,  or  4
          up) may be set with the ----MMMM option. The size of the left
          (lm), right (rm), top (tm) and bottom (bm) margins  may
          be set in points (p), inches (i) or centimeters (c).

          This option affects each logical page: margins set with
          ----iiii or ----mmmm are used to offset physical margins.

          For example,

              -M 2,3,4.2,5,c

          will set a left margin of 2cm, right margin of 3cm, top
          margin of 4.2cm and a bottom margin of 5cm.

          If the  type  of  unit  is  omitted,  then  "point"  is
          assumed.

          Only those margin settings desired  need  be  provided.
          The  missing values are assumed to be printer defaults.
          For example, to offset (left margin  only)  a  page  by
          1.25 inches, a possible command might be:

               psf -M 1.25,,,,i my.file

          Margin sizes are absolute and not scaled when  printing
          in 2-up or 4-up modes.

          Margins to do not cause line clipping:  long text lines
          may overflow the right margin.  Line wrap with ----eeee or ----EEEE
          may be used to preserve the right margin.

          The margin setting could be used  in  conjunction  with
          the line and column count to provide positioning within
          the page. For example, an 80 column by 60 line page can
          be centered with 50 point margins with:

               psf -M 50,50,50,50,p -l 60 -c 80 my.file

          If margins are set but the line and  column  count  are
          not provided, the printing is scaled to use the default
          number of lines and columns for the page and point size
          in  use.   Scaling  for point size may be defeated with
          the ----PPPP _n option.


     ----nnnn   The page is printed in portrait (narrow) format.   This
          is the default for 1-up and 4-up printing.  If portrait
          layout is desired for 2-up printing, then the ----nnnn option
          must be specified.


     ----OOOO ppppiiiippppeeee
          The -O option allows psf to open a pipe to another pro-
          cess rather than sending output to stdout.  This option
          is effective only for versions of psf used in  a  print
          spooler.

          The _p_i_p_e is the command (with options) that  is  to  be
          executed.  For example,

          Quoted options may be used.


     ----pppp nnnn Sets the nominal point size to _n points.  This is accu-
          rate  only  to "1-up" printing.  If "2-up" or "4-up" or
          "1-up, landscape"  printing  is  desired,  the  nominal
          point size is automatically scaled.

          The selected point size becomes the new "default  point
          size".

          Character shape is retained as much as  possible:  how-
          ever  margin  adjustment  with  ----MMMM,,,, ----iiii,,,, and ----mmmm do cause
          general scaling.

          Line count set with ----llll and column count  sent  with  ----cccc
          are  honoured,  however  the point height is preserved.
          This  may  result  in  horizontally  squashed/elongated
          characters  if  the ----cccc option is used and/or changes in
          the spacing between lines if the ----llll option is used.


     ----PPPP nnnn Sets the nominal point size to  _n.  however  the  point
          size  is  not  be scaled if the margin size is adjusted
          with ----MMMM.... ----iiii,,,, or ----mmmm.... Scaling still take  place  in  2-up
          and 4-up printing.


     ----RRRR nnnn removes _n lines from the beginning of the file.


     ----rrrr nnnn removes _n lines between pages of the file.

          Use this option if the text file has blank  lines  that
          must  be removed between pages.  For example, a typical
          "accounting" report may print 60 lines and 132  columns
          of  text.   Usually,  such reports have two blank lines
          before the first printed text on a page   and  6  blank
          lines to skip to the top of the next page.

          To generate exactly 60  printed  lines  with  psf,  the
          first  two  blank  lines should be removed with ----RRRR2222 and
          the blank lines between pages removed with ----rrrr6666::::

          The ----rrrr and ----RRRR may be used together as needed.

     If _p_s_f_f_i_l_t_e_r has been installed as part of the lp/lpsched _l_p
     spooling system, _p_s_f options may be passed in the _l_p command
     line using the ----oooo option for _l_p :

             lp -o"-4xh" this.file that.file
                --------

     The additional options of "banner"  and  "nobanner"  may  be
     passed to the spooler to print or not print a banner page:

             lp -o"nobanner -4xh" this.file that.file
     or
             lp -o"banner -4xh" this.file that.file

     The spooler system also recognizes the ----zzzz  option  to  force
     printing of postscript code.

     If the spooler is _l_p/_l_p_s_c_h_e_d, then  the  spooler  binary  is
     normally _p_s_f_f_i_l_t_e_r. If the spooler is _l_p_r/_l_p_d, the binary is

     If the system's spooler is _l_p_r/_l_p_d then options may  not  be

     has configured a number of different printer names that  use
     different default printing characteristics of _p_s_f.

     Error messages are written to stderr.  If psf is used  as  a
     spooler  filter,  the  error  messages  are  written  to the
     spooler error logging file.  If a serial/ethernet printer is
     connected,  additional  printer-generated  messages may also
     appear in the log file.

     Standard messages generated by psf:

     no alternate bins permitted
     paper bin greater than maximum for printer
     Double sided or book in reverse ordered not supported
     Font number invalid
             - use 'psf -' to see a list of fonts available
     cannot create work file
          - directory permission?
     cannot allocate enough memory
     Cannot open output file
          - directory permission?
     Unknown file xxxx

             - the psfprint.def file is corrupted.  Contact
               your systems administrator.

     Double sided reverse ordered printing with the  ----ddddvvvv  options
     is not supported.

     Line wrap with the ----eeee option  works  correctly  for  Courier
     font  only.   If  other  fonts  are used, inappropriate line

     wraps may result.  Psf does not know about font metrics.

     Double sided printing may not work correctly with top margin
     or left margin indentation.

     Psf has far to many options.
