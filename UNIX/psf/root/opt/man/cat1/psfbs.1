     _P_s_f_b_s is a filter that converts "backspaced text"  generated
     by  _n_r_o_f_f into underlined or bold text. It is primarily used
     to format _m_a_n pages, however it can be used to format  docu-
     ments generated with the _m_s and _m_m macros.

     Normally, _p_s_f_b_s is  not  used  directly:  the  shell  script
     _p_s_f_n_r_o_f_f  is a more convenient interface for _n_r_o_f_f text for-
     matting.

     Nroff'ed documents typically use 66 line pages.   Since  _p_s_f
     defaults  to  63  lines  on  Letter  size paper (3 lines are
     unprintable), three blank lines are usually removed  between
     nroff'ed pages.

     The man page for "psf" man  page  could  be  printed  "2-up"
     with:

           nroff -man psf.1 | psfbs -r 3 | psf -2 | lp

     or 1-up with with italic conversion

           nroff -man psf.1 | psfbs -ir 3 | psf -2 | lp

     ----iiii       Since  the  text  from  _n_r_o_f_f  usually  substitutes
              underlines  for  italics, you may use the -i option
              to regenerate the italic font.


     ----ffff       If the document uses form feeds  for  page  separa-
              tion,  the -f option should be specified.  Any line
              count specified by -l is ignored.

     ----llll nnnn     The -l option specifies the nominal number of lines
              generated  by _n_r_o_f_f for the page.  If the -l option
              is used, the -r option probably must  be  specified
              also.

              If "-l" is not specified, then 66 line nroff  pages
              are assumed.


     ----rrrr nnnn     The -r option allows  you  to  specify  the  number
              blank  lines  to  be removed between each page gen-
              erated by nroff.  If "-r" is not specified, then  3
              blank lines are removed between pages.

              The removed lines account for the "unprintable" top
              an bottom areas of the postscript page.

              Lines may be removed by _p_s_f_b_s or by _p_s_f which  also
              has  a  -_r option.  If line removal is performed by
              _p_s_f, then the option ----rrrr0000 should be used with  _p_s_f_b_s
              to  disable  the  removal  of  the  3 default blank
              lines.

     _P_s_f_b_s converts "backspaced text"  generated  by  _n_r_o_f_f  into
     escape  sequences that can be used by psf to generate under-
     lined or bold text.  It simply  scans  for  the  "backspace"
     character and attempts determine if the backspace is used in
     the contex of an "underline" or "multi-strike boldface".  In
     some  circumstances,  it  may not correctly detect the print
     operation (for example, italic-bold is not recognized).

     The conversion results in the following generated  sequences
     that  can  be  recognized  by _p_s_f (were ^E is <ctrl>E or the
     octal value \005):

             ^EB..text..^Eb   for bold
             ^EU..text..^Eu   for underline
     or
             ^EI..text..^Ei   for italics

     (italics instead of underline selected with -i option)

     The  logic  cannot  handle  bold-underlined   (nor   italic-
     underlined).

     _P_s_f_b_s is not a full featured _n_r_o_f_f filter. It is intended to
     process documents generated with the -_m_a_n macros. Formatting
     with other macros may be incorrectly handled.
