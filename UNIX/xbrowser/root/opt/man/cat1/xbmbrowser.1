     tory.  Note that if the program can not change directory  to
     the  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y in the command line it will exit and print an
     error message.

     You can then select any bitmap that  is  displayed  and  you
     will be able to Rename, Copy, Delete, Edit and Set it as the
     root window bitmap. (Edit and SetRoot may not work  on  your
     installation - you will have to try it to find out).

     This version of xxxxbbbbmmmmbbbbrrrroooowwwwsssseeeerrrr has a user definable menu of com-
     mands  that can be executed for a bitmap. There is a default
     setup  file  but  you  can  have  your   own   file   called
     .xbmbrowserrc  in  your  home  directory. The format is dis-
     cussed below.

     Comments are denoted by a # as the first letter on a line

     Each line is one menu entry. They have the format of:

     "Menu Name" "command" "popup query string"

     The line MUST begin in the first  character.  that  is  LEFT
     JUSTIFIED or it will be ignored.

     The Command is any unix command and is executed  by  a  sys-
     tem() call. In the command there are some place holders that
     you can use.

     %b - Current bitmap name (no path)
     %B - Current bitmap name (with full path)
     %u - Users input string (default value in text box is %b)
     %n - Users input string (default value in text box is blank)
     %d - Current Directory

     The Menu Name, command, and popup query string MUST exist in
     that order, however if the popup is NOT wanted then make the
     popup query string an empty string (""). If the popup  query
     is  not used and the %u place holder is used in the command,

     an error message will be given and the menu  item  will  not
     appear.

     The Popup Query will ALWAYS contain an Ok button which  will
     execute  the  command  and a Cancel button which will cancel
     the command. If, in the command, the users input  string  is
     used,  the  popup query will also have a text input box that
     the user can enter a string into. The current bitmap name is
     showen  in  the  text  box  as  the default value and can be
     changed.  The popup will also contain the text in the  popup
     query string.

     The use of a "~"  and  its  associated  shorthand  directory
     notations  (~/  =  home, ~user = user's home) are allowed in
     the command and in the string entered by  the  user  in  the
     popup  query,  They  will  be expanded before the command is
     executed.

     NOTE that when it is expanded there WILL NOT be a '/' at the
     end  of  the  directory  name, so if you are going to conca-
     tinate another name to it then make sure that you put a  '/'
     before  the other one. Note also that the %b string does NOT
     have a leading '/'.

     Some commands will not change the  bitmaps  in  the  current
     directory  in  any way so that the directory doesn't have to
     be rescanned, to indicate that  a  rescan  is  unneccessory,
     start  the  line with a "!". This is done with the Set Root,
     and Grab menu items below.
