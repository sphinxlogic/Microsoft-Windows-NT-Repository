     _x_d_i_a_r_y is an X application that displays a calendar  in  one
     of two formats and/or an interactive daily diary.

     _x_d_i_a_r_y accepts all of  the  standard  toolkit  command  line

                 This option indicates how many pixels  wide  the
                 lines composing the calendar grid should be.  By
                 default, the grid lines are one pixel wide.

                 when  determining  the  size and position of the
                 full year calendar.  The full year calendar will
                 default  to  the  minimum  size  needed  to hold
                 calendars for all twelve  months  based  on  the

     The pointer may be used to select any date on  the  calendar
     that  is currently visible.  The diary will then display the
     entry (if any) for the selected date.

     When the pointer is in the diary text window, any text typed
     will  become  part  of  the  diary  entry  for the currently
     displayed date.

     A template is an ascii file whose contents will be used  for
     any  diary  entry that did not exist prior to the invocation
     of the _x_d_i_a_r_y application.

     Templates allow you to customize the  format  of  the  diary
     entries.  For example, a template file could be created with
     the following contents:

           7:00
           8:00
           9:00
          10:00
          11:00
           noon
           1:00
           2:00
           3:00
           4:00
           5:00

     The above template would be useful for appointment  schedul-
     ing and time management whereas the following template would
     be useful for logging work:

          Things to do today:
          1.
          2.
          3.

          Things done today:
          1.
          2.
          3.

     Once text is added to the  template,  the  template  becomes
     part  of  the diary entry and can be edited for further cus-
     tomization.

     If  no  template  file  is  specified,  and  if   the   file
     ~/.xdiary-template  does  not  exist, then all diary entries
     that did not exist prior to the  invocation  of  the  _x_d_i_a_r_y
     application will initially be empty.

     The format chosen for the diary file is very simple so  that
     it is possible to delete, add or change diary entries easily
     from a text editor.  The entry  format  is  a  newline  ter-
     minated  date string followed by a newline terminated double
     quote enclosed information string.  Double quotes within the
     information  string  are  allowed,  but they must be doubled
     (i.e. "").  A series of these  entries  make  up  the  diary
     file.

     The following two diary entries illustrate the format of the
     diary file:

          9/17/1966
          "Meeting with Steve and Sally went as expected."

          9/18/1966
          "Dave said, ""Buy stock in IBM.""  I can't
          wait to make him eat his own words."

     The entries may initially appear in any order, however  they
     are  always  saved in ascending order by the _x_d_i_a_r_y applica-
     tion.

     The _x_d_i_a_r_y application class name is Xdiary.

     _x_d_i_a_r_y has a small application defaults file which  is  used
     simply  to  select  default  fonts and to configure the text
     widget used by the diary.

     The _x_d_i_a_r_y application is  divided  into  three  independent
     parts:

     xdiary.full
          This references the top level window of the  full  year
          calendar part.

     xdiary.single
          This references the top  level  window  of  the  single
          month calendar part.

     xdiary.diary
          This references the  top  level  window  of  the  diary
          calendar part.

     The full and single calendar parts have a  large  number  of
     resources  which can be specified to customize their appear-
     ance.

     The diary's appearance can also be customized.  In addition,
     the  text  widget  has  few  hard coded resources and can be

     In order to specify resources, it  is  useful  to  know  the
     hierarchy of the widgets which compose _x_d_i_a_r_y.  In the nota-
     tion below, indentation  indicates  hierarchical  structure.
     The widget class name is given first, followed by the widget
     instance name.

     _x_d_i_a_r_y attempts to recover from syntax errors in  the  diary
     file,  however  there's no limit to the number of error mes-
     sages produced so feeding it an entirely bogus file  is  not
     recommended.

     _x_d_i_a_r_y doesn't do any file locking, so if multiple  _x_d_i_a_r_i_e_s
     are  running  based off the same diary file, the last one to
     save its diary wins.

     The diary entries in the diary file do not append, therefore
     the  last  entry with a given date will replace any previous
     entries with the same date, and the previous entries will be
     lost  after _x_d_i_a_r_y saves the diary (if any changes have been
     made).  This is only a problem if the diary file  is  edited
     by a text editor other than the one provided by _x_d_i_a_r_y.
