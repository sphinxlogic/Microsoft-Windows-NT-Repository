     brings up a single window in which the  user  may  play  the
     game of life.

     The universe is effectivly unbounded (4.2 billion on a side)
     The  algorithim uses hashed 8x8 boxes of cells, and computes
     the next generation by using lookup tables for added speed.

     By default Xlife will run in a window taking up your  entire
     screen. The -bw option allows you to pass Xlife the width of
     the borders created by your window manager, for use  in  the
     internal window size calculation.

     The -geometry option sets the Xlife window size and position
     as per usual for X applications.

     If possible, you should tell your window manager  to  create
     Xlife  without  a  title bar; otherwise you will have to use
     -geometry to set the window's vertical size  enough  smaller
     than the default that the title bar doesn't crowd the bottom
     of the window off the screen.

     A .life image file is an ordinary text  file  consisting  of
     lines terminated by the newline character. It is interpreted
     as one or more image sections  separated  by  section  lines

     beginning  with  '#'.  Lines led by `##' are considered com-
     ments and ignored.

     Each image section is interpreted according  to  the  format
     letter following its section line #. The format letters are:

     A -- Absolute.  Each line  is  interpreted  as  an  absolute
     (x,y) coordinate pair.

     R -- Relative.  Each line is interpreted as a relative (x,y)
     coordinate pair.

     P -- Picture.  Each line in the section is interpreted as  a
     scan line of a relative image.  Each '*' character turns the
     corresponding  bit  on.  All  other  characters  leave   the
     corresponding bit off.

     I -- Include.  A #I line  should  have  whitespace-separated
     fields  after  the  #I consisting of a pattern name and five
     optional integer parameters (x, y offsets,  rotation,  flip,
     and  delay as defined in the document NEWINCLUDE). The named
     pattern is loaded as if it had been included in the image at
     this  point  with  the  given  transformation  applied.  The
     offsets, if present, displace the load point of the  pattern
     relative to the current mouse position. The include facility
     is useful for assembling `sampler' collections of  interest-
     ing  patterns, as well as maintaining structured representa-
     tions of complex patterns.

     B and E -- Pattern blocks. Patterns enclosed  by  #B  <name>
     and  #E lines are skipped when loading a whole file, but may
     be accessed by adding :<name> to the file  name.   They  are
     useful  for  bundling  related  patterns into the same file.
     Access is by sequentially skipping lines not in  the  block,
     so  excessive  numbers  of  blocks in the same file may slow
     down the loading process.  Pattern blocks may not be nested.

     Relative image sections are normally drawn with 0,0  on  the
     current  mouse  position (coordinates may be negative). This
     may be changed by including a pair  of  whitespace-separated
     integers  after the format character. If this is done, these
     will be interpreted as a pair of x and y  offsets,  and  the
     image  section will be drawn with its upper left corner dis-
     placed from the  cursor  position  by  those  offsets.  This
     facility  can  be  used  to write image files that will load
     patterns centered on the cursor.

     A leading image section with no header line  is  treated  as
     though  it had a `#A' header. Thus, version 1.00 image files
     will load properly.

     N -- Name This  line  contains  the  internal  name  of  the

     file.

     O -- Owner This line contains information on the person  who
     wrote the file, it is written in the form: id "name"@machine
     date, for example.

     #O jb7m "Jon C. R. Bennett"@sushi.andrew.cmu.edu Fri Jan  12
     18:25:54 1990

     C -- Comment Lines begining with "C" are comments  that  the
     user  may  have  automaticaly  writen  to the save file, and
     which may be viewed from withen Xlife.

     More section formats may be added in the future.
