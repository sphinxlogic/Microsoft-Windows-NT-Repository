     _D_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t selects pages from a DVI  file  produced  by  TeX,
     creating  a new DVI file usable by any of the TeX conversion
     programs, or even by _d_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t itself.

     A _r_a_n_g_e is a string of the form  _e_v_e_n,  _o_d_d,  or  _f_i_r_s_t:_l_a_s_t
     where both _f_i_r_s_t and _l_a_s_t are optional numeric strings, with
     negative numbers indicated by a leading underscore character
     ``_''.   If  both  _f_i_r_s_t and _l_a_s_t are omitted, the colon may
     also be omitted, or may be replaced with an asterisk  ``*''.
     A  _p_a_g_e  _r_a_n_g_e  is a list of ranges separated by periods.  A
     _l_i_s_t _o_f _p_a_g_e_s is described by a set of page ranges separated
     by commas and/or white space.

     _D_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t actually looks at the ten _c_o_u_n_t variables that TeX
     writes;  the  first  of  these (\count0) is the page number,
     with \count1 through \count9 having varied uses depending on
     which  macro  packages are in use.  (Typically \count1 might
     be a chapter or section number.)   A  page  is  included  in
     _d_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t's output if all its \count values match any one of
     the ranges listed on the command  line.   For  example,  the
     command  ``dviselect  *.1,35:''   might select everything in
     chapter 1, as well as pages 35 and up.  ``dviselect  10:30''
     would select pages 10 through 30 (inclusive).  ``:43'' means
     everything up to and including page 43 (including  negative-
     numbered  pages).   To  get  all  even-numbered  pages,  use
     ``even''; to get all odd-numbered pages, use ``odd''.  If  a
     Table  of  Contents  has negative page numbers, ``:_1'' will
     select it.  Note that ``*'' must be quoted from  the  shell;
     the  empty  string  is  more convenient to use, if harder to
     read.

     Instead of \count  values,  _d_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t  can  also  select  by
     ``absolute  page  number'',  where the first page is page 1,
     the second page 2, and so forth.  Absolute page numbers  are
     indicated by a leading equal sign ``=''.  Ranges of absolute
     pages are also allowed: ``dviselect =3:7'' will extract  the
     third  through  seventh pages.  Dot separators are not legal
     in absolute ranges, and there are no negative absolute  page
     numbers.    Even/odd   specifiers,   however,   are   legal;
     ``dviselect =even'' selects every other page, starting  with
     the second.

     More precisely, an asterisk or an empty  string  implies  no
     limit;  an equal sign means absolute page number rather than

     \counts; a leading colon means everything up to and  includ-
     ing  the  given page; a trailing colon means everything from
     the given page on; the word ``even'' means only even  values
     shall  be  accepted;  the word ``odd'' means only odd values
     shall be accepted; and a  period  indicates  that  the  next
     \count  should  be  examined.   If  fewer than 10 ranges are
     specified, the remaining \counts are left unrestricted (that
     is,  ``1:5'' and ``1:5.*'' are equivalent).  A single number
     _n is treated as if it were  the  range  _n:_n.   An  arbitrary
     number  of  page selectors may be given, separated by commas
     or whitespace; a page is selected if any  of  the  selectors
     matches its \counts or absolute page number.

     Dviselect normally prints the  page  numbers  of  the  pages
     selected; the -_s option suppresses this.

     A leading ``-'' ought to be allowed  for  negative  numbers,
     but  it  is currently used as a synonym for ``:'', for back-
     wards compatibility.

     Section or subsection selection will sometimes fail, for the
     DVI  file lists only the \count values that were active when
     the page ended.  Clever macro packages can alleviate this by
     making  use  of  other  ``free'' \count registers.  Chapters
     normally begin on new pages, and do  not  suffer  from  this
     particular problem.

     The heuristic that decides which arguments are  page  selec-
     tors  and  which are file names is often wrong.  Using shell
     redirection or the -i and -o options is safest.

     _D_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t does not adjust the parameters in  the  postamble;
     however,  since  these values are normally used only to size
     certain structures in the output  conversion  programs,  and
     the  parameters  never  need to be adjusted upward, this has
     not proven to be a problem.
