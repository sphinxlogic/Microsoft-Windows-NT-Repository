     By now, you're  probably  wondering  what  a  lot  of  these
     options  do.   Note  that  some of these options can also be
     specified in your SunView defaults file.

     _T_e_x_s_u_n can display your document  at  two  different  sizes,
     _N_o_r_m_a_l  and  _L_a_r_g_e. These two sizes are used for viewing the
     overall structure of  the  document  and  checking  detailed
     structure,  respectively.  In Normal mode, you will normally
     have two _l_e_a_v_e_s on your display simultaneously.   Two  adja-
     cent  pages  of your DVI file are displayed in these leaves.
     To make the image so small, _t_e_x_s_u_n  shrinks  the  fonts  and
     scales everything down to size.  This is where the blackness
     parameter comes in---you can control the shrinking algorithm
     to  some  extent.   The  default values for NormalShrink and
     LargeShrink are determined by the size of your  display  and
     the  number  of leaves you specify (2 is the default, unless
     the DVI file contains only one page), so you normally  don't
     need   to  specify  them  yourself.   Similarly,  TopMargin,
     SideMargin, and Dpi will default to  reasonable  values,  so
     you  normally don't need to worry about any of these options
     except perhaps ----rrrrvvvv....

     _T_e_x_s_u_n precomputes each page's image before  displaying  it.
     This  means that you can obscure parts of the _t_e_x_s_u_n window,
     or move it around, without having to wait for the display to
     be recomputed.  It takes about a second on a 3/50 to compute
     the image when only text is present, though  heavy  graphics
     take a little longer.

     When _t_e_x_s_u_n starts up, it will be in Normal mode, and you'll
     normally  see  two  leaves  of your document, containing the
     first two pages of your DVI file.  To go to the  next  page,
     just  type  Return.  This will move page 2 to the left leaf,
     and put page 3 in the right leaf.   Typing  ``-Return'',  or
     Delete,  or  Backspace,  will  move back one page.  Typing a
     number followed by one of these keys will go that many pages
     in the indicated direction.

     To see one of the pages in Large mode, put the mouse on  top
     of  the text to be displayed and hold down any mouse button.
     The cursor will turn to  an  hourglass  while  the  enlarged
     image  is  being computed.  Once it has been completely com-
     puted, the enlarged image will be displayed, taking  up  the
     entire  _t_e_x_s_u_n  window  (covering both leaves, if two are in
     use).  Release the button to go back to Normal  mode.   Once
     the  enlarged  image for the pages on display have been com-
     puted, they are retained, so you can switch quickly  between
     the  Normal  and  Large  modes.   Once  a  page is not being
     displayed in either leaf, however,  its  enlarged  image  is
     also  discarded,  so  if you come back to it, its normal and
     enlarged images will have to be recomputed.

     To move around in the DVI file, you can also go to  absolute
     page  numbers  by  typing the number of the page followed by
     the letter ``g''.  Typing ``q'' will exit _t_e_x_s_u_n.

     The options displyed in the menu displayed when you  depress
     the right mouse button has several submenus.  You can goto a
     specific page in the document by selecting  the  _g_o_t_o  menu.
     The  _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t  menu  allows  you  to move between detail and
     overview mode or reload  the  document  file.   This  latter
     option  re-reads  the  DVI  file,  adjusting the display and
     showing the current contents.  The _M_a_r_k &  _P_r_i_n_t  menu  lets
     you  mark  and  unmark  pages.   You  can also print all the
     pages, marked pages or  unmarked  pages.   When  a  page  is
     marked,  the word ``marked'' appears in the frame title.  In
     addition, marked pages are indicated by an asterisk  in  the
     ``goto page'' menu.

     If a subset of the pages are  being  printed,  ddddvvvviiiisssseeeelllleeeecccctttt  is
     used to generate a new DVI file containing those pages.  The
     printing program is invoked with the name  of  the  file  to
     print.   The local printer can be specified in your defaults
     file.  If this is not set, pages are printed using the  pro-
     gram  named  in  environment  variable TTTTEEEEXXXXSSSSUUUUNNNNPPPPRRRRIIIINNNNTTTT,,,, with the
     default program being used if no program is specified in the
     defaults  file  or  your  environment.   This  default value
     should be configured to ``your local printer'' by the person
     installing TeXsun.

     The _F_r_a_m_e menu gives you the window frame  menu.   The  _Q_u_i_t
     button justs exits.

     _t_e_x_s_u_n responds to the OOOOPPPPEEEENNNN and EEEEXXXXPPPPOOOOSSSSEEEE  buttons.   Addition-
     ally,  if  the  AAAAGGGGAAAAIIIINNNN button is pressed, the current file is
     re-read, and the current pages are redisplayed (this is  the
     same  as the reload option in the document menu).  This lets
     you keep the same _t_e_x_s_u_n window open  while  you  edit  your
     document.  The DDDDEEEELLLLEEEETTTTEEEE button exits _t_e_x_s_u_n.

     Although _t_e_x_s_u_n understands most _t_p_i_c graphical commands, it
     is  unable  to display shading of objects which are not rec-
     tangular.  All other graphics commands are  supported,  how-
     ever.  It also outlines the bounding box for psfig illustra-
     tions, but doesn't attempt to display the postscript  figure
     (don't you wish).
