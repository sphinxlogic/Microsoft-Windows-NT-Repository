     By now, you're  probably  wondering  what  a  lot  of  these
     options do.  _T_e_x_x can display your document at two different
     sizes, _N_o_r_m_a_l and _L_a_r_g_e. These two sizes are used for  view-
     ing  the  overall  structure  of  the  document and checking
     detailed structure, respectively.  In Normal mode, you  will
     normally  have  two  _l_e_a_v_e_s  on your display simultaneously.
     Two adjacent pages of your DVI file are displayed  in  these
     leaves.   To make the image so small, _t_e_x_x shrinks the fonts
     and scales everything down  to  size.   This  is  where  the
     blackness parameter comes in---you can control the shrinking
     algorithm to some  extent.   The  default  values  for  Nor-
     malShrink and LargeShrink are determined by the size of your
     display and the number of  leaves  you  specify  (2  is  the
     default, unless the DVI file contains only one page), so you
     normally don't need to specify  them  yourself.   Similarly,
     TopMargin,  SideMargin,  and  Dpi will default to reasonable
     values, so you normally don't need to  worry  about  any  of
     these options except perhaps ----rrrrvvvv....

     _T_e_x_x precomputes each page's  image  before  displaying  it.
     This means that you can obscure parts of the _t_e_x_x window, or
     move it around, without having to wait for the display to be
     recomputed.   It  takes  about a second on a 3/50 to compute
     the image when only text is present, though  heavy  graphics
     take a little longer.

     When _t_e_x_x starts up, it will be in Normal mode,  and  you'll
     normally  see  two  leaves  of your document, containing the
     first two pages of your DVI file.  To go to the  next  page,
     just  type  Return.  This will move page 2 to the left leaf,
     and put page 3 in the right leaf.   Typing  ``-Return'',  or
     Delete,  or  Backspace,  will  move back one page.  Typing a
     number followed by one of these keys will go that many pages
     in the indicated direction.

     To see one of the pages in Large mode, put the mouse on  top
     of  the text to be displayed and hold down any mouse button.
     The cursor will turn to an clock while the enlarged image is
     being  computed.   Once it has been completely computed, the
     enlarged image will be displayed, taking up the entire  _t_e_x_x
     window  (or  only  one  leaf,  if  two  leaves  are in use).
     Release the button to go back  to  Normal  mode.   Once  the
     enlarged  image for the pages on display have been computed,
     they are retained, so you can  switch  quickly  between  the
     Normal  and Large modes.  Once a page is not being displayed
     in either leaf, however, its enlarged  image  is  also  dis-
     carded,  so  if you come back to it, its normal and enlarged
     images will have to be recomputed.

     To move around in the DVI file, you can also go to  absolute
     page  numbers  by  typing the number of the page followed by

     the letter ``g''.  Typing ``q'' will exit _t_e_x_x.

     You can ``reload'' the DVI file by pressing  R.  This  saves
     time when you're intensively editing a document.

     Although _t_e_x_x understands most _t_p_i_c graphical  commands,  it
     is  unable  to display shading, because Dirk was too lazy to
     finsih it.  All other graphics commands are supported,  how-
     ever.
