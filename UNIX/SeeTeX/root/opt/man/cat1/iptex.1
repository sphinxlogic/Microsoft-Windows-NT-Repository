     _I_p_t_e_x takes a DVI file produced by TeX and converts it to  a
     format  suitable  for  the Imagen series printers.  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
     should be the name of a ....ddddvvvviiii file.  By default,  _i_p_t_e_x  pro-
     duces  output for a 300 dpi printer (the 8/300) but this may
     be overridden with the -_r  flag:   ----rrrr  222244440000  produces  output
     suitable for the Imprint-10 (a.k.a. the 10/240).

     To get landscape mode (rather than  portrait  mode)  output,
     use  the ----llll flag. The entire document is rotated to print on
     the 11 by 8.5 paper.

     The -_m flag applies a global magnification  to  the  output.
     If  you  have  slides that are to be reduced, you can fiddle
     with the output size using -m.  (By the way, -r is really -m
     in disguise.)

     Normally, iptex will print information  about  the  document
     and  the  pages  being  printed.  This  information  can  be
     suppressed using the +_v option to display Verboseness.

     By default, pages are printed from last  to  first,  leaving
     the output in the proper order on most Imagen printers.  You
     can change this by specifying -_p for Page reversal.

     The default margins are one inch on the left  and  the  top.
     You  can set the side margin using -_s_m to specify a floating
     point value for margin in _i_n_c_h_e_s. Similarly,  -_t_m  specifies
     the margin for the top of the page.  To center your document
     across the width of the paper, specify -_c_w_d and to center it
     along the paper height, use -_c_h_t.

     _I_p_t_e_x is actually a shell script that invokes the conversion
     program  and  feeds  its output to Imagen's _i_p_r command.  By
     default, this is done by creating a file in  /tmp,  so  that
     missing  fonts  can  be caught before ipr runs away with the
     output.  However, if desired, you can force the output to be
     piped  directly  to  ipr with the -_f_o_r_c_e flag.  This ignores
     all errors in imagen1 and iptex.

     If you get confused, you can use the -help option to  get  a
     short list of all the available options.

     Chris Torek, University of Maryland, wrote the original ver-
     sion of imagen1 and iptex.
     Mike Urban (TRW) added the -p, -X, and -Y options.
     Dirk Grunwald, Univ. of Illinois, rewrote imagen1 to provide
     more help and greater flexibility in placing the document on
     the paper.  The current version of imagen1 uses the same DVI
     driver used in TeXx and TeXsun.
     Tim Morgan (UCI) added support for tpic specials.
