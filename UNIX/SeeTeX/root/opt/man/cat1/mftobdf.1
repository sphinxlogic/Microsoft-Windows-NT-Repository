     _m_f_t_o_b_d_f translates a metafont derived font into X11 BDF for-
     mat;  the  original font can be in any of PXL, GF or PK for-
     mat.  In addition to converting the font  into  BDF  format,
     fonts  can  be  optionally  shrunk, allowing you to generate
     screen-resolution fonts  from  existing  printer  resolution
     fonts.

          Specify the scale of the font  to  load,  specified  as
          _s_c_a_l_e  * _1_0_0_0 e.g., 1500 means scale the font 1.5 times
          Default is 1000.

          Specify how much the font should be  magnified,  speci-
          fied  as _m_a_g * _1_0_0_0 e.g., -mag 333 specifies 1/3 reduc-
          tion.

          Specify the  ``blackness''  for  font  reduction.  When
          reducing an n by n area, a blackess of _b means that the
          reduced pixel is ``on'' is (n * n)/b pixels were on  in
          the original sample.  The default is 3.

          load.  Default is 300.

          Specify the dvi design size of the fonts.  If you  ever
          need  to specify this, please tell me why.  Defaults to
          1000.

     ----ddddeeeevvvv Specify the device for the original fonts; defaults  to

     Assume you're viewing a file using texx2, and you've set the
     magnification level to 500, meaning that you're viewing your
     document at 1/2 the size that would be actually sent to your
     300dpi  printer  (that is, you're viewing it at 150dpi).  If
     your file calls for font ``cmr10'' scaled  1000  at  300dpi,
     _t_e_x_x_2  will  look for the font ``cmr10.150''.  The suffix is

     compute by (_d_p_i * _s_c_a_l_e_d * _m_a_g ) / ( _1_0_0_0 * _1_0_0_0 ).  You can
     generate  this  fonts  using ``mftobdf''.  For this example,
     you would execute ``mftobdf -scaled 1000 -mag  500  cmr10''.
     This  looks  for the font ``cmr10.300'' (the default resolu-
     tion is 300); this would then be shrunk by  50%  to  produce
     ``cmr10.150.bdf'',  the  output file.  _m_f_t_o_b_d_f can only mag-
     nify things  by  500,  333,  250,  200,  ...,  1000/integer,
     because  it  does  the  shrinking  in a very silly way.  You
     could also generate this font by using _M_e_t_a_f_o_n_t to  build  a
     font  ``cmr10.150''  and  then  saying ``mftobdf -scaled 500
     cmr10,'' the result to _t_e_x_x_2 are the same; it  doesn't  care
     how you produce the font.

     texx2 was designed to work with _m_f_t_o_b_d_f  and  _b_u_i_l_d_f_o_n_t_s  (a
     shell script to automate the installation of the X11 fonts).
     When texx2 can't find a font, you will get a message in  the
     dialog  box,  e.g,  ``Can't find font: -scaled 1095 -mag 500
     cmr11.''  Simply  cut  the  text  ``-scaled  1095  -mag  500
     cmr11'' from the dialog box and paste it in as the arguments
     to a _b_u_i_l_d_f_o_n_t_s command.

     The texx2 distribution also includes a  file  called  _b_u_i_l_d-
     _i_n_i_t_i_a_l-_f_o_n_t_s  that  purports to build many of your favorite
     cmr fonts automatically.  You should probably look  at  this
     an _b_u_i_l_d_f_o_n_t_s if you want to automate the procedure.  If you
     come up with a good solution, please inform the author.

     You can  only  shrink  by  intergral  areas.   Anti-aliasing
     should be done.  You can only shrink, not magnify fonts.
