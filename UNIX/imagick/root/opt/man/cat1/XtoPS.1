     _X_t_o_P_S reads an image from any visible window on an X server
     and outputs it as Encapsulated Postscript.  You can capture
     a single window, the entire screen, or any rectangular
     portion of the screen.  You can view the captured screen
     with any Postscript compatible viewer or printer.  The
     Postscript is displayed in color on viewers or printers that
     support color, otherwise it is displayed as grayscale.

     The target window can be specified by id, name, or may be
     selected by clicking the mouse in the desired window.  If
     you press a button and then drag, a rectangle will form
     which expands and contracts as the mouse moves.  To save the
     portion of the screen defined by the rectangle, just release
     the button.  The keyboard bell is rung once at the beginning
     of the screen capture and twice it completes.

          This option is useful when you need time to ready the
          target window before it is captured to a file.

          preferred size and location of the image on the
          Postscript page.  See XXXX((((1111)))) for details about the
          geometry specification. By default, the image is scaled
          and centered to fit on an 612x792 point Postscript
          page.

          If the specified image size is smaller than the actual
          image size, the image is first reduced to an integral
          of the specified image size with an antialias digital
          filter.  The image is then scaled to the exact
          specified image size with pixel replication.  If the
          specified image size is greater than the actual image
          size, the image is first enlarged to an integral of the
          specified image size with bilinear interpolation.  The
          image is then scaled to the exact specified image size
          with pixel replication.

          Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are
          filled with the color defined by the pixel at location
          (0,0).

          By default the image is output in portrait mode.  Use

          preferred size factors of the image.

          This option behaves like ----ggggeeeeoooommmmeeeettttrrrryyyy except the width and
          height values are relative instead of absolute.  The
          image size is multiplied by the width and height
          factors to obtain the final image dimensions.  If only
          one factor is specified, both the width and height
          factors assume the value.

          Factors may be fractional.  To increase the size of an
          image, use a scale factor greater than 1.0.  To

          This option indicates that the GetImage request used to
          obtain the image should be done on the root window,
          rather than directly on the specified window.  In this
          way, you can obtain pieces of other windows that
          overlap the specified window, and more importantly, you
          can capture menus or other popups that are independent
          windows but appear over the specified window.

          _P_s_e_u_d_o_C_l_a_s_s);  the total number of unique colors;  and
          the number of seconds to read and write the image.

          With this option you can specify the target  window by
          id or name rather than using the mouse.  Specify 'root'
          to select X's root window as the target window.

     Change - to + in any option above to reverse its effect.
     For example ++++ffffrrrraaaammmmeeee means do not include window manager
