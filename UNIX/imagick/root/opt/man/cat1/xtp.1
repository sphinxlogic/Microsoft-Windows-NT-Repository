     _X_t_p is a utility for retrieving, listing, or printing files
     from a remote network site, or sending files to a remote
     network site.  _X_t_p performs most of the same functions as
     the _f_t_p program, but does not require any interactive
     commands.  You simply specify the file transfer task on the
     command line and _x_t_p performs the task automatically.

          Retrieved files are stored on your local host directory
          as the full name of the retrieved file.  For example,
          if the retrieved file is named _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_s/_x_t_p._m_a_n on the
          remote FTP server, it will appear in your home
          directory as _d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_s/_x_t_p._m_a_n.

          specifies the maximum seconds to complete your remote
          FTP server request.  If this time expires, the program
          terminates.  The program also terminates if one tenth
          of this value is exceeded while logging onto the remote

     command line, a directory of files is listed for the remote
     network host.

     _x_t_p recursively descends the directory hierarchy from the
     home directory. Some remote hosts may have thousands of
     files causing a significant delay satisfying your request.
     This can be wasteful if the files you are interested in
     reside in a known directory.  You can reduce the searching
     required by specifying <_h_o_m_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y> on the command line.
     This limits the filename search to the specified directory
     and any of its subdirectories.  Alternatively, ----pppprrrruuuunnnneeee
     restricts the search to the home directory only.

     If only the program name is specified on the command line,
     the program command syntax and options are listed.

     ||||.  It matches anything that matches one of the branches.

     A branch is zero or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a
     match for the first, followed by a match for the second,
     etc.

     A piece is an atom possibly followed by ****, ++++, or ????.  An atom
     followed by **** matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the
     atom.  An atom followed by ++++ matches a sequence of 1 or more
     matches of the atom.  An atom followed by ???? matches a match
     of the atom, or the null pattern.

     An atom is a _r_e_g_u_l_a_r _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n in parentheses (matching a
     match for the _r_e_g_u_l_a_r _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n), a range (see below), ....
     (matching any single character), ^^^^ (matching the null
     pattern at the beginning of the input pattern), $$$$ (matching
     the null pattern at the end of the input pattern), a ''''
     followed by a single character (matching that character), or
     a single character with no other significance (matching that
     character).

     A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in [[[[]]]].  It
     normally matches any single character from the sequence.  If
     the sequence begins with ^^^^, it matches any single character
     not from the rest of the sequence.  If two characters in the
     sequence are separated by ----, this is shorthand for the full
     list of ASCII characters between them (e.g.  [[[[0000----9999]]]] matches
     any decimal digit). To include a literal ]]]] in the sequence,
     make it the first character (following a possible ^^^^).  To
     include a literal ----, make it the first or last character.
