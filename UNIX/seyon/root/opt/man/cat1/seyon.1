     _S_e_y_o_n is a complete full-featured telecommunications package
     for the _X _W_i_n_d_o_w _S_y_s_t_e_m. Some of its features are:


          * Dialing directory that supports an  unlimited  number
          of  entries.  The  directory  is fully mouse-driven and
          features  call  progress  monitoring,   dial   timeout,
          automatic  redial,  multi-number  dialing, and circular
          redial queue. Each item in the dialing directory can be
          configured with its own baud rate, bit mask, and script
          file.  The dialing directory uses  a  plain-text  phone
          book  that  can be edited from withen Seyon. Seyon also
          supports manual dialing.

          * Terminal emulation window supporting DEC  VT02,  Tek-
          tronix  4014,  and  ANSI.  Seyon delegates its terminal
          emulation to xterm, so all the familiar xterm functions
          such  as the scroll-back buffer, cut-and-paste utility,
          and visual bell are availabe through  Seyon's  terminal
          emulation window. Using xterm also means that Seyon has
          a more complete emulation of VT102 than other any  Unix
          or  DOS telecommunications program. Other terminal emu-
          lation programs can also be used with Seyon to suit the
          user's  need;  for  example, color xterm can be used to
          provide emulation for color ANSI (popular on  many  BBS
          systems), and xvt can be used if memory is a bit tight.

          * Script language to automate  tedious  tasks  such  as
          logging  into  remote hosts. Seyon's script interpreter
          uses plain-text files and has a syntax similar to  that
          of sh, with a few extra addtions. It supports many fam-
          iliar statements such as conditional branching  by  _i_f-
          _e_l_s_e  and  looping  by _g_o_t_o. Scripts may be assigned to
          items in the dialing directory for automatic  execution
          after a connection is made.

          * Unlimited number of slots for external file  transfer
          protocols.  Protocols are activated from a mouse-driven
          transfer console that uses a plain-text file,  editable
          from  withen  Seyon,  for protocol configuration. Seyon
          prompts the user for filenames only if the chosen  pro-
          tocol  requires  filenames or if the transfer operation

          is an upload, for which Seyon also  accepts  wildcards.
          Multiple  download directories can be specified for the
          different transfer slots.

          *  Support  for  Zmodem  auto-download.  Seyon  detects
          incoming Zmodem signature and automatically activates a
          user-specified  zmodem  protocol  to  receive  incoming
          files.   Zmodem   transfers   can  thus  be  completely
          automatic and require no user intervention.

          * Translation modes. Seyon can perfrom useful  trasnla-
          tions  on  the  user's  input.  From example, Seyon can
          translate backspace to delete (useful on may Unix  sys-
          tems),  newline  to carriage return (useful on many BBS
          hosts), and my favorite, meta key tranlation:  to  send
          keys  pressed  while the meta (ALT) key is held down as
          an escape (ESC) followed by the key press.  The  latter
          mode  simulates  the meta key on hosts that do not sup-
          port 8-bit-clean connections and makes possible the use
          of the meta key in programs like Emacs on such hosts.

          * Other features: interactive setting of program param-
          eters,  on-line help, software (XONN/XOFF) and hardware
          (RTS/CTS) flow control, session capture to a file,  and
          temporary running of a local shell in the terminal emu-
          lation window.

          Seyon is intended to be  both  simple  and  extensively
          configurable.  Almost every aspect of Seyon can be con-
          figured via the resources to suit the user's taste.

     Besides the toolkit options, Seyon recognizes the  following
     command-line switches:


     ----mmmmooooddddeeeemmmm <_d_e_v_i_c_e>

          of that resource below.

          Instructs Seyon to use the  specified  program  as  the
          terminal emulator.  If Seyon fails to execute that pro-
          gram, it will fall back to xterm. If this option is not
          given, Seyon will try to use seyon-emu, which should be
          a link to your  favorite  terminal  emulation  program.
          Seyon  will  fall back to xterm in this case as well if
          it fails to execute seyon-emu.

     --------   This switch instructs Seyon to pass  the  rest  of  the
          command-line  to  the  terminal  emulation program. All

          options following this switch will be passed blindly to
          the  emulator.  This  switch  cannot  be  combined with
          -noemulator.

          Seyon usually invokes the  terminal  emulation  program
          with  some options to set the application name and win-
          dow and icon titles (those are -name  Seyon  -T  "Seyon
          Terminal  Emulator"  -n  Terminal).  If  this switch is
          given, Seyon will not pass those options to the  emula-
          tor.   This  is  to accommodate terminal emulation pro-
          grams that use a  different  command-line  syntax  than
          xterm  --  like xvt, cmdtool, shelltool, ..etc. You can
          use the '--' switch to pass your  own  options  to  the
          emulator.

          This option is valid only  if  Seyon  is  invoked  from
          withen  a  terminal emulation program in the foreground
          of an interactive shell session.  If given, Seyon  will
          not  launch  a  new terminal emulator, but will use the
          existing one instead. You cannot use the '--' switch if
          this option is given.

          script  after  the startup script is run. The specified
          script file will be looked for according  to  the  rule

          This resource specifies that Seyon should start dialing
          the  entries  specified by the resource _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_P_h_o_n_e_E_n_-
          _t_r_i_e_s (or its override command-line switch) on startup.
          Seyon will commence dialing those entries after execut-
          ing the startup script and any script specified at  the
          command  line.  If set to 'on', this resource overrides
          the resource _D_i_a_l_D_i_r_A_u_t_o_O_p_e_n and forces it to be  'on'.
          A  more  convenient way of automatic dialing on startup
          is to use the override command-line switch -_d_i_a_l, which
          overrides  this  resource  and sets it to 'on'.  If the
          resource is set to 'on', it can set  to  'off'  at  the
          command  line  by the override switch -_n_o_d_i_a_l. Refer to
          the  description  of  these  switches  above.   _D_e_f_a_u_l_t

          This is a format string that specifies  the  layout  of
          the  dialing direcotry. The default is '%-15s %-15s %6s
          %1c%1c%1c %1c%1c %s' (no quotes).  Briefly: the  fields
          represent  the  host name, number, the baud rate, bits,
          parity, stop bits, whether there is  a  custom  prefix,
          suffix,  and  the  script name. You can understand more
          what each field refers to  by  comparing  with  dialing
          directory, fields that use the current setting (via the
          keyword CURRENT) are designated  by  a  question  mark.
          Notice  that  you  cannot change the order the items in
          the dialing directory appear at, only the  format.  For
          example, if the numbers you call are all 7-digits, your
          host names are short, you never use  baud  rates  above
          9600,  and you like dashes between the baud rate, bits,
          parity, and stop bits fields, then you  may  prefer  to
          use  the  format  string  '%-10s  %-8s  %5s-%1c-%1c-%1c
          %1c%1c %s', which would be narrower  than  the  default

          If this resource is set to 'on', the  modem  DCD  (Data
          Carrier  Detect)  status  will  be ignored. Some of the

     Script files can automate some tedious tasks such as logging
     into  a system.  A script file is an ascii text file and may
     be entered or edited using any standard text editor.

     The script file is read line by line.  Empty lines (consist-
     ing  of  white  space only) are ignored.  Comments are lines
     whose first non-space character is a pound sign (#).

     The script processor reads each script line, ignoring  lead-
     ing white space, into _w_o_r_d_s. A word is defined as either:


          +o a sequence of characters delimited by white space, or
          +o a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double
          quotes.

          The first word of a script file is considered the  _c_o_m_-
          _m_a_n_d  _w_o_r_d.   If the last character of the command word
          is a colon (:), the line is considered to  be  a  _l_a_b_e_l
          (the  object  of  a  _g_o_t_o statement).  Otherwise, it is
          assumed to be a script command and  is  interpreted  as
          such. Command words are case insensative.

          Some commands take one or more arguments. Each argument
          is parsed as a single word as defined above.  If blanks
          are required in  an  argument,  the  argument  must  be
          quoted using single or double quotes.

          If the argument is _o_n,  all  subsequent  command  lines
          processed  will  be  displayed on the local screen. The
          exception to this is lines containing a  _t_r_a_n_s_m_i_t  com-
          mand.  These lines will just print _T_R_A_N_S_M_I_T..., so that
          passwords, etc. can be protected. If  the  argument  is

          "Hayes"  compatible modems for dialing.  Note that this
          command requires an actual phone number. The  phonebook

          it  to the modem (use _t_r_a_n_s_m_i_t for that). If the string
          contains spaces, it must be quoted.  Note  that  unlike
          the  shell  command of the same name, this command does
          not accepts the switch -n but always appends newline to
          the string.

          text  argument should be quoted (using single or double
          quotes) if there are spaces to be transmitted. The text

          \ is quote prefix: the next  character  is  transmitted

          This  command  specifies  whether  or  not   characters
          received  from the modem will be displayed on the local
          terminal.  Since the only time that the script  proces-
          sor  looks  at the receive queue is during _w_a_i_t_f_o_r pro-
          cessing, the displays may look a bit erratic.  Use  the
          _t_t_y  _o_f_f  command  to disable local display of received
          characters during script processing.

          The  text  argument  should  be quoted (using single or
          double quotes) if there are spaces to be transmitted.

          Special characters are  interpreted  the  same  as  for
          _t_r_a_n_s_m_i_t.   If the timeout argument is specified, Seyon
          will wait that number of  seconds  for  the  string  to
          appear.   If  no timeout is given, Seyon defaults to 30
          seconds.

          During _w_a_i_t_f_o_r processing, characters received  (up  to
          and  including  the last character found in the text or
          in the timeout) can be captured to a disk file (if _c_a_p_-

          This is is useful if the order of prompts  expected  is
          not  known  before  hand. For example, some BBS systems
          (notably PCBoard) change the prompts  depeding  on  the
          time  of  call,  and  a complete script for such boards
          cannot be written using _w_a_i_t_f_o_r only.

          As many number of  _w_h_e_n  commands  as  desired  can  be
          specified.  A _w_h_e_n command with no arguments clears all
          outstanding _w_h_e_n commands.  _w_a_i_t_f_o_r commands take  pre-
          cedence  over  _w_h_e_n  commands  if  they expect the same
          string.

          A typical use of this command would be:

                  when "Continue?"    "y^M"
                  when "More?"         "n^M"
                  waitfor "BBS Command?"
                  when

          The above script keeps  sending  "y^M"  to  every  Con-
          tinue?"  prompt and "n^M" to every "More?" prompt until
          the the string "BBS Command?" is encountered. The  lasy
          _w_h_e_n clears all outstanding _w_h_e_n commands.
