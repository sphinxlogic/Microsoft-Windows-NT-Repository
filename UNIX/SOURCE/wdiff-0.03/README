Subject: wdiff 0.0 - Patch 3 (brings 0.02 to 0.03)

Here is the version 0.03 test release of `wdiff'.  All reported bugs
in previous test releases have been fixed.  Some bugs surely remain.
Your feedback will help me to make `wdiff' better and more portable.
Thanks to all those who contributed comments or suggestions.

The program `wdiff' is a front end to `diff' for comparing files on a
word per word basis.  A word is anything between whitespace.  This
program is particularily useful for comparing two texts in which a few
words have been changed and for which paragraphs have been refilled.
`wdiff' is free software.  See files COPYING and COPYING.LIB for
copying conditions.

This program does not require `termcap', but takes advantage of it.
If your system does not have termcap, you might feel like getting and
installing GNU termcap first.  Grab termcap-1.0.tar.Z in /pub/gnu from
prep.ai.mit.edu.  *If* you do not have an ANSI-C compiler, you might
still install `wdiff', BUT YOU NEED TO INSTALL FLEX FIRST.  Get a copy
of flex-2.3.7.tar.Z in /pub/gnu from prep.ai.mit.edu.

This version improves the previous one in the following areas:

* Exit code values like diff's: 0=identical, 1=differs, 2=others.
* Provide alloca.c for those lacking it.
* Provide unproto.l, which can help compiling with non-ANSI compilers.
* Other portability glitches, thanks to all those who wrote.

If a patch follows later in this file, apply it to wdiff-0.02 to get
wdiff-0.03.  It is a unified diff, you can apply it using a recent
version of the `patch' program, like patch-2.0.12u7.tar.Z in /pub/gnu
from prep.ai.mit.edu.  Given you have it, first save this article in
file THIS_ARTICLE, then execute the following commands:

	cd wdiff-0.02
	patch < THIS_ARTICLE

If you just patched `wdiff', or if you received it in shar format,
beware the time stamps might be improper.  You might somewhat
alleviate the problem with the two following commands:

	touch configure    <- if you forget this, you need autoconf!
	touch wdiff.info   <- if you forget this, you need makeinfo!

You can also get a fully patched version, for at least a few days, as
wdiff-0.03.tar.Z in /tmp from ftp.uu.net.  In any case, see the file
INSTALL for building and installation instructions.  Please send all
bug reports by electronic mail to: <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

Let me add a few words about the documentation.  Calling just `wdiff',
without arguments, will summarize its usage.  The true documentation
is in Texinfo format.  You can look at the file wdiff.info using any
ASCII editor, or even print the file as is.  You may browse it using
GNU Emacs Info mode: `C-u M-x info RET wdiff.info RET' or, using the
standalone Info reader, through: `info -f wdiff.info'.  If you have
TeX, first insure `.' is in TEXINPUTS, execute `tex wdiff.texi', then
process and print wdiff.dvi the usual way.  You can find makeinfo and
the standalone info reader in file texinfo-2.15.tar.Z in /pub/gnu from
prep.ai.mit.edu: just unpack it and look into the C subdirectory.
