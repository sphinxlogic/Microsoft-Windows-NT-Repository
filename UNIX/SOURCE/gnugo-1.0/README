This program is the updated version of Hugo (Version 1.0).  It is an
attempt to start a free program to play Go.  The idea is based on the
article "Programming the Game of Go. Byte, Vol.6 No.4" by J. K. Millen.

Currently, this program only understands basic Go rules and play skills.
It counts the number of liberty for each board piece.  Computer move is
generated by choosing among several possible moves to attack the opponent,
defense own pieces and match playing patterns.  If no good move is found
then random move will be generated.  It doesn't have the concept of eye
although it will try to form one.

The program is written in C running on Sun and IBM PC.  The only difference
is the function to get system time as the seed for the random number
generator.  It can easily ported to other systems by changing this function.
Computer Innovation C86 compiler is used for the PC version.  To use other
C compilers, simple change is required.

You are encouraged to send in enhencement, suggestion, bug/fix for this
program.  Future release can be obtained from Free Software Foundation and
usenet rec.games.go newsgroup.
