DNA sequence useful for testing the `animate' program from
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  `animate' is a
program that can display image sequences on any X server:

  animate dna.[0-9]*

ImageMagick requires Craig Kolb's RAYSHADE software available via FTP
as princeton.edu:/pub/Graphics/rayshade.4.0 to generate the DNA image
sequence.  Alternately, you can get the image sequence from
contrib/ImageMagick.animation.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.
