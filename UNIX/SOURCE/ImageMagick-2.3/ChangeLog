ImageMagick 2.3


  o Magnify window now includes pixel value with RGB color value for windows
    whose depth is 12 or less.

  o Sometimes icon's had a private colormap.  Icon's now use a shared colormap.
  
  o Keyboard accelerators did not work with -backdrop option.

  o Add new utility: combine-- combine images to create new images using
    digital compositing operators.

  o xtp failed under Solaris 2.1.

  o I486 compiler complained about includes within a function body of
    xtp/network.c (thanks to glenn@physics.su.OZ.AU).

  o I486 compiler complained about XWDfile.h being included twice (ReadXWD &
    WriteXWD) (thanks to glenn@physics.su.OZ.AU)

ImageMagick 2.2.4

  o time between images did not always match the value specified on
    -delay.

  o Sped up and reduced memory requirement of dithering.

  o GIF images were corrupted on SVR4 (thanks to glenn@physics.su.OZ.AU).

ImageMagick 2.2.3

  o Non-color reduced images were being written even though the color
    reduction option was specified (-colors).  This affected images written
    as AVS, CMYK, and RGB.

  o Modified various sources to reduce lint warnings.


ImageMagick 2.2.2

  o Dithering did not work properly on the Cray (due to right shift problem).

  o In most cases dithering requires 1/2 as much memory as previously.

  o Dithering was sped up by ~15%.

  o Occasionally the quantization error was reported incorrectly.


ImageMagick 2.2.1

  o The number of colors reported with the -verbose option was on
    occasion incorrect.

  o Color quantization was improved and in some cases sped up ~10%.

  o Cleaned up image rotation code.

  o Added -shear to mogrify options.

  o Added a file type of HISTOGRAM to convert.

  o Sometimes PBM image files did not have the correct number of bytes.

  o Color reduced PPM images were being written at the full color resolution.

  o Keypresses are no longer accepted during image configuration.

  o Red, green, and blue values of a X constant image were set to the
    red intensity of the background color.

  o Clipped images did not show up correctly in the panning icon.

  o `animate' no longer shows images out-of-order if the image scene number is
    absent (thanks to kent@oddjob.uchicago.edu).

  o ImageMagick now recognizes the X resource class with the first letter
    of the client capitalized, i.e. 'Display.Visual: default' (thanks to
    dws@ssec.wisc.edu).


ImageMagick 2.2

  o When displaying a composite MIFF image created with `montage',
    button 3 no longer displays a magnify window.  Instead the
    tile at the mouse location is displayed.  When the tile image is
    exited, the composite image reappears.  This is effectively a
    visual image directory.

  o `montage' has a new gravity option for placing an image within
    a tile of the composite, i.e. CenterGravity.

  o `montage' has a new compose option for specifying which composite
     operation to use.

  o `montage' creates composite images with the `montage' keyword.

  o Updated MIFF manual page to reflect 'montage' image header
    keyword.

  o Add -colormap to `mogrify.'  Use to color reduce an image to
    a set of colors you choose.

  o Some compilers have read-only strings.   ImageMagick no longer
    writes on read-only strings.

  o For colormapped X servers, the color reduction has been sped up by
    trading image quality for processing time.  See the README for
    details.

  o Latin1Upper was declared wrong in X.h.

  o Added unistd.h to display.h for strict ANSI compilers.

  o Changed long to time_t for calls to C time routine.

  o Multi-part GIF's can now be displayed or animated.

  o Fixed segmentation fault when reading multi-part images with
    animate, montage, or mogrify.

  o Multi-part MIFF images have the correct file name now.

  o An expose event for the Magnify window may occur before it is
    mapped.  This caused display to fail on Solburne and HP's.

  o Using `-colorspace gray' with 'convert' correctly produces
    grayscale images.

  o Images are sorted by intensity for shared colormapped visuals.
    Some intensity intervals are made "more popular".  This gives better
    image results when sharing colors with other applications.

  o All utilities correctly read multi-part TIFF images.

  o Image pixmap was not being updated correctly when pan icon appears
    (thanks to dws@ssec.wisc.edu).

  o Fixed ANSI warning on image composite code.

  o Panning uses a pixmap for faster panning speed.

  o Rotate.c now uses a table to force range limits.

  o range table in quantize.c is allocated from the heap instead of
    the stack.

  o adjusted the sensitivity for automatic dithering.  Some JPEG images
    were not being dithered.
