       xviewgl - display GRASP library files under X11

       _f_i_le [_s_c_r_i_p_t]

       Where _f_i_l_e is either the name of a directory containing an
       unpacked  GRASP  library, the name of a GRASP library file
       ending in ".gl", or the name of a GRASP script  ending  in
       ".txt".  If _f_i_l_e is a directory or GRASP library name, you
       may specify _s_c_r_i_p_t , the name of a script  to  use  within
       the library or directory.  The default is to use the first
       script encountered.

       _X_g_l is an X11-based viewer for _G_R_A_S_P libraries.  _G_R_A_S_P  is
       an  animation  package  popular on _I_B_M _P_C_s.  It is a near-
       complete implementation of _G_R_A_S_P _V_1._1_0 ,  with  many  fea-
       tures from later versions of _G_R_A_S_P.

       In  order  to see the colors properly, you may need to set
       input focus to _x_v_i_e_w_g_lusing the -i  option.   The  _x_v_i_e_w_g_l
       window  will accept the following input in addition to any
       requested by GRASP files:  <space> will pause  the  anima-
       tion,  <esc>  will  exit  _x_v_i_e_w_g_l , and any other key will
       break out of a single delay.

       -d _d_e_l
            Sets minimum delay to _d_e_l hundredths of a second.  This
            option is useful for viewing files designed for viewing on slow
            PCs.

       -F   Attempts to play friendly with the colormap.  Colors
            are allocated from the highest number down so as to
            minimize the diruption of other applications' colors.

       -f   Attempts to "fix up" the aspect ratio according to the
            screen type.

       -i   Install colormap.

       -q     Quiet mode.  Don't beep for sound effects.

       -s   Synchronize display.  For debugging.

       -t   Trace.  Display each line before executing.

       -x _n These options allow you to specify x and y scaling factors.
       -y _n Only integer values are allowed.

       Monochrome  support  is  latent,  but  I  don't   have   a
       monochrome  system,  so I can't get it working.  Feel free
       to hack around in windows.c to try to get it going.

       I am looking for information on  .DFF  and  BSAVE  images.
       Any  help  or specifications may lead to my adding support
       for them.

       I am also interested in adding  support  for  any  of  the
       standard  variables  GRASP  supports, and for info on com-
       mands (like DLOAD and PUTDFF) which  I  don't  understand.
       Any  documentation  or command descriptions would be help-
       ful.  (I have seen the GRASP v1.10 docs, so I  don't  need
       them...)
