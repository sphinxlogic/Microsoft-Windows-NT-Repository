This directory contains documentation for GNU EMACS LISP.

Revision:	19-2.02.2
Author:		Free Software Foundation
Date formatted:	6 February 1994
Formatted by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS

Prerequisites:	GNU emacs, TeX

Documentation:	.dvi and info

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		Make always rebuilds the .dvi files. This is a tricky
		business, of course, but be warned that you are in for
		quite a wait if you start a "make all"

Modifications:

0. Configure for local environment.

1. Texindex fails to compile. The problems don't look bad, but since
   we already have the definitive version in texinfo, leave it out of
   here.

2. Similar considerations apply to makeinfo.
