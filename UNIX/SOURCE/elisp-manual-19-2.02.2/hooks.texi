@appendix Standard Hooks

The following is a list of hook variables which let you provide
functions to be called from within Emacs on suitable occasions. 

Most of these variables have names ending with @samp{-hook} are
@dfn{normal hooks}, that are run with @code{run-hooks}.  The value of
such a hook is a list of functions.  The recommended way to put a new
function on such a hook is to call @code{add-hook}.  @xref{Hooks}, for
more information about using hooks.

The variables whose names end in @samp{-function} have single functions
as their values.  Usually there is a specific reason why the variable is
not a normal hook, such as, the need to pass an argument to the
function.  (In older Emacs versions, some of these variables had
names ending in @samp{-hook} even though they were not normal hooks.)

The variables whose names end in @samp{-hooks} have lists of functions
as their values, but these functions are called in a special way (they
are passed arguments, or else their values are used).

@c !!! need  xref  to where each hook is documented or else document it
@c by specifying what is expected, and when it is called relative to
@c mode initialization.)
