Things to do for Ease 3.?
-------------------------


Fix the following constructs so that cfc/et handles the conversion properly:

	# indirect macros, i.e. 
	DMroot
	T$M

Eliminate the concat() construct, if possible.

check for if (exactly_one) next($2); type error.
check for matching < and > in rulesets
Check for mailers "local" and "prog" 

Add the new IDA/sendmail macro $m

	A new macro, $m, has been defined.  For single recipients in
	a local mail delivery, it's value is the original address before
	aliasing.  If all recipients for the current transaction derive
	from a single original recipient, use that for $m.  Else make
	$m undefined (to preserve Bcc: privacy).

	The Received header now has 'for $m' in place of 'for $u'.  The
	new code release supports $m as the recipient prior to aliasing.
	This will not cause any problems with earlier code releases, except
	that the 'for user' will no appear on the header unless you change
	this back to $u.


Add the IDA Os option:

	If Os (SuperSafe) is set in the sendmail.cf file, files in the spool
	area will either be open()ed with O_SYNC set or fsync()ed prior
	to close.

IDA:
	Simon J Gerraty (sjg@melb.bull.oz.au) contributed patch for SUN's
	$%x and $!x features ($!x added as $^x).

    * delayed macro evaluation using $&x syntax
    * RFC822 quoted macro expansion using $!x syntax


Silicon Graphics:
	Add the $[! lookup operator for pathalias
CFC improvements
	Make it a real two-pass parser. This way, it can
	properly specify the rulesets, macros, and classes it
	needs. Or else write a shell script that determines which rulesets,
	macros, and classes are needed.

Error Detections
	Eliminate syntax errors that just report "syntax error"	

Regression Testing script:

	rewrite it into perl for speed
