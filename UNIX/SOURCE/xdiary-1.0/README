xdiary was initially developed as an exercise for me to learn the basics
of widget writing and toolkit programming.  However, the further along
it came the more I realized that a useful tool could be made of it.

In its current form (version 1.0) xdiary provides a somewhat robust tool
for associating text with a specified date, suitable for keeping a daily
diary or work log.  By using templates, the diary entries can be
configured or personalized to be suitabile for a wide range of needs.
See the man page for more details.

xdiary will only build under Release 4.  The Makefile supplied is the
result of running xmkmf on a Sun-3 with Release 4 installed.  Running
xmkmf on your system should provide you with a suitable makefile, if
the one provided doesn't work right off.

There are many improvements currently under consideration, and I am
interested in hearing "reasonable" requests for features and enhancements
for the next version.  I have no intention of adding xclock-like
functionality to xdiary (for an "integrated desktop" feel) so please
send those requests to /dev/null.

xdiary was developed on a Harris Night Hawk 3800 running CX/UX 5.0, and
it has also been tested on a Sun-3 running SunOS 4.0.3.  Please email
comments and bug reports directly to me (at the address listed above).

A large part of the xdiary coding effort was devoted to the CalendarWidget in
hopes that other developers might use it in their own applications.  The
Calendar.doc document is in the standard Xaw widget document format and can be
printed out on unix systems via:

    tbl macros.t strings.xaw Calendar.doc | roff -ms

where macros.t and strings.xaw can be found in the mit/doc/Xaw/ directory
of the X tree.
