	* Released xalarm-3.04.

Tue May 26 20:49:31 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Daemon extracts display info from command line args.  From a bug
	report of sorts by Jay Hersh.  Ditto for restarting.

Fri May 22 20:07:53 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Warnings not updated as the alarm triggers.

	* Fullpath accepts path directory as well as full path.  Idea from Ned
	Danieley.

Fri May 15 19:59:20 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Explicitly moves to the end of the file before saving; solves the
	occasional losing of information when many xalarms write to the same
	file.

Tue May 12 13:41:19 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Uses fcntl() rather than flock(), and can use lockf() too.

	* Can use un/link() method as an alternative to rename().

Wed May  6 09:52:43 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Certain servers seem to require all parts of the XLFD explicitly, and
	the iso number specified in case PostScript fonts are around.  From
	Andreas Stolcke.

Sat May  2 15:24:10 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Does not remove "saved" information from confirmation popup on minute
	change.

Wed Apr 29 18:53:28 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Correctly detects absolute alarm time passing in confirmation on
	minute change, only switches dialog to time entry if the dialog is the
	confirm.

	* Only complains about no display when restarting alarms if there are
	alarms to restart.

Tue Apr 28 10:13:10 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released xalarm-3.03.

Wed Apr 22 12:06:14 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Properly solved the hanging <defunct> children; wait() only waits for
	one child.

Fri Apr 17 12:11:24 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Correctly adds, not replaces, callbacks on AsciiText widget.  From
	Donna Converse.

Wed Apr  8 19:46:43 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Correctly saves multi-line messages when xalarm dies.

Tue Apr  7 10:41:46 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added all as an option to -reset; -kill is the same as -reset, except
	deadly.

	* Added getlogin() as a way of getting the login name, from Bob
	Primmer, and also cuserid().

Mon Apr  6 18:21:53 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Does not attempt to restart alarms if it cannot open a connection to
	the display.

Fri Mar 27 19:11:22 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Solved the intermittent resize problem - the behaviour of the Shell
	is undefined for multiple children, even if only one is managed.  Added
	an intermediate (Form) widget to solve this.

Fri Mar 20 20:07:01 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Corrected bug whereby a 2 or 4 digit absolute time with leading
	zero was not treated as in 24 hour format.

Mon Mar 16 20:38:17 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -restart, along with the ability for xalarm to save alarms when
	the session closes.

	* Solved the hanging <defunct> children, thanks to comp.unix.programmer
	and a cast of thousands.

Tue Mar 10 11:55:13 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -daemon option, like -file but never returns, and -kill.

Sat Mar  7 18:46:38 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added XALARMFILEPATH so you can have a list of alarm files to check.

	* Can save alarm settings in ~/.xalarms.

	* Put a clock up on each popup.  Also keeps track of any other time
	dependent information.  From an idea by Gisle Hannemyr.

Fri Mar  6 18:19:10 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Changed the way the alarm and warnings make a noise.  Can now specify
	a shell script to run instead.  Volume control.

Tue Mar  3 10:54:02 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -pester (or should that be -persecute?), kind of auto-snooze,
	and time information in popups.  Idea from Gisle Hannemyr.

	* Made a temporary hack-fix for a R5 manifestation of the Shell's
	ChangeManaged bug: added field padding for confirmation widget label.
	Yes, I could give a XXXX.  Unfortunately, the bug then shows up under
	R4.  Can't win them all.

	* Fixed "-file" without-following-arg bug, and Makefiles for brain-dead
	makes.  From Stefan Haenssgen and Braham Levy.

Sun Mar  1 13:19:08 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made it get the user's home directory via the passwd file too.

Fri Feb 28 10:25:31 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Corrected declaration of XtResources defaults which caused a silent
	crash if application defaults were not properly installed.  From Gisle
	Hannemyr.

Thu Feb 27 17:52:59 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Can combine time symbols & dates.  Added noon.

Wed Feb 26 19:49:54 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made the config guess all & only query at the end.

Mon Feb 24 13:03:39 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* "make config" is now included when necessary by make & corrected
	CentreWidgetUnderPointer() to include widget's width.  Thanks to Braham
	Levy.  Added EnsureAllOnScreen() for resizing popups; only shifts left.

Sun Feb 23 15:27:08 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Changed the alarm file to ~/.xalarms always and removed environment
	variable XALARM.

	* Added uname() as a way of getting the machine name.  From Rich $alz's
	shar program.

Sun Feb 16 13:46:26 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added date parsing to appointments too.  Added -file option, moved 
	into file.c.

Fri Feb 14 19:55:24 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added date parsing to popup, with some error parsing.  Moved dates
	into dates.c.

Mon Feb 10 12:53:47 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made it get the user name from the passwd file rather than $USER.
	From Paul Vixie's cron program.

Thu Feb  6 18:52:25 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Time parsing now gives more informative error messages.

Tue Feb  4 10:00:36 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added reset button to warning popup.  Don't think it's appropriate
	for alarm itself.  Corrected timeout casting.

	* Change to Imakefile to make sure dependencies are made, and
	config.1st invoked, properly.  George Lindholm & Jonathan I. Kamens.

Sat Feb  1 15:40:29 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released patch 2.

Thu Jan 30 11:11:01 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Behaves properly during leap years.

	* Fixed bug whereby dates are parsed wrongly if the number of days in
	the current month is more than the number of days in the month given.

	* Better error messages with unrecognised dates.

Tue Jan 21 11:10:34 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made config.1st try to find locations, instead of assuming a Sun.
	Forgot to include times.o as dependent on xalarm.h.  Non-existent
	function was declared.

	* Fixed bug whereby changes in the dialog was silently accepted while
	changing other values.

	* Resources properly label all quit buttons.

Mon Jan 20 10:08:55 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released patch 1.

Wed Jan 15 14:58:08 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Input in the dialog popup properly is directed to the visible widget.

	* Cleaned resources, man page & xmemo doesn't ask for confirmation.

Fri Jan  3 13:51:52 1992  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fixed Imakefile where blanks after ManSuffix were not stripped, from
	Jonathan I. Kamens.

Thu Dec 19 15:23:46 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Solved the auto-resize; just took the width resource out.

	* Casted everything properly to shut up picky compilers.

Wed Dec 18 19:29:08 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made all the windows proper transient shells as they should be.  If
	no geometry is given, the windows popup under the mouse pointer.

	* Can no longer kill xalarm via the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol.  It has
	no effect with shells widgets.

Fri Dec  6 13:36:08 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fixed bug in AppointmentIsToday() which under certain circumstances
	would parse times in files wrong or core dump.  Forgot to XtMalloc() in
	a couple of places.

Thu Dec  5 18:29:45 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Words from the alarm message can be incorporated in the warning
	popup.  From an idea by Evan Bigall.

Sun Dec  1 14:20:46 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made resources control the cursor shapes; took gumby out of alarm.c.

Thu Oct 17 14:46:01 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added justification for the Dialog widget label.  Still makes a
	widget bigger than need be though.

Sun Oct 13 17:40:00 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* For the confirmation window, sorts the warning times into descending
	order, and takes the day of the week from WEEKDAYS rather than ctime(),
	in case a different language is being used.

Sat Oct  5 15:37:59 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released xalarm-3.

Wed Oct  2 14:35:15 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Taken out the makeX and put that stuff in with config.1st, let the
	user sort it out.

Mon Sep 30 19:12:40 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -list so xalarm shows what ps thinks are the user's xalarm pids
	are.  Had to alter the makefiles so that you could set where ps & the
	rest where; added a config.1st to do this.

Sun Sep 29 22:16:09 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made xalarm capable of parsing a file for alarms, so for regular
	times, it will set alarms automatically.

Fri Sep 27 10:43:41 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fed up with ``Is it only BSD that uses bzero, or only SYSV that uses
	memset?  Or is it a bit of both?''  Wrote my own.

Wed Sep 25 22:17:05 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Split README into README and INSTALL.  Made it all a touch more
	portable?  Thanks to Andreas Stolcke.  Made the manual more readable,
	thanks to suggestions by Bill Leonard.

Tue Sep 24 21:54:30 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added a -snooze & resource on suggestion by Bill Leonard, so you can
	have a default snoozetime already set for you.  Corrected bits & bobs
	in man page too.

Sun Sep 15 21:41:52 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Cleaned up for release in contrib for R5; re-named xalarm-3 for good
	measure.

	* Added a -reset kill & signal trapper code so that you can wake up an
	alarm and change the times.

Thu Sep  5 12:24:56 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added a make flag & fix for the X crash-on-zero-timeout (bug report
	from Jamie Zawinsk).  Cleaned up Makefile & README.

Mon Sep  2 11:54:20 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fixed the little problem with the clear button, although the resource
	still isn't changeable by the user.

Tue Aug 27 17:08:47 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* The timeout is now recalculated on confirmation so that if the time
	is absolute, messing around during confirmation won't result in a late
	alarm.

Wed Aug 21 18:00:00 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released xalarm-2.00.

Tue Aug 20 10:25:58 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fixed a little bug as a result of yesterday; if an invalid time is
	given with the noconfirm option, the alarm message text is "".

	* Finally made the popups get their geometry from the alarm, by
	intercepting it from the command line...

Mon Aug 19 13:56:53 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added xmemo (thanks to an unconnected posting by Dan Jacobson, I
	think) & found a bug in the manual - used -beep instead of -bell!!!
	Added -beep & -nobeep to options...

Sun Aug 18 11:17:45 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Put the toggling back (!) so you can fiddle with warning times too.

	* Changed -at and -in to -time, -in times preceded by a `+' (but
	warning times aren't).  None of that silly toggling etc.  Also made
	some options have shorter aliases.

	* Made xalarm overwrite any given message, so ps etc can't show what it
	is.  From a comment by Reiner Hammer.

Fri Aug 16 12:25:08 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Cleaned up here & there.

	* Incorporated a hacked version of the time parser from xcal-3.2, Peter
	Collinson et al.

	* Changed the way warnings are given.  No longer within quotes, they
	must be separated by commas (only).

Wed Aug 14 12:58:29 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Corrected bug whereby time wasn't always correctly calculated when
	given as 12 hour clock but >12 hours ahead.

Tue Aug 13 12:41:32 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added forking - so must easier than I had assumed.  No closing to do
	after all.  Thanks to Gordon Freedman & Janet Anstett.

Fri Aug  9 13:38:35 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -h[elp].

Thu Aug  8 15:04:56 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -v[ersion]; I'm fed up with getting bug reports without it.

	* Added a config to Makefile so as to make sure stuff is ready for
	making & running/playing with.

Mon Aug  5 15:46:00 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* It appears that stuff in .../lib/X11/app-defaults is not
	pre-processed with cpp, so we can't have "#ifdef" etc in there.  Moved
	colour stuff to separate file.  From Scott Blachovicz & a multitude of
	others.

Sun Aug  4 15:12:06 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Corrected bug whereby When?.when.label was for "at" time when it
	should be "in", when user gave invalid "in" time on the command line.

	* If enabled, confirmation is now always sort, unless alarm is to
	trigger immediately.

	* Made warnings only accept times in the [[[h]h]m]m format a` la -in.
	Invalid times result in an error message on stderr only.  Also added
	-nowarn.  (Implemented as "-warn 0" :-)

Fri Aug  2 09:46:42 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added confirmation stuff to xalarm.  Does not confirm if using
	relative time given on the command line.  Also added -confirm,
	-noconfirm and -nobell.

	* Split up xalarm into more meaningful pieces.  Preparation for
	xalarm-2.00?

Wed Jul 31 13:20:29 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released xalarm-1.01.

	* Made MakeX which looks for the absolute path of an executable.  Need
	it for yow, as it is often not is a person's path.

	* Fixed bug/mistake.  I had sometimes declared warg as an Arg, but
	XtSetValues expects an ArgList.  Changed to declare as warg[1].  From
	comments made by Dave Brooks, Bill Leonard & Braham Levy (plus more
	once our mailer came up).

	* Added 2 options; -bell and -warn "...".  By default the bell no
	longer sounds, and the warning times can be specified.  Both have
	resources of course.  From comments by Bill Leonard.

	* Updated the manual & made it clearer.

Tue Jul 30 10:29:22 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Changed the way the time is calculated.  No more fiddling with
	strings & it's much more compact.

	* Added Imakefile, sent by Andreas Stolcke (stolcke@edu.Berkeley.ICSI).
	I don't know how useful it is, our imake isn't installed.

	* Changed default font for value entry to 9x15bold in XAlarm.ad; it is
	a little more readable.
