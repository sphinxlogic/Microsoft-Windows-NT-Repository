MAKING
~~~~~~

  First get any relevant patch files so as to make the latest patch version.
  You can find out which patch level your xalarm is at by looking at the file
  patchlevel.h in the source directory, or, if you have xalarm built, by:

% xalarm -version

  See the man page for more.  Apply any patches, see the patch files themselves
  for more information.

  If you have problems with compilation or use, look at the PROBLEMS file.

    1.  If you don't want to use the Imakefile or the Makefile generated from
	it, try using Makefile.alt.

	Check the flag settings in the Makefile of your choice.  If you are
	using the Imakefile, generate a Makefile by "xmkmf".

	If you want to use a different notation or language for dates etc., see
	WEEKDAYS and related definitions in dates.h.

    2.  Try making with "make".  Answer the questions.  Have a play.

    3.  If you aren't installing (you selfish get), put the XAlarm.ad and
	XAlarm.ad+ in your ~/.xresources file.

	Otherwise, try "make install install.man".

  Look at the manual for anything else & enjoy.


BUGS
~~~~

  See the PROBLEMS file first.

  If you have any bugs, comments, suggestions, code, fixes, please let me know
  and I will make an attempt to include them.  A few ``things'' are mentioned
  in the bugs section of the manual.  Don't forget to include the xalarm
  version number ("xalarm -version" gives it you), machine/OS, 	X11 release &
  patch, WM used, etc.
