! We can't surround this by "#ifdef COLOR ... #endif" and have it in
! .../lib/X11/app-defaults/XAlarm because stuff in there is not pre-processed
! with cpp like wot xrdb does.  Now why is that...?

! If you want colour, you have to stick this in your ~/.xresources file (where
! you can surround it with #ifdefs).

#ifdef COLOR
XAlarm*background:			LightYellow
XAlarm*foreground:			IndianRed
XAlarm*Command.background:		IndianRed
XAlarm*Command.foreground:		LightYellow
#endif

! If you want a smaller button box in the alarm window, uncomment & try these
! for size in your ~/.xresources file:

!XAlarm.Alarm!.alarm.buttons.snooze1.fromVert:		quit
! This will vary depending on the button labels & font...
!XAlarm.Alarm!.alarm.buttons.snooze1.horizDistance:	-93
!XAlarm.Alarm!.alarm.buttons.snooze5.fromVert:		quit
!XAlarm.Alarm!.alarm.buttons.snooze15.fromVert:		quit
!XAlarm.Alarm!.alarm.buttons.snoozetime.fromHoriz:	snooze

! If you want the button box next to the alarm window, uncomment & try this:

!XAlarm.Alarm!.alarm.message.fromHoriz:			buttons
! This will vary depending on the button labels & font...
!XAlarm.Alarm!.alarm.message.vertDistance:		-33
