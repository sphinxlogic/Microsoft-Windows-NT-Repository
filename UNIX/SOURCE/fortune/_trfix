***********************************************************************\
The fortune database has a section of potentially offensive fortunes\
which may offend people because of references to sex, politics, or\
religion, or because they use words that some find offensive.  To get\
fortunes from this list, a user must specifically ask for them, using\
either -o or -a, so no one gets them by surprise.  Some groups don't\
even like the existence of such a section of fortunes -- to protect\
them, the section is transmitted with rot13 encryption.  You have the\
following options right now:\
\
\	(1) unencrypt the fortunes and leave them on your system.\
\	(2) leave the encrypted fortunes on the system.\
\	(3) delete the section right now, replacing it with a\
\	    statement that says the section isn't on the system.\
\
(3) is final; both (1) and (2) allow you to change your mind latter,\
but do result in the section being present on your disk.\
