You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
building.  Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out
of the building and down a gully.
%%
You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road
slopes back down the other side of the hill.  There is a
building in the distance.
%%
You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
%%
You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling
along a rocky bed.
%%
You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.
%%
You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
%%
At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a
2-inch slit in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
%%
You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set
into the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.
A dry streambed leads into the depression.
%%
You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the
surface.  A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the West.
%%
You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a
dim light at the east end of the passage.
%%
You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the
surface.  A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged
with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon leads
upward and west.  A note on the wall says:
       Magic Word "XYZZY"
%%
You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
%%
You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls
are frozen rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a
good passage exit from east and west sides of the chamber.
%%
At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.
An east passage ends here except for a small crack leading
on.
%%
You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of
sight to the west.  There are openings to either side.
Nearby, a wide stone staircase leads downward.  The hall
is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and fro
almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the staircase.
There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
%%
The crack is far too small for you to follow.
%%
You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across
the hall.  The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure
is too wide to jump.
%%
This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The
note says:
       You won't get it up the steps.
%%
You are in the hall of the mountain king, with passages
off in all directions.
%%
You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
%%
You didn't make it.
%%
The dome is unclimbable.
%%
You are at the west end of the twopit room.  There is a
large hole in the wall above the pit at this end of the
room.
%%
You are that the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit
room.  There is a small pool of oil in one corner of the
pit.
%%
You are at the bottom of the western pit in the towpit room.
There is a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
%%
You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the
top.
%%
You are on the west side of the fissure in the hall of mists.
%%
You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  The
hole goes down to an E/W passage.
%%
You are in the south side chamber.
%%
You are in the west side chamber of the hall of the
mountain king.  A passage continues west and up here.
%%
You are in a large room, with a passage to the south,
a passage to the west, and a wall of broken rock to the
east.  There is a large "Y2" on a rock in the room's 
center.
%%
You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which
extends up out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible
over 50 feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floor
of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.  Marks in the
dust around the window would seem to indicate that
someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit
from you and 25 feet away there is a similar window
looking into a lighted room.  A shadowy figure can
be seen there peering back at you.
%%
You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a
crawl.  To the west is a large passage.  Above you is
another passage.
%%
You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A
crawl leads west.
%%
You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream,
which enters and exits through tiny slits.
%%
You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a
big hole in the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and
a passage leading east.
%%
You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel
to and north of the hall of mists.
%%
You are at the west end of hall of mists.  A low wide crawl
continues west and another goes north.  To the south is a
little passage 6 feet off the floor.

%%
You have crawled through a very low wide passage paralled
to and north of the hall of mists.
%%
You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently
without side chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl
slants up.  To the north a round two foot hole slants
down.
%%
You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.
The hall joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
%%
You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low
E/W one.
%%
Dead end
%%
You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage
from the north joins a higher crawl from the east to make
a walking passage going west.  There is also a large room
above.  The air is damp here.
%%
You are in bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes
everywhere.  To explore at random select north, south, up
or down.
%%
You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  
Obvious passages go west, east, ne, and nw.  Part of the
room is occupied by a large bedrock block.
%%
You are at the east end of the twopit room.  The floor
here is littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy
to descend the pits.  There is a path here bypassing
the pits to connect passages from east and west.
There are holes all over, but the only bit one is on
the wall directly over the west pit where you can't
get at it.
%%
You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is
an immense slab fallen from the ceiling (slab room).
East and west there once were large passages, but they
are now filled with boulders.  Low small passages go
north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
around the boulders.
%%
You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.
%%
You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
%%
You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons,
bearing north, south and se.  The north one is as tall as
the other two combined.
%%
You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, se, and sw.
%%
Dead end crawl.
%%
You are in a secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses
over a very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you
may not be able to get back up.
%%
You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
%%
The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
%%
You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3
feet north and seems to open up.
%%
The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.

The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter
sewer pipes.  It would be advisable to use the exit.

You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight
to the west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which
you can see a profusion of leaves,
%%
There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave
the pit.
%%
You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
%%
You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.
You could climb down here, but you would not be able to
climb up.  There is a passage leading back to the north.
%%
You are in the giant room.  The ceiling is too high up
for your lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east,
north, and south.  On the west wall is scrawled the
inscription:
              "Fee Fie Foe Foo"       {sic}
%%
The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
%%
You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
%%
You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream,
which cascades over a sparkling waterfall into a
roaring whirlpool which disappears through a hole in
the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
%%
You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered with
heavy curtains, the floor with a thick pile carpet.
Moss covers the ceiling.
%%
This is the oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings
cover the walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward
to the north, another passage leads se, and a hands and
knees crawl leads west.
%%
You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a
large cavern.  Far below, through a heavy white mist,
strange splashing noises can be heard.  The mist rises up
through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path exits to the
south and west.
%%
You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen
after a short distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads
east.  It looks like a very tight squeeze.  An eerie
light can be seen at the other end.
%%
You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An
extremely narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor
leads ne.
%%
You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the
only exit.
%%
You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued
up and east from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The
air smells of sea water.
%%
You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.
The floor and walls are littered with bits of shells
imbedded in the stone.  A shallow passage proceeds
downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads up.  A low
hands and knees passage enters from the south.
%%
You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
%%
You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
%%
You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the
east.  Small passages go west and up.  The remnants of
recent digging are evident.  A sign in midair here says:
       "Cave under construction beyond this point."
              "Proceed at your own risk."
             "Witt construction company"
%%
You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
%%
You are at Witt's end.  Passages lead off in ALL directions.
%%
You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The
floor is covered by white mist seeping in from the north.
The walls extend upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended
from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-
sided mirror is hanging paralled to and midway between
the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are
extremely vain.)  A small window can be seen in either
wall, some fifty feet up.
%%
You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which
extends up out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible
over 50 feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floor
of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.  Marks in the
dust around the window would seem to indicate that
someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit
from you and 25 feet away there is a similar window
looking into a lighted room.  A shadowy figure can be seen
there peering back at you.
%%
A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches
the floor below.  You could climb down it, and jump from
it to the floor, but having done so you would be unable to
reach it to climb back up.
%%
You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
%%
You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An
opaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises
rapidly upward.  The lake is fed by a stream which tumbles
out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and
splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist.
The only passage goes back toward the south.
%%
Dead end.
%%
You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even
larger than the giant room.  It appears to be a repository
for the "adventure" program.  Massive torches far overhead
bathe the room with smoky yellow light.  Scattered about
you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a
nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of
oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their
ends, and a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side
a great many Dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring
loudly.  A sign nearby reads:
        "Do NOT disturb the Dwarves!"
An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and
stretches to the other end of the room, where various
other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
%%
You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one
side is a pit full of fierce green snakes.  On the other
side is a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains
a little sulking bird.  In one corner is a bundle of
black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A large
number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.
A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your
feet is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign
which reads:
     "Treasure vault.  Keys in main office."
%%
You are on one side of a large deep chasm.  A heavy white
mist rising up from below obscures all view of the far
side.  A sw path leads away from the chasm into a winding
corridor.
%%
You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight
in both directions.
%%
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
%%
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
%%
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
%%
You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads away
from the chasm on this side.
%%
You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise
can be heard in the distance.
%%
The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull
rumbling seems to get louder in that direction.  The right
fork leads southeast down a gentle slope.  The main
corridor enters from the west.
%%
The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard
a steady roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be
trembling.  Another passage leads south, and a low crawl
goes east.
%%
You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below
you is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten
lava come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.
The glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern
with a blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie,
macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls
are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano
drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof
far overhead are myriad formations composed of pure
white alabaster, which scatter their murky light into
sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a
deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured
rock which seems to have been crafted by the Devil
Himself.  An immense river of fire crashes out from
the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your
left.  To the right, an immense geyser of blistering
steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the
center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.
The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the
already hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits
to the south.
%%
You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.
The walls are very warm, causing the air in the room
to be almost stifling from the heat.  The only exit
is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
a low rumbling.
%%
You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage
lined with oddly shaped limestone formations.
%%
You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren
room.  A sign posted above the entrance reads:
       "Caution!  Bear in room!"
%%
You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room
is completely empty except for some dust.  Marks in
the dust lead away toward the far end of the room.
The only exit is the way you came in.

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
have to enter "Northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "North".
(Should you get stuck, type "help" for some general hints.

%%
A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
%%
A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
%%
There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
%%
One sharp, nasty knife is thrown at you!
%%
None of them hit you!
%%
One of them gets you!
%%
A hollow voice says "Plugh".
%%
There is no way to go that direction.
%%
I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby
objects.
%%
I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points ore name something
in the general direction you want to go.
%%
I don't know how to apply that word here.
%%
I don't understand that!
%%
I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
%%
Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
long description of your location.
%%
It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a
pit.
%%
Are you trying to catch the bird?
%%
The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
%%
Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
%%
You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
resources right now.
%%
Do you really want to quit now?
%%
You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
%%
You can't be serious!
%%
The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
disturbed and you cannot catch it.
%%
You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
%%
There is nothing here with a lock!
%%
You aren't carrying it!
%%
The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
drives the snake away.
%%
You have no keys!
%%
It has no lock.
%%
I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
%%
It was already locked.
%%
The grate is now locked.
%%
The grate is now unlocked.
%%
It was already unlocked.
%%
You have no source of light.
%%
Your lamp is now on.
%%
Your lamp is now off.
%%
There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain,_ which is
probably just as well.
%%
Nothing happens.
%%
Where?
%%
There is nothing here to attack.
%%
The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
%%
Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
%%
You killed a little dwarf.
%%
You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
%%
With what? Your bare hands?
%%
Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
%%
I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up
or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden
in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the
action words I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object
and action words (In either order), but sometimes I can infer the
object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
distances with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets
you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the
south.  Good luck!
%%
You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
main passage.
%%
I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
the surface for very long.  I would try the stream.
%%
I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
%%
The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
looking elsewhere for the keys.
%%
The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of
undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
spruce and berry bushes.
%%
Welcome to adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
%%
Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
progress is unlikely.
%%
Blasting requires dynamite.
%%
I'm as confused as you are.
%%
Mist is a white vapor, usually water.  Seen from time to time in
caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
pit leading down to water.
%%
Your feet are now wet.
%%
I think I just lost my appetite.
%%
Thank you.  It was delicious!
%%
You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
%%
The bottle of water is now empty.
%%
Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
nothing exciting happens.
%%
Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
%%
Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
%%
Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
to try to reincarnate you?
%%
All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
                    --- POOF !! ---
You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and
gasping, you emerge from the smoke and find...
%%
You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
%%
Okay, now where did i put my orange smoke? 

                 ... > POOF! <

Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
%%
Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
%%
Okay, If you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
%%
Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
%%
You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
%%
You can't go through a locked steel grate!
%%
I believe what you want is right here with you.
%%
You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
%%
I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
%%
There is no way across the fissure.
%%
You're not carrying anything.
%%
You are currently holding the following:
%%
It's not hungry (It's merely pinin' for the Fjords).  Besides You have
no bird seed.
%%
The snake has now devoured your bird.
%%
There's nothing here it wants to eat (Except perhaps you).
%%
You fool, Dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him REALLY mad !!
%%
You have nothing in which to carry it.
%%
Your bottle is already full.
%%
There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
%%
Your bottle is now full of water.
%%
Your bottle is now full of oil.
%%
You can't fill that.
%%
Don't be ridiculous!
%%
The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
%%
The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks:
"Water?".
%%
The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
%%
The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
although it requires some effort.
%%
The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
%%
The Dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
%%
Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
You'd best take inventory and drop something.
%%
You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
%%
You can't fit this five foot oyster through that little passage!
%%
I advise you to put down the clam before opening it. >STRAIN!<
%%
I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >WRENCH!<
%%
You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
%%
You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
%%
A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
%%
The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
promptly snaps shut again.
%%
You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
%%
There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind
you.
%%
Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har"
he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
chest deep in the maze!".  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
the gloom.
%%
A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave says: "Cave closing
soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office."
%%
A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces: "This exit
is closed.  Please leave via main office."
%%
It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
%%
The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
smoke). . . .
%%
There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in
the far wall, burying the Dwarves in the rubble.  You march
through the hole and find yourself in the main office, where
a cheering band of friendly elves carry the conquering
adventurer off into the sunset.
%%
There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including
you!!
%%
There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
walls of the room.
%%
The resulting ruckus has awakened the Dwarves.  There are now several
threatening little Dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
knives at you!  All of them get you!
%%
Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
%%
I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
%%
You can't get there from here.
%%
You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
%%
If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend you
adventure such that you can continue later say "suspend" (or "pause"
or "save").  To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full
credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,
though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points
for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you
more.  There are also points based on how much (If any) of the cave
you've managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just
for getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the
pack), and there are other ways to determine whether you've been
through some of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've
found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing
interesting happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something
interesting DOES happen, it means you're getting a bonus and have an
opportunity to garner many more points in the master's section.  I may
occasionally offer hints in you seem to be having trouble.  If I do,
I'll warn you in advance how much it will affect your score to accept
the hints.  Finally, to save paper, you may specify "brief", which
tells me never to repeat the full description of a place unless you
explicitly ask me to.
%%
Do you indeed wish to quit now?
%%
There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
%%
The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
%%
It is beyond your power to do that.
%%
I don't know how.
%%
It is too far up for you to reach.
%%
You killed a little Dwarf.  The body vanished in a cloud of greasy
black smoke.
%%
The shell is very strong and impervious to attack.
%%
What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
%%
The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
%%
The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
%%
The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
%%
Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
%%
The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough.".
%%
The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
%%
The troll refuses to let you cross.
%%
There is no longer any way across the chasm.
%%
Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
stumble back and fall into the chasm.
%%
The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
scurries away.  The bear soon gives up pursuit and wanders back.
%%
The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get
at it.
%%
With what?  Your bare hands?  Agains HIS bear hands??
%%
The bear is confused;  he only wants to be your friend.
%%
For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
%%
The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm
down considerably, and even becomes rather friendly.
%%
The bear is still chained to the wall.
%%
The chain is still locked.
%%
The chain is now unlocked.
%%
The chain is now locked.
%%
There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
%%
There is nothing here to eat.
%%
Do you want the hint?
%%
Do you need help getting out of the maze?
%%
You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
%%
Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?
%%
There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
useful in descovering the secret.
%%
Do you need help getting out of here?
%%
Don't go west.
%%
Gluttony is not one of the Troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
%%
Your lamp is getting dim.. You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
%%
Your lamp has run out of power.
%%
There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.
%%
There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded
pirate.  He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!"  he
cries, "I've been spotted!  I'd best hide meself off to the maze and
hide me chest!".  With that, he vanished into the gloom.
%%
Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.
%%
Your lamp is getting dim.. I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
batteries.
%%
Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd
best start wrapping this up.
%%
I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.
%%
"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
%%
Hmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
%%
It says, "There is something strange about this place, such that one
of the words I've always known now has a new effect."
%%
It says the same thing it did before.
%%
I'm afraid I don't understand.
%%
"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
%%
You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
myriad tiny fragments.
%%
You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
%%
You prod the nearest Dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
%%
Is this acceptable?
%%
There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
