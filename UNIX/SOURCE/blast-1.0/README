What is Blast?

Blast is simple program that lets you blast holes any window in X
using mouse button 1. Mouse button 2 repairs blasted windows and
mouse button 3 exits the program. Holes become permanent unless 
you repair them before you quit. You may move permanently "damaged"
windows and enjoy the view behind the holes.


Building Blast

Edit the Imakefile. Set CCOPTIONS to use the appropriate 
platform/architecture. Then type xmkmf to generate a new
Makefile. Type: make blast to build the blast program.

This program was tested on Sparc IPC, Silicon Graphics IRIS,
386s running SCO Unix, and DECstations running Ultrix.


Technical Details

Blast uses the X Window Shape Extension library. If you are 
building this on a Sun 4, you may also enable the shooting sound
effect.

You may have the program repair all holes by default when you
quit by setting REPAIR_EVERYTHING_IN_SIGHT.

The program is not overly sophisticated. It was written as an
exercise in using X Shape Extension. Hopefully, it will 
educational for others as well.


Any suggestion for future enhancements is welcome. I'd like most
to incorporate sound effects for machines other the Sun. If
somebody can give me a hint on where to start, I'd be most grateful.

Enjoy.
