XBoard is an X11/Xt/Athena Widgets chessboard that can serve as a user
interface for GNU Chess or for the Internet Chess Server, or can be
used to play out games manually or from game files.  See the manual
page xboard.man for further details.

XBoard was originally written by Dan Sears and Chris Sears.  XBoard
borrows its colors, icons and piece bitmaps from XChess, which was
written and copyrighted by Wayne Christopher.  We thank him for his
work on XChess.  Beginning with version 2.0, Tim Mann has taken over
development of XBoard.

Report bugs to Tim Mann <mann@src.dec.com>, with a carbon copy to
Stuart Cracraft <cracraft@rice-chex.ai.mit.edu>.  If you improve
XBoard, please send your changes to Tim and Stuart.

CAVEATS

XBoard depends on the Xt Intrinsics and Athena Widget Set of X11R4 or
later.  In particular, X11R3 just won't do.  At this writing, the
standard DEC and SUN releases won't do either.  The Athena widgets are
either missing in the DEC standard distribution or in the wrong (R3)
place in SUN OpenWindows.

XBoard works best with version 4.0 of GNU Chess.  Older versions may
also work, but they are unsupported.  The GNU Chess project requests
that you get a current copy of GNU Chess rather than using older,
bug-ridden versions.  GNU Chess must be compiled with the -DXBOARD
flag for use with XBoard.  Use the "make gnuchessx" target in GNU
Chess 4.0 to do this.

The Free Software Foundation would prefer to be able to distribute an
X chessboard program covered only by the GNU General Public License
and unencumbered by any other copyright.  If you can help with this,
please contact the FSF.
