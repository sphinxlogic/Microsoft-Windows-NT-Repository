# To install xboard on your system, you will need to generate a properly
# customized Makefile for it, probably using imake, a program that comes
# with the X Window System.  
#
# Before you do this, you may need to edit the Imakefile.  xboard has
# special code for certain systems that is enabled or disabled by ifdefs
# in xboard.c.  A few systems do not automatically define a symbol that 
# can be used to select the right ifdef, so you have to define it yourself
# in the Imakefile.  Here is a list of ifdef symbols used in xboard.  To
# add one of these, for example FOO, to your Imakefile, add the string -DFOO
# to the end of the DEFINES line, separated by a space from what's already
# there.
#
# IRIX			-- Silicon Graphics IRIX.
# IRIS			-- Old version of Silicon Graphics Iris code; try
#			     IRIX first.
# AIXV3			-- IBM AIX, version 3.
# IBMRTAIX		-- AIX for the IBM RT.  I don't know how this
#			     differs from AIXV3.  Use what works for you.
# ESIX			-- The ESIX operating system.
# SYSTEM_FIVE		-- Unix System V.
# SYSV			-- Unix System V.
# SVR4			-- Unix System V, release 4.
# HPUX or hpux		-- Hewlett-Packard HPUX.
# UNIPLUS		-- Uniplus Unix.
# sun			-- SUN Microsystems.
# RTU			-- I don't know what this is for!
# __STDC__		-- Automatically defined by ANSI C compilers.
# ATTENTION		-- Define this if your version of gnuchess
#			     requires you to get its attention by
#			     hitting ^C when you want to move while it
#			     is thinking on your time.
# HAS_GETTIMEOFDAY	-- Remove this if you don't have the getttimeofday()
#			     system call.
# 
# After editing the Imakefile, you should be able to generate a correct
# Makefile by typing the command "xmkmf" in the xboard source directory.
# This command is supposed to run imake with the right flags for your
# site.  If you get "Command not found," make sure the directory
# containing xmkmf is on your search path.  (It is /usr/local/X11/bin on
# many systems.)  If xmkmf doesn't work, you can try the following
# command, editing the pathnames first if the X release is installed in
# a different place on your system:

/usr/local/X11/mit/config/imake \
        -I/usr/local/X11/mit/config \
        -DTOPDIR=/usr/local/X11/mit

# Once you have a working Makefile, if you need to make further changes
# to the Imakefile, you can use the command "make Makefile" to update
# the Makefile after you edit the Imakefile.
