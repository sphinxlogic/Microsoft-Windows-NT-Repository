These are the GNU text file (actually, file contents) processing
utilities.  Most of these programs have significant advantages over
their Unix counterparts, such as greater speed, additional options,
and fewer arbitrary limits.

The programs that can be built with this package are: cat, cksum, comm,
csplit, cut, expand, fold, head, join, nl, od paste, pr, sort, split,
sum, tac, tail, tr, unexpand, uniq, and wc.

The cmp program has moved to the GNU diff distribution.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

If you are using a version of the Linux libc that predates 4.4.1,
you should get a newer version.  The old libraries contain getopt
functions that are incompatible with several of these utilities.  For
instance, when built with the obsolete getopt functions, `tail +10' and
`uniq +3' will give usage errors instead of the expected results.

There is a known bug in the pr program.  It doesn't work properly when
the first character in an input file is a form feed.

The textutils are intended to be POSIX.2 compliant (with BSD and other
extensions), like the rest of the GNU system.  They are almost there,
but a few incompatibilities remain.

The comprehensive Texinfo documentation for these programs is not
finished yet, and needs to be rewritten.  In the interim, the skeletal
man pages provided with this distribution will have to serve.

These programs all recognize the `--version' option.  When reporting
bugs, please include in the subject line both the package name/version
and the name of the program for which you found a problem.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for these programs to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.
