This directory contains source and objects for groff, the GNU roff
package

Author:		Free Software Foundation
Prerequisites:	C++ for compilation
Documentation:	man pages, hardcopy documentation
Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		Groff offers a number of advantages over the System V
		standard troff. In particular, groff supports a wide
		range of output devices, in particular PostScript,
		whereas troff supports only an obscure
		phototypesetter.

Platform:	Consensys UNIX System V.4.2.1
Revision:	1.08
Date ported:	21 January 1994
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.5.6

Modifications:

0. Run configure. It deduces -prefix=/opt! But it doesn't handle
   CFLAGS. Oh well, this is all in C++, and debugging symbols don't
   work anyway. Modify the Makefile.

1. libgroff/font.cc fails to compile with undefined M_PI. Turns out
   that this is another game played by the system header files, this
   time math.h: these constants are only defined if __STDC__ is set to
   0. Modify header files.

2. libgroff/new.cc fails to compile, dying in sys/stat.h. This file
   was using old-style prototypes. Fix header file.

3. Install was not installing all tmac files. Fix Makefile.sub.
