Changes for version 1.4:

 - added 'maxWindows' resource to limit damage done by 'xless *' (suggested
   by Markus Koch <raistlin@uni-paderborn.de>)
 - cleaned up help window (suggested by Len Makin <len@mel.dit.csiro.au>)
 - cleaned up manual page
 - massive source code reformatting
 - all buffers should be dynamically allocated now
 - tried to eliminate as much code duplication as practical
 - tilde expansion performed on file names (suggested by Michael J. Thibodeau
   <mike@ra.cs.umb.edu>)
 - icon & title name are now set to 'xless:filename'
 - title line is gone because titlebar name should now be correct
 - '?' is an accelerator for the [Help] button, 'Q' is an accelerator for the
   [Close window] button and 'Meta-Q' is an accelerator for the [Quit] button
   (if present)
 - you are now prompted if you try to [Quit] and there is more than one window
 - popup boxes are now created when they're needed and (most of them)
   are only created once
 - all windows are now created equal; there's no main window anymore
 - added 'quitButton' resource for those who would like something like the
   old behavior
 - [Editor] and [Reload] buttons are now re-sensitized if user starts with
   a file from STDIN, then changes to another file
 - Add 'textGeometry' resource (suggested by Tom Bannon
   <bannon@eyebeam.csc.ti.com>)
 - Set window manager size hints
 - Change default textFont to Courier 12; variable-width fonts screw up
   geometry guess
 - Add 'namePrefix' resource which adds 'xless:' (or whatever) to the
   front of all icon names and window titles
 - Add 'removePath' resource which, if true, truncates the path name to
   just the last element so names are somewhat more readable
 - Add 'sizeToFit' resource which, if true, make the window only as large
   as it needs to be (handy for lists or short files)
 - The button colors were quieted down a bit

Changes for version 1.3:

 - icon name now changed when file is changed
 - added code for "help" action from Fred Gilham <gilham@csl.sri.com>
 - merged in interface cleanups from Fred Gilham
 - added code to filter out ^H_ left by 'man' underlining (from Fred Gilham,
   but simplified by me, so bugs are probably my fault)

Changes for version 1.2:

 - fixed R4 scrolling problem reported by Karsten Gaier
   <gaier@nova.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>
 - added resource file files from Rainer Klute
   <klute@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>
 - added print button code from Andrew Bacon <andy@mcsds3.mcs.loral.com>
   (but I hacked on it, so any bugs are undoubtedly mine)
 - ANSIfied some stuff

Changes for version 1.1:

 - fixed things to work under R5
 - added 'editorDoesWindows' which can be set if your editor is X-savvy
   enough to come up in its own window
 - added a 'quit()' action
 - created XLess.ad, which incorporates the previous .Xresources with
   a bunch of keyboard bindings to make xless behave more like less
