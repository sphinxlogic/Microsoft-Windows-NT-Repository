   (as specified in EDITOR env. var.)
 - Reload the current file.
 - Change file in the current window.

INSTALLATION:
 Check the Imakefile to see if you need to add or change any DEFINES,
 then do the usual 'xmkmf', etc.

CAVEAT:
 The color resources are stored in the global app-defaults directory in
 a file named 'XLess-color'.  If you have a color display and are running at
 least X11R5, you may want to add a line like this to your personal
 resources file:

	#ifdef COLOR
	*customization: -color
	#endif

 Versions of X earlier than X11R5 don't support the `customization' resource.
 If you're on one of those, you'll have to include the color resources in your
 personal resources file.
