kaleid for LINUX
----------------

Adapted by Laurent JULLIARD (laurentj@hpgnse2.grenoble.hp.com)

kaleid has been compiled with gcc2.11c and the shared libraries of
X11v1.0. You will need this library to run kaleid. I you have any other
version of X11 then simply recompile kaleid with :

gcc -c -DLINUX -O kaleid.c
gcc -o kaleid kaleid.o -lX11

Should you have any trouble please let me know.
