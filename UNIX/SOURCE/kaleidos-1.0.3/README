Kaleid produces a colorful kaleidoscope display in an X11 window -- it
was ported from an MS-DOS program written for the EGA/VGA display.

For connoisseurs of window managers, this program does two interesting
things: 1) it creates and maintains a window icon, and 2) it observes
window manager sizing hints for its window icon.

To make on systems of SYSV descent (such as hp-ux):
