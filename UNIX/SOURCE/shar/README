I have received quite a number of postings recently that weren't in "shar"
format.  Some of them (man pages, etc.) are quite at risk for being munched
if they aren't shar'ed or if the shar program used doesn't insert a protective
character in front of a line; also, it can be difficult to detect some
transmission errors.

This is my "shar" program.  It can split shars into multiple files automatically
based on size; it does overwrite protection; and it does a character count on
the transmitted files to catch transmission errors.

Please -- use this or some other *good* shar program (K&P "bundle" won't do,
not in these days of non-UNIX machines on the net) to pack your submissions
to comp.sources.misc.  Or to any other source group, for that matter.  If you
don't, you're the one who loses.

(This is shar'ed with mkshar, by the way.)
