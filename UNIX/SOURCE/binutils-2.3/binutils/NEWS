Changes since binutils 2.2

* A new --stabs argument has been added to objdump to dump stabs
  sections in ELF and COFF files.

* A new program, nlmconv, has been added.  It can convert object files
  into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.

* The strings program has been added.

* The BFD library now defaults to a minimal configuration, including
  only the targets requested (plus some required to make gdb or other
  programs link correctly).  If you want more than the default
  formats, the --with-targets=... option may be of use.  See the
  documentation in the bfd directory for specifics.

Changes since binutils 2.1

* The 'copy' program has been renamed to 'objcopy', for
  consistency with 'objdump', and because 'copy' might more
  plausibly be used as a synonym for 'cp'.

* The new stand-alone program c++filt is a filter that converts encoded
  (mangled) C++ assembly-level identifiers to user-level names.
  (Note:  This may get moved to the gcc distribution.)

* nm -o on an archive now prefixes each line with the archive name,
  matching the output from BSD nm.

* ar (and ld) can now read (but not write) BSD4.4-style archives.

* New support for H8500, Z8000, and the Hitach SH.

* Dis-assembler interface changed to allow sharing with gdb.

* There is new Elf code, but it is not yet ready for general use.

* There is the beginnings of a test suite.

Changes since binutils 2.0

* There is now support for writing ECOFF files, so ld and the
  other utilities should work on Risc/Ultrix and Irix.
  Please let us know how well this works.

* ar now automatically creates a symbol table (a __.SYMDEF member,
  in the BSD version), if there are any object files in the archive.
  So running ranlib is now redundant (unless the non-standard q
  command is used).  This is required for Posix.2 conformance.

* The archive-reading code now reads both BSD-style and SYSV-style archives
  independently of the selected target format.  This is to encourage
  people to switch to SYSV-format, which has a number of advantages.

* The strip and copy programs now have options to remove debug-symbols
  only and/or local symbols only.  They now also support long options.
