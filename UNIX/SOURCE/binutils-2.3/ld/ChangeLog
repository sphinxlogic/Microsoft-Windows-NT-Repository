Sat Feb 15 13:59:54 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	Major rewrite of how ld is configured.  The major idea
	is to use shell scripts to generate everything.
	* generic.em replaces ldtemplate.
	* Other *.em files replace various *.c files.
	A *.em file is a shell script that generates the corresponding
	ld__*.c file that implements an emulation.  This is usually
	a straight 'cat' of a here-document, possibly with substitutions.
	* Script files (*.sc) are places by *.sc-sh scripts.
	Again, these are simple shell scripts that 'cat'
	here-documents, usually with some substitutions.
	The output a *.sc-sh is a script file.
	* Each emulation is defined by a short shell script with
	extension *.sh that specifies the emulation-specific
	parameters (such as the name of the *.sh-sc and *.em
	files to use).
	* genscript.sh is the master shell script used to generate
	an emulation.  It is passed various argument, including
	the name a the emulation-speciic *.sh file that it
	"sources" to set variables to emulation-specifc parameters.
	* config/mt-foo:  Changed EMUL=GLDFOO_EMULATION_NAME
	to EMUL=foo. (The GLDFOO_EMULATION_NAMEs have bee removed.)
	* config/mh-foo:  Rename LDEMULATION names as appropriate
	(usually 'gldfoo' -> plain 'foo').
	* ldwrite.c:  Fixed a typo in a comment.
	* Makefile.in:  Major changes.  Removed some the sed
	magic to converts scripts, since that is now handled
	by genscripts.sh and the *.sc-sh scipt generators.
	* config.h:  Remove a bunch of macros defining emulations
	and targets.  This becomes one less file to edit when
	adding emulations or targets.
	* ldemul.h (struct ld_emulation_xfer_struct):  Add
	emulation_name and target_name fields.
	* ldemul.c, ldemul.h:  Define some default functions used
	by most emulations (and remove from the *.em scripts).
	* ldemul.c (ldemul_choose_target):  Search the new
	ld_emulations array using a loop (instead of a hardwired
	nested if statement).
	Define the ld_emulation from the automatically-geenrated
	ldemul-list.h.  This means you no longer have to edit ldemul.c
	to add a new emulation.
	* ldmain.c:  Replace {GLD,LNK}960_EMULATION_NAME by
	their expansions, since the former no longer exist.
	* PORTING:  A very rough first draft of a porting guide.

	* ldgram.y, ldlex.l, lexsup.c: Changes to allow an assignment
	to be terminated by a new-line (instead of requiring a semicolon).

Mon Feb 10 16:21:02 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* ldexp.c, ldlang.c: added new idea "abs_output_section", removes
	tests for NULL pointers all over the place.
	* ldlang.c (lang_process): remember to relocate global symbols
	*after* relaxing has done it stuff.

Thu Feb  6 11:40:15 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* config/mt-coff-h8300: use EMUL like everything else
	* ldlang.c: (print_padding_statement): print the right address.
	* Makefile.in, config.h, ldemul.c: renamed  h8300hds to h8300hms
	

Tue Feb  4 15:28:01 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* ldlex.l: Put pack -noinhibit-exec and -sort-common
	* ldlang.c (print_data_statement): print the right address.

Thu Jan 30 17:51:53 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  The rule for testing ld by re-linking itself
	via an intermediate -r link was moved to the ld1 rule
	instead of the ld2 rule.  This allows ld2 and ld3 to be identical,
	which allows the bootstrap rule to work.
	* ldctor.c (find_constructors):  Don't create a constructor
	list if it is already defined (as would happen if ld is
	invoked by collect).

Wed Jan 29 08:35:39 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* config/mh-sparc.h: now uses libgcc.a
	* ldmain.c: quit using exit
	* *sc: use *(COMMON) rather than [COMMON]
	* ldlex.l, lexsup.c: much thinking moved from .l and put into .c,
	to allow preprocessing of .l file.
	* Makefile.in: New ldlex.l mangling
	* ldexp.c (fold_binary): perform expressions with % and / in
	integer.
	* ldfile.c (open_a): open archives on VMS in a special way


Tue Jan 28 10:18:16 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* ldgram.y: map -M behave in the same way as -Map (sets file name
	to be "-".
	* ldsym.c, ldlang.c: remember that size of a section is dependent on
	whether or not relaxing has been done.
	* ldmain.c: don't open a map file if it doesn't have a name
	* relax.c: all the brains have moved into bfd.
	* ldwrite.c: ammend comment

Fri Jan 24 14:23:46 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added relax, also made three stage go through a
	partial link stage.
	* relax.c : added
	* config.h: if GNU960 defined, then default emulation mode is
	GLD960
	* ldexp.h, ldexp.c: map to file hooks
	* ldlang.c: map to file hooks
	* ldgram.y: added -Map -relax
	* ldlex.l: added -relax, -Map
	* ldmain.c: open map file
	* ldmisc.c: support for map file
	* ldwrite.c: new relax magic

Thu Dec 19 18:49:51 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, config/tm-*.h:  Clean up make output, only
	pass DEFAULT_EMULATION to ldmain.c.

Wed Dec 18 15:02:47 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldver.c:  Bump to version 1.94.

Tue Dec 10 04:07:23 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: infodir belongs in datadir.

Mon Dec  9 16:26:43 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Pass -y to bison.  (Again;
	accidentally deleted by Rich.)
	* news.sc, ldgld68k.sc:  Define __end as well as _end.

Sat Dec  7 17:19:26 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* ldindr.h: added to contain prototypes of ldindr.c
	* ldfile.c: include ctype.h
	* ldmain.c: include the requried prototype headers
	* ldwrite.c: get_reloc_upper_bound has been renamed
	bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound 

Fri Dec  6 23:29:26 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: punt "fundamental" mode because it breaks my emacs
	  macros.  install using INSTALL_PROGRAM and INSTALL_DATA.  remove
	  spaces following hyphens, bsd make can't cope.  added
	  standards.text support and made it look like all the other
	  makefiles.

	* configure.in: configure now runs entirely in objdir so make file
	  existence checks against ${srcdir}.  Mark this directory as
	  target dependent.

Thu Dec  5 22:46:16 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: idestdir and ddestdir go away.  Added copyrights
	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.

Wed Dec  4 23:36:55 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldver.c:  Bumped version to 1.93.
	* Makefile.in:  Pass -y to bison.

Mon Nov 25 18:28:40 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at cygnus.com)

	* config.h: h8 is now coff, not ieee
	* h8300hds.sc: reflect the same

Thu Nov 14 19:55:09 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldver.c (ldversion()):  Update to 1.92.
	* ldctor.c: There are two places constructor sets
	can be defined.  One of them checked for an existing
	duplicate, the other didn't.  Unfortunately, the latter
	was called after the former ...
	So, factor out code for inserting a new element into
	constructor_name_list (after checking for a duplicate)
	into a new function add_constructor_name, and call
	it from both aforementioned places (ldlang_add_constructor
	and ldlang_check_for_constructors).

Wed Nov 13 15:17:43 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Rename .c files generated from ldtemplate
	to have names starting with ld__.  This helps 'make clean'.	

Tue Nov 12 18:36:50 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Take out the version number for install
	* m88kbcs.sc: put in contructor blocks.

Mon Nov 11 18:47:33 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldmisc.c, ldmisc.h:  Re-write info() to take a filename
	parameter, a format, and an arg pointer, and rename it to
	vfinfo().  Write info() in terms of new vfinfo().
	New einfo() is the same as info(), except it writes to stderr.
	* ldemul.c, ldexp.c, ldlang.c, ldlnk960.c, ldmain.c, ldwrite.c,
	ldmisc.c:  Replace "error" calls to info() by new einfo().

Mon Nov 11 09:57:32 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygnus.com)

	* ldlex.l ldgram.y: made -V option do same as -v
	* Makefile.in: Added $(MINUS_G) flag so debugging can be
	turned off

Sun Nov  3 16:37:37 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygnus.com)
	 i386 aout changes from Bob Kukura
	* Makefile.in, config.h: added i386aout support
	* configure.in: fixed /h-{myhost} typo
	* ldgram.y: -MM now gives more boring map.
	* ldlang.c: now does D_PAGED flag the right way.
	* ldsym.c: -MM flags does the right thing.

Sun Nov  3 15:00:03 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Fixed typo.  Also, a fix for hp300bsd.
	* ldlang.c (init_os):  Compensate for BFD change,
	where bfd_make_section now returns NULL for a duplicate
	section request, instead of the old section.

Thu Oct 17 15:27:13 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldver.c: Bump to version 1.91 (consistent with binutils).

Wed Oct 16 12:27:08 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, config.h, ld.h, ldemul.c, ldexp.c, ldexp.h,
	ldgram.y, ldlex.l, ldlnk960.c, ldmain.c, ldmisc.c, ldmisc.h,
	ldsym.c, ldsym.h, ldtemplate, ldvanilla.c, ldver.c, ldver.h,
	ldwarn.c, ldwarn.h, ldwrite.c, ldwrite.h, mkscript.c:
	Add or update copyright notices.	

Mon Oct 14 23:55:27 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* README: New file.
	* Makefile.in:  Changed installation directory name scheme
	to be consistent with gcc.  Also changed 'install'.

Mon Oct 14 17:30:02 1991  Roland H. Pesch  (pesch at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: new targets ld.mm, ld.me

Mon Oct 14 17:27:24 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, ldtemplate:  Need to use separate scripts
	for -n and -N options.  Yet more complication.

Fri Oct 11 22:40:46 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Avoid using $< in explicit Make rules (it doesn't
	work).  Add some lines to avoid Sun Make VPATH bugs.

Fri Oct 11 16:42:22 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* news.sc: Add alignment for data segment.
	* ldtemplate: Add (yet another) script to get for -n or -N
	options.  (These need different alignment than ZMAGIC files.)
	* Makefile.in:  Add stuff for new foo.xn scripts.
	These are generated by replacing "ALIGN(0x...00)" by ".".

Fri Oct 11 15:43:04 1991  Roland H. Pesch  (pesch at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: new targets ld.ms, ld-index.ms
	ld.texinfo: remove tabs, other cleanups for texi2roff

Fri Oct 11 13:51:54 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldmain.c (main): Make config.magic_demand_paged be true
	by default.  Don't the WP_TEXT and D_PAGED flags of
	output_bfd here; it's too late, so set it when output_bfd
	is created (in ldlang.c).  Also fix setting of EXEC_P flag
	* ldlang.c (ldlang_open_output):  Set output_bfd->flags here.
	* ldlang.c: Remove some duplicate extern declarations.
	* ldgram.y: Fixes to -N and -n options.
	* Makefile.in:  Recognize upper case letters in sed script
	to remove assignments from script files.
	* ldtemplate:  Don't assukme that -N or -n options
	imply use of -r script.
	* mkscript.c:  Tweaking to correctly handle \n and \\ in input.

Fri Oct 11 10:29:27 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygnus.com)

	* ldtemplate: include bfd.h before sysdep.h.

Fri Oct 11 04:24:45 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	Restructure configuration scheme for bfd, binutils, ld.

	* include/sys/h-*.h:  Move to bfd/hosts/h-*.h.
	* configure.in:  Revise to symlink sysdep.h to ../bfd/hosts/h-xxx.h.
	Change some config names to match other dirs.
	* *.c:  Include bfd.h before sysdep.h, so ansidecl and PROTO()
	get defined first.
	* config/:  Rename some config files to match up h-*.h names.
	Remove all the HOST_SYS definitions from the config files.

Tue Oct  8 16:00:57 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldexp.h, ldlang.h: Change enum boolean -> enum bfd_boolean.
	* ldtemplate: Remove ldfile_add_library_path calls;
	just use the SEARCH_DIR commands in the script files.
	* Makefile.in: Add LIB_PATH macro, which if set is used to replace
	the SEARCH_DIR commands in the scripts (using ugly sed magic).
	This is primarily intended for cross-linking, where you would
	place libaries in a different place than native libraries.
	Also, emulations made from ldtemplate now use $(srcdir).
	* ldglda29k.sc:  Change SEARCH_DIR commands to a conventional
	form; people can use the Makefile's LIB_PATH to override.

Tue Oct  8 14:51:21 1991  Roland H. Pesch  (pesch at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: fix target ld.dvi, add target ld.info
	ld.texinfo: make info filename ld.info

Fri Oct  4 21:51:58 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Avoid using $< in non-suffix rules (breaks on Sun
	Make). 
	* ldfile.c, ldlang.c, ldmain.c, ldwrite.c:  Cope with renames of a
	few BFD types & enums.
