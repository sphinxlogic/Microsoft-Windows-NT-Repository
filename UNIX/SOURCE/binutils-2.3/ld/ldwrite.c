/*
   This module writes out the final image by reading sections from the
   input files, relocating them and writing them out

   There are two main paths through this module, one for normal
   operation and one for partial linking.

   During  normal operation, raw section data is read along with the
   associated relocation information, the relocation info applied and
   the section data written out on a section by section basis.

   When partially linking, all the relocation records are read to work
   out how big the output relocation vector will be. Then raw data is
   read, relocated and written section by section.
