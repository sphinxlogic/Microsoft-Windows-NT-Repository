xbomb is an rewrite and extension of the minesweeper game found on
various PCs.  The object of the game is to clear a field of deadly
bombs.  To do this requires only two mouse buttons, one key and a
devastatingly clever man page which describes the game in greater
detail.

This version of minesweeper has MANY MANY features not available
in other versions.  We have:

	o Ted Mode--you'll love it (it's hard to explain, but you
          *will* love it
	
	o User-defined solvers (for that "boring" stuff between the
	  fun part

	o A new and different scoring function

And much much more!
