     Xpipeman is a game of skill requiring the  user  to  connect
     together  pieces of a pipe to allow a liquid to flow through
     without leaking out.  The liquid  flows  out  of  the  block
     marked  with  an  "S".  The aim of the game is to connect as
     many pieces of pipe to the start block as possible.

     A random sequence of blocks is generated and displayed  down
     the  right hand side of the screen. The next pipe block that
     has to be placed is under the arrow marked "next".  After  a
     block has been placed a new block is displayed on the end of
     the sequence and the next block appears under the arrow.

     After a period of time the liquid starts to flow.  It  first
     fills  up the "flow start" meter at the right of the screen.
     When this is full it then begins to flow out  of  the  start
     block and into any pipe blocks connected to it.

     To finish  successfully  each  level  a  certain  number  of
     blocks  have to be connected to the start. This is indicated
     by the "Remaining" count. This count is decremented  as  the
     liquid  flows through the blocks. This is the minimum number
     of blocks that must be connected, any  further  blocks  con-
     nected generate extra points. The number of blocks that must
     be connected increases with each level.

     To make life more difficult there  are  also  object  blocks
     where  pieces of pipe cannot be placed. The number of object
     blocks also increases with each level.

     Blocks can be moved and placed either by using the mouse and
     its  buttons or by using the keyboard. For the mouse, button
     1 (left) moves the next pipe block to the  position  pointed
     to  by  the mouse. Button 2 (middle) places a piece of pipe.
     Pipes may not be placed on the start block, objects, or  any
     filled/partially filled pipe sections. Once a block has been
     placed it may NOT be moved.

     At higher levels some pieces of pipe  only  let  the  liquid
     flow one direction. These pipe sections have an arrow within
     them indicating the allowed flow direction. Successful  con-
     nection of one of these sections earns extra bonus points.

     The game is over when the required number of blocks have not
     been  connected  or  there  are  no more levels (I doubt the
     latter will happen before the first!).

     The default keyboard setup is as follows:

          zzzz    move one square left

          xxxx    move one square right

          ''''    move one square up

          ////    move one square down

          ssssppppcccc  place a piece of pipe

          ttttaaaabbbb  speed up the flow

     If no more blocks can be placed then pressing  the  tab  key
     will cause the flow to speed up.

     xpipeman.scorefile
          Set this to the path of your personal score file.   The
          file  will  be  created  if  it  does  not  exist.  The
          default: ./xpipescores

     In addition to the normal XToolkit options, xpipeman accepts
     command line options for the following resource:scorefile

          For example: xpipeman -scorefile myscorefile

     Each pipe connected to the flow scores 10 points.  Any  pipe
     placed  on  top  of  another  piece  of  empty pipe incurs a
     penalty of 20 points. Any pipe not  connected  to  the  flow
     also  incurs  a  penalty, but this time of only 10 points. A
     bonus 40 points is awarded each time there is a flow  cross-
     over  and  a  bonus of 10 points is awarded for each one way
     pipe used (later levels). The name for the high  score  list
     comes from the USER environment variable.

     Type ahead may be a problem  on  some  slower  machines.  To
     reduce  the problem try to use the mouse instead of the key-
     board. (I have a SPARCstation which seems  to  work  fine!).
     Other tips to reduce type ahead: plan the flow by looking at
     the sequence down the right hand side of the screen and most
     of all don't panic as the flow approaches!.
