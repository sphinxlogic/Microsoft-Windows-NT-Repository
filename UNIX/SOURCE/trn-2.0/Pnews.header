Type the name of one or more newsgroups to which you wish to post an article.
If you want to post to multiple newsgroups, it is better to do them all at
once than to post to each newsgroup individually, which defeats the news
reading programs' strategies of eliminating duplicates.

Separate multiple newsgroup names with commas.

The Distribution line may be used to limit the distribution of an article
to some subset of the systems that would receive the article based only on
the Newsgroups line.  For example, if you want to sell your car in talk.auto,
and you live in New Jersey, you might want to put "nj" on the Distribution
line to avoid advertising in California, which has enough problems of its own.
The actual area designators to use depend on where you are, of course.

article to find out they aren't interested.  This includes marking movie
