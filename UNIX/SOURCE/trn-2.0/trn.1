.SH NAME
trn - threaded read news program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trn [options] [newsgroups]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trn
is a threaded version of
.I rn,
which is a replacement for the readnews(1) program.
Being \*(L"threaded\*(R" means that the articles are interconnected
in reply order.
Each discussion thread is a tree of articles, where all the
reply (child) articles branch off from their respective originating
(parent) articles.
A representation of this tree (or a portion of it) is displayed in the
article header as you are reading news.
This gives you a better feel for how all the articles are related, and
even lets you see at a glance when an article already has a plethora of
replies (to avoid beating a subject to death).
In addition,
.I trn
has a thread selector menu that allows you to quickly browse
the subjects and authors of the available threads and choose the
ones you find interesting.
The remaining threads can either be saved for later or marked as read.
.PP
If you are already familiar with
.I rn
you will probably want to skip forward to the section on the
.IR "Thread Selection Mode" ,
then move on to read about the
.IR "Tree Display" ,
and finish with the summary of
.IR "What's New" ?
with
.IR trn .
If you're impatient, just dive in and get started.
All the regular commands are the same as those in
.IR rn ,
and the on-line help will give you a quick run-down of what new commands are
available.
Just type \*(L'h\*(R' from any prompt.
I'd suggest using the command:
.Sp
    trn \-x \-X
.Sp
to make sure some of the best new features are turned on.
.Sh "Starting Trn"
If no newsgroups are specified, all the newsgroups which have unread news
are displayed, and then the user is asked for each one whether he wants to
read it, in the order in which the newsgroups occur in the
.I .newsrc
file.
With a list of newsgroups,
.I trn
will start up in \*(L"add\*(R" mode, using the list as a set of patterns to
add new newsgroups and restrict which newsgroups are displayed.
See the discussion of the \*(L'a\*(R' command on the newsgroup selection
level.
.PP
.I Trn
operates on four levels: the newsgroup selection level, the thread
selection level, the article selection level, and the paging level.
Each level has its own set of commands, and its own help menu.
At the paging level (the bottom level),
.I trn
behaves much like the
.IR more (1)
program.
At the thread selection level, you are presented with the subjects and
(optionally) authors associated with each discussion thread, and given
a chance to choose which ones you wish to read now, save for later, or
manipulate in some way.
At the article selection level, you may read them in the default order
(which follows the discussion of the articles and their replies), or jump
around from one article to another.
At the newsgroup selection level (the top level), you may specify which
newsgroup you want next, or read them in the default order, which is the
order that the newsgroups occur in your
.I .newsrc
file.
(You will therefore want to rearrange your
.I .newsrc
file to put the most interesting newsgroups first.
This can be done with the \*(L'm\*(R' command on the Newsgroup Selection level.
WARNING: invoking readnews/vnews (the old user interface) in any way (including
as a news checker in your login sequence!) will cause your
.I .newsrc
to be disarranged again.)
.PP
On any level, at ANY prompt, help is available in the form of a summary of
available commands and what they do by typing an \*(L'h\*(R'.
This is probably the most important command to remember, so don't you
forget it.
.PP
Typing space to any question means to do the normal thing.
You will know what that is because
every prompt has a list of several plausible commands enclosed in
square brackets.
The first command in the list is the one which will be done if you type
a space.
(All input is done in cbreak mode, so carriage returns should not be typed
to terminate anything except certain multi-character commands.
Those commands will be obvious in the discussion below because they take an
argument.)
.PP
Upon startup,
.I trn
will do several things:
.Ip 1. 4
It will look for your
.I .newsrc
file, which is your list of subscribed-to
newsgroups.
If
.I trn
doesn't find a
.IR .newsrc ,
it will create one.
If it does find one, it will back it up under the name \*(L".oldnewsrc\*(R".
.Ip 2. 4
It will input your
.I .newsrc
file, listing out the first several newsgroups
with unread news.
.Ip 3. 4
It will perform certain consistency checks on your
.IR .newsrc .
If your
.I .newsrc
is out of date in any of several ways,
.I trn
will warn you and patch it up for you, but you may have to wait a little
longer for it to start up.
.Ip 4. 4
.I Trn
will next check to see if any new newsgroups have been created, and give
you the opportunity to add them to your
.IR .newsrc .
.Ip 5. 4
.I Trn
goes into the top prompt level\*(--the newsgroup selection level.
.Sh "Newsgroup Selection Level"
In this section the words \*(L"next\*(R" and \*(L"previous\*(R" refer to
the ordering of the newsgroups in your
.I .newsrc
file.
On the newsgroup selection level, the prompt looks like this:
.Sp
******** 17 unread articles in talk.blurfl\*(--read now? [ynq]
.Sp
and the following commands may be given at this level:
.Ip y,SP 8
Do this newsgroup now.
.Ip .command 8
Do this newsgroup now, but execute
.I command
before displaying anything.
The command will be interpreted as if given on the article selection level.
.Ip \+ 8
Enter this newsgroup through the thread selector.
.Ip = 8
Start this newsgroup, but list subjects before displaying articles.
.Ip U 8
Enter this newsgroup through the \*(L"Set unread\*(R" prompt.
.Ip t 8
Toggle the always-read-threaded flag for the current group.
.Ip n 8
Go to the next newsgroup with unread news.
.Ip N 8
Go to the next newsgroup.
.Ip p 8
Go to the previous newsgroup with unread news.
If there is none, stay at the current newsgroup.
.Ip P 8
Go to the previous newsgroup.
.Ip \- 8
Go to the previously displayed newsgroup (regardless of whether it is
before or after the current one in the list).
.Ip 1 8
Go to the first newsgroup.
.Ip ^ 8
Go to the first newsgroup with unread news.
.Ip $ 8
Go to the end of the newsgroups list.
.Ip "g newsgroup" 8
Go to
.IR newsgroup .
If it isn't currently subscribed to, you will be asked if you want to
subscribe.
.Ip "/pattern" 8
Scan forward for a newsgroup matching
.IR pattern .
Patterns do globbing like filenames, i.e., use ? to match a single
character, * to match any sequence of characters, and [] to specify a list
of characters to match.
(\*(L"all\*(R" may be used as a synonym for \*(L"*\*(R".)
Unlike normal filename globbing, newsgroup searching is not anchored to
the front and back of the filename, i.e. \*(L"/ski\*(R" will find
rec.skiing.
You may use ^ or $ to anchor the front or back of the search:
\*(L"/^test$\*(R" will find newsgroup test and nothing else
If you want to include newsgroups with 0 unread articles, append /r.
If the newsgroup is not found between the current newsgroup and the last
newsgroup, the search will wrap around to the beginning.
.Ip "?pattern" 8
Same as /, but search backwards.
.Ip u 8
Unsubscribe from the current newsgroup.
.Ip "l string" 8
List newsgroups not subscribed to which contain the string specified.
.Ip L 8 13v
Lists the current state of the
.IR .newsrc ,
along with status information.
.Sp
.nf
    \h'|0.5i'Status    \h'|2i'Meaning
    \h'|0.5i'<number>  \h'|2i'Count of unread articles in newsgroup.
    \h'|0.5i'READ      \h'|2i'No unread articles in newsgroup.
    \h'|0.5i'UNSUB     \h'|2i'Unsubscribed newsgroup.
    \h'|0.5i'BOGUS     \h'|2i'Bogus newsgroup.
    \h'|0.5i'JUNK      \h'|2i'Ignored line in .newsrc
\h'|2i'(e.g. readnews \*(L"options\*(R" line).
.fi
.Sp
(A bogus newsgroup is one that is not in the list of active newsgroups
in the active file, which on most systems is /usr/lib/news/active unless
you use NNTP.)
.Ip "m name" 8
Move the named newsgroup somewhere else in the
.IR .newsrc .
If no name is given, the current newsgroup is moved.
There are a number of ways to specify where you want the newsgroup\*(--type
h for help when it asks where you want to put it.
.Ip c 8
Catch up\*(--mark all unread articles in this newsgroup as read.
.Ip "o pattern" 8
Only display those newsgroups whose name matches
.IR pattern .
Patterns are the same as for the \*(L'/\*(R' command.
Multiple patterns may be separated by spaces, just as on the
command line.
The restriction will remain in effect either until there are no articles
left in the restricted set of newsgroups, or another restriction command
is given.
Since
.I pattern
is optional, \*(L'o\*(R' by itself will remove the
restriction.
.Ip "a pattern" 8
Add new newsgroups matching
.IR pattern .
Newsgroups which are already in your
.I .newsrc
file, whether subscribed to or
not, will not be listed.
If any new newsgroups are found, you will be asked for each one whether
you would like to add it.
If you want to add all new newsgroups, you can
type \*(L'Y\*(R' and they will be added the the end of the
.I .newsrc
file and as groups you want to read.
If you don't want to subscribe, all
the new groups can be added by typing  \*(L'N\*(R'.
After any new newsgroups have been added, the \*(L'a\*(R' command also
restricts the current set of newsgroups just like the \*(L'o\*(R' command
does.
.Ip & 8
Print out the current status of command line switches and any newsgroup
restrictions.
.Ip "&switch {switch}" 8
Set additional command line switches.
.Ip && 8
Print out the current macro definitions.
.Ip "&&keys commands" 8
Define additional macros.
.Ip !command 8
Escape to a subshell.
One exclamation mark (!) leaves you in your own news directory.
A double exclamation mark (!!) leaves you in the spool
directory for news, which on most systems is /usr/spool/news if NNTP is not being used.
The environment variable SHELL will be used if defined.
If
.I command
is null, an interactive shell is started.
.Ip q 8
Quit.
.Ip x 8
Quit, restoring .newsrc to its state at startup of
.IR trn .
The .newsrc you would have had if you had exited with \*(L'q\*(R' will be
called .newnewsrc, in case you didn't really want to type \*(L'x\*(R'.
.Ip ^K 8
Edit the global KILL file.
This is a file which contains /pattern/j commands (one per line) to be
applied to every newsgroup as it is started up, that is, when it is
selected on the newsgroup selection level.
The purpose of a KILL file is to mark articles as read on the basis of some
set of patterns.
This saves considerable wear and tear on your \*(L'n\*(R' key.
There is also a local KILL file for each newsgroup.
Because of the overhead involved in searching for articles to kill, it is
better if possible to use a local KILL file.
Local KILL files are edited with a \*(L'^K\*(R' on the article selection level.
There are also automatic ways of adding search commands to the local KILL
file\*(--see the \*(L'K\*(R' and \*(L'T\*(R' commands, and the K search
modifier on the article selection level.
.Sp
If either of the environment variables VISUAL or EDITOR is set, the
specified editor will be invoked; otherwise a default editor (normally vi(1))
is invoked on the KILL file.
.Sh "Thread Selection Level"
Most people who don't have all day to read news will want to enter a newsgroup
by way of the thread selector.
This is accomplished by using the \*(L'+\*(R'
command at the newsgroup selection level.
In fact, this may be the default command for entering a newsgroup, depending
on how your version of
.I trn
was configured (see the
.B \-X
option for how to turn this default on or off).
The thread selector displays a list of article subjects and (optionally)
authors grouped into threads.
A thread may contain multiple subjects if the subject changes as the
discussion continues.
Also displayed is a count of the number of unread articles in each thread.
Each thread is preceded by a letter or number that can be typed to select it.
Selected threads are flagged with a \*(L'+\*(R'.
.Sp
The default is to display the long mode of the thread selector.
In this mode, all the authors of the articles in the thread are summarized,
one per line (authors of multiple articles are listed only once).
The medium display mode groups multiple authors onto the same line, so that
more threads can be displayed at one time.
The short display mode does not display any author names, and can display
more characters in the subject.
.PP
The following commands are available in the thread selector:
.Ip "a-z,0-9" 8
Select the discussion thread by its letter or number;
press again to deselect.
By default the letters h, k, n, p, q, and y are omitted to allow them
to be typed as commands.
See the variable SELECTCHARS to customize this.
.Ip SP 8
Perform the default command.
This is usually > for most pages, and Z on the last page (although D and X
are also quite popular).
.Ip CR 8
Read the current thread (if none are selected) or all the selected threads.
.Ip "Z,TAB" 8
Begin reading the selected threads.
If none are are selected, read everything.
.Ip "y, \*(L'.\*(R'" 8
Toggle the current thread's selection (the one under the cursor).
.Ip "k, \*(L',\*(R'" 8
Mark the current thread as killed.
.Ip "m, \e" 8
Unmark the current thread.
.Ip \- 8
Set a range, as in 2 \- 5.
Repeats the last marking action:  selected, unselected, killed, or unmarked.
.Ip @ 8
Toggle all visible article selections.
.Ip < 8
Go to previous page.
.Ip > 8
Go to next page.
.Ip "p, [" 8
Move up to the previous thread.
.Ip "n, ]" 8
Move down to the next thread.
.Ip ^ 8
Go to first page.
.Ip $ 8
Go to last page.
.Ip X 8
Mark all unselected articles as read and start reading.
.Ip J 8
Mark all selected articles as read (useful after performing some action
on them with the \*(L':\*(R' command).
.Ip D 8
Mark unselected articles on the current page as read.
Begin reading if articles are selected, otherwise go to the next page.
.Ip ^K 8
Edit the local KILL file for this newsgroup.
A detailed description of KILL files is found in the Article Selection section.
.Ip ":command" 8
Execute a command upon all the selected threads and their articles.
If no threads are selected, all threads with unread articles are affected.
.Sp
Applicable commands include \*(L'+\*(R' and \*(L'-\*(R' (select and unselect
thread), \*(L'T\*(R' (trash the thread into the local KILL file), \*(L't\*(R'
(display article tree), \*(L"s dest\*(R" (save article to a destination),
\*(L"e dir\*(R" (extract to directory), \*(L'E\*(R' (end partial uudecode),
as well as: S, |, w, W, m, M, j, = and ','.
.Ip "/pattern" 8
Scan all articles for a subject containing
.I pattern
and select its thread.
.Ip "/pattern/modifiers:command{:command}" 8
Apply the commands listed to articles matching the search command (possibly
with h, a, r, or K modifiers).
The default action, if no command is specified, is to select the parent
thread of the matching article (the \*(L'+\*(R' command).
See the section on Regular Expressions, and the description of pattern
searching in the Article Selection section.
.Sp
One example:  to scan all the unread articles looking for \*(L"topic\*(L"
anywhere in the article and then select its thread and save the article to
the files topic.1, topic.2, etc. use \*(L"/topic/a:+:s topic.%#\*(R".
.Ip N 8
Go to the next newsgroup with unread news.
.Ip P 8
Go to the previous newsgroup with unread news.
.Ip U 8
Switch between selecting read/unread articles.
.Ip L 8
Switch the current display mode between the long and medium modes
(with authors) and the short mode.
(See the
.B \-x
option to select your favorite mode as the default.)
.Ip & 8
Display or set the current status of command line switches.
.Ip && 8
Display or set the current macro definitions.
.Ip !command 8
Escape to a subshell.
.Ip q 8
Quit this group.
.Ip "ESC,+" 8
Quit the thread selector (back) to the article level.
.Ip Q 8
Quit the current newsgroup and return to the newsgroup selection prompt
for this group.
.Sh "Article Selection Level"
On the article selection level,
.I trn
displays unread articles in thread sequence, reading each article and its
replies before going on to another topic.
If threads are disabled for a particular group, the default order is
in numeric sequence (the order they arrived at your site) unless you
use subject search (^N) to change the default order to be
numerical order within each matching subject.
(The
.B \-S
switch can be used to make subject search mode the default for unthreaded
groups.)
.Sp
On the article selection level you are
.I not
asked whether you want to read an article before the article is displayed;
rather,
.I trn
simply displays the first page (or portion of a page, at low baud rates) of the
article and asks if you want to continue.
The normal article selection prompt comes at the END of the article
(though article selection commands can be given from within the middle
of the article (the pager level) also).
The prompt at the end of an article looks like this:
.Sp 
End of article 248 (of 257)\*(--what next? [npq]
.Sp
The following are the options at this point:
.Ip n,SP 8
Scan forward for next unread article.
(Note: the \*(L'n\*(R' (next) command when typed at the end of an article
does not mark the article as read, since an article is automaticaly marked
as read after the last line of it is printed.
It is therefore possible to type a sequence such as \*(L'mn\*(R' and leave
the article marked as unread.
The fact that an article is marked as read by typing n, N, ^N, e, s, S, |,
w, or W within the MIDDLE of the article is in fact a special case.)
.Ip N 8
Go to the next article.
.Ip ^N 8
Scan forward for the next article with the same subject.
If the group is unthreaded this also makes subject search mode (^N)
the default.
.Ip p 8
Scan backward for previous unread article.
If there is none, stay at the current article.
.Ip P 8
Go to the previous article.
.Ip \- 8
Go to the previously displayed article (regardless of whether that article
is before or after this article in the normal sequence).
.Ip ^P 8
Scan backward for the previous article with the same subject.
Makes subject search mode (^N) the default if the group is unthreaded.
.Ip "<,>" 8
Browse the previous/next selected thread.
If no selections have been made, all the threads that had unread news when
you entered the newsgroup (or last left the thread selector) are treated
as selected.
Entering an empty newsgroup makes all the already-read threads available
for browsing.
.Ip "[,]" 8
Proceed to the left/right in the article tree.
Visits already-read articles as well as empty nodes.
If you attempt to go past the left/right edge of the tree, you are advanced
to the previous/next line if available.
.Ip "{,}" 8
Go to the root/leaf of the article tree, even if the node is
already read or empty.
Proceeds to the very first/last node if you're already at a root/leaf in
a multi-root thread.
.Ip t 8
Display the entire article tree and all its associated subjects.
If the group is not currently threaded, it will be turned on and
processed as needed.
.Ip ^R 8
Restart the current article.
.Ip v 8
Restart the current article verbosely, displaying the entire header.
.Ip ^L 8
Refresh the screen.
.Ip ^X 8
Restart the current article, and decrypt as a rot13 message.
.Ip X 8
Refresh the screen, and decrypt as a rot13 message.
.Ip b 8
Back up one page.
.Ip q 8
Quit this newsgroup and go back to the newsgroup selection level.
.Ip ^ 8
Go to the first unread article.
.Ip $ 8
Go to the last article (actually, one past the last article).
.Ip "number" 8
Go to the numbered article.
.Ip "range{,range}:command{:command}" 8
Apply a set of commands to a set of articles.
A range consists of either <article number> or
<article\ number>\-<article\ number>.
A dot \*(L'.\*(R' represents the current article, and a dollar
sign \*(L'$\*(R' represents the last article.
.Sp
Applicable commands include \*(L'm\*(R' (mark as unread), \*(L'M\*(R'
(delayed mark as unread), \*(L'j\*(R' (mark as read), \*(L"s dest\*(R"
(save to a destination), \*(L"e dir"\*(R" (extract to directory),
\&\*(L"!command\*(R" (shell escape), \*(L"=\*(R" (print the subject),
\&\*(L'T\*(R' (trash the thread into the local KILL file), \*(L'+\*(R'
(select the thread), \*(L'-\*(R' (deselect the thread), \*(L'C\*(R'
(cancel), as well as S, |, w, W, and t.
.Ip ":command" 8
Apply a command to all selected threads and their articles.
If no threads are selected, apply the command to all the unread threads.
For applicable commands, see the discussion above for the range command.
.Ip j 8
Junk the current article\*(--mark it as read.
If this command is used from within an article, you are left at the end of
the article, unlike \*(L'n\*(R', which looks for the next article.
.Ip m 8
Mark the current article as still unread.
(If you are in subject search mode you probably want to use M instead of m.
Otherwise the current article may be selected as the beginning of the next
subject thread.)
.Ip M 8
Mark the current article as still unread, but not until the newsgroup
is exited.
Until then, the current article will be marked as read.
This is useful for returning to an article in another session, or in another
newsgroup.
.Ip /pattern 8
Scan forward for article containing
.I pattern
in the subject.
See the Regular Expressions section.
Together with the escape substitution facility described later, it becomes
easy to search for various attributes of the current article, such as
subject, article ID, author name, etc.
The previous pattern can be recalled with \*(L"<esc>/\*(R".
If
.I pattern
is omitted, the previous pattern is assumed.
.Ip /pattern/h 8
Scan forward for article containing
.I pattern
in the header.
.Ip /pattern/a 8
Scan forward for article containing
.I pattern
anywhere in article.
.Ip /pattern/r 8
Scan read articles also.
.Ip /pattern/c 8
Make search case sensitive.
Ordinarily upper- and lower-case are considered the same.
.Ip "/pattern/modifiers:command{:command}" 8
Apply the commands listed to articles matching the search command (possibly
with h, a, or r modifiers).
Applicable commands include \*(L'm\*(R' (mark as unread), \*(L'M\*(R'
(delayed mark as unread), \*(L'j\*(R' (mark as read), \*(L"s dest\*(R"
(save to a destination), \*(L"e dir"\*(R" (extract to directory),
\&\*(L"!command\*(R" (shell escape), \*(L"=\*(R" (print the subject),
\&\*(L'T\*(R' (trash the associated thread and put it in the local KILL
file), \*(L'+\*(R' (select the associated thread), \*(L'-\*(R' deselect
the associated thread), and \*(L'C\*(R' (cancel).
If the first command is \*(L'm\*(R' or \*(L'M\*(R', modifier r is assumed.
A K may be included in the modifiers (not the commands) to cause the
entire command (sans K) to be saved to the local KILL file, where it will
be applied to every article that shows up in the newsgroup.
.Sp
For example, to save all articles in a given newsgroup to the line printer
and mark them read, use \*(L"/^/\||\|lpr:j\*(R".
If you type \*(L"/^/K\||\|lpr:j\*(R", this will happen every time you enter the
newsgroup.
.Ip ?pattern 8
Scan backward for article containing
.I pattern
in the subject.
May be modified as the forward search is: ?pattern?modifiers[:commands].
It is likely that you will want an r modifier when scanning backward.
.Ip k 8
Mark as read all articles with the same subject as the current article.
(Note: there is no single character command to temporarily mark as read (M
command) articles matching the current subject.
That can be done with \*(L"/<esc>s/M\*(R", however.)
.Ip \, 8
Mark the current article and all its replies as read.
.Ip J 8
Junk all the articles in the thread, even if it contains multiple subjects.
.Ip K 8
Do the same as the k command, but also add a line to the local KILL file for
this newsgroup to kill this subject every time the newsgroup is started up.
For a discussion of KILL files, see the \*(L'^K\*(R' command below.
See also the K modifier on searches above.
.Ip T 8
Kill the current thread, and also add a line to the local KILL file for
this newsgroup to kill new articles attached to this thread every time the
newsgroup is started up.
.Ip ^K 8
Edit the local KILL file for this newsgroup.
Each line of the KILL file should be a subject-killing command of the
form /pattern/j or a thread killing command of the form T<number>.
The thread killing commands are usually followed by a comment to let
you know the primary subject of the numbered thread being killed.
The first line in the KILL file has the form \*(L"THRU <number>\*(R",
which tells
.I trn
the maximum article number that the KILL file has been applied to.
(You may delete the THRU line to force a rescan of current articles.)
You may also have reason to use the m, h, or a modifiers.
Be careful with the M modifier in a kill file\*(--there are more efficient
ways to never read an article.
You might have reason to use it if a particular series of articles is posted
to multiple newsgroups.
In this case, M would force you to view the article in a different newsgroup.
.Sp
To see only newgroup articles in the control newsgroup, for instance, you
might put
.Sp
/^/j
.br
/newgroup/m
.Sp
which kills all subjects not containing \*(L"newgroup\*(R".
You can add lines automatically via the K command and K search modifiers,
but editing is the only way to remove lines.
If either of the environment variables VISUAL or EDITOR is set, the
specified editor will be invoked; otherwise a default editor (normally vi)
is invoked on the KILL file.
.Sp
The KILL file may also contain switch setting lines beginning with \*(L'&\*(R'.
Additionally, any line beginning with \*(L'X\*(R' is executed on exit
from the newsgroup rather than on entrance.
This can be used to set switches back to a default value.
One use for this capability is to set your save directory to a custom value
upon entry to a newsgroup and set it back on exit using the \-ESAVEDIR option.
See also the
.B \-/
option for another solution to multiple save directories without using KILL
files.
.Ip r 8
Reply through net mail.
The environment variables MAILPOSTER and MAILHEADER may be used to modify
the mailing behavior of
.I trn
(see environment section).
If on a nonexistent article such as the \*(L"End of newsgroup\*(R"
pseudo-article
(which you can get to with a \*(L'$\*(R' command), invokes the mailer to
nobody in particular.
.Ip R 8
Reply, including the current article in the header file generated.
(See \*(L'F\*(R' command below).
The YOUSAID environment variable controls the format of the attribution line.
.Ip f 8
Submit a followup article.
If on a nonexistent article such as the \*(L"End of newsgroup\*(R"
pseudo-article
(which you can get to with a \*(L'$\*(R' command), posts an original
article (basenote).
.Ip F 8
Submit a followup article, and include the old article, with lines prefixed
either by \*(L">\*(R" or by the argument to a
.B \-F
switch.
.I Trn
will attempt to provide an attribution line in front of the quoted article,
generated from the From: line of the article.
Unfortunately, the From: line doesn't always contain the right name; you
should double check it against the signature and change it if necessary,
or you may have to apologize for quoting the wrong person.
The environment variables NEWSPOSTER, NEWSHEADER and ATTRIBUTION may be
used to modify the posting behavior of
.I trn
(see environment section).
.Sp
If you are starting a new subject, move to the end of the newsgroup
with the \*(L'$\*(R' command before pressing \*(L'f\*(R'.
Otherwise you may have to do a lot of header editing, including 
.I "removing the References line"
-- this is IMPORTANT to remember ONLY when starting a new subject.
It is much simpler to remember \*(L"$f\*(R" for new subjects, and to
allways leave the References line alone.
.Ip C 8
Cancel the current article, but only if you are the contributor or superuser.
.Ip z 8
Supersede the current article, but only if you are the contributor.
.Ip c 8
Catch up in this newsgroup; i.e., mark all articles as read.
.Ip U 8
Mark some or all articles as unread.
You can choose to mark the current thread, sub-thread (the current article
and its replies), all the articles, or start up the thread selector
to choose specific threads to set unread.
.Ip u 8
Unsubscribe from this newsgroup.
.Ip "s destination" 8
Save to a filename or pipe using sh.
If the first character of the destination is a vertical bar, the rest of
the command is considered a shell command to which the article is passed
through standard input.
The command is subject to filename expansion.
(See also the environment variable PIPESAVER.)
If the destination does not begin with a vertical bar, the rest of the
command is assumed to be a filename of some sort.
An initial tilde \*(L'~\*(R' will be translated to the name of the home
directory, and an initial environment variable substitution is also allowed.
If only a directory name is specified, the environment variable SAVENAME
is used to generate the actual name.
If a non-absolute filename is specified, the environment variable
SAVEDIR will be used to generate the actual directory.
If nothing is specified, then obviously both variables will be used.
Since the current directory for
.I trn
while doing a save command is your
private news directory, typing \*(L"s ./filename\*(R" will force the file
to your news directory.
Save commands are also run through % interpretation, so that you can
enter \*(L"s %O/filename\*(R" to save to the directory you were in when you ran
.IR trn ,
and \*(L"s %t\*(R" to save to a filename consisting of the Internet address
of the sender.
.Sp
After generating the full pathname of the file to save to,
.I trn
determines if the file exists already, and if so, appends to it.
.I trn
will attempt to determine if an existing file is a mailbox or a normal file,
and save the article in the same format.
If the output file does not yet exist,
.I trn
will by default ask you which format you want, or you can make it skip the
question with either the
.B \-M
or
.B \-N
switch.
If the article is to be saved in mailbox format, the command to do so is
generated from the environment variable MBOXSAVER.
Otherwise, NORMSAVER is used.
.Ip "S destination" 8
Save to a filename or pipe using a preferred shell, such as csh.
Which shell is used depends first on what you have the environment variable
SHELL set to, and in the absence of that, on what your news administrator
set for the preferred shell when he or she installed
.IR trn .
.Ip "| command" 8
Shorthand for \*(L"s | command\*(R".
.Ip "w destination" 8
The same as \*(L"s destination\*(R", but saves without the header.
.Ip "W destination" 8
The same as \*(L"S destination\*(R", but saves without the header.
.Ip "e directory" 8
Extract a shell archive or uuencoded binary to the designated directory.
The article is first scanned to try discover what type of data is
encapsulated.
If a \*(L"cut here\*(R" line is found, the first non-blank line after it
must be either the start of a shar header, or the \*(L"begin\*(R"
or \*(L"table\*(R" line of a uuencoded binary.
The default for extracting shars is to send the data portion of the file
to /bin/sh, but that can be overridden with the UNSHAR variable (see the
ENVIRONMENT section).
Uudecoding is done internally by a decoder that can handle the data
being split up over multiple articles, and extracted one piece at a time.
To decode a multi-article file, either execute the \*(L'e\*(R'
command in each article in sequence, use an article range to execute the
command, or use the \*(L":e\*(R" command to repeat the command for each of the
currently selected articles.
When the \*(L'e\*(R' command is not followed by any arguments, it will
repeat the arguments from the last extraction.
All directory specifications are relative to the value of SAVEDIR, so you
can use the command \*(L"e .\*(R" to force an extraction to SAVEDIR itself.
If a uudecoding is in progress (i.e. the last piece wasn't extracted yet)
and you exit the group, the partial file will be removed.
This also occurs if you start to extract a new uuencoded file before the
previous one was finished.
See also the \*(L'E\*(R' command for ending a multi-part uudecoding
manually.
.Sp
There is one special case that is handled differently:  if the first file in a
recognizable shar file is a uuencoded binary that was packed with lines
starting with an \*(L'X\*(R', we will not unshar the file but instead
uudecode it.
If this causes problems, you can override the default extraction method
by following the directory with an explicit command to execute, as
described below.
.Ip "e directory|command" 8
This form of the \*(L'e\*(R' command allows you to extract other data
formats than shar or uuencoded files or to override the decisions made
by the automatic extraction selection described above.
In normal operation, all data following what we recognize as
a \*(L"cut here\*(R" line will be sent to the specified command.
Additionally, the distinctive beginning of a shell archive is also recognized
without a preceding cut line.
When the command is run, the default directory will be set to the
specified directory, or the value
of SAVEDIR if unspecified.
Entering the \*(L'e\*(R' command without arguments will repeat your
previous extract command.
You can use the command \*(L"e dir|\*(R" to extract to a new directory
using the previously-specified command.
.Ip E 8
This command ends any multi-part uuencoded file extraction that you began,
but are unable (or unwilling) to complete.
The partially extracted file is removed.
.Ip & 8
Print out the current status of command line switches.
.Ip "&switch {switch}" 8
Set additional command line switches.
.Ip && 8
Print out current macro definitions.
.Ip "&&keys commands" 8
Define an additional macro.
.Ip !command 8
Escape to a subshell.
One exclamation mark (!) leaves you in your own news directory.
A double exclamation mark (!!) leaves you in the spool
directory of the current newsgroup.
The environment variable SHELL will be used if defined.
If
.I command
is null, an interactive shell is started.
.Sp
You can use escape key substitutions described later to get to many
run-time values.
The command is also run through % interpretation, in case it is being called
from a range or search command.
.Ip \+ 8
Start the thread selector.
If the newsgroup is unthreaded, the subject lister is called instead.
.Ip = 8
List subjects of unread articles.
.Ip # 8
Print last article number.
.Sh "Pager Level"
At the pager level (within an article), the prompt looks like this:
.Sp
\*(--MORE\*(--(17%)
.Sp
and a number of commands may be given:
.Ip SP 8
Display next page.
.Ip x 8
Display next page and decrypt as a rot13 message.
.Ip d 8
Display half a page more.
.Ip CR 8
Display one more line.
.Ip q 8
Go to the end of the current article (don't mark it either read or unread).
Leaves you at the \*(L"What next?\*(R" prompt.
.Ip j 8
Junk the current article.
Mark it read and go to the end of the article.
.Ip ^L 8
Refresh the screen.
.Ip X 8
Refresh the screen and decrypt as a rot13 message.
.Ip b 8
Back up one page.
.Ip t 8
Display the entire article tree, including its associated subjects, and
continue reading.
If the group is not currently threaded, it will be turned on and
processed as needed.
.Ip gpattern 8
Goto (search forward for)
.I pattern
within current article.
Note that there is no space between the command and the pattern.
If the pattern is found, the page containing the pattern will be displayed.
Where on the page the line matching the pattern goes depends on the value
of the
.B \-g
switch.
By default the matched line goes at the top of the screen.
.Ip G 8
Search for g pattern again.
.Ip ^G 8
This is a special version of the \*(L'g\*(R' command that is for skipping
articles in a digest.
It is equivalent to setting \*(L"\-g4\*(R" and then executing the command
\*(L"g^Subject:\*(R".
.Ip TAB 8
This is another special version of the \*(L'g\*(R' command that is for
skipping inclusions of older articles.
It is equivalent to setting \*(L"\-g4\*(R" and then executing the command
\*(L"g^[^c]\*(R", where \fIc\fR is the first character of the last line
on the screen.
It searches for the first line that doesn't begin with the same character
as the last line on the screen.
.Ip !command 8
Escape to a subshell.
.PP
The following commands skip the rest of the current article, then behave just
as if typed to the \*(L"What next?\*(R" prompt at the end of the article.
See the documentation at the article selection level for these commands.
.Sp	
    # $ & / = ? c C f F k K T ^K J , m M r R ^R u U v Y ^
.br
    p P ^P - < > [ ] { } number
.br
    range{,range} command{:command}
.Sp
The following commands also skip to the end of the article, but have the
additional effect of marking the current article as read:
.Sp
    n N ^N e s S | w W
.Sp
.Sh "Miscellaneous facts about commands"
An \*(L'n\*(R' typed at either the \*(L"Last newsgroup\*(R" prompt or a
\*(L"Last article\*(R" prompt will cycle back to the top of the newsgroup
or article list, whereas a \*(L'q\*(R' will quit the level.
(Note that \*(L'n\*(R' does not mean \*(L"no\*(R", but rather
\*(L"next\*(R".)
A space will of course do whatever is shown as the
default, which will vary depending on whether
.I trn
thinks you have more articles or newsgroups to read.
.PP
The \*(L'b\*(R' (backup page) command may be repeated until the beginning of
the article is reached.
If
.I trn
is suspended (via a ^Z), then when the job is resumed, a refresh (^L) will
automatically be done (Berkeley-type systems only).
If you type a command such as \*(L'!\*(R' or \*(L's\*(R' which takes you
from the middle of the article to the end, you can always get back into the
middle by typing \*(L'^L\*(R'.
.PP
In multi-character commands such as \*(L'!\*(R', \*(L's\*(R', \*(L'/\*(R',
etc, you can interpolate various run-time values by typing escape and a
character.
To find out what you can interpolate, type escape and \*(L'h\*(R', or check
out the single character % substitutions for environment variables in the
Interpretation and Interpolation section, which are the same.
Additionally, typing a double escape will cause any % substitutions in the
string already typed in to be expanded.
.Sh "The Tree Display"
When reading a threaded newsgroup,
.I trn
displays a character representation of the article tree in the upper right
corner of the header.
For example, consider the following display:
.Sp
.nf
    (1)+-(1)--(\fI2\fP)--\fI[2]\fP
       |-(1)+-[3]
       |    \\-[1]
       \\-(1)+-[1]--[1]
            \\-[1]
.fi
.Sp
This tree represents an initial article that has three direct replies
(the second column with three (1)'s).
Each reply has further replies branching off from them.
In two cases the subject line was altered in the reply, as indicated
by the increasing numbers.
When there is only one subject associated with a thread, all the nodes
are marked with the number 1.
When the first subject change arrives, it is marked with the number 2,
and so on.
If you were to look at this thread in the thread selector, the three
subjects associated with it would be listed in the same order as the
ascending digits.
In those rare cases where more than 9 subjects are associated with each
thread, the nodes are marked with the letters A-Z, and then by a-z.
The articles that have already been read are enclosed in ()'s.
Unread articles are displayed in []'s.
The currently displayed article has its entire node highlighted in the
display.
The previously displayed article has only its number highlighted.
.Sh "Options"
.I Trn
has a nice set of options to allow you to tailor the interaction
to your liking.
(You might like to know that the author swears by
\*(L"\-x6ls \-e \+m \-S -XX -N\*(R".)
These options may be set on the command line, via the TRNINIT
environment variable, via a file pointed to by the TRNINIT variable, or
from within
.I trn
via the & command.
Options may generally be unset by typing \*(L"+switch\*(R".
Options include:
.TP 5
.B \-a
causes trn to always thread a group that doesn't have a pre-created
thread file.
Without this option you have to toggle each group with the \*(L't\*(R'
command at the newsgroup prompt to force it to be read threaded even
if no thread file for the group exists.
.TP 5
.B \-c
checks for news without reading news.
If a list of newsgroups is given on the command line, only those newsgroups
will be checked; otherwise all subscribed-to newsgroups are checked.
Whenever the
.B \-c
switch is specified, a non-zero exit status from
.I trn
means that there is unread news in one of the checked newsgroups.
The
.B \-c
switch does not disable the printing of newsgroups with unread news;
this is controlled by the
.B \-s
switch.
(The
.B \-c
switch is not meaningful when given via the & command.)
.TP 5
.B \-C<number>
tells
.I trn
how often to checkpoint the
.IR .newsrc ,
in articles read.
Actually, this number says when to start thinking about doing a checkpoint
if the situation is right.
If a reasonable checkpointing situation doesn't arise within 10 more
articles, the
.I .newsrc
is checkpointed willy-nilly.
.TP 5
.B \-d<directory name>
sets the default save directory to something other than ~/News.
The directory name will be globbed (via csh) if necessary (and if possible).
Articles saved by
.I trn
may be placed in the save directory or in a subdirectory thereof depending
on the command that you give and the state of the environment variables
SAVEDIR and SAVENAME.
Any KILL files (see the K command in the Article Selection section)
also reside in this directory and its subdirectories, by default.
In addition, shell escapes leave you in this directory.
.TP 5
.B \-D<flags>
enables debugging output.
See common.h for flag values.
Warning: normally
.I trn
attempts to restore your
.I .newsrc
when an unexpected signal or internal error occurs.
This is disabled when any debugging flags are set.
.TP 5
.B \-e
causes each page within an article to be started at the top of the screen,
not just the first page.
(It is similar to the
.B \-c
switch of
.IR more (1).)
You never have to read scrolling text with this switch.
This is helpful especially at certain baud rates because you can start reading
the top of the next page without waiting for the whole page to be printed.
It works nicely in conjunction with the
.B \-m
switch, especially if you use half-intensity for your highlight mode.
See also the
.B \-L
switch.
.TP 5
.B \-E<name>=<val>
sets the environment variable <name> to the value specified.
Within
.IR trn ,
\*(L"&\-ESAVENAME=%t\*(R" is similar to \*(L"setenv SAVENAME '%t'\*(R" in
.IR csh ,
or \*(L"SAVENAME='%t'; export SAVENAME\*(R" in
.IR sh .
Any environment variables set with
.B \-E
will be inherited by subprocesses of
.IR trn .
.TP 5
.B \-F<string>
sets the prefix string for the \*(L'F\*(R' followup command to use in
prefixing each line of the quoted article.
For example, \*(L"\-F<tab>\*(R" inserts a tab on the front of each line
(which will cause long lines to wrap around, unfortunately),
\*(L"\-F>>>>\*(R" inserts \*(L">>>>\*(R" on every line, and
\*(L"\-F\*(R" by itself causes nothing to be inserted, in case you want to
reformat the text, for instance.
The initial default prefix is \*(L">\*(R".
.TP 5
.B \-g<line>
tells
.I trn
which line of the screen you want searched-for strings to show up on when
you search with the \*(L'g\*(R' command within an article.
The lines are numbered starting with 1.
The initial default is \*(L"\-g1\*(R", meaning the first line of the screen.
Setting the line to less than 1 or more than the number of lines on the screen
will set it to the last line of the screen.
.TP 5
.B \-h<string>
hides (disables the printing of) all header lines beginning with
.I string.
For instance, \-hexp will disable the printing of the \*(L"Expires:\*(R" line.
Case is insignificant.
If <string> is null, all header lines except Subject are hidden, and you
may then use
.B +h
to select those lines you want to see.
You may wish to use the baud-rate switch modifier below to hide more lines
at lower baud rates.
.TP 5
.B \-H<string>
works just like
.B \-h
except that instead of setting the hiding flag for a header line, it sets
the magic flag for that header line.
Certain header lines have magic behavior that can be controlled this way.
At present, the following actions are caused by the flag for the particular
line:
the Date line prints the date in local time if the group is threaded;
the From line will only print the commented portion of the user name;
the Newsgroups line will only print when there are multiple newsgroups;
the Subject line will be underlined and (when threaded) the
keyword \*(L'Subject:\*(R' is replaced by its subject number (e.g. [1]);
and the Expires line will always be suppressed if there is nothing on it.
In fact, all of these actions are the default, and you must use
.B +H
to undo them.
.TP 5
.B \-i=<number>
specifies how long (in lines) to consider the initial page of an
article\*(--normally this is determined automatically depending on baud rate.
(Note that an entire article header will always be printed regardless of the
specified initial page length.
If you are working at low baud rate and wish to reduce the size of the
headers, you may hide certain header lines with the
.B \(bsh
switch.)
.TP 5
.B \-l
disables the clearing of the screen at the beginning of each
article, in case you have a bizarre terminal.
.TP 5
.B \-L
tells
.I trn
to leave information on the screen as long as possible by not blanking
the screen between pages, and by using clear to end-of-line.
(The
.IR more (1)
program does this.)
This feature works only if you have the requisite termcap
capabilities.
The switch has no effect unless the
.B \-e
switch is set.
.TP 5
.B \-m=<mode>
enables the marking of the last line of the previous page
printed, to help the user see where to continue reading.
This is most helpful when less than a full page is going to be displayed.
It may also be used in conjunction with the
.B \-e
switch, in which case the page is erased, and the first line (which is
the last line of the previous page) is highlighted.
If
.B \-m=s
is specified, the standout mode will be used, but if
.B \-m=u
is specified, underlining will be used.
If neither
.B =s
or
.B =u
is specified, standout is the default.
Use
.B +m
to disable highlighting.
.TP 5
.B \-M
forces mailbox format in creating new save files.
Ordinarily you are asked which format you want.
.TP 5
.B \-N
forces normal (non-mailbox) format in creating new save files.
Ordinarily you are asked which format you want.
.TP 5
.B \-o
will act like old versions of trn and not chase xrefs when junking
articles via thread commands.
Using
.B \-o2
will also disable the database lookup for all article-junking commands.
This slows down the junking of non-xrefed articles, but enables trn 2.\|0
to be run using a database from a pre-2.\|0 mthreads.
.TP 5
.B \-q
bypasses the automatic check for new newsgroups when starting 
.IR trn .
.TP 5
.B \-r
causes
.I trn
to restart in the last newsgroup read during a previous session with
.IR trn .
It is equivalent to starting up normally and then getting to the newsgroup
with a g command.
.TP 5
.B \-s
with no argument suppresses the initial listing of newsgroups with unread
news, whether
.B \-c
is specified or not.
Thus
.B \-c
and
.B \-s
can be used together to test \*(L"silently\*(R" the status of news from
within your
.I .login
file.
If
.B \-s
is followed by a number, the initial listing is suppressed after that many
lines have been listed.
Presuming that you have your
.I .newsrc
sorted into order of interest,
.B \-s5
will tell you the 5 most interesting newsgroups that have unread news.
This is also a nice feature to use in your
.I .login
file, since it not only tells you whether there is unread news, but also how
important the unread news is, without having to wade through the entire
list of unread newsgroups.
If no 
.B \-s
switch is given 
.B \-s5
is assumed, so just putting \*(L"rn \-c\*(R"
into your
\&.login file is fine.
.TP 5
.B \-S<number>
causes
.I trn
to enter subject search mode (^N) automatically whenever an unthreaded
newsgroup is
started up with <number> unread articles or more.
Additionally, it causes any \*(L'n\*(R' typed while in subject search mode
to be interpreted as \*(L'^N\*(R' instead.
(To get back out of subject search mode, the best command is probably
\&\*(L'^\*(R'.)
If <number> is omitted, 3 is assumed.
.TP 5
.B \-t
puts
.I trn
into terse mode.
This is more cryptic but useful for low baud rates.
(Note that your system administrator may have compiled
.I trn
with either verbose or terse messages only to save memory.)
You may wish to use the baud-rate switch modifier below to enable terse mode
only at lower baud rates.
.TP 5
.B \-T
allows you to type ahead of rn.
Ordinarily rn will eat typeahead to prevent your autorepeating space bar from
doing a very frustrating thing when you accidentally hold it down.
If you don't have a repeating space bar, or you are working at low baud
rate, you can set this switch to prevent this behavior.
You may wish to use the baud-rate switch modifier below to disable typeahead
only at lower baud rates.
.TP 5
.B \-v
sets verification mode for commands.
When set, the command being executed is displayed to give some feedback that
the key has actually been typed.
Useful when the system is heavily loaded and you give a command that takes
a while to start up.
.TP 5
.B \-x<number><list>
Enable the extended (threaded) features of
.I trn
beyond the traditional
.I rn
compatibility mode.
(This may be the default on your system, use +x if you yearn for the good
ol' days.)
The <number> is the maximum number of article-tree lines (from 0 to 11)
you want displayed in your header.
Use the <list> to choose which thread selector modes you like (s \- short,
m \- medium, or l \- long), and in what order they are selected with the
\&\*(L'L\*(R' command.
For example, use
.B \-xls
to start with the long display mode and only switch between it and
the short mode.
You can omit either or both of the parameters, in which case a default of
.B \-x6lsm
is assumed.
.TP 5
.B \-X<number><commands>
If you like using the thread selector, you'll probably want to use this
option to make the thread selector command (+) the default when a newsgroup
is started up with at least <number> unread articles.
(Your installer may have chosen to make -X1 the default on your system.)
It is also used to select which commands you want to be the defaults while
using the thread selector.
For example,
.B \-X2XD
will make the thread selector the default command for entering a newsgroup
with at least 2 unread articles, and set the default command for the LAST
page of the thread selector to be the
.B X
command and the default command for all other pages to be the
.B D
command.
Either or both parameters can be omitted, as well as the second default
command (e.g.
.B \-XX
would change the default newsgroup entry to use the selector and the default
command for the last page of the selector to be \*(L'X\*(R').
The default is
.B \-X1Z>
if just
.B \-X
is specified.
To set the default selector commands without affecting the default entry
into a newsgroup, specify a high number, like 9999.
.TP 5
.B \-/
sets SAVEDIR to \*(L"%p/%c\*(R" and SAVENAME to \*(L"%a\*(R", which means
that by default articles are saved in a subdirectory of your private news
directory corresponding to the name of the the current newsgroup, with the
filename being the article number.
.B +/
sets SAVEDIR to \*(L"%p\*(R" and SAVENAME to \*(L"%^C\*(R", which by
default saves articles directly to your private news directory, with the
filename being the name of the current newsgroup, first letter capitalized.
(Either
.B +/
or
.B \-/
may be default on your system, depending on the feelings of your news
administrator when he, she or it installed
.IR trn .)
You may, of course, explicitly set SAVEDIR and SAVENAME to other values\*(--see
discussion in the environment section.
.PP
Any switch may be selectively applied according to the current baud-rate.
Simply prefix the switch with +speed to apply the switch at that speed or
greater, and \%\-speed to apply the switch at that speed or less.
Examples: \%\-1200\-hposted suppresses the Posted line at 1200 baud or less;
\%+9600\-m enables marking at 9600 baud or more.
You can apply the modifier recursively to itself also: \%+300\-1200\-t sets
terse mode from 300 to 1200 baud.
.PP
Similarly, switches may be selected based on terminal type:
.Sp
	\-=vt100+T		set +T on vt100
.br
	\-=tvi920\-ETERM=mytvi	get a special termcap entry
.br
	\-=tvi920\-ERNMACRO=%./.rnmac.tvi
.br
				set up special keymappings
.br
	+=paper\-v		set verify mode if not hardcopy
.PP
Some switch arguments, such as environment variable values, may require
spaces in them.
Such spaces should be quoted via ", ', or \e in the conventional fashion,
even when passed via TRNINIT or the & command.
.Sh "Regular Expressions"
The patterns used in article searching are regular expressions such as
those used by
.IR ed (1).
In addition, \ew matches an alphanumeric character and \eW a nonalphanumeric.
Word boundaries may be matched by \eb, and non-boundaries by \eB.
The bracketing construct \e(\ ...\ \e) may also be used, and \edigit matches
the digit'th substring, where digit can range from 1 to 9.
\e0 matches whatever the last bracket match matched.
Up to 10 alternatives may given in a pattern, separated by \e|, with the
caveat that \e(\ ...\ \e|\ ...\ \e) is illegal.
.Sh "Interpretation and Interpolation"
Many of the strings that
.I trn
handles are subject to interpretations of several types.
Under filename expansion, an initial \*(L"~/\*(R" is translated to the name
of your home directory, and \*(L"~name\*(R" is translated to the login
directory for the user specified.
Filename expansion will also expand an initial environment variable, and
also does the backslash, uparrow and percent expansion mentioned below.
.PP
All interpreted strings go through backslash, uparrow and percent
interpretation.
The backslash escapes are the normal ones (such as \en, \et, \ennn, etc.).
The uparrow escapes indicate control codes in the normal fashion.
Backslashes or uparrows to be passed through should be escaped with backslash.
The special percent escapes are similar to printf percent escapes.
These cause the substitution of various run-time values into the string.
The following are currently recognized:
.Ip %a 8
Current article number.
.Ip %A 8
Full name of current article (%P/%c/%a).
.Ip %b 8
Destination of last save command, often a mailbox.
.Ip %B 8
The byte offset to the beginning of the part of the article to be saved,
set by the save command.
The \*(L's\*(R' and \*(L'S\*(R' commands set it to 0, and the \*(L'w\*(R'
and \*(L'W\*(R' commands set it to the byte offset of the body of the article.
.Ip %c 8
Current newsgroup, directory form.
.Ip %C 8
Current newsgroup, dot form.

.Ip %E 8
The last directory where an extracted file went.
.Ip %f 8
\*(L"From:\*(R" line from the current article, or the \*(L"Reply-To:\*(R"
line if there is one.
This differs from %t in that comments (such as the full name) are not
stripped out with %f.
.Ip %F 8
\*(L"Newsgroups:\*(R" line for a new article, constructed from
\*(L"Newsgroups:\*(R" and \*(L"Followup-To:\*(R" lines of current article.
.Ip %h 8
Name of the header file to pass to the mail or news poster,
containing all the information that the poster program needs in the
form of a message header.
It may also contain a copy of the current article.
The format of the header file is controlled by the MAILHEADER and NEWSHEADER
environment variables.
.Ip %H 8
Host name (your machine's name).
.Ip %i 8
\*(L"Message-I.D.:\*(R" line from the current article, with <> guaranteed.

	R	Resubscribe to this newsgroup?
.fi
.Sp
Note that yes/no questions are all upper-case modes.
If, for example, you wanted to disallow defaults on all yes/no questions,
you could define the following macro:
.Sp
.nf
\e040	%(%m=[A-Z]?h: )
.fi
.Ip %M 8
The number of articles marked to return via the \*(L'M\*(R' command.

\*(L"Newsgroups:\*(R" line from the current article.
.Ip %N 8
Full name (yours).
.Ip %o 8
Organization (yours).

lines of the current article.
This always returns an Internet format address.
.Ip %T 8
\*(L"To:\*(R" line derived from the \*(L"Path:\*(R" line of the
current article to produce a uucp path.
.Ip %u 8
The number of unread articles in the current newsgroup.
.Ip %U 8
The number of unread articles in the current newsgroup, not counting the
the current article.
When threads are selected, this count reflects only selected articles.
.Ip %v 8
The number of unselected articles, not counting the current article
if it is unselected.
.Ip %w 8
The directory where mthreads keeps its tmp files.
.Ip %W 8
The directory where thread files are placed.

.Ip %[name] 8
The value of header line \*(L"Name:\*(R" from the current article.
The \*(L"Name:\ \*(R" is not included.
For example \*(L"%D\*(R" and \*(L"%[distribution]\*(R" are equivalent.
The name must be spelled out in full.
.Ip %`command` 8
Inserts the output of the command, with any embedded newlines translated
to space.
.Ip %""prompt"" 8
Prints prompt on the terminal, then inputs one string, and inserts it.
.Ip "%(test_text=pattern?then_text:else_text)" 8
If
.I test_text
matches
.IR pattern ,
has the value
.IR then_text ,
otherwise
.IR else_text .
The \*(L":else_text\*(R" is optional, and if absent, interpolates the null string.
The = may be replaced with != to negate the test.
To quote any of the metacharacters
(\*(L'=\*(R', \*(L'?\*(R', \*(L':\*(R', or \*(L')\*(R'),
precede with a backslash.
.Ip %digit 8
The digits 1 through 9 interpolate the string matched by the nth bracket
in the last pattern match that had brackets.
If the last pattern had alternatives, you may not know the number of the
bracket you want\*(--%0 will give you the last bracket matched.
.PP
Modifiers: to capitalize the first letter, insert \*(L'^\*(R':
\*(L"%^C\*(R" produces something like \*(L"Net.jokes\*(R".
Inserting \*(L'_\*(R' causes the first letter following the last
\&\*(L'/\*(R' to be capitalized: \*(L"%_c\*(R" produces \*(L"net/Jokes\*(R".
.PP
Inserting \*(L'\\\*(R' will insert a backslash before
any characters that would be magic in a regular expression:
\*L"%\\C\*(R" produces \*(L"net\\.jokes\*(R".
This is called regexp quoting.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables are paid attention to by
.IR trn .
In general the default values assumed for these variables by
.I trn
are reasonable, so if you are using
.I trn
for the first time, you can safely ignore this section.
Note that the defaults below may not correspond precisely to the defaults
on your system.
To find the actual defaults you would need to look in config.h and common.h
in the trn source directory, and the file INIT in the trn library.
.PP
Those variables marked (%) are subject to % interpolation, and those marked
(~) are subject to both % interpolation and ~ interpretation.
.Ip "ATTRIBUTION (%)" 8
Gives the format of the attribution line in front of the quoted article
included by an F command.
.Sp
Default: In article %i %f writes:
.Ip "AUTOSUBSCRIBE" 8
When
.I trn
is checking for new newsgroups and finds one
matching one of the patterns in AUTOSUBSCRIBE, the new group is
automatically added to the end of the .newsrc, subscribed.
Newsgroups not matching this or AUTOUNSUBSCRIBE, below, are offered
to the user.
.Sp
AUTOSUBSCRIBE is a comma separated list of newsgroup patterns ala
\*(L'o\*(R', \*(L'/\*(R', etc.
It can also include \*(L"but not\*(R" entries preceded by \*(L'!\*(R'.
\*(L"a,b,!c,d\*(R" is read as \*(L"matching a or b, unless it also
matches c; matching d regardless\*(R".
Another way to look at it is \*(L"(((a or b) and not c) or d)\*(R".
To automatically subscribe to all local
groups but be choosy about non-local groups, one might say \*(L"*,!*.*\*(R".
.Sp
Default: (none)
.Ip "AUTOUNSUBSCRIBE" 8
AUTOUNSUBSCRIBE is very similar to AUTOSUBSCRIBE, above, but
new newsgroups matching it are automatically added to the end
of the .newsrc file, unsubscribed.
If a newsgroup matches AUTOSUBSCRIBE, AUTOUNSUBSCRIBE is not consulted.
.Sp
Default: (none)
.Ip "CANCEL (~)" 8
The shell command used to cancel an article.
.Sp
Default: inews \-h < %h
.Ip "CANCELHEADER (%)" 8 13v

.Sp
The default in an unthreaded group is approximately:
.Sp
Article %a %(%U%M!=^00$?(%U more%(%M!=^0$? + %M Marked to return)\e) )in %C:
.Sp
While the default in a threaded group is almost:
.Sp
%C #%a%(%Z=^0$?%(%U!=^0$? (%U more\e)): (%U + %v more\e))
.Ip HIDELINE 8
If defined, contains a regular expression which matches article lines to
be hidden, in order, for instance, to suppress quoted material.
A recommended string for this purpose is \*(L"^>...\*(R", which \fIdoesn't\fR
hide lines with only \*(L'>\*(R', to give some indication that quoted
material is being skipped.
If you want to hide more than one pattern, you can use \*(L"\||\|\*(R" to
separate the alternatives.
You can view the hidden lines by restarting the article with the \*(L'v\*(R'
command.
.Sp
There is some overhead involved in matching each line of the article against
a regular expression.
You might wish to use a baud-rate modifier to enable this feature only at
low baud rates.
.Sp
Default: undefined
.Ip HOME 8
Your home directory.
Affects ~ interpretation, and the location of your
dot files if DOTDIR is not defined.
.Sp

and the search modifier \*(L'K\*(R'.
.Sp
Default: %p/%c/KILL
.Ip LOGDIR 8
Your home directory if HOME is undefined.

Your login name, if USER is undefined.
May be interpolated using \*(L"%L\*(R".
.Sp
Default: value of getlogin().
.Ip LOCALTIMEFMT 8
The format used by strftime() to print the local time.
The Date line is only displayed in local time if the group is threaded
(see the \-H option for more information on Date).
.Sp
Default: %a %b %e %X %Z %Y
.Sp
which is the same format as the
.IR date (1)
command.
.Ip "MAILCALL (~)" 8

.Ip "MBOXSAVER (~)" 8
The shell command to save an article in mailbox format.
.Sp
Default: %X/mbox.saver %A %P %c %a %B %C "%b" \e
.br

The eighth argument to the shell script is the new From: line
for the article, including the posting date,
derived either directly from the Posted: line, or not-so-directly from
the Date: line.
Header munging at its finest.
.Ip MODSTRING 8

in use.
NEWSORG will override ORGANIZATION if both are present.)
May be interpolated using \*(L"%o\*(R".
.Sp
Default: whatever your news administrator compiled in.
.Ip "NEWSPOSTER (~)" 8
The shell command to be used by the followup commands (f and F)
in order to allow you to enter and post a followup news article.

(If NEWSORG is set, it will override ORGANIZATION.)
May be interpolated using \*(L"%o\*(R".
.Sp
Default: whatever your news administrator compiled in.
.Ip PAGESTOP 8
If defined, contains a regular expression which matches article lines to
be treated as form-feeds.
There are at least two things you might want to do with this.
To cause page breaks between articles in a digest, you might define it
as \*(L"^--------\*(R".
To force a page break before a signature, you could define it
as \*(L"^-- $\*(R".
(Then, when you see \*(L"--\*(R" at the bottom of the page, you can skip
the signature if you so desire by typing \*(L'n\*(R' instead of space.)
To do both, you could use \*(L"^--\*(R".
If you want to break on more than one pattern, you can use \*(L"\||\|\*(R" to
separate the alternatives.
.Sp
There is some overhead involved in matching each line of the article against
a regular expression.
You might wish to use a baud-rate modifier to enable this feature only at
low baud rates.
.Sp
Default: undefined
.Ip "PIPESAVER (%)" 8
The shell command to execute in order to accomplish a save to a pipe
(\*(L"s\ |\ command\*(R" or \*(L"w\ |\ command\*(R").
The command typed by the user is substituted in as %b.
.Sp
Default: %(%B=^0$?<%A:tail +%Bc %A |) %b

the command is \*(L"tail +%Bc %A | %b\*(R".
.Ip REPLYTO 8
The value of the \*(L"Reply-To:\*(R" header, if needed.
.Sp Default: %L@%H (%N)
.Ip RNINIT 8
Default values for switches may be passed to
.I trn
by placing them in either RNINIT or TRNINIT.
RNINIT is used when in rn-compatibility mode or if TRNINIT isn't found.
Any switch that is set in this way may be overruled 
on the command line, or via the \*(L'&\*(R' command from within
.IR trn .
Binary-valued switches that are set with \*(L"\-switch\*(R" may be unset
using \*(L"+switch\*(R".
.Sp
If RNINIT begins with a \*(L'/\*(R' it is assumed to be the name of a file
containing switches.
If you want to set many environment variables but don't want to keep
them all in your environment, or if the use of any of these variables
conflicts with other programs, you can use this feature along with the
.B \-E
switch to set the environment variables upon startup.

is set: %^C
.Ip "SELECTCHARS" 8
The characters used by the thread selector to select the associated thread
of discussion.
You can specify up to 64 visible characters, including upper- and lower-case
letters, numbers, and many punctuation characters.
Selection characters override command characters in the selector, but are
not excluded from macro expansion, so be careful.
.br
Default: abcdefgijlorstuvwxz1234567890
.br
(h, k, n, p, q, and y are omitted to allow them to be typed as commands).
.Ip SHELL 8
The name of your preferred shell.
It will be used by the \*(L'!\*(R', \*(L'S\*(R' and \*(L'W\*(R' commands.
.Sp
Default: whatever your news administrator compiled in.
.Ip "SUBJLINE (%)" 8
Controls the format of the lines displayed by the \*(L'=\*(R' command at
the article selection level.
.Sp
Default: %s
.Ip "SUPERSEDEHEADER (%)" 8 16v

Default: $LOGNAME
.Ip "VISUAL (~)" 8
The name of your editor.
.Sp
Default: $EDITOR
.Ip "YOUSAID (%)" 8
Gives the format of the attribution line in front of the quoted article
included by an R command.
.Sp
Default: In article %i you write:
.SH MACROS
When
.I trn
starts up, it looks for a file containing macro definitions (see environment
variable RNMACRO).
Any sequence of commands may be bound to any sequence of keys, so you
could remap your entire keyboard if you desire.
Blank lines or lines beginning with # in the macro file are considered
comments; otherwise
.I trn
looks for two fields separated by white space.
The first field gives the sequence of keystrokes that trigger the macro,
and the second field gives the sequence of commands to execute.
Both fields are subject to % interpolation, which will also translate
backslash and uparrow sequences.
(The keystroke field is interpreted at startup time, but the command field
is interpreted at macro execution time so that you may refer to % values
in a macro.)
For example, if you want to reverse the roles of carriage return and
space in
.I trn
.Sp
^J	\e040
.br
^M	\e040
.br
\e040	^J
.Sp
will do just that.
By default, all characters in the command field are interpreted as the
canonical
.I trn
characters, i.e. no macro expansion is done.
Otherwise the above pair of macros would cause an infinite loop.
To force macro expansion in the command field, enclose the
macro call with ^( ... ^) thusly:
.Sp
@s	|mysavescript

You can use the %() conditional construct to construct macros that work
differently under different circumstances.
In particular, the current mode (%m) of
.I trn
could be used to make a command that only works at a particular level.
This is particularly vital for the thread selector, which uses most of
the lower-case letters to select the associated thread of discussion.
For example,
.Sp
a	%(%m=t?a:s art.hold\en)
.Sp
will return the original letter (a) in the thread selector, and the command
\*(L"s art.hold\en\*(R" everywhere else.
.Sp
%(%{TERM}=vt100?^[[O)	/^J
.Sp
will do the binding only if the terminal type is vt100,
though if you have many of these it would be better to have separate
files for each terminal.
.Sp
If you want to bind a macro to a function key that puts a common garbage character
after the sequence (such as the carriage return on the end of Televideo 920
function sequences), DO NOT put the carriage return
into all the sequences or you will waste a CONSIDERABLE amount of internal
storage.
Instead of \*(L"^AF^M\*(R", put \*(L"^AF+1\*(R", which indicates to
.I trn
that it should gobble up one character after the F.
.SH "WHAT'S NEW?"
Here's a quick run-down of
.IR trn 's
new features and commands aimed at the knowledgeable
.I rn
user.
.Sp
One of the biggest improvements is the Thread Selector, which is bound
to the \*(L'+\*(R' key.
The selector displays a list of subject threads and (by default) authors
to allow you to select the topics that interest you by typing their
associated letter.
The thread selector can also be used to browse articles that have already
been read, to selectively re-read discussions (use the \*(L'U\*(R' command).
.Sp
Another big improvement is the thread-ordered display of articles.
While reading each topic,
.I trn
displays each article and its replies in the order of their parent/child
relationship.
This lets you follow the flow of the discussion better, instead of jumping
around from idea to idea or even reading a reply before the original article.
.Sp
Along this same line is the addition of the article-tree display in the
upper-right corner of the header.
Glancing at the tree gives you a better feel for how the articles you are
reading relate to each other.
.Sp
The header has also been modified to hide a few more header-lines by default
(e.g. References), but, as always, you can override these with \-h.
There is also some new \*(L"magic\*(R" in the header: the From header is
trimmed to be just the comment portion (if available), and the Date header
is displayed in local time (in threaded groups).
Override these defaults with +H.
.Sp
Once you begin reading articles, use the regular movement commands (n, N,
p, P, etc.) as you normally would.
Then, check out the [, ], {, and } commands to move around in the article
tree a bit more directly.
For example, the \*(L'[\*(R' command takes you to your parent article,
even if it was already read, which is very useful for tracking down the
cited portion of the article in its original context.
.Sp
There are additional kill commands for the entire thread (J) and the
current article and all its replies (,).
The KILL files have been extended to allow killing by thread (T), which will
kill a topic even if people fine-tune the subject along the way.
.Sp
There is also an easy way to skip around among the various threads with
the < and > commands.
.Sp
Note:  your news administrator has the option of turning thread processing
off for individual groups, and thus it is possible for some groups to not
have any pre-processed thread information available for use.
When
.I trn
encounters such a group, it generates the thread information on the fly
while entering the group.
For really large groups (or really slow systems), this can take an
appreciable amount of time.
If you can't talk your news administrator into pre-threading the group,
you can turn off the thread database on a group-by-group basis using
the \*(L't\*(R' command at the newsgroup selection level.
Groups turned off in this way are read in the traditional
.I rn
fashion\*(--articles arranged in arrival order with optional subject
searching and no thread selector.
.Sp
There is a new command, \*(L"e dir\*(R", that extracts a shell archive or
uuencoded file into the specified directory.
It is even possible to extract other data formats if you specify the
appropriate filter command (e.g. \*(L"e dir|cmd\*(R".
.Sp
Also, if you plan to use macro definitions, it is good to keep in mind
that the thread selector uses most of the lower-case letters for thread
selection, and thus it is a good idea to explicitly set the mode(s) in
which a macro applies.
For example, if you want to press 'f' from the article pager/selector to
forward the current article to the user \*(L"smith\*(R", you could define:
.Sp
.nf
	f	%(%m=[pa]?|mail smith\en:f)
.fi
.Sp
This checks the current mode (%m) and if it is \*(L'p\*(R' or \*(L'a\*(R'
it expands it to the string \*(L"|mail smith\en\*(R", otherwise it returns
the letter \*(L'f\*(R'.
In some cases, you may simply wish to exclude the thread selector from a
macro with the conditional \*(L"%m!=t\*(R".
.Sp
Finally, you'll probably want to use the new options,
.B \-x
and
.B \-X
to ensure that all the newest features are available for use.
These options might be on by default, depending on how your administrator
decided to install
.IR trn .

Generally self-documenting, as they say.
.SH BUGS
The
.B \-h
switch can only hide header lines that
.I trn
knows about.
.PP
The \*(L'\-\*(R' command doesn't cross newsgroup boundaries, and only undoes
the last article selection.
.PP
If you edit your
.I .newsrc
while
.I trn
is running,
.I trn
will happily wipe out your changes when it decides to
write out the
.I .newsrc
file.
.PP
Marking of duplicate articles as read in cross-referenced newsgroups will
not work unless the Xref patch is installed in inews.
.PP
If you get carried away with % or escape substitutions, you can overflow
buffers.
.PP
There should be no fixed limit on the number of newsgroups.
.PP
Some of the more esoteric features may be missing on machines with limited
address space.
