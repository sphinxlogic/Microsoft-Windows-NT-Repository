@(#)PATCHES_TO_STOCK_TAYLOR1.04	1.1 (30 Sep 1993)

TSLIP (dial-on-demand slip) requires Taylor UUCP 1.04 with two small patches.  

An already-patched Taylor UUCP distribution may have been distributed along
with this TSLIP package.  If not, or if you already have Taylor UUCP 1.04 and 
don't want to replace it, apply the following patches to Taylor 1.04.  

If you have some other version than 1.04, check the patches carefully.

The (patched) Taylor UUCP distribution must be built before the tslip
package, because various taylor object files are linked in with the slipd
daemon.  

The tslip configure script will locate the Taylor build directory automatically
if it is in the same parent as tslip (or in a few other places).  If not, the
configure script will complain, and you'll have to edit "guess_tuucpsrc"
to indicate the location of the Taylor UUCP build tree.
