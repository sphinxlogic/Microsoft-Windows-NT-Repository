The IP driver in SVR4.0.2 for i386 has a bug which crashes the system when
using point-to-point links.  The Driver.o in this directory is said to
be an ip driver with this bug fixed.  You can install it if necessary
as /etc/conf/pack.d/ip/Driver.o .

This ip driver binary was extracted from 
ftp.tcp.com:/pub/SVR4/slip/slip.tar.gz on 6/23/93.

There is no corresponding source file.

P.S.  The stock IP driver in ESIX SVR4.0.4 has worked fine for me.
