# @(#)mk_idfiles.sh.in	1.2 (13 Oct 1993)

# This shell script creates Master, Node, and System files, using the driver 
# name provided by configure (DRIVER_NAME).  We can't just let configure
# create Master from a Master.in, etc., because configure prepends a
# line like "#created automatically by configure..." which confuses idinstall.
