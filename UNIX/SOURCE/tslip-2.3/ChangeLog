@(#)ChangeLog	1.2 (13 Oct 1993)

Wed Oct 13 08:46:36 PDT 1993  Jim Avera
    * Version 2.3
    * driver/io/tslip.c: ALL state is now dynamically allocated.  
      There is no hard limit on the number of minor devices in use.
      Put open/close logging back under #ifdef DEBUG
    * driver/ID/Space.c: Deleted (no longer used - nothing to configure).
    * driver/ID/mk_ID.sh.in: New.
    * Renamed the driver "tslip" (was "slp"), to permit co-existence with
      another slip driver named slp.  This required changing all entry point
      names (from slp_ to tsl_).  The driver name is now a parameter supplied 
      in configure.in.
    * dialin/mkslipuser.c: Use TCP for DNS queries (patch from Peter Wemm).
    * configure.in: DRIVER_NAME substitution, call warn_of_sasbug.
    * PATCHES_TO_SAS-1.25, warn_of_sasbug: New.
    * IP.SKETCH: New.

    utils/slipdlogsum added - program to summarize slipd log file
    utils/slipcmd: Fixed various bugs.  Added -w opt to wait for dial-out.
    configure.in: Major rev.  Added sysdep.h, acconfig.h.
    utils/slipd.c: flushes input after dialing and before I_LINK (just in case).
    driver/io/slp.c: Restore auto-compress to uncompressed after each new
	connection; Minor logging changes.
    configure,configure.in,Makefile.in: Allow different Taylor obj & src dirs.

    Use configure (gnu autoconf) [but it still only works with SVR4.0...]

    Makefile(s): Added DVRCC in Makefiles to allow use of gcc except for driver.
    Changed sbindir to $(prefix)/lib/slip [was $(prefix)/lib/uucp];
    Added mksourcedirs script.

    **NOTE** Old binaries must be manually de-installed from $(prefix)/lib/uucp.

    man/*: Rewrite of driver man page and renamed as slp.7.  Substantial
    editing of others.  Removed slhangup man page (obsolete) and references.

    **NOTE** Old slip.* and slhangup.* man pages must be manually de-installed.

    driver/io/slp.c: Changed spl(oldpri) to splx(oldpri) [fr Peter Wemm].
    Added checks for insane conditions (data arriving from unlinked driver).

    utils/slipd_tuucp.c: Patch for multiple phone numbers (copied from
    corresponding fix to Taylor cu.c -- from peter@zeus.dialix.oz.au).

    utils/Makefile: Install slipcmd as suid root.

    Slipd now always logs ON and OFF times, with elapsed times.
