tslip wish list
---------------

1. Make the server-support tools work and write installation notes for them.
   NOTE: There are a couple of people working on this now.  Before spending
	 effort here, you should probably contact jima@netcom.com.

1.5  (URGENT) 
     Adapt tslip to work with svr4.2.  Currently [7/93] tslip (and ancestor 
     slip drivers) won't work with svr4.2, apparently due to new expectations
     by the 4.2 ip driver.  If you want to work on this, get the DLPI
     spec (ftp from ui.org).
     
2. (done)

3. Build a pkgadd-able binary distribution.

4. Type "slip: dialing server..." on the control terminal of the users
   whose packets are queued pending dial-out (somehow).

5. Permit dialing parameters and the timeout to be dynamically changed.
   At the moment, they can only be set before the slip driver is linked
   under IP (because the operations must be performed on the appropriate minor 
   device, which is not directly accessable after linking under ip).
   The solution is to provide a meta-operation ioctl which applies any
   ioctl call to an arbitrary minor device (perhaps specified using the
   interface name), analogous to the current SLP_MOVE_LOWER operation.

6. Done.

7. Find a PPP driver and adapt it to work alongside slip, with the
   same daemon, etc.   Peter Wemm has some good ideas about this.

8. Make driver debug output (including packet tracing) controlled dynamically 
   via ioctls (with command support in slipd or some other utility program).  
   The debug code would be compiled in only with -DDEBUG.
