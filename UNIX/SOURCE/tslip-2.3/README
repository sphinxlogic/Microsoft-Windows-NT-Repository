Welcome to tslip - 

Tslip implements SLIP network links with automatic dial-on-demand and idle
disconnect using Taylor UUCP dialing routines.

  Note: Ian Lance Taylor wrote Taylor UUCP, but had nothing to do with tslip --
  so please don't bother him for anything related to this package.

Tslip requires that Taylor UUCP 1.04 (with patches) be compiled first.
Several .o and .a files from the Taylor build directory are linked into the 
slip dialing daemon (slipd).  

Put the Taylor UUCP source directory in the same parent as tslip, if you can.
Otherwise edit the file guess_tuucpsrc to indicate the correct path.

NOTE: The following instructions apply to ESIX SVR4.04.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Patch and compile Taylor uucp-1.04 (see file PATCHES_TO_STOCK_TAYLOR1.04).

In tslip:

2. Run "configure".  This creates various system-dependent files.  By default,
   programs will be installed in /usr/local/lib/slip, but you can substitute
   another directory for "/usr/local" by running "configure --prefix=otherdir".

3. make 				...in the top directory
5. If using SVR4.0.2 on i386, read driver/v2.ip.fix/README.v2ipfix
4. (as root) make install		...install programs and driver
6. (as root) /etc/conf/bin/idbuild	...rebuild your kernel
7. Edit /etc/inet/rc.inet as explained below
8. Reboot

Note: You do not have to *install* Taylor UUCP.  You can use your regular 
(non-Taylor) uucp setup files for tslip dial-out if you compile Taylor 
uucp-1.04 using the appropriate options (probably HAVE_HDB_CONFIG).
Please read the Taylor uucp-1.04 README and policy.h files.

For clients (who dial out to servers) add lines to /etc/inet/rc.inet which:
  - Start "slipd", the autodial/supervisory daemon.
  - Run "slattach" to configure each slip interface and give autodial info.
  - Use "ifconfig" to assign IP addresses to each slip interface. 
  - Use "route" to tell the kernel to route packets to the slip interface(s).
  [see example below]

For servers (who accept dial-IN slip clients):
  Server support tools (by Greg Whitehead and Geoff Arnold) are in the
  "dialin" subdirectory, BUT HAVEN'T YET BEEN TESTED with the new daemon and
  don't work yet with tslip.
  
  I'd really appreciate it if someone would wring out the server tools on SVR4 
  and send me advice and any corrections, both of which will be incorporated
  into a later release.

  In general, the login shell for slip dial-up accounts should configure the 
  line as a slip link after login and tear it down when SIGHUP is received.
  The dialin tools provided will dynamically assign IP addresses to dial-in 
  slip connections (and prevent duplicates).  


======================= CLIENT EXAMPLE ===========================

Scenario: The only network connection is a dial-up slip link to an internet 
gateway.  You must dial the machine "slipserv" (as it is known to uucp) and 
log in, wait for the message "slip session beginning....", and then convert
the line to a slip link.  You want the call to be dropped after 3 idle 
minutes (and automatically re-dialed when needed).

**FIRST**
Configure uucp so that "cu slipserv" dials up the slip server machine.
Also define a login chat script, as would be used by uucico.
The way you do this depends on whether you built Taylor UUCP to use Taylor-style
configuration files or HDB config files (see the Taylor documentation).

For HDB configuration, the Systems file should contain a line like this:

slipserv Any ACU 19200 <phonenumber> ogin:-\r\c-ogin: <logname>\r\c word: <password>\r\c beginning....

and the Devices file should contain a line similar to this:

ACU tty00,M - 19200 hayes -

For Taylor-style configuration and a pre-set-up modem, the "sys" file might 
have lines like the following:

system slipserv
phone <phonenumber>
baud 19200
port device /dev/tty00
# s190=1 disables compression (on a Telebit Worldblazer modem)
port dialer chat "" ATs190=1DT\T\r\c CONNECT
port dialer chat-fail \nRING\r
port dialer chat-fail ANSWER
port dialer chat-fail BUSY
port dialer chat-fail ERROR
port dialer chat-fail NO\sCARRIER
chat ogin: <logname>\r\c ssword: <password>\r\c beginning....
chat-fail NO\sCARRIER


**SECOND**
Put lines in /etc/inet/rc.inet like the following (supply full
path names for slattach and slipd):

SLLOG=/var/adm/slip.log
slipd -v >$SLLOG 2>&1; chmod 700 $SLLOG

  slipd is the auto-dial daemon, and must be running to actually use the
  link (packets are harmlessly dropped if the daemon is not running).
  The driver sends slipd the dial parameter string when a dial-out is needed.
  -v means log slipd actions to stderr.  Also, if "-d" is in a dial parameter 
  string given to slattach, slipd will emit dial-out logging just like "cu".
  The log should be secure because it may show server passwords.

slattach -a "-d slipserv" -t180 -p sl0

  slattach configures the network interface "sl0" as a slip link.
  You can use any name ending in digits.  -a means auto-dial on demand.
  The auto-dial parameter string "-d slipserv" is stored in the driver, along
  with a 180-second idle timeout value.  In this case, the system "slipserv"
  will be dialed, with debug logging.  Dialing is performed by slipd.
  -p means use persistent links to construct the interface (you can 
  omit -p for testing and run slattach in background; slattach will sleep until 
  interrupted, at which time the link will be dismantled).

/usr/sbin/ifconfig sl0 sl0_ip_addr slipserv_gw_ip_addr up -trailers

  ifconif tells the system that network interface "sl0" has IP 
  address <sl0_ip_addr> and is connected directly to <slipserv_gw_ip_addr>.  
  Names in /etc/hosts may be used.  A unique but fictitious 
  <slipserv_gw_ip_addr> may be used if the true address of the other end is
  not known.  <slipserv_gw_ip_addr> is used only as a target for
  packet routing inside the client.  "-trailers", in the case of the slip 
  driver, enables Van Jacobson packet compression (see driver/io/slp.c).

/usr/sbin/route add default slipserv_gw_ip_addr 0

  The "route" command is used to tell the kernel to forward packets to
  <slipserv_gw_ip_addr> if no explicit route is known.  Since this is on the
  same network as <sl0_ip_addr>, the kernel routes packets to the slip
  interface.  If you have other networks (e.g., a LAN), you may want to
  specify an explicit network or host route instead.

NOTE: The ESIX installation notes imply that subnetting doesn't work for 
point-to-point networks, in which case a unique network number would have
to be assigned to each slip link.  However, one SVR4.0.4 user has reported
that subnetting DOES appear to work, at least with class B networks.  

SAS USERS: The sas-1.25 serial port driver (available from the net)
has a bug which crashes the system when receiving at high speeds.  If you
use sas-1.25, apply the patch in PATCHES_TO_SAS-1.25.  
Tslip does NOT require use of sas.
