#
# Warn the user if the unpatched SAS 1.25 serial driver may be in use.
#
# SAS is by no means required (tslip works with any streams serial driver, 
# including the vendor-supplied asy).  However, many sites use SAS because
# it offers deterministic hardware flow control, supports buffered serial
# ports (1.2550A chips), high speeds (57600 and 1.25200 baud), and, with 
# a patch, reliable operation.
#
# However, there is a serious bug in sas-1.25 which will panic the kernel
# during sustained high-speed reception.  A patch is included with tslip.
#
# This script warns the user to install the patch if it appears to be needed.


# Look around for the sas source tree
