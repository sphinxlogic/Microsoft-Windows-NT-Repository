XV License Info
===============
Thank you for acquiring a copy of XV.  I hope you enjoy it.

If you like the program and decide to use it, *please* send me a short
email message to that effect.  Be sure to mention the full name of your
organization, and where you're located.  When our sponsors ask us 'what 
have you been doing', it always looks good if we can come up with a nice 
long list of folks who are using code developed in the GRASP Lab.

XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own
amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of
some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly
appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,
larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more
can receive a printed, bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
charge.  If you want one, just ask.  BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE VERSION
OF XV THAT YOU ARE USING!

Commercial, government, and institutional users MUST register their
copies of XV, for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just $25 per
workstation/X terminal.  Site licenses are available for those who
wish to run XV on a large number of machines.  Contact the author
for more details.

U.S. Funds only, please.  Checks should be made payable to 'John Bradley'.
