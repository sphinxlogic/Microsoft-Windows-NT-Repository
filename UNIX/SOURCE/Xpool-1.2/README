Here is the new version of the game xpool.
If you have the version 1.1, just delete it.
If you have xmkmf, just run it and ti should create Makefile.
Then type 'make' to compile.

Example;
%xmkmf

%make


I am also including the good old Makefile. If you dont have xmkmf
just type 

make -f Makefile.old

to compile, it should do it.

I improved the game's speed a little , but I guess the big improvement
would be using scaled integers, currently, we are using 'float', do it later.
if anybody wants to create better balls, just edit .bmp files (with bitmap) in
'include' and recompile.

My thanks to those who were kind enough to send their comments,
suggestions and complaints.

Not: If you are interested in the theory, get a printout of the file
 'theory.ps'. It shows you the basic idea behind this game.
  Sorry, I forgot to put this file in version 1.1, it should come with
  the game's source code.
