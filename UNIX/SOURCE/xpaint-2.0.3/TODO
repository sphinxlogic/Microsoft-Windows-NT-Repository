Ah, the wish list:

Probably in 2.1:
	Spray can should have gaussian distrubution.
	Fatbits active region marker, and manipulator.
	Make point size selectable for fonts if scalable fonts exist
	Invert, Rotate selected region
	Editable Brush Patterns
	Patterns should support grabbing from enviornment
	Support more image formats for reading/writing (XPM at least)
	Work on the colormap usage.
	Have a color wheel, or some better method of selecting the color.
	Correct cursor for fatbits paint.

Probably in 3.0 (don't expect this for a LONG while):
	File Browser
	Better Help information (system?)
	Line style should be selectable better than the menu
	Colormaps and 24 bit images need to be done better
	Fatbits needs cut/copy/paste
	Even better cut/copy/paste
	Some method of doing "blend" operations (color in HUE)
	More default patterns (maybe some color ones!).
	Organizing the colors/patterns into a better setup
	Use the default colormap as long a possible before creating own
	Chroma Key Cut
