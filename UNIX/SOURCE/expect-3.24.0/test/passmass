# passmass: change password on many machines
# Synopsis: passmass host1 host2 host3 ....
# Don Libes - March 11, 1991

# Description: Change passwords on the named machines.
#
# You are prompted for old/new passwords.  (If you are changing root
# passwords and have equivalencing, the old password is not used and may be
# omitted.)
# 
# Additional arguments may be used for fine tuning.  They affect all hosts
# which follow until another argument overrides.
#
#   -user	User whose password will be changed.  By default, the current
#		user is used.
#   -rlogin	Use rlogin to access host.  (default)
#   -telnet	Use telnet to access host.
#   -program	Next argument is taken as program to run to set password.
#		Default is "passwd".  Other common choices are "yppasswd" and
#		"set passwd (e.g., VMS hosts).
#   -prompt	Next argument is taken as a prompt suffix pattern.  This allows
#		the script to know when the shell is prompting.  The default is
#		"# " for root and "% " for non-root accounts.  Note that spaces
#		must be escaped by "\" in prompts and should be quoted
#		sufficiently to protect again unwanted shell massaging.
#   -timeout	Next argument is number of seconds to wait for responses.
#		Default is 30 but some systems can be much slower logging in.

# The best way to run this is to put the command in a one-line shell script
# or alias. (Presumably, the set of hosts and parameters will rarely change.)
# Then run it whenever you want to change your passwords on all the hosts.
