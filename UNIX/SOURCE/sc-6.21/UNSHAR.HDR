Subject: Sc6.20 -> Sc6.21 upgrade (FIX, please apply)


Somehow when sending 6.20 to you I sent old gram.y, interp.c, format.c
files. This will bring Sc to the proper revision. Whew.

Sc6.21 is now the official release.

I am also cc:'ing you the comp.sources.misc patches.

Thank you for all your efforts.
