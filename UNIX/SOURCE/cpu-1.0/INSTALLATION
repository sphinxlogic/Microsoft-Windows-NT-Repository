You need to do a few things. This is principally because the shell
script in cpus.sh creates input for the executable produced from
cpus.c.

0) Change the INCLUDES line in the Makefile to point to your X
   include directory.

1) Type 'make' to create the cpus executable.

2) Edit cpus.sh and follow the instructions there.

3) Install cpus.sh (rename it to cpus) somewhere in your path.

4) Add some reseources to your ~/.Xdefaults (for an example,
   look in Cpus.ad).

5) Type 'make cpus.cat' to format a man page. Install this (and
   the original nroff in cpus.1) under /usr/local/man or wherever
   you want the man page to live.

Now you should be able to run (the shell script) cpus that you
installed in step 3 above. Actually, steps 4 and 5 are not necessary
to make it run - it just wont look so good and there'll be no man
page.
