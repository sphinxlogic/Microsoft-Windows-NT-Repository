This library provides some widgets for use with the standard X11R4
toolkit.  It also redefines some of the Athena widgets with added
functionality.

See the header files in ../include for details on the resources the
former use and functionality they provide.

The Fontview widget is no longer used by any program here.  It's
included for your hacking pleasure.
