This program adds sidebearings to a bitmap font, and outputs a revised
bitmap font and a TFM file.  It reads several auxiliary ``character
metric information'' (CMI) files to determine the side bearings.

The ideas behind the CMI files are based on Harry Smith's (Linotype)
principles, as explicated by Walter Tracy in his book `Letters of
Credit'.  (A book we highly recommend for those interested in type.)
