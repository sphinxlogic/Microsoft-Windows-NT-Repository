	* Version 0.6.

Sat Oct 24 05:03:22 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

	* gsrf.in: Don't give -encoding to imageto if the user didn't give
	us an encoding.

	* writefont.PS (find-encoding): New routine.
	* gsrf.in: Pass a sentinel to use the input encoding by default.

	* gsrf.in: Take only the first occurrence in the map file.

	* GNUmakefile (extraclean): Remove all the temp files we might create.

	* input-pbm.c (pbm_get_block): Go back to finding the first
	all-white row after the block.  Will I ever learn?  We are now
	almost entirely back to the original code, except that we only
	skip at most BLANK_COUNT white rows.  If I had just fixed that bug
	in the first place, I would have been done three days ago.

	* writefont.PS (set-char-variables): We can output /space now.
        (output-space-char, number-buffer): Delete.
        * gsrf.in: Don't do the fontconvert -space stuff.

	* input-pbm.c (pbm_get_block): Don't read the blank rows into the
	bitmap we return.

	* writefont.PS (compute-max-char-dimens): Round char-height when
	moving, so the character doesn't get out of its block.

	* input-pbm.c (get_row): Go back to stdout for the scanline trace.

	of scanlines.

	* writefont.PS (encoding-chars-present-3): Set the current point
	before trying to render anything.

	* writefont.PS (type3-setfont): Copy the dictionary before calling
	definefont.

	to be rendered, not the character name.

	* writefont.PS (type3-render-p, type3-setfont,
	encoding-chars-present{,-[13]}): New routines.

        (input-filename): New argument to program.
        (reencode-file): Read input-filename if the fontname is unknown to GS.

	* gsrf.in: Specify ./<filename> to gftopk.

	* gsrf.in: Specify the .pbm extension explicitly to imageto, in
	case the filename has a `.' in it.

	* main.c (main): Output to standard output if no output file is
	specified.
        (read_command_line): Output the version info to stderr.
        * gsrf.in: Redirect output from bbcount.

Sat Oct 17 08:36:45 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

	* writefont.PS (set-font): Do `setfont' after `scalefont'.

	* writefont.PS (reencode-font): Test for the various keys we don't
	copy properly -- we were dup'ing the truth value.

Sun Oct 11 15:14:27 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

	* writefont.PS (set-font): Use findfont scalefont instead of
	selectfont, in case Ghostscript wasn't installed with level 2 features.

	* gsrf.in: Remove a PK file so fontconvert will always read the
	newly-output GF file.

	* gsrf.in: Don't pass -clean-threshold to imageto, since it's no
	longer an option.

Tue Sep 22 14:50:47 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

        * gsrf.in: specify -clean-threshold=100, so we don't throw away
          parts of our characters.

Mon Sep 21 13:00:57 1992  Karl Berry  (karl@cs.umb.edu)

        * gsrf.in: use -eq, not =, to see if we should make a space character.

          already done automatically), fixifibb.awk, and writefont.PS.

        * GNUmakefile (gsrenderfont): make the result of the sed
          executable.

        * writefont.PS (open-encoding-file): use = for the error message,
          not ==.

        * gsrf.in: apparently some awk's don't have getline, so explicitly
          call gawk.

        * gsrf.in (-map, -map=): assign to `map_file', not the
          (nonexistent) `mapfile'.

        * input-pbm.c (pbm_get_block): if one of the last few scanlines
          that is supposed to be blank isn't, then save it and return,

        * writefont.PS (bounding-boxes): add many accented characters to
          the dictionary.

        * writefont.PS (reencode-font): new routine; we now reencode the
          font instead of keeping its original encoding, so we can get at
          characters that Adobe did not encode.

        * writefont.PS (make-image-device): update the call to
          makeimagedevice for the new version of Ghostscript -- the
          palette is specified differently.

        * writefont.PS: read a .enc file, instead of duplicating the
          information in dictionaries.
        (parse-encoding-file, open-encoding-file, encoding-line): new routines.

        * gsrenderfnt.PS: rename to `writefont.PS', so avoid dumb
          autosaving errors.  Hmph.
