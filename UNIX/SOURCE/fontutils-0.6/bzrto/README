This program converts outline fonts in our homegrown BZR format to a
form usable for typesetting, such as Metafont or PostScript.

The Metafont file `bzrsetup.mf' is input by the MF code output by this
program, so MF must be able to find it.  You can generate a font at a
given size with a command line such as:

    mf '\mode:=localfont; designsize:=24pt#; input foofont'

This makes a 24pt version of foofont.  The default size is 10pt.

Similarly, the Type 3 fonts output by this program use the BuildChar
routine defined in bzrbuildch.PS.

The BZR format is described in the manual.
