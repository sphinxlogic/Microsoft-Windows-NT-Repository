Version 0.6 (28 October 1992)

* Imageto changes:
  - Automatically removes all pieces of adjacent characters; the
    `-clean-threshold' kludge is gone.
  - `-info-filename' option renamed to `-ifi-filename'.
  - Writes a complete GF font if the image file is incomplete.
  - No longer crashes on a filename lacking an extension.

* BZRto changes:
  - No longer requires TFM files as input along with the BZR files.
  - Doesn't guess that the CCC file is the same as the BZR file.
  - Ligature/kern Metafont output doesn't crash on missing characters.
  - Metafont output does better at not overflowing MF's memory.

* GSrenderfont changes:
  - Handles invisible characters, such as spaces.
  - Reads Type 3 PostScript fonts, as well as Type 1.
  - No longer requires an output encoding; default is same as input.
  - Reads fonts that aren't known to Ghostscript by default.

* Other program changes:
  - Limn doesn't try to log uninitialized floating-point numbers.
  - All the programs handle fontnames containing `.' better.
  - Verbose output usually goes to standard output, instead of standard error.
  - Minor installation and configuration fixes.

* Documentation changes:
  - The chapter on bug reporting has some further explanation of the
    purpose of what we ask for, and clarifications.  Please read before
    submitting bug reports.
  - The chapter on Imageto has been substantially rewritten.  I hope the
    difficulties people encountered using that program because of
    deficiencies in the manual will be cleared up now.
  
Version 0.5 (3 September 1992)

* Manual written!

* New program `BPLtoBZR' and new Emacs Lisp BZR editing mode bzredit.el.

* BZRto provides for character construction (of, e.g., pre-accented
  files) via CCC files.
  Can also merge fonts, scaling them all to the same size.

* Charspace reads CMI files instead of SBI files; pretty much the same
  idea, but many changes to the syntax, etc.

* Fontconvert can put a space character in its output.
  Can do some things via character names, instead of only character codes.

* Imageto uses character names instead of codes, and
  can write EPS files.
