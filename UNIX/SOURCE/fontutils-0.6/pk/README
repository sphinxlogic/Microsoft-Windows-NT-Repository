This library provides for reading of packed font (PK) bitmap files.  An
arbitrary number of fonts may be read simultaneously.  Routines to write
a PK file have not been written; instead, use the TeX utility routine
gftopk.

None of the code that processes the PK commands actually explains what
the precise definition of those commands are.  For that, you should look
at the definition of the PK format in the TeX utility programs that
convert to and from PK format.

The header file is ../include/pk.h.  It explains the basics of how to
use the routines.  The source files in this directory do not repeat that
explanation.
