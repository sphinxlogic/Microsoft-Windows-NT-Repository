This library provides for reading and writing of fonts in Bezier (BZR)
form, a binary outline font format that we invented.  Characters in this
format are constructed from Bezier splines and straight lines.

Only a single file may be read or written at a time.

See the `BZR files' node in the Texinfo documentation for the full
details.

Like our other subroutine libraries, character codes must be in the
range 0-255.
