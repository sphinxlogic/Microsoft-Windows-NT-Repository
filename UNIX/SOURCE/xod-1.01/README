=================================== XOD =================================

Please read this whole file before trying to make this program.  Some
of what is said herein just may be important..... and you might not
give up on it if you realize the minor caveats.  If nothing else,
search for IMPORTANT in this document.

Release
-------
This is the first release of xod (xod 1.01).

Xod is an X-based "octal" dump program.  Like the Unix-supplied od(1),
you are not limited to octal displays.  You can view your data in
hex, octal, decimal, or ASCII as well.  Not only that (which isn't all
that earth-shattering), you can click on a byte, and decode it and the
bytes that follow in a variety of formats, search for strings, move
backwards and forwards in the file, and lots more.

Like some mainframe data dumpers, you see your binary data in your
selected format on one side of the screen, and in ASCII on the other.
But with xod, you are a key (or mouse) stroke away from viewing your
data in one of 4 formats (hex, octal, decimal, or ASCII).

xod uses the Athena widget set for portability.
In a lot of ways, it is like running less, vi, or emacs on a binary file
(except that you can't edit it).  But you can search for  strings,
numbers, etc., decode any byte pointed to, and much other stuff.  See the
man page for full details.

xod was developed on a 486 running Linux, and tested there and on a
Sun.  Both were running X11R5, but is should run under R4.

Building
--------
Should be fairly easy:

	xmkmf
	make

If this doesn't work, the files used by imake (run by xmkmf) may
be wrong.  Have your sysadmin fix the appropriate files.

*IMPORTANT*
To install, you need to install Xod.ad as Xod in your app-defaults
area.  You may need a sysadmin to do this.  If you don't do this,
xod will look stupid when it is run. And you will have to copy
xod to your area for binaries (a sysadmin will probably have to do
this as well).

*IMPORTANT*
NOTE: this code is ANSI-C, so you may need to modify the CC line
in the Imakefile before running xmkmf.  Use gcc if your company is too
cheap to buy an ASNI compiler (in 1993?).  Otherwise, perhaps you
can use one of the public domain de-prototypers.

*IMPORTANT*
If keys don't work as advertized, some of the key mappings may be wrong
(mainly PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End).  This has been tested on a Sun, and
a 486 under Linux,  and there are proper key mappings for them.  Check
out keys.h, and modify if required.  If you get proper mappings for other
machines, please email them to me.

Before running xod
------------------
Ensure that Xod.ad (included with this distribution) is installed in
an app-defaults as Xod.  Otherwise, the screen display will be pretty
funky.

Author(s)
---------
xod was written by RF Starr (starr@wg2.waii.com).  It makes use of
Paul Fox's wonderful CTW widget.  The CTW widget is a color terminal widget,
allowing a text-like widget with multiple colors, and easy cursor manipulation.
Much of the dialog box stuff was ripped out of the X11R5 bitmap program.
