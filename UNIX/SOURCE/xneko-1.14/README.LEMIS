This directory contains source and objects for xneko, an X cat and
mouse game.

Program:	xneko
Revision:	1.14
Date ported:	8 May 1993
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.3.3

Prerequisites:	none

Documentation:	man page, in Japanese.

Installation:	make, make install-sysv for documentation as well

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		For those users not fluent in Japanese, this demo
		opens a window in which	the mouse cursor is a mouse. A
		cat is placed in the window, which chases the mouse.
		There is just enough roman text in the man page to
		discern a few options, which we have not tried.

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4, add -lnsl

1. Resultant object died out of poll () with signal SIGALRM shortly
   after startup. This seems to be related to the library in use:
   after including /usr/ucblib/libucb.a in the search path, all was
   OK.
