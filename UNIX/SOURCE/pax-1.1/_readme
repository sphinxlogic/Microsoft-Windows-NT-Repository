[  The name is Latin for "peace."  --r$  ]

    This is version 1.1 of Pax, a public domain archiving utility.  
    
    Pax is an archiving utility that reads and writes tar and cpio formats, 
    both the traditional ones and the extended formats specified in IEEE 
    1003.1.  It handles multi-volume archives and automatically determines 
    the format of an archive while reading it.  Three user interfaces are 
    supported: tar, cpio, and pax.  The pax interface was designed by IEEE 
    1003.2 as a compromise in the chronic controversy over which of tar or 
    cpio is best.

    The USENIX Association provided some support for this implementation 
    project.  As a result, the Pax utility is being distributed free of 
    charge and may be redistributed by others in either source or binary 
    form.  (See the liscensing section for restrictions)

    The source for Pax is being posted to comp.sources.unix on USENET and 
    will also be available by anonymous FTP on the Internet from uunet.uu.net,
    moon.honeywell.com and from one of the Berkeley machines.  The source
    to Pax will be available via anonymous UUCP from jhereg.mn.org, the 
    author's home machine and possibly other sites.

    The source for Pax will continue to change as long as the definition of 
    the utility is modified by the 1003.2 working group.  (For example, 
    there are a number of changes in Draft 8 which will be incorporated as 
    soon as Draft 8 is available).  Additional modifications will be made 
    based on user input, such as request for support of additional archive 
    formats, etc.  Patches and new releases will be made as new functionality 
    is added or problems are diagnosed and fixed.
