NAME
	stream: A program to make tape streamers stream.

SYNOPSIS

	stream [ -v ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -n blocks ]

	-v Set verbose mode
	-b set the number of bytes per block written to tape
	-n set the number of blocks held in shared memory

DESCRIPTION

	Stream is designed to run as a filter between a program
	accessing a tape and the tape device itself. It will run in
	either direction. Typically, it will be used with a command
	like tar:

	     tar cf - files | stream > /dev/rct0

	or

	     stream < /dev/rct0 | tar xvf -

	Stream forks and buffers data in shared memory, thus making up
	for this deficiency in the device driver. Since data is
	(almost) always available, the tape drive does not need to
	stop, and the data rates can be increased to the maximum that
	the tape drive can handle. Typically this results in a 75% to
	90% reduction in the tape transfer time.
