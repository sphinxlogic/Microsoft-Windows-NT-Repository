This is a list of user-visible changes between bash version 1.13 and the
previous release, version 1.12.

Porting and Support
*******************
New machines supported:  Alliant i860, Delta SysV68.  Also, handle all
of the HP machines with separate machine types, and handle the various
operating system types, including the hppa.

New variables in machines.h aid in porting to new machines:
LD_HAS_NO_DASH_L handles case of a /bin/ld which doesn't understand
one of -l<lib>, -L<libdir>, or -L <libdir>.  New variable HAVE_DIRENT
says that this machine uses the "struct dirent" aggregate for reading
directories.  New variable HAVE_DIRENT_H says that this machine has
/usr/include/dirent.h to describe that structure.

Test for endian-ness now works on machines where sizeof (long) is
larger than 4 bytes.

The Makefiles now uses "bindir" instead of "DESTDIR" to be similar
with other GNU software.

"MACHINE" in cpp-Makefile is now "Machine" to avoid conflict with
4.3-Tahoe "make" and others.

Bug Fixes and Features
**********************

Globbing is correctly and fully interruptible.

`umask -S' no longer prints excess info.

stdin is no longer buffered when reading a script from there, as in
"bash foo".

cd, $PWD, and pwd now understand about canonicalizing pathnames.  If
you don't know what this means, you don't need to worry about it.

Systems without job control handle background processes better.

Variables which are special to the shell (e.g.,
command_oriented_history) are correctly propagated to new shells if
they are exported in the environment.

No more `pushd_silent' variable.  If you want the old behaviour, then
use a function similar to the following:

	function pushd () { builtin pushd "$@" >/dev/null; }
