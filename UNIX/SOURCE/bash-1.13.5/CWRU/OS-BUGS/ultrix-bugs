Not (gasp) Real Work!

Works for me.

Typeahead under Ultrix is wierd.  This doesn't happen anywhere else.  Here's
what it does for me:

cwjcc$ sleep 4
echo hi ; echo hi		<----- typeahead while sleeping
cwjcc$				<----- nothing comes out
cwjcc$ more readline.c
readline.c: No such file or directory
cwjcc$ echo hi ; echo hi	<----- now it does...
hi
hi

I'll look at it today.

This only happens under Ultrix, too.  It's another consequence of Dec's
dup2 fuckup (I am *really*pissed*off* about it; it's caused me to waste a
lot of time already).  File descriptor 1 is getting set to close-on-exec. 
I haven't decided whether to hack around it in the code or to just make
Ultrix use the dup2 emulation in general.c.

Cheers,

Chet
