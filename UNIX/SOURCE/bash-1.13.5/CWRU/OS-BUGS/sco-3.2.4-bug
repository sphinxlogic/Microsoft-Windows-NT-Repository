You can't run bash-1.12 on a 3.2.4 system if it's been compiled on a
3.2.2 system.  Bash contains a fix for the broken sigsuspend in 3.2.2
that breaks bash on 3.2.4, because 3.2.4 has the bug fixed.

Bash 1.12 should build and run OK out of the box on 3.2.2.  For 3.2.4
you need to locate the code at around line 1250 of jobs.c and change
#if !defined (SCO) to #if 1 so that sigsuspend is used.  Then take out
the SCO defines in flush_child().
