INTRO TO xgrabsc

When I first wrote xgrabsc, there were a number of programs available
for getting X-Window screen dumps (e.g., xwd and xwps), but they
were all restricted to dumping a single window in a single format.
I wrote xgrabsc in an effort to get around these restrictions.

The main contribution of this program is its use of root-window
rubberbanding to allow capture of arbitrary portions of the screen,
and its multiple output formats (x-bitmap, x-pixmap, xwd, puzzle,
"simple", and several Postscript formats).

The Postscript dumps will use run-length encoding if it results in
any savings in size.  A typical xterm window dump on a mono system
runs around 40K bytes (20K for binary output).  An xwd dump on the
same screen will be around 650K bytes.  While the xpr program has a
"compress" option, it only compresses white samples.  Reducing the 
size of the output increases the cost of computing the dump and the
final printing of the dump, but it reduces the cost of storage and
the time to transfer the dump to your printer.  The latter is
especially important for large screen dumps.

The xgrabsc program is not interactive.  You specify all processing
options on the command line with obscure option characters.  These
are all detailed in the man page.  An interactive interface to xgrabsc,
named xgrab, is also included in this release.  xgrab allows you to
do most of the setup with a mouse, and then uses the xgrabsc program
to actually do the processing.  To use xgrab you must have the xgrabsc
program in your execution path.



OPTIONS FOR BUILDING xgrabsc

The file config.h contains all the configuration options for xgrabsc.
Please take a moment to look through that file before building xgrabsc.



BUILDING xgrabsc

Xgrabsc should build easily enough.  If you don't have the imake
program, use simple.mak (i.e., make -f simple.mak).  There are targets
for xgrabsc, install, install.man, and clean.  E.g.,
  make
  make install
  make install.man
  make clean

The install target will put xgrabsc in /usr/bin/X11 and the
man page in /usr/man/man1.  Change simple.mak before installing
with it if you don't like these locations.

For Vax/VMS installations, this release includes a VMSMAKE.COM script that was
contributed by a user, as well as a GETOPT.C module that implements the
getopt() function.  I am informed that you will also need a copy of the
XWDfile.h include file from the MIT XWindows distribution, so I've included a
copy of that file.  I do not have a Vax to test with so I can't claim you won't
have problems in building xgrabsc under VMS, but this gives you a running start
at it.
