.SH NAME
xgrab \- interactive front for xgrabsc, an X-Windows image grabber
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.in +8n
.ti -8n
\fIxgrab\fR
.in -8n
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIxgrab\fR lets you grab arbitrary rectangular images from an
X server and writes them to files or commands (such as lpr) in
a variety of formats.
.PP
\fIxgrab\fR is a front for the xgrabsc program.
Read the man page for \fIxgrabsc\fR for a description of the options
presented by xgrab.
.PP
After selecting options from the various categories presented, press
the \fIOK\fR button to have xgrab run xgrabsc to let you grab an image
from the screen.  After you press \fIOK\fP, xgrab's window will disappear
and xgrabsc will gain control until the grabbing process is finished.
Afterwards, the xgrab window will reappear.
.sp 2
.SH OPTIONS
Xgrab responds to the standard application options, such as \fI-display\fP.
See the man page for \fIX\fP for a complete list.
.sp
You can also override the default xgrab settings in your .Xdefaults.  See
the examples section below for instructions.
.sp 2
.SH RESOURCES
The XGrab resource file, XGrab.ad, contains a complete specification of the
resources of all the widgets used in the xgrab window.  Global resources,
such as default font and color, are at the bottom of the file.
.sp 2
.SH EXAMPLES
The \fITo Command\fR output option may be used to pipe xgrabsc output
to programs.  The most common commands are \fIlpr\fR for Postscript
output, and \fIxwud\fR for X-Window Dump output.  Programs that do not
accept piped input should not be used in \fITo Command\fR.
.sp
You can also get fancy and pipe the output through more than one command,
such as \fItee screen.dmp | xwud\fP, to store the grabbed image and get
a preview window.
.sp 2
Default settings for xgrab can be made in your .Xdefaults file.  Toggle
buttons can be set/unset through their \fI.state\fP attribute, and text
field strings can be set through their \fI*string\fP attribute.  For
example, to set the default paper size for postscript output, put these
lines in your .Xdefaults (and use xrdb to load them into the server!):
.sp
XGrab*.pageWidthText*string:   8.5
.br
XGrab*.pageHeightText*string: 11.0
.sp
To set the default output type to \fIXWD\fP, put these lines in
your .Xdefaults:
.sp
XGrab*.ps.state:  0
.br
XGrab*.xwd.state: 1
.sp 2
.SH LIMITATIONS
See the limitations listed in the xgrabsc man page.
