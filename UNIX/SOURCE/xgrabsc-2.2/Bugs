*  xgrab dumps core after xgrabsc finishes

This has been reported for Sun3's running 4.0.3 and Tek 4319's
running Utek 4.1.  Looks like the stack is being overwritten
by the system() call.

*  Postscript images produced by xgrabsc don't get printed

This is almost always a memory requirement problem.  Xgrabsc
v2.0 and later can generate checks for memory availability so
you can at least see how much memory you're lacking to be able
to print your document.  I'd like to be able to preempt the
transfer of the rest of the file when there isn't enough memory
to process it, but haven't been able to make this happen. 


*  The puzzle program won't display xgrabsc output

While xgrabsc can create puzzle picture files from monochrome 
screens, the puzzle program will not display pictures with "-
picture" on monochrome systems. This is not a "bug" in xgrabsc, 
but is a "confusing feature".


*  When started from a window-manager menu, xgrabsc fails to grab an image.

If you run xgrabsc from a Twm menu, be sure to end your exec 
command with "&". The program may not be able to grab the pointer 
or server unless you do this.  This will likely happen with any 
window manager, but has been reported onlyfor Twm.


*  Encapsulate Postscript images are not centered or scaled when printed

This isn't a problem with xgrabsc.  EPS files are not supposed to
contain scaling or transformation commands.


*  The X cursor isn't included in images

If someone can tell me how to grab an image with the X cursor, I'd
be much obliged.  Most X servers explicitely hide the cursor when
processing getImage requests.


* BadMatch errors are generated when grabbing with the keyboard (-k) and
  the cursor is on a menubar

I haven't been able to reproduce this error.


* Can't grab xeyes

I haven't been able to reproduce this problem.


* Dithered output sent to "xpr" for a laserjet doesn't produce an image

I have no laserjet to test with.


* The halftoning algorithm in xgrabsc should be improved

Someone have a better algorithm?  If so, please send it to me.  I'm
not interested in supporting zillions of different dithering
algorithms, but would be happy to improve the ones already in xgrabsc.


* Postscript output doesn't center properly when printed

The default paper size is hard-coded into xgrabsc.  If you're not
using the size of paper specified in config.h, you should use the
"-page" command to set the size of paper to be expected.


* Binary Postscript images appear dark when printed

Your print spooler is probably stripping off the top bits of the binary
data, causing the samples to be darker.  Some systems have "lpr" options
to tell the spooler that the file you're printing contains binary data.
Consult your lpr documentation.
