This is the source directory for the GNU emacs lisp library Elib
version 0.06.  This is an alpha release.  Use at your own risk, and
_please_ send bug reports, suggestions and comments to
elib-maintainers@lysator.liu.se.  The more feedback we get, the sooner
the real release is likely to occur...

Information about how to install the library and the documentation is
in the file INSTALL.  Licensing terms are in the file COPYING.
Further documentation is in the TeXinfo file elib.texinfo. 

Known bugs:
  + The documentation could be better. It lacks an index, among 
    other things. 
  + The stack-m and stack-f should probably both (provide 'stack).
    stack-m.el should maybe be renamed stack.el, and stack-f.el
    should maybe only be used while debugging.  We are still 
    thinking about this. Suggestions are welcome.
  + The cookie package has a number of inconsistencies regarding
    handling of (point).

Enjoy!
