Major changes in release 1.9:
* su fails gracefully when getpass is unable to open /dev/tty.
* printenv and tty detect and report write errors
* fix bug in stty
* stty accepts the new options status and flush on systems that provide them

* expr's `substr' doesn't overrun malloc'd buffer

* better support for Linux, Dec Alpha, and SGI Irix
* all programs (even true and false) accept --version and --help options
* uname's --version option is no longer equivalent to its -v option
* configure uses config.h, so DEFS won't exceed preprocessor limits of
  some compilers on the number of symbols defined via -D.
* work around problem where $(srcdir)/config.h was used instead of
  ../config.h -- this happened only when building in a subdirectory
  and when config.h remained in $(srcdir) from a previous ./configure.
* make may be run from the subdirectories
