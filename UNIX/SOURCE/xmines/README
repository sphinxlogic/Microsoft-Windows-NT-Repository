Sorry for the lack of a man page, (Anyone want to write one for me??)

This is the game of xmines.  I really liked minesweeper that ran
on Windows 3.0.  Unfortunately, I only have a 6 MHz 286, so it was 
rather slow.  In addition, I don't have a PC at work, so I wrote
xmines.  It follows the same rules as minehunt.
If you want to pay for it, send money to Microsoft.  They are the people
who came up with the idea, (they just picked the wrong platform :-)

Anyway, if you like the game, please send me a message at 
zimmer@calvin.stanford.edu telling me you are playing it.

The buttons are something like this

left button - turn over the square you are selecting

middle button - turn over all of the squares adjacent to the square
you pick.  This only works if you have marked the correct number of
cells.

right button - mark a cell.  This is a toggle, so the next push unmarks
a cell.


guru question.  Gee, I have to mention this, but there is a way to 
cheat in the game.  Does anyone know how to capture a STOP signal?

Please feel free to comment on the X11 code.  
(ie You stupid idiot, that is not the way you are supposed to do foo,
the correct way is ...)  Of course, I know that some of the other
code in X11.c is pretty sloppy also, but I will be cleaning it up when
I get some time.  (Sure I will, wink wink)

Anyway, have fun, and send suggestions for future X clones of games
you would like to see.
