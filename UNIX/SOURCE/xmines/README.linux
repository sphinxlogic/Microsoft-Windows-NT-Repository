This is the game xbombs (xmines) for linux.  It is almost exactly the original 
code.  You can recompile it by typing 'make all' 

The game looks for its scorefile at /usr/X386/lib/scores/xbombsscores
but you can change that.  It is defined at the top of score.c

The binary and .o files were compiled with GCC 2.2.2d and Xfree86.1.1
and kernel source level 0.98.2.

Enjoy!
