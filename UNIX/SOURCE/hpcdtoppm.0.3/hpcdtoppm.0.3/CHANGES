Changes of hpcdtoppm:

v0.3:
- Additional Options -x, -a and -ycc

- bcopy thrown out.

- New datatype sBYTE for char. This fixes the problem with
  compilers which have the char unsigned. These got some
  'snow' in their pictures (merry christmas :-).

- Address arithmetik bug fixed in writepicture

v0.2:

- Small workaround for strange behavior of address-calculation
  of a c-compiler for NeXT.

- Improved rounding for integer maths.

- Thrown out floating arithmetic, changed color conversion to
  integer fixed point.

- PPM-writing-routines added. You can choose whether you
  want to use pbmplus-routines or the included routines.

- some ununused variables thrown out.
