Things i want to do when i find time:


- Implement additional parameters for color decoding

- Implement routines to decode only cut out subrectangle of higher
  resolutions.

- Implement a 'fast lookup-table' for huffman decoding.

- speedup.

- Make a "small memory mode". This to extract the 
  high resolutions even if you have not enough 
  memory.
