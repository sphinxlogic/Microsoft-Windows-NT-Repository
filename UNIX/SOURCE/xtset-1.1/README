Looks like the only way to get source in alt.sources at the moment is to do it
myself so here's a little prog to use with xterm:

Xterm title icon hack
---------------------

The purpose of this little program is to set up the window title and icon of
xterms so that the current directory, hostname and other information the user
may want is always on display and is updated when it changes.

Installation
------------

Compile xtset.c, call the result xtset and place it in a publicly accessible
place. It doesn't need any special libraries though libc.a is useful :-)

Place the xterm_hack (csh) and ksh_xterm_hack scripts in a publicly accessible
place.

If you're happy with the default window title line which is:

pwd@hostname (username:groupname-umask)

then just arrange for the appropriate script to be sourced as you log in on all
machines you use. Once you've done that the appropriate directory etc should be
maintained as you execute commands. Ensure that xtset is in your path at the
appropriate point in the login sequence.

To customise the title and icon refer to the scripts for the appropriate icon
variables. I set XTXTRA to the time of login so I can see how long shells have
been lying around.

Tests
-----

rlogin to another machine and iconify the xterm, the title should be the new
hostname.

pushd /tmp, the title should be /tmp@hostname .......
popd, the title should be restored

umask nnn, the number at the top of the screen should change.

etc, etc ...

Problems
--------

The su command sometimes stops the updating of window titles.

Thanks
------

To Derek for the ksh version of the script.

That's It
---------

I hope it proves useful. Yell if it doesn't work.
