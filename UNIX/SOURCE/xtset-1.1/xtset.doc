	and their icons.

	Options:

	  -i	Set the icon title only

	  If no options are supplied, the format string is applied to
	  both window and icon.

	format-string is a text string which may contain format
	characters preceded by a % sign. These have the following
	meanings:

	   %h is translated to hostname
	   %d is translated to current dir
	   %D is translated to the last part of the current directory
	      name, i.e. everything after the last / in the pathname. If
	      this is one of the names src, doc, config, lib, bin, etc,
	      source, conf or man, the previous part of the pathname is
	      also included.
	   %u is current user name
	   %g is current group name
	   %U is current real user name
	   %G is current real group name
	   %m is octal current umask
	   %e is value of environment variable XTXTRA or null string
	   %t is the complete name of the stdin terminal, if it is a terminal
	   %T is the last part of the stdin file name, if it is a terminal
	   %% is a real percent sign, God knows why you'd want one, but
	      there you are
