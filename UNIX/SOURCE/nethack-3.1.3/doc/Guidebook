	       You have	just finished your years as a student at the  local
	  adventurer's	guild.	 After much practice and sweat you have	fi-
	  nally	completed your training	and are	 ready	to  embark  upon  a
	  perilous  adventure.	 To prove your worthiness, the local guild-
	  masters have sent you	into the Mazes of Menace.  Your	quest is to
	  retrieve  the	 Amulet	 of  Yendor.  According	to legend, the gods
	  will grant immortality to the	one  who  recovers  this  artifact;
	  true or not, its recovery will bring honor and full guild member-
	  ship (not to mention the attentions of certain wealthy wizards).

	       Your abilities and strengths for	dealing	with the hazards of
	  adventure will vary with your	background and training.

	       _A_r_c_h_e_o_l_o_g_i_s_t_s understand	dungeons pretty	well; this  enables
	  them to move quickly and sneak up on dungeon nasties.	 They start
	  equipped with	proper tools for a scientific expedition.

	       _B_a_r_b_a_r_i_a_n_s are warriors out of the hinterland,  hardened	 to
	  battle.   They  begin	 their	quests	with  naught  but  uncommon
	  strength, a trusty hauberk, and a great two-handed sword.

	       _C_a_v_e_m_e_n and _C_a_v_e_w_o_m_e_n start with	 exceptional  strength	and
	  neolithic weapons.

	       _E_l_v_e_s are agile,	quick, and sensitive; very little  of  what
	  goes	on  will escape	an Elf.	 The quality of	Elven craftsmanship
	  often	gives them an advantage	in arms	and armor.

	       _H_e_a_l_e_r_s are wise	in medicine and	the apothecary.	 They  know
	  the  herbs  and  simples  that  can  restore vitality, ease pain,
	  anesthetize, and neutralize poisons; and with	their  instruments,
	  they	can  divine  a	being's	state of health	or sickness.  Their
	  medical practice earns them quite reasonable	amounts	 of  money,
	  which	they enter the dungeon with.

	       _K_n_i_g_h_t_s are distinguished  from	the  common  skirmisher	 by
	  their	 devotion  to  the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing

	  excellence of	their armor.

	       _P_r_i_e_s_t_s and _P_r_i_e_s_t_e_s_s_e_s are clerics militant, crusaders	ad-
	  vancing  the	cause  of  righteousness with arms, armor, and arts
	  thaumaturgic.	 Their ability to commune with deities	via  prayer
	  occasionally	extricates them	from peril-but can also	put them in
	  it.

	       _R_o_g_u_e_s are agile	and stealthy thieves,  who  carry  daggers,
	  lock picks, and poisons to put on darts.

	       _S_a_m_u_r_a_i are the elite warriors of feudal	Nippon.	  They	are
	  lightly  armored  and	 quick,	and wear the _d_a_i-_s_h_o, two swords of
	  the deadliest	keenness.

	       _T_o_u_r_i_s_t_s	start out with lots of gold (suitable for  shopping
	  with),  a  credit card, lots of food,	some maps, and an expensive
	  camera.  Most	monsters don't like being photographed.

	       _V_a_l_k_y_r_i_e_s are hardy warrior women.  Their upbringing in	the
	  harsh	Northlands makes them strong and inures	them to	extremes of
	  cold,	and instills in	them stealth and cunning.

	       _W_i_z_a_r_d_s start out with a	fair selection of  magical  goodies
	  and a	particular affinity for	dweomercraft.

	       You set out for	the  dungeon  and  after  several  days	 of
	  uneventful  travel,  you  see	the ancient ruins that mark the	en-
	  trance to the	Mazes of Menace.  It is	late at	night, so you  make
	  camp	at the entrance	and spend the night sleeping under the open
	  skies.  In the morning, you gather your gear,	 eat  what  may	 be
	  your last meal outside, and enter the	dungeon.

	       You have	just begun a game of NetHack.  Your goal is to grab
	  as  much  treasure as	you can, retrieve the Amulet of	Yendor,	and
	  escape the Mazes of Menace alive.  On	the screen is kept a map of
	  where	you have been and what you have	seen on	the current dungeon
	  level; as you	explore	more of	the level, it appears on the screen
	  in front of you.

	       When NetHack's ancestor _r_o_g_u_e  first  appeared,	its  screen
	  orientation  was  almost  unique  among  computer  fantasy games.
	  Since	then, screen orientation has become the	 norm  rather  than
	  the  exception;  NetHack  continues  this fine tradition.  Unlike
	  text adventure games that input commands in  pseudo-English  sen-
	  tences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are	all
	  one or two keystrokes	and the	results	are  displayed	graphically
	  on  the  screen.  A minimum screen size of 24	lines by 80 columns
	  is recommended; if the screen	is larger,  only  a  21x80  section
	  will be used for the map.

	       NetHack generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even
	  the  authors	still  find  it	 an  entertaining and exciting game
	  despite having won several times.

	       In order	to understand what is going on	in  NetHack,  first
	  you  must  understand	what NetHack is	doing with the screen.	The
	  NetHack screen replaces the ``You see...'' descriptions  of  text
	  adventure  games.   Figure 1 is a sample of what a NetHack screen
	  might	look like.

	       The bottom two lines of the screen contain  several  cryptic
	  pieces  of information describing your current status.  If either
	  status line becomes longer than the  width  of  the  screen,	you
	  might	not see	all of it.  Here are explanations of what the vari-
	  ous status items mean	(though	your configuration may not have	all
	  the status items listed below):

	  Rank
	       Your character's	name and professional ranking (based on	the
	       experience level, see below).

	  Strength
	       A measure of your character's  strength,	 one  of  your	six
	       basic  attributes.   Your  attributes can range from 3 to 18
	       inclusive (occasionally you may get super-strengths  of	the
	       form  18/xx).   The  higher  your strength, the stronger	you
	       are.  Strength affects how successfully you perform physical
	       tasks and how much damage you do	in combat.




	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993






	  NetHack Guidebook						  4


	  Dexterity
	       Dexterity affects your chances to hit in	 combat,  to  avoid
	       traps,  and do other tasks requiring agility or manipulation
	       of objects.

	  Constitution
	       Constitution affects your ability to  withstand	injury	and
	       other strains on	your stamina.

	  Intelligence
	       Intelligence affects your ability to cast spells.

	  Wisdom
	       Wisdom comes from your religious	affairs.  It  affects  your
	       magical energy.

	  Charisma
	       Charisma	affects	how certain creatures react toward you.	 In
	       particular, it can affect the prices shopkeepers	offer you.

	  Alignment
	       LLLLaaaawwwwffffuuuullll, NNNNeeeeuuuuttttrrrraaaallll,	or CCCChhhhaaaaoooottttiiiicccc.  Basically,	Lawful is good	and
	       Chaotic	is  evil.  Your	alignment influences how other mon-
	       sters react toward you.

	  Dungeon Level
	       How deep	you have gone into the dungeon.	 It starts  at	one
	       and increases as	you go deeper into the dungeon.	 The Amulet
	       of Yendor is reputed to be somewhere beneath  the  twentieth
	       level.

	  Gold
	       The number of gold pieces you have.

	  Hit Points
	       Your current and	maximum	hit points.   Hit  points  indicate
	       how  much  damage you can take before you die.  The more	you
	       get hit in a fight, the lower they get.	You can	regain	hit
	       points by resting.  The number in parentheses is	the maximum
	       number your hit points can reach.

	  Power
	       Spell points.  This tells you how much mystic energy  (_m_a_n_a)
	       you  have available for spell casting.  When you	type `+' to
	       list your spells, each will have	a spell	point  cost  beside
	       it  in  parentheses.   You will not see this if your dungeon
	       has been	set up without spells.

	  Armor	Class
	       A measure of how	effectively your armor stops blows from	un-
	       friendly	 creatures.  The lower this number is, the more	ef-
	       fective the armor; it is	quite possible to have negative	ar-
	       mor class.



	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993






	  NetHack Guidebook						  5


	  Experience
	       Your current experience level and experience points.  As	you
	       adventure,  you	gain experience	points.	 At certain experi-
	       ence point totals, you gain an experience level.	  The  more
	       experienced you are, the	better you fight and withstand mag-
	       ical attacks.  Many dungeons show only your experience level
	       here.

	  Time
	       The number of turns elapsed so far, displayed  if  you  have
	       the ttttiiiimmmmeeee	option set.

	  Hunger status
	       Your current hunger status, ranging from	 SSSSaaaattttiiiiaaaatttteeeedddd  down	 to
	       FFFFaaaaiiiinnnnttttiiiinnnngggg.   If  your  hunger  status  is	 normal,  it is	not
	       displayed.

	       Additional status flags may appear after	the hunger  status:
	  CCCCoooonnnnffff	when  you're confused, SSSSiiiicccckkkk when sick, BBBBlllliiiinnnndddd when you can't
	  see, SSSSttttuuuunnnn when stunned, and HHHHaaaalllllllluuuu when hallucinating.

	       The top line of the screen is  reserved	for  messages  that
	  describe  things  that  are impossible to represent visually.	 If
	  you see a ``--------MMMMoooorrrreeee--------'' on the	top line, this means  that  NetHack
	  has  another	message	 to  display on	the screen, but	it wants to
	  make certain that you've read	the one	that is	 there	first.	 To
	  read the next	message, just press the	space bar.

	       The rest	of the screen is the map of the	level as  you  have
	  explored  it	so far.	 Each symbol on	the screen represents some-
	  thing.  You can set the ggggrrrraaaapppphhhhiiiiccccssss option to  change  some  of	the
	  symbols  the game uses; otherwise, the game will use default sym-
	  bols.	 Here is a list	of what	the default symbols mean:

	  - and	|
	       The walls of a room, or an open door.

	  .    The floor of a room, or a doorless doorway.

	  #    A corridor, or possibly a kitchen  sink	or  drawbridge	(if
	       your dungeon has	sinks).

	  <    A way to	the previous level.

	  >    A way to	the next level.

	  +    A closed	door, or a spell book containing a  spell  you	can
	       learn (if your dungeon has spell	books).




	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993

	  @    A human (you, usually).

	  \    An opulent throne (your dungeon may  not	 have  thrones	ei-

	  a-zA-Z and other symbols
	       Letters and certain other symbols represent the various	in-
	       habitants  of  the  Mazes of Menace.  Watch out,	they can be
	       nasty and vicious.  Sometimes, however, they can	be helpful.

	       You need	not memorize all these symbols;	 you  can  ask	the
	  game	what  any  symbol  represents with the `/' command (see	the
	  Commands section for more info).

	       Commands	are given to NetHack by	typing one or  two  charac-
	  ters;	 NetHack  then	asks questions to find out what	it needs to
	  know to do your bidding.


	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993






	  NetHack Guidebook						  7


	       For example, a common question, in the form  ``What  do	you
	  want	to use?	[a-zA-Z	?*]'', asks you	to choose an object you	are
	  carrying.  Here, ``a-zA-Z'' are the  inventory  letters  of  your
	  possible  choices.   Typing  `?'  gives  you an inventory list of
	  these	items, so you can see what each	letter refers to.  In  this
	  example,  there  is  also a `*' indicating that you may choose an
	  object not on	the list, if you wanted	to use something  unexpect-
	  ed.  Typing a	`*' lists your entire inventory, so you	can see	the
	  inventory letters of every object you're carrying.   Finally,	 if
	  you change your mind and decide you don't want to do this command
	  after	all, you can press the ESC key to abort	the command.

	       You can put a number before most	 commands  to  repeat  them
	  that	many times; for	example, ``10s'' will search ten times.	 If
	  you have the nnnnuuuummmmbbbbeeeerrrr____ppppaaaadddd option set, you must type `n'	to prefix a
	  count,  so  the  example  above  would be typed ``n10s'' instead.
	  Commands for which counts make no sense ignore  them.	  In  addi-
	  tion,	 movement commands can be prefixed for greater control (see
	  below).  To cancel a count or	a prefix, press	the ESC	key.

	       The list	of commands is rather long, but	it can be  read	 at
	  any  time during the game through the	`?' command, which accesses
	  a menu of helpful texts.  Here are the commands for  your  refer-
	  ence:

	  ?    Help menu:  display one of several help texts available.

	  /    Tell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify  a
	       location	 or type a symbol (or even a whole word) to define.
	       If the hhhheeeellllpppp option is on, and NetHack has some  special	in-
	       formation  about	 an  object  or	monster	that you looked	at,
	       you'll be asked if you want ``More info?''.  If hhhheeeellllpppp is off,
	       then  you'll  only get the special information if you expli-
	       citly ask for it	by typing in the name of the monster or	ob-
	       ject.

	  &    Tell what a command does.

	  <    Go up a staircase to the	previous level (if you are  on	the
	       stairs).

	  >    Go down a staircase to the next level (if  you  are  on	the
	       stairs).

	  [yuhjklbn]
	       Go one step in the direction indicated (see Figure  2).	 If
	       there  is  a  monster  there, you will fight the	monster	in-
	       stead.  Only these one-step movement commands cause  you	 to
	       fight monsters; the others (below) are ``safe.''

	       Doorways	connect	rooms and corridors.  Some doorways have no
	  doors;  you  can  walk right through.	 Others	have doors in them,
	  which	may be open, closed, or	locked.	 To open a closed door,	use
	  the  `o'  (open)  command; to	close it again,	use the	`c' (close)
	  command.

	       You can get through a locked door by using a  tool  to  pick
	  the lock with	the `a'	(apply)	command, or by kicking it open with
	  the `^D' (kick) command.

	       Open doors cannot be entered diagonally;	you  must  approach
	  them	straight  on, horizontally or vertically.  Doorways without
	  doors	are not	restricted.

	       Doors can be useful for shutting	out  monsters.	 Most  mon-
	  sters	cannot open doors, although a few don't	need to	(ex. ghosts
	  can walk through doors).

	       There are traps throughout the dungeon to snare	the  unwary

	       If you see a monster and	you wish to fight it, just  attempt
	  to  walk  into  it.	Many  monsters you find	will mind their	own

	  when angered.	 Remember:  Discretion is the better part of valor.

	       You start the game with a little	dog  (`d')  or	cat  (`f'),
	  which	follows	you about the dungeon and fights monsters with you.
	  Like you, your pet needs food	to survive.  It	usually	 feeds	it-
	  self	on  fresh carrion and other meats.  If you're worried about
	  it or	want to	train it, you can feed	it,  too,  by  throwing	 it
	  food.

	       Your pet	also gains experience from  killing  monsters,	and
	  can  grow  over  time,  gaining hit points and doing more damage.
	  Initially, your pet may even be better  at  killing  things  than
	  you, which makes pets	useful for low-level characters.

	       Your pet	will follow you	up and down staircases,	 if  it	 is
	  next to you when you move.  Otherwise, your pet will be stranded,
	  and may become wild.

	  they're  slow	and do little damage.  You can plunder the deceased
	  adventurer's possessions; however, they are likely to	be  cursed.

	       When you	find something in the dungeon, it is common to want
	  to pick it up.  In NetHack, this is accomplished automatically by
	  walking over the object (unless you turn off the  aaaauuuuttttooooppppiiiicccckkkkuuuupppp	op-
	  tion	(see  below),  or move with the	`m' prefix (see	above)), or
	  manually by using the	`,' command.  If you're	carrying  too  many
	  things, NetHack will tell you	so and won't pick up anything more.
	  Otherwise, it	will add the object(s) to your pack  and  tell	you
	  what you just	picked up.




	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993






	  NetHack Guidebook						 14


	       When you	pick up	an object,  it	is  assigned  an  inventory
	  letter.   Many  commands  that operate on objects must ask you to
	  find out which object	you want to use.  When NetHack asks you	 to
	  choose  a  particular	 object	 you  are carrying, you	are usually
	  presented with a list	of inventory letters to	 choose	 from  (see
	  Commands, above).

	       Some objects, such as weapons,  are  easily  differentiated.
	  Others,  like	 scrolls  and potions, are given descriptions which
	  vary according to type.  During a game, any two objects with	the
	  same	description  are  the same type.  However, the descriptions
	  will vary from game to game.

	       When you	use one	of these objects, if its effect	is obvious,
	  NetHack  will	 remember  what	it is for you.	If its effect isn't
	  extremely obvious, you will be asked what you	want to	 call  this
	  type	of object so you will recognize	it later.  You can also	use
	  the ``#name''	command	for the	same purpose at	any time,  to  name
	  all objects of a particular type or just an individual object.

	  7777....1111....	CCCCuuuurrrrsssseeeessss aaaannnndddd bbbblllleeeessssssssiiiinnnnggggssss

	       Any object that you find	may be cursed, even if	the  object
	  is otherwise helpful.	 The most common effect	of a curse is being
	  stuck	with (and to) the item.	 Cursed	weapons	weld themselves	 to
	  your	hand  when wielded, so you cannot unwield them.	 Any cursed
	  item you wear	is not removable by ordinary means.   In  addition,
	  cursed  arms and armor usually, but not always, bear negative	en-
	  chantments that make them less effective in combat.  Other cursed
	  objects may act poorly or detrimentally in other ways.

	       Objects can also	become blessed.	 Blessed items usually work
	  better  or more beneficially than normal uncursed items.  For	ex-
	  ample, a blessed weapon will do more damage against demons.

	       There are magical means of bestowing or removing	curses upon
	  objects,  so	even  if you are stuck with one, you can still have
	  the curse lifted and the item	removed.  Priests  and	Priestesses
	  have	an  innate sensitivity to curses and blessings,	so they	can
	  more easily avoid cursed objects than	other character	classes.

	       An item with unknown curse status, and  an  item	 which	you
	  know	to  be uncursed, will be distinguished in your inventory by
	  the presence of the word ``uncursed''	in the description  of	the
	  latter.   The	 exception is if this description isn't	needed;	you
	  can look at the inventory description	 and  know  that  you  have
	  discovered whether it's cursed.  This	applies	to items which have
	  ``plusses,'' and items with charges.

	       Given a chance, almost all monsters in the Mazes	 of  Menace
	  will	gratuitously  kill  you.  You need weapons for self-defense
	  (killing them	first).	 Without a weapon,  you	 do  only  1-2	hit


	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993






	  NetHack Guidebook						 15


	  points of damage (plus bonuses, if any).

	       There are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown
	  weapons,  like  arrows.   To hit monsters with a weapon, you must
	  wield	it and attack them, or throw it	at them.  To shoot an arrow
	  out of a bow,	you must first wield the bow, then throw the arrow.
	  Crossbows shoot crossbow bolts.  Slings hurl	rocks  and  (other)
	  gems.	  You  can  wield  only	 one  weapon at	a time,	but you	can
	  change weapons unless	you're wielding	a cursed one.

	       Enchanted weapons have a	 ``plus''  (which  can	also  be  a
	  minus) that adds to your chance to hit and the damage	you do to a
	  monster.  The	only way to determine a	weapon's enchantment is	 to
	  have it magically identified somehow.

	       Those of	you in the audience who	are AD&D players, be  aware
	  that	each  weapon  which  exists in AD&D does the same damage to
	  monsters in NetHack.	Some of	the more obscure weapons  (such	 as
	  the  _a_k_l_y_s,  _l_u_c_e_r_n  _h_a_m_m_e_r, and _b_e_c-_d_e-_c_o_r_b_i_n) are defined in an
	  appendix to _U_n_e_a_r_t_h_e_d	_A_r_c_a_n_a,	an AD&D	supplement.

	       The commands to use weapons are `w' (wield) and `t' (throw).

	       Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to pro-
	  tect yourself	from their blows.  Some	types of armor offer better
	  protection than others.  Your	armor class is a  measure  of  this
	  protection.  Armor class (AC)	is measured as in AD&D,	with 10	be-
	  ing the equivalent of	no armor, and lower numbers meaning  better
	  armor.   Each	 suit  of armor	which exists in	AD&D gives the same
	  protection in	NetHack.  Here is an (incomplete) list of the armor
	  classes provided by various suits of armor:

			     dragon scale mail	       1
			     plate mail		       3
			     bronze plate mail	       4
			     splint mail	       4
			     banded mail	       4
			     elven mithril-coat	       5
			     chain mail		       5
			     scale mail		       6
			     ring mail		       7
			     studded leather armor     7
			     leather armor	       8
			     no	armor		      10
			    ____________________________

	       You can also wear other pieces of armor (ex. helmets, boots,
	  shields,  cloaks) to lower your armor	class even further, but	you
	  can only wear	one item of each category (one suit of	armor,	one
	  cloak, one helmet, one shield, and so	on).




	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993






	  NetHack Guidebook						 16


	       If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection  will
	  be  better  (or  worse)  than	normal,	and its	``plus'' (or minus)
	  will subtract	from your armor	class.	For  example,  a  +1  chain
	  mail	would  give  you  better protection than normal	chain mail,
	  lowering your	armor class one	unit further to	4.  When you put on
	  a  piece  of	armor, you immediately find out	the armor class	and
	  any ``plusses'' it provides.	Cursed pieces of armor usually have
	  negative enchantments	(minuses) in addition to being unremovable.

	       The commands to use armor are `W' (wear)	and `T'	(take off).

	       Food is necessary to survive.  If you go	 too  long  without
	  eating  you  will  faint, and	eventually die of starvation.  Some
	  types	of food	will spoil, and	become unhealthy  to  eat,  if	not
	  protected.   Food  stored  in	 ice boxes or tins (``cans'' to	you
	  Americans) will usually stay fresh, but ice boxes are	heavy,	and
	  tins take a while to open.

	       When you	kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which	are
	  also ``food.''  Many,	but not	all, of	these are edible; some also
	  give you special powers when you eat them.  A	good rule of  thumb
	  is ``you are what you	eat.''

	       You can name one	food item after	something you like  to	eat

	       Scrolls are labeled with	various	titles,	probably chosen	 by
	  ancient  wizards  for	 their amusement value (ex. ``READ ME,'' or
	  ``HOLY BIBLE'' backwards).  Scrolls disappear	after you read them
	  (except for blank ones, without magic	spells on them).

	       One of the most useful of these is the _s_c_r_o_l_l  _o_f  _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_y,
	  which	can be used to determine what another object is, whether it
	  is cursed or blessed,	and how	many uses it has  left.	  Some	ob-
	  jects	 of  subtle  enchantment  are difficult	to identify without
	  these.

	       If you receive mail while you are playing (on versions  com-
	  piled	with this feature), a mail daemon may run up and deliver it
	  to you as a _s_c_r_o_l_l _o_f	_m_a_i_l.  To use this feature,  you  must	let
	  NetHack  know	 where to look for new mail by setting the ``MAIL''
	  environment variable to the file name	of your	mailbox.   You	may
	  also	want  to set the ``MAILREADER''	environment variable to	the
	  file name of your favorite reader, so	NetHack	 can  shell  to	 it
	  when you read	the scroll.

	       The command to read a scroll is `r'.

	       Potions are distinguished by the	color of the liquid  inside
	  the flask.  They disappear after you quaff them.

	       Clear potions are potions of  water.   Sometimes	 these	are
	  blessed or cursed, resulting in holy or unholy water.	 Holy water
	  is the bane of the undead, so	potions	 of  holy  water  are  good
	  thing	 to  throw  (`t') at them.  It also is very useful when	you
	  dip (``#dip'') other objects in it.

	       The command to drink a potion is	`q' (quaff).

	       Magic wands have	multiple magical charges.  Some	 wands	are
	  directional-you  must	 give  a direction to zap them in.  You	can
	  also zap them	at yourself (just give a `.' or	`s' for	the  direc-
	  tion),  but  it is often unwise.  Other wands	are nondirectional-
	  they don't ask for directions.  The number of	charges	in  a  wand
	  is random, and decreases by one whenever you use it.

	       The command to use a wand is `z'	(zap).

	       Rings are very useful items, since they are relatively  per-
	  manent  magic,  unlike  the  usually fleeting	effects	of potions,
	  scrolls, and wands.

	       Putting on a ring activates its magic.  You  can	 wear  only
	  two rings, one on each ring finger.

	       Most rings also cause you to grow hungry	more  rapidly,	the
	  rate varying with the	type of	ring.

	       The commands to use rings are `P' (put on) and `R' (remove).

	       Spell books are tomes of	mighty magic.	When  studied  with
	  the  `r'  (read)  command,  they bestow the knowledge	of a spell-
	  unless the attempt backfires.	 Reading a cursed  spell  book,	 or
	  one  with  mystic  runes  beyond  your ken can be harmful to your
	  health!

	       A spell can also	backfire when you cast it.  If you  attempt
	  to cast a spell well above your experience level, or cast it at a
	  time when your luck is particularly bad, you can end	up  wasting
	  both the energy and the time required	in casting.

	       Casting a spell calls forth  magical  energies  and  focuses
	  them with your naked mind.  Releasing	the magical energy releases
	  some of your memory of the spell with	it.  Each time you  cast  a

	  spell, your familiarity with it will dwindle,	until you eventual-
	  ly forget the	details	completely and must relearn it.

	       The command to read a spell book	is the same as for scrolls,
	  `r'  (read).	 The  `+' command lists	your current spells and	the
	  number of spell points they  require.	  The  `Z'  (cast)  command
	  casts	a spell.

	       Tools are miscellaneous objects with various purposes.  Some
	  tools,  like	wands, have a limited number of	uses.  For example,
	  lamps	burn out after a while.	 Other tools are containers,  which
	  objects can be placed	into or	taken out of.

	       The command to use tools	is `a' (apply).

	       You may encounter chests	or boxes in  your  travels.   These
	  can  be  opened with the ``#loot'' extended command when they	are
	  on the floor,	or with	the `a'	(apply)	command	when you are carry-
	  ing  one.   However,	chests are often locked, and require you to
	  either use a key to unlock it, a tool	to pick	 the  lock,  or	 to
	  break	it open	with brute force.  Chests are unwieldy objects,	and
	  must be set down to be unlocked (by kicking them, using a key	 or
	  lock	picking	 tool  with  the `a' (apply) command, or by using a
	  weapon to force the lock with	the ``#force'' extended	command).

	       Some chests are trapped,	causing	nasty things to	happen when
	  you unlock or	open them.  You	can check for and try to deactivate
	  traps	with the ``#untrap'' extended command.

	       Amulets are very	similar	to rings, and often more  powerful.
	  Like rings, amulets have various magical properties, some benefi-
	  cial,	some harmful, which are	activated by putting them on.

	       Some gems are valuable, and can be sold for a  lot  of  gold

	       Due to variations in personal tastes and	conceptions of	how
	  NetHack should do things, there are options you can set to change
	  how NetHack behaves.

	       Options may be set in a number of ways.	 Within	 the  game,
	  the `O' command allows you to	view all options and change most of
	  them.	 You can also set options automatically	by placing them	 in
	  the  NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable or a	configuration file.
	  Some versions	of NetHack also	have front-end programs	that  allow
	  you to set options before starting the game.

	       The NETHACKOPTIONS variable is a	comma-separated	list of	in-
	  itial	values for the various options.	 Some can only be turned on
	  or off.  You turn one	of these on by adding the name of  the	op-
	  tion	to  the	list, and turn it off by typing	a `!' or ``no''	be-
	  fore the name.  Others take a	character string as a  value.	You
	  can  set  string  options by typing the option name, a colon,	and
	  then the value of the	string.	 The value  is	terminated  by	the
	  next comma or	the end	of string.

	       For example, to set up an environment variable so that ``fe-
	  male''  is  on,  ``autopickup'' is off, the name is set to ``Blue
	  Meanie'', and	the fruit is set to ``papaya'',	you would enter	the
	  command

	       The default name	of the configuration file  varies  on  dif-

	  the full name	of a file you want to use (possibly preceded by	 an

	       Here are	explanations of	the various options do.	  Character
	  strings  longer than fifty characters	are truncated.	Some of	the
	  options listed may be	inactive in your dungeon.

	  autopickup
	       Pick up things you move onto by default (default	on).

	  BIOS
	       Use BIOS	calls to update	the screen display quickly  and	 to
	       read  the  keyboard (allowing the use of	arrow keys to move)
	       on machines with	an IBM PC compatible BIOS ROM (default off,
	       OS/2, PC, and ST	NetHack	only).

	  catname
	       Name your starting cat (ex. ``catname:Morris'').	 Cannot	 be
	       set with	the `O'	command.

	  checkpoint
	       Save game  state	 after	each  level  change,  for  possible
	       recovery	after program crash (default on).

	  color
	       Use color  for  different  monsters,  objects,  and  dungeon
	       features	(default on for	microcomputers).

	  confirm
	       Have user confirm attacks on pets,  shopkeepers,	 and  other
	       peaceable creatures (default on).

	  DECgraphics
	       Use a predefined	selection of characters	from  the  DEC	VT-
	       xxx/DEC	Rainbow/ ANSI line-drawing character set to display
	       the dungeon instead of having to	define a full graphics	set
	       yourself	(default off).	Cannot be set with the `O' command.

	  disclose
	       Offer to	disclose various information  when  the	 game  ends
	       (default	 all).	 The possibilities are identifying your	in-
	       ventory ('i'), disclosing your attributes ('a'),	summarizing
	       monsters	 that  have been vanquished ('v'), and listing mon-
	       ster species that have been genocided ('g').  Note that	the

	       vanquished  monsters  list  includes  all monsters killed by
	       traps and each other as well as by you.

	  dogname
	       Name your starting dog (ex.  ``dogname:Fang'').	 Cannot	 be
	       set with	the `O'	command.

	  female
	       Set your	sex (default off).  Cannot be set with the `O' com-
	       mand.

	  fixinv
	       An object's inventory letter sticks to it when it's  dropped
	       (default	on).  If this is off, dropping an object shifts	all
	       the remaining inventory letters.

	  fruit
	       Name  a	fruit  after  something	 you  enjoy   eating   (ex.
	       ``fruit:mango'')	 (default ``slime mold''.  Basically a nos-
	       talgic whimsy that NetHack uses	from  time  to	time.	You
	       should  set  this to something you find more appetizing than
	       slime mold.  Apples, oranges, pears, bananas, and melons	al-
	       ready exist in NetHack, so don't	use those.

	  graphics
	       Set the graphics	symbols	for screen displays (default ``	|--
	       ------||.-|++.##<><>\^"_\\#{}.}..## #}|-\\/*!)(0#@*/-\\||\\-
	       //-\\| |\\-/'').	 If specified, the ggggrrrraaaapppphhhhiiiiccccssss  option  should
	       come  last,  followed  by  a string of 1-69 characters to be
	       used instead of the  default  map-drawing  characters.	The
	       dungeon	map  will use the characters you specify instead of
	       the default symbols.  Remember that you may need	 to  escape
	       some of these characters	if, for	example, you use _c_s_h.

	       The  DDDDEEEECCCCggggrrrraaaapppphhhhiiiiccccssss	 and  IIIIBBBBMMMMggggrrrraaaapppphhhhiiiiccccssss  options  use	 predefined
	       selections  of  graphics	 symbols, so you need not go to	the
	       trouble of setting up a full graphics string for	these  com-
	       mon cases.  These two options also set up proper	handling of
	       graphics	characters for such terminals, so you should speci-
	       fy  them	 as appropriate	even if	you override the selections
	       with your own graphics string.

	       Note that this option string is now escape-processed in con-
	       ventional  C  fashion.	This  means that `\' is	a prefix to
	       take the	following character literally, and not as a special
	       prefix.	 Your  graphics	 strings  for NetHack 2.2 and older
	       versions	may contain a `\'; it must be doubled for the  same
	       effect  now.   The  special escape form `\m' switches on	the
	       meta bit	in the following  character,  and  the	`^'  prefix
	       causes  the  following  character to be treated as a control
	       character (so any `^' in	your old graphics strings should be
	       changed to `\^' now).  Also note	that there are more symbols
	       in a different order than used for NetHack 3.0.



	  NetHack 3.1					   January 25, 1993






	  NetHack Guidebook						 22


	       The order of the	symbols	is: solid rock,	vertical wall, hor-
	       izontal	wall,  upper left corner, upper	right corner, lower
	       left corner, lower right	corner,	cross wall, upward T  wall,
	       downward	T wall,	leftward T wall, rightward T wall, no door,
	       vertical	open door, horizontal open  door,  vertical  closed
	       door,  horizontal  closed door, floor of	a room,	dark corri-
	       dor, lit	corridor, stairs up, stairs down, ladder up, ladder
	       down, trap, web,	altar, throne, kitchen sink, fountain, pool
	       or moat,	ice, lava, vertical lowered drawbridge,	 horizontal
	       lowered	drawbridge,  vertical raised drawbridge, horizontal
	       raised drawbridge, air, cloud, under water,  vertical  beam,
	       horizontal beam,	left slant, right slant, digging beam, cam-
	       era flash beam, left boomerang, right boomerang,	four glyphs
	       giving the sequence for magic resistance	displays; the eight
	       surrounding glyphs for swallowed	display;  nine	glyphs	for
	       explosions.   An	explosion consists of three rows (top, mid-
	       dle, and	bottom)	of three characters.  The explosion is cen-
	       tered in	the center of this 3 by	3 array.

	       You might want to use `+' for the corners and T walls for  a
	       more  aesthetic,	 boxier	 display.   Note  that	in the next
	       release,	new symbols may	be added, or the present ones rear-
	       ranged.

	       Cannot be set with the `O' command.

	  help If more information is available	for  an	 object	 looked	 at
	       with  the  `/'  command,	 ask if	you want to see	it (default
	       on). Turning help off makes just	looking	at  things  faster,
	       since you aren't	interrupted with the ``More info?'' prompt,
	       but it also means  that	you  might  miss  some	interesting
	       and/or important	information.

	  hilite_pet
	       Highlight pets when color is turned off (default	off).

	  IBMgraphics
	       Use a predefined	selection of IBM extended ASCII	 characters
	       to  display  the	 dungeon instead of having to define a full
	       graphics	set yourself (default off).  Cannot be set with	the
	       `O' command.

	  ignintr
	       Ignore interrupt	signals, including breaks (default off).

	  legacy
	       Display an introductory message when starting the game  (de-
	       fault on).

	  lit_corridor
	       Show corridor squares seen by night vision or a light source
	       held by your character as lit (default off).

	  male
	       Set your	sex (default on, most hackers are male).  Cannot be
	       set with	the `O'	command.

	  monsters
	       Set the characters used to display monster classes  (default
	       ``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX-
	       YZ@ \&;:~]'').  This string is subjected	to  the	 same  pro-
	       cessing as the ggggrrrraaaapppphhhhiiiiccccssss option.	The order of the symbols is
	       ant or other insect, blob, cockatrice, dog or other  canine,
	       eye  or	sphere,	 feline,  gremlin,  humanoid,  imp or minor
	       demon, jelly, kobold, leprechaun,  mimic,  nymph,  orc,	pi-
	       ercer,  quadruped,  rodent, spider, trapper or lurker above,
	       unicorn,	vortex,	worm, xan or other  mythical/fantastic	in-
	       sect,  light,  zruty,  angelic  being, bat, centaur, dragon,
	       elemental, fungus or mold, gnome, giant humanoid,  invisible
	       stalker,	 jabberwock, Keystone Kop, lich, mummy,	naga, ogre,
	       pudding or ooze,	 quantum  mechanic,  rust  monster,  snake,
	       troll,  umber  hulk,  vampire,  wraith, xorn, yeti or ape or
	       other large beast, zombie, human, ghost,	golem,	demon,	sea
	       monster,	 lizard,  long worm tail, and mimic.  Cannot be	set
	       with the	`O' command.

	  msghistory
	       The number of top line messages to save (and recall with	^P)
	       (default	20).  Cannot be	set with the `O' command.

	  name
	       Set your	character's name (defaults to your user	name).	You
	       can  also  set  your character class by appending a dash	and
	       the first letter	of the character class (that is, by suffix-
	       ing  one	 of ----AAAA ----BBBB ----CCCC ----EEEE	----HHHH ----KKKK ----PPPP ----RRRR ----SSSS ----TTTT ----VVVV ----WWWW).  If ----@@@@ is
	       used for	the class, then	a random one will be  automatically
	       chosen.	Cannot be set with the `O' command.

	  news
	       Read the	NetHack	news file, if present (default on).   Since
	       the  news  is shown at the beginning of the game, there's no
	       point in	setting	this with the `O' command.

	  null
	       Send padding nulls to the terminal (default off).

	  number_pad
	       Use the number keys to move instead of  [yuhjklbn]  (default
	       off).

	  objects
	       Set the characters used to display object  classes  (default
	       ``])[="(%!?+/$*`0_.'').	 This  string  is  subjected to	the
	       same processing as the ggggrrrraaaapppphhhhiiiiccccssss option.	The  order  of	the
	       symbols	is  illegal-object  (should never be seen), weapon,
	       armor, ring, amulet, tool, food,	potion,	scroll,	spell book,
	       wand,  gold,  gem  or  rock,  boulder  or statue, iron ball,

	       chain, and venom.  Cannot be set	with the `O' command.

	  packorder
	       Specify	the  order  to	list  object  types   in   (default
	       ``\")[%?+/=!(*`0_'').   The value of this option	should be a
	       string containing the symbols for the various object types.

	  pettype
	       Specify the type	of your	initial	pet, if	you are	 playing  a
	       character  class	 that  uses  both  types of pets.  Possible
	       values are ``cat'' and ``dog''.	Cannot be set with the	`O'
	       command.

	  pickup_types
	       Specify the object types	to be picked up	when aaaauuuuttttooooppppiiiicccckkkkuuuupppp	 is
	       on.  Default is all types.

	  rawio
	       Force raw (non-cbreak) mode for faster output and more  bul-
	       letproof	 input	(MS-DOS	 sometimes treats `^P' as a printer
	       toggle without it) (default off).  Note:	 DEC Rainbows  hang
	       if this is turned on.  Cannot be	set with the `O' command.

	  rest_on_space
	       Make the	space bar a synonym for	the `.'	(rest) command (de-
	       fault off).

	  safe_pet
	       Prevent you from	(knowingly) attacking  your  pets  (default
	       on).

	  scores
	       Control what parts of the score list you	are  shown  at	the
	       end  (ex.   ``scores:5  top  scores/4  around  my  score/own
	       scores'').  Only	the first letter  of  each  category  (`t',
	       `a', or `o') is necessary.

	  showexp
	       Show your accumulated experience	points on bottom line  (de-
	       fault off).

	  showscore
	       Show your approximate accumulated score on bottom line  (de-
	       fault off).

	  silent
	       Suppress	terminal beeps (default	on).

	  sortpack
	       Sort the	pack contents by  type	when  displaying  inventory
	       (default	on).

	  standout
	       Boldface	monsters and ``--------MMMMoooorrrreeee--------'' (default off).

	  time
	       Show the	elapsed	game time in turns on bottom line  (default
	       off).

	  tombstone
	       Draw a tombstone	graphic	upon your death	(default on).

	  verbose
	       Provide more commentary during the game (default	on).

	  videocolors
	       Set the color palette for PC systems using NO_TERMS (default
	       4  2  6	1 5 3 15 12 10 14 9 13 11).  The order of colors is
	       red,  green,  brown,  blue,  magenta,  cyan,   bright.white,
	       bright.red,	bright.green,	   yellow,     bright.blue,
	       bright.magenta, and bright.cyan.	 Cannot	be set with the	`O'
	       command.

	  videoshades
	       Set the intensity level of the three gray  scales  available
	       (default	 dark  normal light, PC	NetHack	only).	If the game
	       display is difficult to read, try adjusting these scales; if
	       this  does  not	correct	the problem, try !color.  Cannot be
	       set with	the `O'	command.

	  windowtype
	       Select which windowing system to	use,  such  as	``tty''	 or
	       ``X11''	(default  depends  on version).	 Cannot	be set with
	       the `O' command.

	       NetHack maintains a list	of the top  scores  or	scorers	 on
	  your machine,	depending on how it is set up.	In the latter case,
	  each account on the machine can post only one	 non-winning  score
	  on  this  list.   If	you  score higher than someone else on this
	  list,	or better your previous	score, you will	be inserted in	the
	  proper  place	 under your current name.  How many scores are kept
	  can also be set up when NetHack is compiled.

	       Your score is chiefly based upon	 how  much  experience	you
	  gained, how much loot	you accumulated, how deep you explored,	and
	  how the game ended.  If you quit the game, you escape	with all of
	  your	gold  intact.	If, however, you get killed in the Mazes of
	  Menace, the guild will only hear about 90% of	your gold when your
	  corpse  is  discovered  (adventurers	have  been known to collect
	  finder's fees).  So, consider	whether	you want to take  one  last
	  hit  at  that	 monster  and  possibly	live, or quit and stop with
	  whatever you have.  If you quit, you keep all	your gold,  but	 if
	  you swing and	live, you might	find more.

	       If you just want	to see what the	current	 top  players/games
	  list is, you can type	nnnneeeetttthhhhaaaacccckkkk	----ssss aaaallllllll on most versions.

	       NetHack is an intricate and difficult game.   Novices  might
	  falter in fear, aware	of their ignorance of the means	to survive.
	  Well,	fear not.  Your	dungeon	may come  equipped  with  an  ``ex-
	  plore''  or  ``discovery'' mode that enables you to keep old save
	  files	and cheat death, at the	paltry cost of not getting  on	the
	  high score list.

	       There are two ways of enabling  explore	mode.	One  is	 to
	  start	the game with the ----XXXX switch.  The other	is to issue the	`X'
	  command while	already	playing	the game.  The	other  benefits	 of
	  explore mode are left	for the	trepid reader to discover.

	       The original _h_a_c_k game was modeled on the Berkeley UNIX	_r_o_-
	  _g_u_e  game.  Large portions of	this paper were	shamelessly cribbed
	  from _A _G_u_i_d_e _t_o _t_h_e _D_u_n_g_e_o_n_s _o_f _D_o_o_m,	by Michael C. Toy and  Ken-
	  neth	C.  R. C. Arnold.  Small portions were adapted from _F_u_r_t_h_e_r

	       NetHack is the product of literally dozens of people's work.
	  Main	events	in the course of the game development are described

	  a  very  different  game, and	published (at least) three versions
	  (1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for	UNIX machines to the Usenet.

	  producing  PC	 HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics
	  in version 1.03g, and	went on	to produce at least four more  ver-
	  sions	(3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6).
