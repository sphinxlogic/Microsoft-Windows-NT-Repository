Changes from v3.02 to V3.03

	A fixed assert in create.c line 607

	Imakefile altered so that 'make install' does sensible
	things, like set the score directory and file up, and set
	access rights for setuid or other.

	'make clean.sprites' can be used to remove all the sprites
	generated by 'make sprites'.

	COMPILATION file altered to reflect above changes.
