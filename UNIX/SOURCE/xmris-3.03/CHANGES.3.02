Changes from v3.00 to V3.02

	timer.c had a recursive sighold #define for SYSV, which breaks
	K&R compilers.

	create.c colour check broke with static visuals.

	scores > SCORE_THRESHOLD never got into the personal score file.

	setuid calls were wrong, these are now set effective user id only.

	COMPILATION file has been augmented to explain install precedure and
	scram use better.

	Some monster stuff tightened up.

	Diamond stuff was wrong.

	Triggered assert fixed (sort of).
