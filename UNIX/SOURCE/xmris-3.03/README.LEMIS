This directory contains source and objects for xmris, a video arcade
game

Program:	xmris
Revision:	3.03
Date ported:	11 May 1993
Ported by:	Andrew Josey, USL
		Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.3.3

Prerequisites:	

Documentation:	man page


Installation:	DIFFERENT from other X programs: xmkmf, make scram,
		make sprites, make, make install, install-sysv.

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		make scram and make sprites make the header files
		needed for compilation. If you leave these out, you'll
		get lots of `file not found' messages from the
		compiler.

		For some reason, this program gets installed setuid.
		This is a bad idea, since it stops anybody except root
		using it (the dynamic libraries don't get found).

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4, involving significant mods to the Imakefile.
