TODO file for GNU m4 - last revised 08 November 1993.
These are more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Use a config.h file.

* <stdarg.h> versus <varargs.h> (check Solaris' cc, which fails).

* eval(08) does not return an error.

* Study synclines at the very beginning of each diverted sequence.

* Carefully revise overall const usage.

* Use rx.[ch] instead of regex.[ch].

* Have NULs go really undisturbed through GNU m4.  See `dumpdef' and
debugging section, which abuses %s.
From Thorsten Ohl <ohl@chico.harvard.edu>, 1992-12-21.

* Profile GNU m4 and speed it up.
From David J. MacKenzie <djm@eng.umd.edu>, 1993-01-20.

* Make eval work on bignums - the 32 bits limit is artificial.
From Krste Asanovic <krste@icsi.berkeley.edu>, 1993-03-20.

* Clean up the obstack.[ch] code.
