This is release 1.1 of GNU m4, a program which copies its input to the
output, expanding macros as it goes.  m4 has built-in functions for
including named files, running Unix commands, doing integer
arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways, recursion, etc...
Macros can also be user-defined, and can take any number of arguments.

Beware there *are* incompatibilities between this GNU m4 release and
the previous one.  GNU m4 lovers will ensure they read the file NEWS.

In the subdirectory `examples' you will find various m4 files, ranging
from trivial test files to rather advanced macros.  If you intend to
use m4 seriously, you might find useful material down there.

See the file COPYING for copying conditions.

See the file THANKS for a list of contributors.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

Send bug reports to <bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu>.  A bug report is
an adequate description of the problem: your input, what you expected,
what you got, and why this is wrong.  Even if useful, diffs describe a
solution, I can not always correctly infer the problem from them.

GNU m4 has originally been written by Rene' Seindal, from Denmark.
Let me express the appreciation received from many GNU m4 users.
