INSTALLING BMS, THE BATCH-MODE MANDELSPAWN CLIENT

This is the first release of bms, so you should be aware that it still
has limited functionality and it is probably still somewhat buggy.
Please report any bugs you find to gson@niksula.hut.fi.

To install:

 * Edit the Makefile if necessary and run make.
 * Copy the binary bms to the appropriate directory, such as /usr/local/bin
 * Install the man page bms.1 in the appropriate place

To post-process bms output and convert it to other graphics file
formats, you should get Jef Poskanzer's PBMPLUS image processing and
conversion package which is available by FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
and many other places.  Please don't ask me to get it for you.

For general information about MandelSpawn see the README file.
