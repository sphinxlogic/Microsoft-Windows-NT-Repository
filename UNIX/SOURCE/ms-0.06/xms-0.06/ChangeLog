Sun Nov 24 12:38:12 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at hydroman.cs.hut.fi)

	* Wrapped version 0.06

	* Added option details to the synopsis in xms.man

	* Tested the new ms_draw() on monochrome and 8-bit colour
	Suns.

	* Completely rewrote the black-and-white special case display
	support in Ms.c:ms_draw(), so that it now constructs the image
	a byte at a time rather than a word at a time.  This should
	avoid any byteorder problems.

Tue Nov  5 17:23:38 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at bulldozer.cs.hut.fi)

	* Version number is now 0.05p.  Changed some key bindings to be 
	more consistent with the new "zoom by default" policy, and
	updated the manual page correspondingly.

Mon Sep 30 01:01:40 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Added XtNinput argument to shell widget; that ought to
	fix the keyboard focus problem with OpenWindows (not tested).

Sun Sep 22 12:07:27 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Edited README and mslaved/Makefile; now gcc is stronly recommended
	only for old CISCs.  Made floating point the default for MIPS in
	ms_real.h as suggested by broadley's benchmarks.

	* restored the menu entries for using the old window but made the
	popup alternative more defaultish (no, I don't run spell on
	ChangeLogs). 

	* added #include <sys/file.h> to ms_ipc.h (needed for FNDELAY in
	HP-UX) 

	* fixed some syntax errors in mslaved.c

	* added #include <netinet/in.h> in Ms.c to get htonl() and ntohs()
	macro definitions (needed for HP-UX)

Sat Sep 14 00:09:20 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* #ifdef'ed away the menu entries for reusing the old window

Sun Aug 11 14:42:55 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Added "inverse box zooming" as suggested by RMS.  Still
	untested.

Sat Aug 10 10:32:51 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Added #include <errno.h> in work.c

	* Wrapped 0.05j and mailed to broadley for beta testing

	* Renamed split.c to mspawn.c

	* Tested 0.05h on SPARCstation IPC.  Fixed some bugs in the
	noImakefile and documented problems with missing imake and
	Aw libs.  Version with these fixes called 0.05i.

Fri Jul 26 14:23:57 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Fixed some more typos and made some other changes in the man
	pages

	* Wrapped 0.05h	and gave it to ufa@niksula.hut.fi for beta 
	testing 

Sun Jul 21 12:36:22 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Wrote the bms batch mode client and renamed the X client to
	xms.  This also caused lots of changes to both source and 
	documentation of xms because of extensive code sharing between the
	two clients.  Mandelbrot-dependent but X-independent
	code has been separated into a new module, mspawn.c, leaving
	code that is both X- and Mandelbrot-independent in work.c.
	The timeout system has been completely rewritten.

	* MIPS fixed-point code has been tested on a DECStation.

Wed Jun 26 17:01:04 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at gunnar)

	* Separated the X-independent workload distribution stuff
	into a new module, work.c.  Renamed all X-independent files
	to lowercase names to reduce ugliness.  Added missing "2" in
	MIPS fracmult2 function name; need to retest MIPS code before
	distributing it.

Tue Jun 18 21:34:57 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Fixed several typos in the man page

Sun May 19 10:49:05 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Corrected some typos, added crosshair at center of rubberband box

Wed Mar 27 19:15:30 1991  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at canopus.hut.fi)

	* Hacked README somewhat

Wed Dec 26 11:18:55 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Documented some incompatibilities with Mach and Silicon Graphics

	* Made ping() in mslavedc.c use the port given with the -p
	option instead of always using the default port

	* Added fixed point support for MIPS

Tue Oct 16 16:26:40 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at canopus.hut.fi)

	* Reverted to the old behaviour of ignoring EWOULDBLOCK
	errors on slave socket input because a user reported getting
	these errors with 0.05; could this be an X11R3 bug fixed in X11R4?

	* Changed main.c to declare rindex() by including <X11/Xos.h>
	instead of rolling its own declaration; rindex is a macro on
	the NeXT.

	* Removed a bogus dependency from the noImakefile

	* Made 0.05 available for FTP from funic.funet.fi and announced 
	it in comp.windows.x and alt.fractals

Fri Oct  5 13:06:42 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at vega.hut.fi)

	* Made the "ping" code in mslavedc.c SYSV-safe (still untested)

	* Fixed outdated usage message in mslavedc.c

	* Mslaved no longer makes the incorrect assumption that
	ntohl(long) returns a signed value (this caused problems
	on some little-endian machines running System V or Ultrix).

Wed Sep 12 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Made mslaved check for convergence by looking for
	repeated values in the iteration sequence (this really speeds
	things up with large iteration counts).  Installed new
	server and client in Niksula as 0.05beta.

	* Made slave timeout dependent of the iteration count

	* Added sanity check of UDP port number read from .mslaves
	(random text in the port field used to cause the not very
	informative error message "can't assign requested address").

Sat Aug 25 17:48:25 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Added code to create a private colormap if allocation from
	the default colormap fails.

	* Updated MANIFEST, renamed the makefile to noImakefile.

Sun Aug  5 19:31:17 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Added a simple Makefile for those not using Imake.

Sat Aug  4 19:00:51 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Merged some System V support fixes into ms-0.05.

Wed Jul 11 14:43:31 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at canopus.hut.fi)

	* Fixed nasty bug in InitSlaves where too little memory was
	allocated for the warning message because it used sizeof with
	a char pointer instead of a char array. 

Thu May 10 16:38:57 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Move the overflow label from the center to the upper left
	corner; changed backing store attribute of the Ms window
	from WhenMapped to Always.

Fri May  4 14:54:41 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Changed the superclass of the Ms widget from core to composite
	and added the overflow label widget (only when LABEL is defined).

Tue Apr 17 22:31:47 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Documented the initial view options.

	* Added -DR4 to DEFINES for X11R4 in Imakefile; put
	Put "#ifdef R4" around the resource converter code in main.c.

	* Edited README

Wed Apr  4 14:42:28 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Updated version number to 0.05.  There is support for
	specifying an initial view using command line options
	but it is still undocumented.  Must check how to
	register resource converters under X11R2..3.

Wed Feb 14 16:28:22 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Wrapped 0.04 and made it available for anonymous FTP from
	sauna.hut.fi

Mon Feb 12 14:07:44 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Documented the -greyscale option

	* Updated MANIFEST and added some comments to Imakefile

Mon Feb  8  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Added menu entries for showing window range and performance
	statistics; changed formatting of statistics printout.

Mon Feb  5 13:37:35 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Made Ms.c discover endianness at runtime, thus eliminating
	the -Dx_ENDIAN compiler flags.

Thu Feb  1 11:47:38 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* fixed a bug causing clients running on little-endian machines
	to draw byteswapped pictures on 1-plane displays

	* restructured the display type/iteration count info;
	added support for 1-plane displays with iteration counts >=256

	* changed translations in R4 version to match the documentation

	* changed name of "-bw" option to "-greyscale"

Tue Jan 30 08:03:22 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Wrote a simple Imakefile (client only )

	* Added a SimpleMenu for R4 only

	* dot-mslaves: Added port number to host experimental.hut.fi

Wed Jan 24 12:21:59 1990  Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Added "-bw" option

	* Restructured some code in Ms.c in preparation for
	merging with the SimpleMenu code; added "Action" suffix
	to the names of all action routines.

	* Fixed a bug in the enslave script that caused it 
	to start only 2..3 of the servers.  Added ChangeLog
	file.  Fixed FTP info in README file (wrong host).

Mon Jan 22 1990 Andreas Gustafsson  (gson at spica.hut.fi)

	* Version 0.03 announced on nordunet.sources.list
