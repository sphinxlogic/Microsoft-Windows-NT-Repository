cisdownload @(#)Download CIS LIB file with XC   JPRadley 20 May 92 vers 0.1
Assumes System-wide preference for B+ set in GO PROFILE.
Assumes Prompt character in all Fora is ^H.

Could use more checks. Providing a non-existent Forum, or one which one
has not joined; providing an incorrect or inaccessible LIB number;
providing a non-existent filename: all of these will cause failure
while the meter's ticking.
But if "all systems are go", then this should save a few pennies.
