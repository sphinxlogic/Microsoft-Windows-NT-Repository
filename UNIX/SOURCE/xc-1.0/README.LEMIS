Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

Modifications:

0. Run Configure. Don't get a choice of where to install man pages
   (the path is wrong), so fix Makefile.xc.

1. Make clean removes the Makefile.xc and other stuff. Rename target
   to 'tooclean' and make a sensible clean target.

2. Fix Makefile to install everything with target install.

3. Fix #ifdef a=b in xcport.c.
