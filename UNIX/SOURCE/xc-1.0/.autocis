# .autocis - xc script to visit CIS automagically.
# This file uses 4-character tabstops.
# It will log in, visit CIS Mail (if mail is waiting), then the
#  PRACTICE and UNIX Fora, uploading any prepared files, downloading
#  all new messages, and capture them into three separate files.

# The following assumption is made about your CIS interactions:
#  You are in "expert" mode in MAIL.
#  You are in Command mode in all Fora.
#  You have opted for continuous reading in all Fora.
#  You have set your Prompt Char set to '^H' --backspace-- in all Fora.
#	This last is VERY critical to the properly trigger the WAITFORs

# This script will call another script, .temp_opt, to set Forum options
# for only the current login
