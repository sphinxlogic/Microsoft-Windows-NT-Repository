@(#) XC README, patchlevel 4.1 JPRadley 10 April 1993
This file (and almost every other one in the distribution) uses 4-character
tabstops.
The supplied .exrc file sets ts=4 and sw=4, for vi's purposes.

Once upon a time (in 1985 or so), a fellow named Eric Coe wrote a Unix dialout
telecommunications program with xmodem called XCOMM. This program was
substantially upgraded and improved by another fellow named Larry Gensch, who
brought XCOMM up to Version 2.2. Version 2.2 included a simple script
language, 128-byte Xmodem and Compuserve Quick-B file-transfer protocols, and
some other stuff. Fred Buck then changed the program name to XCMALT, which it
maintained until June 1991, when Jean-Pierre Radley renamed it XC. 

XC is a massive expansion and modification of XCOMM 2.2. Many bugs in
XCOMM 2.2 have been fixed, and many advertised features that didn't work in
XCOMM 2.2 do work in XC. Also, XC includes a fullscreen dialing directory; a
totally rewritten and much more powerful script language allowing, among other
things, remote execution of shell commands and unattended protocol-controlled
file transfer (provided that your system also has Chuck Forsberg's "rz/sz"
Xmodem/Ymodem/Zmodem program, available as shareware from many sources), a
flexible variable mechanism, including access to shell environment variables,
and more; BREAK-signal capability; the capability to upload a file in ASCII
from within a script; and miscellaneous cosmetic changes.

But while XC incorporates much of Larry Gensch's work, it's not supported by
Larry Gensch (although he contributed the key-binding features starting with
XC3.2a). The changes from XCOMM 2.2 are the product of Steve Manes, who
installed uucp LCKfile support and special compile-time tuning for SCO Xenix,
and who wrote the fullscreen dialing directory; Fred Buck, who rewrote the
script language, performed various bugfixes and alterations, and installed
special compile-time tuning for the Tandy 6000; and Jean-Pierre Radley, who
installed the B+ Protocol, used more termcap features, and is now the
"caretaker" of XC.

Run Configure. There are various definitions that have to be set according
to your flavor of Unix, your preference for default directories, and other
user-definable items.

Typing just "make" will compile XC. On most systems, XC should be run "suid
uucp", and in order to do this, you should have chosen "uucp" as the user
to own the program, and 4755 as its permissions. If so, typing "make
install.suid" willl strip out its symbol table, place the program in INSDIR,
and change its modes and permissions accordingly. If you did not elect
this when running Configure, you can type "make install", but XC's permissions
will probably not allow it to properly cope with dial-in/dial-out ports.

The "xc.nro" file is 'nroff' source for a manual page which describes the
command-line options, the various commands once you're running XC, script
language, file transfers, and the price of milk in Soviet Georgia in 1986.
This file MUST pass through 'tbl' and 'col', e.g.,
	"tbl xc.nro | nroff -man | col > /usr/man/cat.L/xc.L".

Some distribution files that you might adapt to your own purposes:

	.exrc		sets tabstops and shiftwidth to 4, which is necessary
				to properly view almost every file in the XC distribution.
				It also contains, commented out, macros to help read
				CompuServe message downloads, and to prepare replies.

	.xc			sample startup script, demonstrates keyboard bindings

	.phonelist	sample dialing directory data file

	.callhq		sample script to call a Unix/Xenix system

	.uni		sample script to call CompuServe and enter UnixForum

	.aus		sample script to call CompuServe and enter, in turn,
				SCOForum and UnixForum, uploading any prepared messages,
				capturing all new messages into separate files, and
				hanging up.

	.autocis	sample script to call CompuServe, get any waiting
				Mail into a capture file, then visit the PRACTICE
				and the Unix Fora in turn, uploading any prepared
				messages, capturing all new messages into separate
				files, then hanging up.

	.cisdial	meant to be called as a sub-script for dialing
				CompuServe.

	.temp_opt	meant to be called as a sub-script for temporary
				setting of Options in a CompuServe Forum to make
				efficient use of .autocis, .aus, or .uni.

	.pass		a subscript containing passwords for various sites.
				This should have very restrictive permissions.

	.rz			sample script to receive files using the public
				domain "rz/sz" package.

	.sz			sample script to send files using the public domain
				"rz/sz" package.

	call		a Bourne shell script to use a spare modem to dial
				voice calls for you.

	callback	a Bourne shell script to call a site and have it
				return the call and present a 'login:' prompt.

	cisdownload a Bourne shell script to fetch a file from a Library
				in a CompuServe Forum.

===================================


Note: in the original XCOMM file "install.doc", Larry Gensch gave his
various mail addresses for users to reach him about bug reports, upgrade
requests, and the like. But Larry doesn't support (or in fact have anything
to do with) XC/XCMALT, except as a contributor, and the fact that
XCMALT is based on XCOMM 2.2, so there's no point in including this
information here. 
Fred Buck, who made the major changes from XCOMM to XCMALT, passed away in
early 1989.
Jean-Pierre Radley has since been shepherding the program as it evolved from
XCMALT to XC.
