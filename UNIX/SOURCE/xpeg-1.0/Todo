				The TODO List - Xpeg

Note:  If you see something you would like to do here. Please e-mail me or call so
       I can coordinate independent actions, and thus prevent duplication of effort.

       If you want to add a feature not mentioned here, the same applies.

       Patches are definitly welcome.  Larry Wall's patch format preferred. Diffs accepted.

       If you add to this file, try to add in the same "awk"able format it is in now.

  Problem     : Make the stupid Athena Pane holding the people resize when you
		add a new person.  Or find an alternate Widget to hold them that
		will resize.

  Problem     : Make person name a menubutton, that pops up a menu of common
		locations to place into the location spot. Could make this
		an action in the editor, I suppose but that has implications for
		the readonly part of it. Could be another command button called
	 	common.  Menu defined by enviroment var, or resource file, or
		command line.
