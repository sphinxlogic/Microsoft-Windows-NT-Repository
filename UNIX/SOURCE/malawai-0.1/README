This is Malawi.

Malawi is a 2 players board game modeled after PIATNIK game No. 6104 by
Gerhard Kodys.

The sources are available from

	ftp.risc.uni-linz.ac.at:/pub/x11/malawi-0.1.tar.Z


Installation:

If you have imake:

	csh> xmkmf
	csh> make
	csh> make install
	csh> make install.man

If you don't have imake, try

	csh> make -f Makefile.std

To test the program

	csh> (setenv XFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad; ./malawi)

because the application defaults are mandatory for malawi to display correctly.

The program runs on the following platforms:

	Sequent, DYNIX/ptx 1.3.1 (SYSV 3.2), X11R5, gcc
	Apollo, Domain/OS 10.3.4 (BSD 4.3), X11R4, cc
	DEC 5000/240, Ultrix 4.2, X11R5, cc
	IBM RS6000, AIX 3.2.2, X11R5, cc

Since the program is fairly operating system independent, it should actually
compile under every environment with X11R4 or higher.

Since my native language is not English any comments on and improvements of
English prose anywhere in the source and, most importantly, in the man page
are welcome.
