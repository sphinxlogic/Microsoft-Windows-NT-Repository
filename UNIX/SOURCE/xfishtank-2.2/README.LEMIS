Date ported:	3 May 1993
Ported by:	Andrew Josey, USL
		Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.3.3

Prerequisites:	

Documentation:	None - just the README file in this directory.


Installation:	1. xmkmf
		2. edit Makefile manually, remove -g flag
		3. make
		4. make install
		5. run `install' to add odds and ends

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		The original version of this program broke the USL CCS
		assembler. This version has been reduced somewhat to
		make it work at all. This is also the reason that it
		is necessary to remove the debugging flag: without it,
		CCS will still die with the message `Memory error:
		Output file space: Not enough space".

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4
