# faces - example installation front-end for faces
#
# This is a shell script front-end to the faces binary.  If you share your
# faces databases across machines of different architectures via NFS, you
# can also share binaries compiled for each architecture likewise, and use
# this script as the installed faces to run the appropriate one.  You need
# an "arch" command that outputs the machine's architecture (for example,
# "mips", "sun3", "sun4", "vax").
#
# Also, you can specify the default FACEPATH here and change it without
# having to recompile faces.
#
# Lastly, you can extend faces with "-e" applications and implement them
# as options to faces with appropriate default FACEPATHs via this script.
#
# If no FACEPATH is defined in the environment and no FACEPATH is
# specified via -f, then this script changes directory to /usr/local/faces
# and specifies FACEPATH directories as relative to the there.  This can
# speed up faces' bitmap lookups considerably.  However, programs given
# with -e will have to be in the PATH, given with an absolute pathname, or
# given with a pathname relative to /usr/local/faces.  Also, they will be
# invoked with /usr/local/faces as the current directory.
#
# You'll probably have to hack this script to work at your site.  It's
# intended primarily as an example of one way to install faces.
