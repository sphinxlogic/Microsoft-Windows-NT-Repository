KNOWEN PATCHES:

        There are no known patches 
        NOTE - this is version 2.0 and all version 1.0
        patches have already been applied. ONLY APPLY PATCHES THAT HAVE A 
        NAME WITH xbmbrowser2.0.patchXX in it. where XX is the number of the 
        patch. ALWAYS apply the patches in numerical order.

THE COMMAND MENU.
In the file xbmbrowser.menu are brief instructions on how to set up the menu. 
This file also contains the default menu setup. You should look at it to 
ensure that it suits your setup. To change the location that the default file 
is placed you have to do the same as for the help file (see below).

HELP FILE LOCATION.
You can change the deafult location at the program expects the help file to be.
to do this, if you are using the Imakefile then you must change the first line
in the Imakefile (the one starting with HELPFILE = -DHELPFILE=.....), this is
what tells the program where to look for the file, you will then also have to 
change the line "InstallNonExecFile(xbmbrowser.help,$(LIBDIR))" so that the 
second parameter is where to put the file (the directory only - without the 
file name).
If However you are using the Makefile.std (standard makefile) you will have to
change the #define HELPFILE line in xbmbrowser.h to the directory that you put
the help file into. (You will have to manually move it there).

Installation:

With Imake:

   type:
     xmkmf
     make
     make install
     make instal.man

With normal make:

   type:
     mv Makefile.std Makefile
     make
   then you will have to manually move the executable, the help file and man 
page to where you want to put them.

For information on how to use xbmbrowser, look at xbmbrowser.help, or press the 
[Help] button when it is running.

If you wish to change the program, then please feel free. However please
leave the copyright notices unchanged but add one detailing your changes, you
should also not just increment the version number, but add something unique
to it (like your name or something).
