       format

       The _t_f_t_o_p_l program translates  a  (program-oriented)  font
       metric  file  to  a  (human-oriented)  property list file.
       Thus, you can edit the contents of the TFM files,  if  the
       font  designer has not done his or her job properly, or if
       you're encountering strange  difficulties,  or  if  you're
       just  curious.   It  also  serves as a TFM-file validating
       program,i.e., if no error messages are  given,  the  input
       file is correct.

       The  _p_l__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e  must  be complete. No adding of default
       extensions or path searching is done.  If the _p_l__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
       is  not given, standard output is used. The _t_f_m__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e,
       on the other hand, is searched for using  the  environment
       variable  TEXFONTS.   See  tteexx(1)  for  the details of the
       searching.  If TEXFONTS is not set,  it  uses  the  system
       default: ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.

       Without  the  -_v_e_r_b_o_s_e  option,  _t_f_t_o_p_l operates silently.
       With it, a banner and progress report are printed on  _s_t_d-
       _o_u_t.  See tteexx(1) for the details of specifying options.

       Donald  Knuth  wrote the program. It was published as part
       of the _T_e_X_w_a_r_e technical report, available  from  the  TeX
       Users  Group.   Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis originally
       ported it to Unix.
