       pktogf - convert packed font files to generic font files

       The  _p_k_t_o_g_f  program converts a packed font file (PK) to a
       generic font file (GF). Packed font files are much smaller
       than the corresponding GF files, but some DVI readers only
       understand GF files.

       The _p_k__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e on the command  line  must  be  complete.
       Because  the resolution is part of the extension, it would
       not make sense to add on a default extension  as  is  done
       with   TeX   or  DVI-reading  software.  The  _g_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
       defaults to the same (stripped) name as _p_k__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e , and
       it  is  placed  in  the current working directory with the
       `gf' suffix replacing `pk'. For example,  the  input  file
       _i_o._3_0_0_p_k would become _i_o._3_0_0_g_f.

       Unless  the  -_v switch is given, _p_k_t_o_g_f operates silently.
       With -_v, the version number of the program and  statistics
       about the unpacking are output to _s_t_d_o_u_t.

       _p_k_t_o_g_f uses the environment variable PKFONTS to search for
       the PK file.  If PKFONTS is not set, it uses the  variable
       TEXFONTS.   If  TEXFONTS  is  not  set, it uses the system
       default: ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.  See tteexx(1)  for  the
       details of the searching.

       Tomas Rokicki wrote the program.  It was published as part
       of the _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_w_a_r_e technical report, available  from  the
       TeX  Users Group.  Pierre MacKay originally adapted it for
       compilation under web2c.
