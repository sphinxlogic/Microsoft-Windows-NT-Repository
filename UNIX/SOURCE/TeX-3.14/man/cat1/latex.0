       The      LaTeX      language      is      described     in
       _L_a_T_e_X-_ADocument_P_r_e_p_a_r_a_t_i_o_nSystem, by Leslie Lamport,  pub-
       lished  by  Addison-Wesley.  LaTeX is a TeX macro package,
       not a modification to the TeX source program, so  all  the
       capabilities described in tteexx(1) are present.

       The LaTeX macros encourage writers to think about the con-
       tent of their documents, rather than the form.  The ideal,
       not  always  realized,  is  to have no formatting commands
       (like ``switch to italic'' or ``skip  2  picas'')  in  the
       document  at  all;  instead, everything is done intension-
       ally: ``emphasize'', ``start a section''.
