       The  _d_v_i_t_y_p_e program translates a DVI (DeVice Independent)
       file output by, for example, tteexx(1) or  ggffttooddvvii(1),  to  a
       file  that  humans can read. It also serves as a DVI file-
       validating program (i.e., if _d_v_i_t_y_p_e  can  read  it,  it's
       correct)  and  as  an example of a DVI-reading program for
       future device drivers.

       The output file can include all commands, just the  impor-
       tant  ones,  or none at all (in which case only errors are
       reported).  A subinterval of pages  may  be  selected  for
       transliteration;  the  magnification and resolution of the
       ``output device'' may be changed; and so on.  All  options
       are specified with an on-line dialog.

       The  _d_v_i__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e  on  the command line must be complete.
       The ._d_v_i extension is not supplied if omitted. The  output
       goes to _s_t_d_o_u_t.

       The  environment  variable  TEXFONTS is used to search for
       the TFM files used in the DVI file.  See  tteexx(1)  for  the
       details of the searching.  If TEXFONTS is not set, it uses
       the system default: ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.

       Donald Knuth wrote the program.  It was published as  part
       of  the  _T_e_X_w_a_r_e  technical report, available from the TeX
       Users Group.  Howard Trickey and Pavel  Curtis  originally
       ported it to Unix.
