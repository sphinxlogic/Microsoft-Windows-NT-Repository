       gftopk - convert generic font files to packed font files

       The _g_f_t_o_p_k program converts a generic font file output by,
       for example, mmff(1), to a packed font file for use by  DVI-
       reading  programs.  Packed  font files (PK files) are much
       smaller than the  corresponding  GF  files,  so  they  are
       rapidly becoming the font format of choice.

       The  _g_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e  on  the  command line must be complete.
       Because the resolution is part of the extension, it  would
       not  make  sense  to add on a default extension as is done
       with  TeX  or  DVI-reading  software.   The   _p_k__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
       defaults  to the same (stripped) name as _g_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e, and
       it is placed in the current  working  directory  with  the
       `pk'  suffix  replacing `gf'.  For example, the input file
       _i_o._3_0_0_g_f would become _i_o._3_0_0_p_k.

       Unless the -_v switch is given, _g_f_t_o_p_k  operates  silently.
       With  -_v, the version number of the program and statistics
       about the packing are output to _s_t_d_o_u_t.

       _g_f_t_o_p_k uses the environment variable GFFONTS to search for
       the  GF file.  If GFFONTS is not set, it uses the variable
       TEXFONTS.  If TEXFONTS is not  set,  it  uses  the  system
       default:  ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.   See tteexx(1) for the
       details of the searching.

       Tomas Rokicki wrote the program. It was published as  part
       of  the  _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_w_a_r_e technical report, available from the
       TeX Users Group.  Paul Richards originally  ported  it  to
       Unix.
