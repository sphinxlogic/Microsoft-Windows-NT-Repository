       The _g_f_t_o_d_v_i program converts a generic font (GF) file out-
       put  by, for example, mmff(1), to a device independent (DVI)
       file (that can then be typeset using  same  software  that
       has  already  been written for TeX). The characters in the
       GF file will appear one per page, with labels, titles, and
       annotations  as  specified in Appendix H (Hardcopy Proofs)
       of _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k.

       _G_F_t_o_D_V_I uses other fonts in addition to the main GF  file.
       A  `gray' font is used to typeset the pixels that actually
       make up the character. (We wouldn't want all the pixels to
       be  simply black, since then labels, key points, and other
       information would be lost.) A `title' font is used for the
       information at the top of the page. A `label' font is used
       for the labels on key points of the figure. A `slant' font
       is used to typeset diagonal lines, which otherwise have to
       be simulated using horizontal  and  vertical  rules.   The
       default  gray,  title, and label fonts are _g_r_a_y, _c_m_r_8, and
       _c_m_t_t_1_0, respectively; there is no default slant font.

       To change the default fonts, you can give ssppeecciiaall commands
       in  your Metafont source file, or you can change the fonts
       online.  An  online  dialog  ensues   if   you   end   the
       _g_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e with a `/'. For example,
         gftodvi io.300gf/
         Special font substitution: grayfont black
         OK; any more? grayfontarea /home/art/don/
         OK; any more? slantfont /home/fonts/slantimagen6
         OK; any more? <RET>
       will  use  //hhoommee//aarrtt//ddoonn//bbllaacckk  as  the  `gray'  font  and
       //hhoommee//ffoonnttss//ssllaannttiimmaaggeenn66 as the `slant'  font  (this  name
       indicates  a  font for lines with slope 1/6 at the resolu-
       tion of an Imagen printer).

       The _g_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e on the command  line  must  be  complete.
       (The  program  prompts  you  for it if you don't give it.)
       Because the resolution is part of the extension, it  would
       not  make  sense  to add on a default extension as is done
       with TeX or DVI-reading software.  The  output  file  name
       defaults  to  the same root as the gf file, with the `dvi'
       extension added. For example,  the  input  file  _i_o._2_6_0_2_g_f
       would become _i_o._d_v_i.

       Without  the  -_v_e_r_b_o_s_e  option, _g_f_t_o_d_v_i operates silently.

       fies the distance from the right  edge  of  the  character
       bounding  box at which the overflow equations (if any) are
       typeset.  The value is given in TeX points.   The  default
       is a little over two inches.

       _g_f_t_o_d_v_i  uses  the  environment variable GFFONTS to search
       for the GF file.  If GFFONTS is not set, it uses the vari-
       able TEXFONTS.  If TEXFONTS is not set, it uses the system
       default: ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.

       The TEXFONTS environment variable is used to find the  TFM
       files  that the program needs. If TEXFONTS is not set, the
       system default above is used.  See tteexx(1) for the  details
       of the searching.
