       METAFONT reads the program in the specified files and out-
       puts font rasters (in _g_f format) and font metrics (in  _t_f_m
       format).   The  METAFONT  language  is  described  in  _T_h_e
       _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k by Donald E.  Knuth,  published  by  Addison-
       Wesley.

       Like  TeX , METAFONT is normally used with a large body of
       precompiled macros,  and  font  generation  in  particular
       requires  the  support  of several macro files.  The basic
       program as compiled is called _i_n_i_m_f; it  can  be  used  to
       precompile macros into a ._b_a_s_e file.  The _v_i_r_m_f variant is
       used to reload the ._b_a_s_e files quickly.  Typically,  _v_i_r_m_f
       has  links  to  it by the names of the various base files.
       For example, if you link _f_o_o to _v_i_r_m_f and then execute the
       program _f_o_o, you get the base file _f_o_o._b_a_s_e.  You can load
       a different base by saying, e.g., _v_i_r_m_f&mybase.

       As described in _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k,  the  command  line  (or
       first  input line) should otherwise begin with a file name
       or a \controlsequence.  The normal usage is to say

              mmff  '\mode=<printengine>; [mag=magstep(_n);]' input
              _f_o_n_t

       to  start  processing  _f_o_n_t._m_f.  The single quotes are the
       best way of keeping your shell  from  misinterpreting  the
       semicolons  and  from  removing  the \ character, which is
       needed here to keep METAFONT from thinking that  you  want
       to produce a font called ``mode''. (Or you can just say mmff
       and give  the  other  stuff  on  the  next  line,  without
       quotes.)  Other  control sequences, such as bbaattcchhmmooddee (for
       silent operation) can also appear.  The name ``font'' will
       be  the  ``jobname'',  and  is used in forming output file
       names.  If METAFONT doesn't get a file name in  the  first
       line,  the  jobname  is ``mfput''.  The default extension,
       ._m_f, can be overridden by specifying an extension  explic-
       itly.

       A  log  of  error messages goes into the file _j_o_b_n_a_m_e.._l_o_g.
       The output files are _j_o_b_n_a_m_e.._t_f_m  and  _j_o_b_n_a_m_e..<number>_g_f,
       where <number> depends on the resolution and magnification
       of the font.  The ``mode'' in this example is shown gener-
       ically  as  <printengine>,  a  symbolic term for which the



                             11/18/90                           1

       name of an actual device or the  name  ``localfont''  (see
       below)  must  be substituted. If the mode is not specified
       or is not valid for your site, METAFONT  will  default  to
       ``proof''  mode  which produces large character images for
       use in font design and refinement.  Proof mode can be rec-
       ognized by the suffix ._2_6_0_2_g_f after the jobname.  Examples
       of proof mode output can be found  in  _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_rModern_T_y_p_e-
       _f_a_c_e_s,  (Volume  E  of _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_sand_T_y_p_e_s_e_t_t_i_n_g), by Donald
       Knuth.  The system of _m_a_g_s_t_e_p_s is identical to the  system
       used by TeX , with values generally in the range 0.5, 1.0,
       2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and  5.0.   A  listing  of  gf  numbers  for
       118-dpi, 240-dpi and 300-dpi fonts is shown below.

       Magnification  can  also be specified not as a magstep but
       as an arbitrary value, such as 1.315,  to  create  special
       character sizes.

       Before  font  production can begin, it is necessary to set
       up the appropriate base files.  The minimum set of  compo-
       nents  for font production for a given print-engine is the
       _p_l_a_i_n._m_f macro file and the local  `mode_def'  file.   The
       macros  in  _p_l_a_i_n._m_f  can be studied in an appendix to the
       _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k; they were developed  by  Donald  Knuth,  and
       this  file should never be altered except when it is offi-
       cially upgraded.  Each mode_def specification helps  adapt
       fonts  to  a  particular print-engine.  There is a regular
       discussion of mode_defs in the journal of  the  TeX  Users
       Group,  _T_U_G_b_o_a_t;  the  local  ones in use on this computer
       should     be     somewhere     in      the      directory
       //uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//mmff//mmaaccrrooss.   With  only  _p_l_a_i_n._m_f  and  the
       ``modes'' file loaded it is possible to  create  fonts  of
       simple  characters,  such  as  those used for the METAFONT
       logo, and those used for the LaTeX  line and circle fonts,
       but  the  production  of  Computer  Modern  fonts would be
       facilitated by making a _c_m_m_f._b_a_s_e file (which includes the
       macros in _c_m_b_a_s_e._m_f as well as those in _p_l_a_i_n._m_f).

       Several environment variables can be used to set up direc-
       tory paths to search when METAFONT opens a file for input.
       For example, the _c_s_h command
           setenv
           MFINPUTS .:/usr/me/mylib:/usr/local/lib/mf/macros
       or the _s_h command sequence
           MFINPUTS=.:/usr/me/mylib:/usr/local/lib/mf/macros
           export MFINPUTS
       would  cause  all  invocations   of   METAFONT   and   its



                             11/18/90                           2

       derivatives  to look for \input files first in the current
       directory, then in a hypothetical  user's  ``mylib'',  and
       finally  in  the  system library.  Normally, the user will
       place the command sequence  which  sets  up  the  MFINPUTS
       environment  variable  in  his  or  her ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e
       file.

       The _e response to METAFONT's error-recovery  mode  invokes
       the  system  default  editor  at the erroneous line of the
       source file.  There is an  environment  variable,  MFEDIT,
       that  overrides  the  default editor.  It should contain a
       string with "%s" indicating where the  filename  goes  and
       "%d"  indicating  where  the  decimal  linenumber (if any)
       goes.  For example, an MFEDIT string for the _v_i editor can
       be set with the _c_s_h command
               setenv MFEDIT "/usr/ucb/vi +%d %s"

       The environment variables section below lists the relevant
       environment variables, and their defaults.

       A convenient file in the library  is  _n_u_l_l._m_f,  containing
       nothing.   When  _m_f can't find the file it thinks you want
       to input, it keeps  asking  you  for  another  file  name;
       responding  `null'  gets  you out of the loop if you don't
       want to input anything.

       METAFONT can use most modern displays, so you can see  its
       output  without  printing.  Chapter 23 of _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k
       describes what you can do.  This implementation  of  META-
       FONT uses environment variables to determine which display
       device you want to use.  First it  looks  for  a  variable
       MFTERM,  and  then for TERM.  If it can't find either, you
       get no online output.  Otherwise, the value of  the  vari-
       able  determines  the device to use: hhpp22662277, ssuunn (for Sun-
       View), tteekk, uunniitteerrmm (for an Atari ST Tek 4014  emuluator),
       xxtteerrmm  (for either X10 or X11).  Some of these devices may
       not be supported in all METAFONT executables;  the  choice
       is made at compilation time.

       The  default  values for all environment variables are set
       at the time of compilation in a file _s_i_t_e._h.   See  tteexx(1)
       for  the  details  of  the  searching.  If the environment
       variable TEXMFOUTPUT is set, METAFONT attempts to put  its
       output  files  in it, if they cannot be put in the current
       directory.  Again, see tteexx(1).
