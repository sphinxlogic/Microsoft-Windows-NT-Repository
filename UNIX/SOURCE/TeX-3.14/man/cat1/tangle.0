       The  _t_a_n_g_l_e  program converts a WEB source document into a
       Pascal program that may be compiled in the usual way  with
       the  on-line  Pascal  compiler  (e.g., ppcc(1)).  The output
       file is all in lower case and  packed  into  lines  of  72
       characters  or less, with the only concession to readabil-
       ity being the termination of lines at semicolons when this
       can be done conveniently.

       The  WEB  language allows you to prepare a single document
       containing all the information that is needed both to pro-
       duce  a  compilable  Pascal program and to produce a well-
       formatted document  describing  the  program  in  as  much
       detail  as the writer may desire.  The user of WEB must be
       familiar with both TeX and Pascal.  WEB  also  provides  a
       relatively  simple, although adequate, macro facility that
       permits a Pascal program to be written  in  small  easily-
       understood modules.

       The  command  line  should have either one or two names on
       it.  The first is taken as the WEB file (and ._w_e_b is added
       if  there  is no extension).  If there is another name, it
       is a change file (and ._c_h is added if there is  no  exten-
       sion).   The  change file overrides parts of the WEB file,
       as described in the WEB system documentation.

       The output files are a Pascal file and a string pool file,
       whose names are formed by adding ._p and ._p_o_o_l respectively
       to the root of the WEB file name.

       The _w_e_a_v_e program is used to create a TeX file for viewing
       the WEB program.  It takes appropriate care of typographic
       details like page layout and the use of indentation, ital-
       ics, boldface, etc., and it supplies extensive cross-index
       information that it gathers  automatically.   The  command
       line  arguments  are the same as for _t_a_n_g_l_e except for the
       option: --xx says to omit the index, module name  list,  and
       table  of contents pages.  (A _C_O_N_T_E_N_T_S._t_e_x file will still
       be written when the TeX file is processed, however, unless
       some macros in _w_e_b_m_a_c._t_e_x are redefined.)

       The  output  TeX file name is formed by adding ._t_e_x to the
       root of the WEB file name.

       There are several macros that probably should be redefined
       by the programmer at the beginning of the WEB file.  It is
       a good idea to set \title to  the  name  of  the  program.

       And,  to cause output of only changed modules, one can say
       \let\maybe=\iffalse (usually as the first  change  in  the
       change file).

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
       WEB was designed by Donald E. Knuth, based on  an  earlier
       system  called  DOC  (implemented by Ignacio Zabala).  The
       _t_a_n_g_l_e and _w_e_a_v_e programs are themselves written  in  WEB.
       The  system  was  originally ported to Unix at Stanford by
       Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.
