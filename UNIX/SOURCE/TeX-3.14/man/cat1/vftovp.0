       The _v_f_t_o_v_p program translates a (program-oriented) virtual
       font  file  and  its  accompanying  font  metric file to a
       (human-oriented) property list file.   Thus,  the  virtual
       font  can  be  edited,  and its exact contents can be dis-
       played mnemonically.  It also serves as a VF-file validat-
       ing  program;  if  no  error messages are given, the input
       files are correct.

       The _v_p_l__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e, must be complete. No adding of  default
       extensions  is  done.   The  _v_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e  is searched for
       using the VFFONTS environment variable.  If VFFONTS is not
       set,       the      system      default      is      used:
       ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.  The _t_f_m__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e is searched
       for  using  the TEXFONTS environment variable; the default
       is the same.  See tteexx(1) for the details of the searching.

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
       Donald  Knuth  wrote the program, based in part on an idea
       of David Fuchs, starting  with  the  code  for  ttffttooppll(1).
       Karl Berry originally ported it to Unix.
