       The  _m_f_t  program  creates a TeX file from a Metafont pro-
       gram.  It takes appropriate care  of  typographic  details
       like  page  layout  and  the  use of indentation, italics,
       boldface, etc., as illustrated in the book _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_rModern-
       _T_y_p_e_f_a_c_e_s,  by Donald Knuth.  Special conventions in Meta-
       font comments allow you to control things that  would  not
       otherwise come out right; section 1 of the MFT source pro-
       gram in the _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_w_a_r_e report explains these rules.

       The command line  has  one  required  file  name  and  two
       optional  file  names.   The  required  one  is a Metafont
       source file; there is also an optional change file  (which
       works  just  as the change files to ttaannggllee(1) and wweeaavvee(1)
       do) and an optional style  file  (which  is  prepended  to
       everything).

       A  file name that doesn't contain a dot is always given an
       extension, either ._m_f (Metafont) or ._c_h (change)  or  ._m_f_t
       (style).  If  no  style  file is specified, the style file
       _p_l_a_i_n._m_f_t is automatically used. The  _c_h_a_n_g_e__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e  is
       not searched for using any paths. The ._m_f file is searched
       for using the MFINPUTS environment variable  if  you  have
       set     it,     or     else     the     system    default:
       ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//mmff//iinnppuuttss.  The style  file  is  searched
       for  using the TEXINPUTS environment variable; the default
       there is: ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//iinnppuuttss.  See tteexx(1) for the
       details of the searching.

       The  output TeX file name is formed by using ._t_e_x in place
       of the extension of _m_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e.

       Donald Knuth wrote the program, and he ported it  to  Unix
       with  the help of Pierre MacKay and the Unix port of _w_e_a_v_e
       by Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis.  The program  is  pub-
       lished  in  the  _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_w_a_r_e  technical report, available
       from the TeX Users Group.
