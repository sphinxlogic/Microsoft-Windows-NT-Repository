       The _v_p_t_o_v_f program translates a (human-oriented)  property
       list  file to a pair of (program-oriented) files in the VF
       (virtual font) and TFM (TeX font metric) formats. Thus,  a
       virtual font file can be edited and its exact contents can
       be displayed mnemonically.  New virtual fonts,  which  map
       characters  as  seen  by TeX into an arbitrary sequence of
       low-level typesetting operations, can also be  created  in
       this way.

       All  three  file  names,  _v_p_l__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e, _v_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e, and
       _t_f_m__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e, must be  complete.  No  adding  of  default
       extensions or path searching is done.

       Donald  Knuth  wrote the program, based in part on an idea
       of David Fuchs, starting  with  the  code  for  ppllttoottff(1).
       Karl Berry originally ported it to Unix.
