       The  _g_f_t_y_p_e  program  translates  a GF (generic font) file
       output by, for example, mmff(1), to a file that  humans  can
       read.   It  also  serves  as  a GF file-validating program
       (i.e., if _g_f_t_y_p_e can read it,  it's  correct)  and  as  an
       example  of  a  GF-reading program for other software that
       wants to read GF files.

       The _g_f__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e on the command  line  must  be  complete.
       Because  the resolution is part of the extension, it would
       not make sense to add on a default extension  as  is  done
       with  TeX  or DVI-reading software. If no _o_u_t_p_u_t__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
       is specified, the output goes to _s_t_d_o_u_t.

       The output file includes a symbolic listing of the GF com-
       mands,  if  -_m  is  given  on the command line, and bitmap
       images of the characters, if -_i is specified.

       _g_f_t_y_p_e uses the environment variable GFFONTS to search for
       the  GF file.  If GFFONTS is not set, it uses the variable
       TEXFONTS.  If TEXFONTS is not  set,  it  uses  the  system
       default: ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.

       David  Fuchs and Don Knuth wrote the program.  It was pub-
       lished as  part  of  the  _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_w_a_r_e  technical  report,
       available  from the TeX Users Group.  Paul Richards origi-
       nally ported it to Unix.
