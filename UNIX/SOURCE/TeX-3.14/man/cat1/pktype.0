       The  _p_k_t_y_p_e  program  translates  a  packed font file (PK)
       (output by, for example, ggffttooppkk(1) to a file  that  humans
       can  read.  It also serves as a PK file-validating program
       (i.e., if _p_k_t_y_p_e can read it,  it's  correct)  and  as  an
       example  of  a  PK-reading program for other software that
       wants to read PK files.

       The _p_k__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e on the command  line  must  be  complete.
       Because  the resolution is part of the extension, it would
       not make sense to add on a default extension  as  is  done
       with  TeX  or DVI-reading software. If no _o_u_t_p_u_t__f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e
       is specified, the output goes to the _s_t_d_o_u_t.

       The output file gives a compact  encoding  of  the  packed
       encoding,  using conventions described in the source code.
       Run lengths of black pixels alternate  with  parenthesized
       run  lengths  of  white  pixels,  and brackets are used to
       indicate when a row should be repeated.

       _p_k_t_y_p_e uses the environment variable PKFONTS to search for
       the  PK file.  If PKFONTS is not set, it uses the variable
       TEXFONTS.  If TEXFONTS is not  set,  it  uses  the  system
       default:  ..:://uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//tteexx//ffoonnttss.   See tteexx(1) for the
       details of the searching.

       Tomas Rokicki wrote the program, and Donald  Knuth  origi-
       nally  ported  it to Unix. It was published as part of the
       _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_w_a_r_e techical report, available from the TeX Users
       Group.
