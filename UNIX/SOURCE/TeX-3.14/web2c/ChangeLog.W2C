        * mfware/gftodvi.ch: change default extension to `2602gf',
          following dek's change for art.

        * tex/ctex.ch: we're now at version 3.14.
        (Also new versions of gftodvi.web and mf.web, but they don't
        require any changes to the change files.)

        * common/common.h: include <math.h>.

        * mfware/gftodvi.ch: implement -overflow-label-offset.
        * common/extra.h (optiontable): another new abbreviation to help
          in arg parsing.

Mon Jan 14 09:28:20 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        * mf/Makefile (inimf): don't depend on $(windowlib), and don't
          link with $(libs); it just wastes disk space.
        * common/texmf.c [INI]: undefine all window symbols.

        * man/dvitype.man: fix mismatched parentheses.

        * man/tftopl.man: document the new option and the path searching.

        * common/extra.c (make_c_string): replace spurious call to
          `space_terminate' with `null_terminate'.

        * texware/tftopl.ch: changes to implement -verbose; also write to
          stdout if no output file is specified; also call set_paths
          to do path searching for the TFM file.

        * texware/pltotf.ch (usage): remove; just print it inline.

Sun Jan 13 16:57:01 1991  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

        * {tex,mf}/Makefile ({tex,mf}-extra.o): make a link to $(extrac)
          and compile it, instead of compiling $(extrac), so that parallel
          computation work properly.

        command, instead of the beginning.

        * web/Makefile (tangle.p): use an already-compiled tangle if

        sprintf if ANSI is not defined, since a prototype with `...'
        doesn't match a function without a prototype.

        * Version 5.0e.

	* Version 4.893c.

	* web2c/Makefile: do test ... instead of [ ... ].
        mf/MFwindow/Makefile: use $(SHELL) instead of /bin/sh.

Thu Mar 22 18:20:38 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at aten)

	* texware/dvitypext.c: declare packrealnameoffile to be void, even
	if ANSI is not defined, else Ultrix loses.

Fri Mar  9 08:38:56 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* defaults.h, site.h: move ANSI from the former back to the
        latter, since some systems want it.

	* bibtex/bibtex.ch (int_to_ASCII): use `the_int' instead of `int'
        as the first parameter name; some cc's bomb with `int'.
        (from rusty@garnet.berkeley.edu)

	* texware/dvitypext.c (packrealnameoffile): return type is void.

	* */Makefile (veryclean): remove backup files, core files.
        */Makefile: use $(SHELL) ./<script> instead of ./<script>.
        web/Makefile: define SHELL.
        (mackay@cs.washington.edu supplied these changes.)

Fri Mar  2 17:27:22 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* texware/dvitype.ch: make input be 8 bits, like the rest of the
	programs.

Sun Feb 25 20:36:19 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* {mf,tex}/ini_to_tr[ai]p: save the .h file we're editing.

Thu Feb 22 21:06:49 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* */Makefile: change $(RM) to rm.

	* texware/texware.h: do not cast the result of getc to char, for
	the sake of Ultrix.

Sat Feb 17 07:36:50 1990  Karl Berry  (karl at hayley)

	* README: Make the instructions for bootstrapping tangle correct.

	* Makefile (dist): tangleboot.pas is in web, not web2c.

	* {mfware,texware,web,web2c}/Makefile: remove $(CFLAGS) from the
	load lines.

	* bibtex/bibext.c: move conditional on BSD to after #include
	"site.h" (from bsuggs@hac.arpa.com).

	* web2c/Makefile (web2cy.c): do `-if', since one of the commands
	exits with bad status under Ultrix.

Release 4.893b:
* Include patches from Tim to web2c to turn off the verbose output,
  unless -d is supplied to web2c.
* Change $(AR) in the MFwindow Makefile to `ar'.
* Try to get the base file from the program name in Metafont, as well in
  TeX.  Implication: mf.script and tex.script are no longer supplied,
  since a link to plain.{base,fmt} named {mf,tex}.{base,fmt} suffices. 
  `make install' doesn't create these links, since they only need to be
  done once.
* Move some stuff from site.h that should never be changed to a new
  file, defaults.h. Add a new definition, SIGNAL_HANDLER_RETURN_TYPE, to
  site.h, to get rid of the warnings in {tex,mf}/extra.c.
* Use a sed script, contributed by eggert@twinsun.com, instead of the
  awk script, at the beginning of the pipeline.
* Fix an unsigned comparison problem in pltotf, that made cc produce
  infinite ligature loops when converting trip.pl.
* Change threshold in Metafont, and f in tftopl, so broken C compilers
  (like some versions of pcc) don't get confused.
* Port vftovp and vptovf. Move pktogf and pktype to fontutil.
* Allow more than 500 kern pairs in pltotf.
* Change the first parameter to {mf,extra}/extra.c to *filename from
  filename[].
* Use a better hack for the mutually recursive procedures in pltotf et al.,
  from Tor Lillqvist <tml@hemuli.atk.vtt.fi>.

Release 2.993+1.9 = 4.893a:
Sebastian contributed the updates to ctex.ch, tftopl.ch, and pltotf.ch. 
Karl did the cmf.ch update.

Release 3.0:
Brings everything up to the new 8-bit versions.
Almost every file has changed at least somewhat, so I'm not going to
list all the changes.  Here are some highlights:
* char is now 0.255 instead of 0..127 in *.defines.
* `packed' is no longer ignored as part of an identifier (e.g., `packed_trie').
* new Makefiles to make it easier to do the trip/trap test, and with all
  the support programs integrated.
* ctex.ch has a hack to get around trie_op_hash being an array with a
  negative lower bound.
* pltotf.ch has a hack to get around mutually recursive routines.
