Here are some ideas for ways to improve the current distribution:

* Make web2c handle fields correctly, i.e., to put the field identifier
in the symbol table of the type, instead of the global symbol table. 
This would simplify the GFtoDVI change file a fair amount.

* Make web2c handle variant records.  This would make the TeX, Metafont,
and GFtoDVI change files all simpler.

* Make DVItype not do a dialog, a la GFtype.  Generally unixify all the
programs. 

* Typeset `TeX' correctly in all the man pages.
