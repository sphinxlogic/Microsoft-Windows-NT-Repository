DVIxxx --- TeX DVI to device xxx translator family

\subsection*{DESCRIPTION}

Several \TeX{} DVI translators are available.  They all expect
the name of the DVI file on the command line, and the extension
{\tt .dvi} can always be omitted.  As illustrated below, they
issue a one-line identifier message and, if no command line
arguments are given, type a \UNIX{}-style\footnote{
\UNIX{} is a trademark of AT\&T Bell Laboratories.
\PCDOS{} is a trademark of IBM Corporation.
\TeX{} is a trademark of the American Mathematical Society.
\TOPS{}, \VAX{}, and \VMS{} are trademarks of Digital Equipment
Corporation.
}
{\em usage} message.
Some of them may have additional help files.  On case-sensitive
file systems, file names
may be expected to be entirely in lower case, so you should
type {\tt dvialw} instead of {\tt DVIALW}.

For all except DVIBIT (which is intended for interactive
display), the output file will be given the name of the {\tt
.dvi} file, but extension {\tt .dvi-xxx}, where {\tt xxx} is the
three-character mnemonic for the translator program.  If long
extensions are not supported, then {\tt .xxx} is used.  For DVIBIT,
output is on {\tt stdout} which defaults to the terminal; it may
be redirected in the usual \UNIX{} fashion by {\tt >filename} on the
command line (e.g. {\tt dvibit foo >foo.out}).

As each {\tt .dvi} file is processed, a list of errors is printed
on the standard error unit {\tt stderr}; this list is also saved
in a file with extension {\tt .dvi-err}, or if long extensions
are not supported by the host, then extension {\tt .err} is used.
This file is not created if there are no errors.  As each page is
printed, the physical page number and the \TeX{} page number(s) are
printed without a following carriage return; after the last
page, the string \verb|[OK]| is printed, followed by a newline.
This gives a convenient progress report to the terminal.
If it is not wanted, then the error output can be redirected into
a file (possibly the null device) (e.g. {\tt dvixxx foo
\&foo.err}), or the {\tt -q} (quiet) option can be given to
suppress it.

These drivers  are written  in C,  and with  C preprocessor  conditional
compilation features, are all derived from  one master set of files,  so
that there is  substantial code  sharing among them.   Host machine  and
output device dependencies  are parametrized to  allow easy movement  to
new hosts and new output devices.  Implementations now exist on
Gould \UNIX{},
Hewlett-Packard \UNIX{},
\PCDOS{},
\TOPS{},
\VAX{} \UNIX{}, and
\VAX{} \VMS{},
with others in progress.

\subsection*{OPTIONS}

The order of command options and DVI file names is {\em not\/}
significant; all switch values apply to all DVI files.  DVI files
are processed in order from left to right.

Letter case is {\em ignored\/} in option switches: {\tt -A}
and  {\tt -a} are equivalent.
  \begin{namelist}{{\tt -o\#}}
  \item[{\tt -a}]
                Implement virtual font caching, if possible.
                When a font file is opened, a buffer is allocated
                to contain the entire file, and the file is then
                read with one system call.  This is important
                primarily on networked file systems, where the
                many random-access calls in the font file for
                small amounts of data entail substantial network
                overhead.  With the entire file cached in local
                memory, this overhead is removed.   The
                additional memory required for the font file
                buffers amounts to 100K to 200K bytes (assuming
                the compact {\tt .PK} font file format), which is
                not excessive.  If memory cannot be allocated for
                a font file, then normal buffering of small
                blocks is used.  A trace option ({\tt -d64}) is
                provided to monitor the font caching; see below.

  \item[{\tt -b}]
                Backwards order printing from the default.  For example,
                laser printers using the Canon LBP-CX print
                engine normally
                receive  pages  in  reverse  order  because  they  stack
                printed side  up.  Some  have page  handling  mechanisms
                that stack them face  down, and in such  a case
                {\tt -b}  will
                ensure that they  come out in  order $1, 2, \ldots{}$
                instead  of $n, n-1, n-2, \ldots$

  \item[{\tt -c\#}]
                Print \# copies of each output page.  Page copies
                are printed consecutively; this does {\em not}
                give multiple collated copies of the entire job.

  \item[{\tt -d\#}]
                Produce debugging output on {\tt stderr} if a
                non-zero value is given.  Multiple {\tt -d}
                switches may be specified, and one may also add
                values of the following possible options to
                obtain the switch value:
                \begin{namelist}{888}
                \item[1]
                        (DVIJET only) print page bitmap in hexadecimal;
                \item[2]
                        display page coordinates and metrics of
                        each output character, and print each
                        character bitmap in hexadecimal;
                \item[4]
                        (DVIJEP only) display updated page
                        coordinate of each character after each call
                        to {\tt fixpos()};
                \item[8]
                        print filename and open mode of
                        each {\em successful} file opening;
                \item[16]
                        print filename and open mode of
                        each {\em unsuccessful} file opening;
                \item[32]
                        show discarded off-page text;
                \item[64]
                        trace virtual font caching;
                \item[128]
                	trace character setting ({\em lots} of output).
                \end{namelist}
                For example, either {\tt -d8 -d16} or {\tt -d24}
                will trace all attempted file openings.

  \item[{\tt -eVAR=value}]
                \mbox{}

                Define an environment variable on the command
                line (see the later section {\em Environment
                Variables}).  The acceptable values for {\tt
                VAR} are {\tt DVIHELP},
                {\tt FONTLIST},
                {\tt TEXFONTS}, and
                {\tt TEXINPUTS}.  Under normal use of the
                translators, these can be set by \TOPS{} and
                \VAX{} \VMS{} {\tt
                define VAR: value} commands, or by \UNIX{}
                {\sc csh} {\tt setenv VAR value} or {\sc sh}
                {\tt VAR=value} commands.   When the
                translator is invoked by another program, such as
                a print spooler, on some systems it may not be
                possible to set a
                particular value of an environment variable for
                the subprocess, so this option gets around this
                limitation.  On most \UNIX{} systems, it should
                be possible to use the call {\tt
                system("VAR=value; dvixxx filename")}.

  \item[{\tt -ffontsubfile}]
                \mbox{}

                Define an alternate font substitution file which
                is to be used instead of the default ones (see below).

  \item[{\tt -l}]
                Inhibit logging.

  \item[{\tt -m\#}]
                Reset magnification to \#.  The default for low
                resolution printers is {\tt -m603}, corresponding
                to $1/1.2^5$ magnification of 300-dot/\-inch
                fonts.  By \TeX{}
                conventions, magnification 1000 corresponds to a
                200-dot/inch output device.  The default
                magnification is always adjusted according to the
                output device resolution in order to give a
                normal page size, so this parameter should rarely
                be required.  Legal values are
                $$int((1000\mbox{\rm{} or } 1440 \mbox{\rm{} or }
                1500)\times1.2^{k/2})\quad (k = -16\ldots16);$$
                other values will be set to the nearest in this
                family.  Not all fonts will be available in this
                wide range, and most installations will probably
                have only a half dozen or so magnifications.

                Magnification values less than 25 are taken to be a
                \TeX{} magstep parameter which is applied to the
                standard magnification for that device.  For
                example, {\tt -m-0.5} selects a smaller size, and
                {\tt -m2} selects a size 1.44 times larger than
                normal.

  \item[{\tt -o\#} or {\tt -o\#:\#} or {\tt -o\#:\#:\#}]
                \mbox{}

                Specify a page number, or range of page numbers,
                to be selected for output.  In the third form,
                the last number is the page number step size; it
                is normally 1.    This option may be
                specified any number of times.  If it is not
                specified, then all pages will be printed.  Pages
                are numbered in order $1, 2, 3, \ldots{}$ in the
                file, but any page number recorded by \TeX{} on
                the printed page will in general be different.
                Negative page numbers count backward; -1 is the
                last page in the document, -2 the second last
                page, and so on.

                As pages are selected for
                printing, \verb|[#{#}| will be printed on {\tt
                stderr}, where the first \verb|#| is the page
                number in the file, and the second \verb|#| is
                a string of values of the \TeX{} counters
                \verb|\count0| through  \verb|\count9|, separated
                by dots, with trailing zero counters dropped.
                \verb|\count0| usually records the printed page number.
                When the page is completely output, a closing
                {\tt ]} will be printed on {\tt stderr}.  Any
                error messages from processing of that page will
                therefore occur between the square brackets.  For
                example, {\tt -o1:3 -o12 -o17:23 -o-3:-1} would
                select pages 1, 2, 3, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
                and 23, plus the last three pages.

                Pages are
                processed in the order found in the DVI file;
                there is intentionally no attempt made to sort
                them according the \verb|\count0| values, since
                different macro packages may use this counter for
                different purposes, and in the case of floating
                tables and figures, the pages may not be in order
                anyway.

                Pages will always be printed in an order
                appropriate for the device so that the first
                document page occurs first face up in the
                document stack; the {\tt -b} option can be used
                to reverse this order.  For example, some
                Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Plus printers are
                equipped with a page flipper which stacks output
                face down; for these, the {\tt -b} option will
                ensure that the pages come out in the expected
                order.

                Specification of a page number step size is
                useful for producing duplex (two-sided) printing.
                For example, with laser printers using the Canon
                LBP-CX engine, the first run could specify {\tt
                -o1:9999:2}, which would stack output face up,
                beginning with the last page, and ending with
                page 1 on top.  The printed pages can then be
                reinserted in the input tray {\em face up}, page
                1 on the top, exactly as they were found in the
                output tray, with the top of the page in the tray
                closest to the end which is inserted first into the
                printer.  A second run with {\tt -b -o2:9999:2}
                would then print pages 2, 4, \ldots, on the backs
                of pages 1, 3, \ldots; note the {\tt -b} option
                to get backwards order on the second run.

                There is a bug in Microsoft C's {\sf sscanf()} on
                the  IBM PC; it does not correctly parse input on
                the format {\tt "\%d:\%d:\%d"} in {\tt option()}
                for the page number switch.  It correctly returns
                the numbers, but instead of returning the number
                of such items parsed, it returns -1, which should
                only happen if none are parsed.  A work around
                seems to be to supply a trailing colon on the
                switch, so that you write {\tt -o17:} instead of
                {\tt -o17}.


  \item[{\tt -p}]
                Inhibit font preloading.  This may produce output a  few
                seconds earlier when  all pages are  output, but  should
                have  negligible  effect  on  the  execution  time,  and
                consequently, should  normally not  be specified.   When
                individual pages are being printed with the {\tt
                -o\#}  option,
                preloading is necessary (and  will be forced) to  ensure
                that all fonts are defined before they are referenced.

  \item[{\tt -q}]
                Quiet mode.  Status displays to {\tt stderr} are
                suppressed, unless warning or error messages are
                issued.  For interactive devices (DVIBIT), warning
                messages are suppressed.

  \item[{\tt -r\#}]
                (Device = HP LaserJet only).  Specify the Laser
                Jet output resolution in dots per inch.  {\tt \#}
                must be one of 75, 100, 150, or 300.  The actual
                plot file is identical in each case; only the
                size on the output page is changed, because the
                resolution change is effected by printing 1
                $\times$ 1, 2 $\times$ 2, 3 $\times$ 3, or 4
                $\times$ 4 pixel blocks.

  \item[{\tt -r}]
                (Device = Golden Laser 100 only).  Select
                run-length encoding of the output file.  This
                reduces disk space typically by 10\% to 40\%, but
                increases host CPU time for the preparation of
                the output file.

  \item[{\tt -r}]
                (Device  = Apple ImageWriter only).   Select  run-length
                encoding of the output file.

  \item[{\tt -r}]
                (Device = Toshiba P-1351 only).  Select
                run-length encoding of the output file.  This
                reduces disk space typically by 10\% to 40\%, but
                increases host CPU time for the preparation of
                the output file, and because of poor logic in the
                printer, may double the print time!  The print
                quality is also substantially worse, so this
                option is generally {\em not} recommended.

  \item[{\tt -s\#}]
                (Device = Apple LaserWriter only).  Force
                characters larger than \# pixels wide or high to
                be reloaded each time they are required.  The
                Version 23.0 \POSTSCRIPT{} interpreter has a bug
                which manifests itself in fatal {\tt VM error}
                messages when large characters are sent.  A
                reasonable default value has been set for this
                which should normally avoid the problem.
                Specifying {\tt -s0} will cause reloading of
                every character each time it is used.

  \item[{\tt -v}]
                (Device = Apple LaserWriter  only).  Force reloading  of
                all required fonts at start of each page.

  \item[{\tt -x\#}{\it units}]
                \mbox{}

                The {\tt -x} options specify the left margin of
                the \TeX{} page on the output page in any of
                several units.  Letter case is not significant
                in the units field, which must {\em not} be
                separated from the number by any space.  {\tt \#}
                may be fractional.  For example, {\tt -x1.0in},
                {\tt -x2.54cm}, {\tt -x72.27pt}, and {\tt
                -x6.0225pc} all specify a one-inch left margin.
                Negative values are permissible, and may be used
                to shift the output page left (possibly
                truncating it on the left) in order to display a
                wide \TeX{} page.

                The units field is mandatory, and may be one of
                \begin{namelist}{mm}
                \item[{\tt bp}]
                    big point ($1in = 72bp$)
                \item[{\tt cc}]
                    cicero ($1cc = 12dd$)
                \item[{\tt cm}]
                    centimeter ($1in = 2.54cm$)
                \item[{\tt dd}]
                    didot point ($1157dd = 1238pt$)
                \item[{\tt in}]
                    inch
                \item[{\tt mm}]
                    millimeter ($10mm = 1cm$)
                \item[{\tt pc}]
                    pica ($1pc = 12pt$)
                \item[{\tt pt}]
                    point ($72.27pt = 1in$)
                \item[{\tt sp}]
                    scaled point ($65536sp = 1pt$)
                \end{namelist}


  \item[{\tt -y\#}{\it units}]
                \mbox{}

                The {\tt -y} options specify the top margin of
                the \TeX{} page
                on the output page in any of the indicated units.
                Letter case is not significant in the unit field,
                which must {\em not} be separated from the number by
                any space.  {\tt \#} may be fractional.  For example,
                {\tt -y1.0in}, {\tt -y2.54cm}, {\tt -y72.27pt},
                and {\tt -y6.0225pc} all specify a one-inch top
                margin.  Negative values are permissible, and may
                be used to shift the output page up (possibly
                truncating it on the top) in order to display a
                long \TeX{} page.

                By decree of the Stanford \TeX{} Project, the
                default \TeX{} page origin is always 1 inch over and
                down from the top-left page corner, even when
                non-American paper sizes are used.  This
                corresponds to the switch settings {\tt -x1in
                -y1in}; these values are assumed unless  overridden.

  \item[{\tt -z}]
                (TOPS-20 or 4.xBSD Unix only).
                For each DVI file processed, type in
                an EXEC command {\tt DVISPOOL: dvifilename} (on
                Unix, {\tt DVISPOOL dvifilename}) followed by a
                newline; the user may then define {\tt DVISPOOL:} (or
                {\tt DVISPOOL}) to be a program or shell script
                which sends the translation of the DVI file to
                the appropriate output spooler.
  \end{namelist}

\subsection*{SAMPLE EXECUTION}

Here is a sample execution of \LaTeX{} and DVIALW extracted from
a \TOPS{} PHOTO log:
\begin{small}%
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}%
\end{small}
When the \TOPS{} version of \TeX{} finishes execution, it
normally simulates terminal input of a line of the form
\begin{verbatim}
TeXspool: dvifile
\end{verbatim}
without supplying a final carriage return.
The default value of the logical name {\tt TeXspool:} points to a
dummy program which does nothing, so if you just type a carriage
return yourself, the line is effectively ignored.  This is
reasonable in that it usually takes several trips through \TeX{}
before you have a {\tt .dvi} file worth printing.  If you like,
you can redefine {\tt TeXspool:} to point to your favorite DVI
translator, for example,
\begin{verbatim}
define TeXspool: sys:dvialw.exe
\end{verbatim}
Then when you type a carriage return when \TeX{} finishes, it
will run the translator immediately, saving you a line of typing.
If you do not want the translator to run, just cancel the line by
typing {\tt CTL-U} or {\tt CTL-C}.

A sample invocation of DVITYPE is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
@dvitype

...and so on...
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{FONT SUBSTITUTION}

If no {\tt -ffontsubfile} option is given, and font substitution
is required, if the current DVI file is {\tt foo.dvi}, then the
files {\tt foo.sub}, {\tt texfonts.sub}, and {\tt
texinputs:texfonts.sub} will be tried in order.  The first two
will be found on the current directory, and the last is the
system default.  This gives the option of document-specific,
user-specific, and system-specific substitutions, and the {\tt
-f} option allows all of these to be overridden.

Font substitution lines have the form:
\begin{verbatim}
% comment
oldname.oldmag  ->      subname.submag  % comment
oldname oldmag  ->      subname submag  % comment
oldname         ->      subname         % comment
\end{verbatim}
Examples are:
\begin{verbatim}
% These provide replacements for some LaTeX invisible fonts:
iamr10 1500     ->      amr10 1500      % comment
iamr10.1500     ->      amr10.1500      % comment
iamssb8         ->      amssb8          % comment
\end{verbatim}
The first  two  forms request  substitution  of a  particular  font  and
magnification.  The third  form substitutes an  entire font family;  the
closest available magnification to the  required one will be used.   Any
dots in  the  non-comment  portion  will be  converted  to  spaces,  and
therefore, cannot be part of a name field.

The first matching substitution will be selected, so
magnification-specific substitutions should be given first,
before family substitutions.

Comments are introduced by percent and continue to end-of-line,
just as for \TeX{}.  One whitespace character is equivalent to
any amount of whitespace.  Whitespace and comments are optional.

\subsection*{SCREEN CONTROL}

At present, DVIBIT is the only family member which supports
interactive viewing of the \TeX{} output.  The following
description therefore applies only to it, but the functionality
should be adhered to in any new interactive device drivers.

All switches, including the page selection ({\tt -o}) and page
origin ({\tt -x} and {\tt -y}) switches, work normally.  In order
to avoid unnecessary waste of screen space, you probably will
want to specify {\tt -x0in} and {\tt -y0in} to remove the default
one-inch left and top margins.  The {\tt -q} option is probably also
advisable to avoid warning messages, such as from font substitutions.

At beginning of page, a command and status menu is displayed at
the top of the screen.  When the end-of-page command is reached
in the DVI file, or as soon as keyboard input is available, the
driver will enter the end-of-page routine.  Any keyboard input
command is then read and acted upon; unrecognized input is
discarded with a warning beep.  The advantage of checking for
keyboard input during the main DVI reading loop is that unwanted
display can be avoided.  This is valuable if you are
repositioning the page, or skimming a document.  The EMACS text
editor uses much the same display algorithm---do nothing more to
the screen if a user command will probably invalidate it anyway.

The input can select
 \begin{itemize}
   \item
        redisplay of the current page, possibly shifting it up,
        down, left, or right, to see more of it, or to restore a
        display trashed by an unexpected system message or
        transmission line error;
   \item
        continuation to the next page in the page list selected
        by default or by the {\tt -o} option;
   \item
        backing up to the previous page (useful if you overshoot);
   \item
        display of an arbitrary page by typing its sequence number;
   \item
        termination of execution.
 \end{itemize}

Although the menu  on the top line displays only a subset of
the possible commands, a number of synonyms are provided for user
convenience.  In particular, arrow keys in VT52 and VT100 modes
are recognized, as are EMACS control-character commands to move
the cursor or page display.  Commands are provided for  both
coarse and fine adjustment of page position.

Here is the current command list.  Input is immediate; no
terminating carriage return is necessary.  Consequently, typing
error correction is supported only for the digit string command;
it ends at the first non-digit typed.

 \begin{namelist}{\bf D}
   \item[{\bf D}]
       Move the display down  by 1/8 of screen size.
   \item[{\bf U}]
       Move the display up   by 1/8 of screen size.
   \item[{\bf L}]
       Move the display left   by 1/8 of screen size.
   \item[{\bf R}]
       Move the display right   by 1/8 of screen size.
   \item[{\bf d} or {\bf Ctl-N} or {\bf down-arrow}]
       \mbox{}

       Move the display down   by 1/64 of screen size.
   \item[{\bf u} or {\bf Ctl-P} or {\bf up-arrow}]
       \mbox{}

       Move the display up   by 1/64 of screen size.

   \item[{\bf l} or {\bf Ctl-B} or {\bf left-arrow}]
       \mbox{}

       Move the display left   by 1/64 of screen size.
   \item[{\bf r} or {\bf Ctl-F} or {\bf right-arrow}]
       \mbox{}

       Move the display right   by 1/64 of screen size.
   \item[{\bf .} or {\bf Ctl-L}]
       \mbox{}

       Redisplay current page.
   \item[{\bf @}]
       Redisplay current page with {\em startup} page
       positioning.
   \item[{\bf CARET} or {\bf BACKSPACE}]
       \mbox{}

       Redisplay previous page.
   \item[{\bf $nnn$}]
       \mbox{}

       $nnn$ is a digit string; DELETE/RUBOUT and BACKSPACE keys
       correct typing errors in it.
       Move to $nnn^{th}$ page, where  document pages are numbered 1,
       2, \ldots.  The \TeX{} page numbers are displayed in the
       status window. This is a recursive display; if you respond
       at end-of-page with a {\em next-page} command, display
       will revert to the page sequence you were viewing when you
       first issued the $nnn$ command.
   \item[{\bf SPACE} or {\bf RETURN} or {\bf Ctl-V}]
       \mbox{}

       Display next page.
   \item[{\bf Q} or {\bf q} or {\bf X} or {\bf x}]
       \mbox{}

       Quit or exit.  The screen will be cleared and the terminal
       restored to its normal font and emulation mode.
    \item[{\bf Z}]
       Zoom up one magstep (1.2 times larger) from current size.
    \item[{\bf z}]
       Zoom down one magstep (1.2 times smaller) from current
       size.

       It is likely that some font magnifications will be
       unavailable for zooming, so do not be alarmed if some
       characters are displayed as blanks when you do this.  You
       can use the font substitution mechanism ({\tt -f} option
       above) to work around this, or you can ask your font
       administrator to generate the required magnifications.
       When font substitution happens because of an unavailable
       magnification, characters of an incorrect size are used
       with the spacing required for the font which \TeX{} used,
       so output is likely to look peculiar.

       To avoid exhausting the terminal's font memory, larger
       characters as sent as raster bitmaps each time they are
       used, rather than as downloaded fonts, making the screen
       display much slower.  The size limit is large enough that
       this should not be necessary except at large
       magnifications.
 \end{namelist}

\subsection*{SPECIALS}

The \TeX{} \verb|\special{}| command is intended to allow the
specification in a {\tt .tex} file of a request to the DVI
driver, usually for the insertion of graphical material at that
point in the document.  It is currently implemented only for
DVIALW; other drivers will simply issue a warning message.

The \TeX{} \verb|\special{}| command is expected to look like one
of the following:
\begin{verbatim}
    \special{overlay filename}          % absolute positioning
    \special{include filename}          % relative positioning
    \special{insert filename}           % relative positioning
\end{verbatim}
In the first case, the \POSTSCRIPT{} file to be included will be
mapped onto the page at precisely the coordinates it specifies.
In the other two cases, the upper-left corner of the bounding box
will be placed at the current point.  The \POSTSCRIPT{} file must
then contain (usually near the start) a comment of the form
\begin{verbatim}
%%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury
\end{verbatim}
specifying the bounding  box lower-left and  upper-right coordinates  in
standard \POSTSCRIPT{} units (1/72 inch).  Alternatively, if the comment
\begin{verbatim}
%%BoundingBox: (atend)
\end{verbatim}
is found in  the file,  the last  1000 characters  of the  file will  be
searched to find a comment of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
%%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury
\end{verbatim}
If the \POSTSCRIPT{} file cannot be opened, or the
\verb|\special{}| command string cannot be recognized, or for
relative positioning, the bounding box cannot be determined, a
warning message is issued and the \verb|\special| command is
ignored.

Otherwise, the section of the \POSTSCRIPT{} file between the
comment lines
\begin{verbatim}
%begin(plot)
%end(plot)
\end{verbatim}
is copied to the output file surrounded by
\begin{verbatim}
save
300 72 div 300 72 div scale % revert to standard 1/72 inch units
% if relative positioning, then
% (xcp(in 1/72in)-llx) (ycp(in 1/72in)-ury) translate
...PostScript file contents...
restore
\end{verbatim}
Plot files produced by \PLOT{} have all the expected commands in
them to allow their use in \TeX{} \verb|\special{}| commands.
The two \PLOT{} parameters which influence the size of the plot
are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
the device  size specified in  the call to  SETSZ(); it defaults  to
$11in$ if SETSZ is not called.
  \item
the device space specified in  the call to SETDS2() or SETDS3();  it
defaults in the  CORE system  to the unit  square, but  if the  \PLOT{}
framing routines  are called,  they will  reset the  device space  to  a
horizontal or vertical frame in proportions of the local standard paper
size ($1 : 8.5/11$ in the USA).
  \end{itemize}
For example, if a device size of $5in$ is specified for a
standard horizontal frame, the bounding box will be declared to
be $5in$ wide and $(8.5/11)\times5in = 3.8636in$ high, so a
\TeX{} manuscript requiring the plot could have the following
commands at the start of a new paragraph:
\begin{verbatim}
\special{include plotfilename}
\vspace*{3.9in}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES}

The behavior of the DVI translators can be influenced by
definition of logical names on \TOPS{} and \VAX{} \VMS{}, or
environment variables in \UNIX{} and \PCDOS{}.  Compiled-in
internal defaults will be provided for any of these which are not
defined.   They {\em must} be entirely in upper-case, since that
is conventional on \UNIX{} systems.  The names currently recognized
are as follows:

  \begin{namelist}{TEXINPUTS}
  \item[DVIHELP]
                This variable defines an alternate help string which  is
                typed when the  user makes  an input  error.  It  should
                direct  the  user  to  additional  documentation.    For
                example, on \TOPS{}, it might be {\tt try HELP
                DVI or XINFO DVI}.

  \item[FONTLIST]
                Normally, the drivers are prepared to search
                first for {\tt .pk}, then {\tt .gf}, then {\tt
                .pxl} font files.  This variable can be used to
                change this search order, or remove one or more
                of the possibilities.  It is expected to contain
                at least one of the strings {\tt PK}, {\tt GF},
                or {\tt PXL}, possibly separated by arbitrary
                punctuation and other text.  This flexibility is
                necessary because some operating systems expect
                environment variables to conform to some syntax,
                such as that of a file name.  Letter case is {\em
                not} significant.    Some acceptable
                strings are {\tt PXL-then-PK-then-GF}, {\tt
                pk.gf}, {\tt use-only-PXL-fonts}, and {\tt PXL/GF/PK}.

  \item[TERM]
                This variable is used only for DVIBIT; if it does
                not evaluate to either {\tt bitgraph} or {\tt
                bg}, DVIBIT will refuse to run.  On \UNIX{}, this
                is the conventional way of defining terminal
                types with the TERMCAP or TERMINFO systems.  This
                variable is ignored on \VAX{} \VMS{}, since the
                \VMS{} C library sets it to a value which can
                never be {\tt bitgraph} or {\tt bg}.

  \item[TEXFONTS]
    \begin{sloppy}
                This defines the directory path for finding font
                files.  Its value is {\em prepended} to the name
                of a \TeX{} font to get a full file
                specification.  A typical value in \UNIX{} for {\tt
                TEXFONTS} would be {\tt
                /usr/\-local/\-lib/\-tex/\-fonts/}.  On \TOPS{},
                font {\em cmr10} on a 300-dot/inch device might
                correspond to the files {\tt
                texfonts:\-cmr10.\-300gf}, {\tt
                texfonts:\-cmr10.\-300pk}, or {\tt
                texfonts:\-cmr10.\-1500pxl}.
    \end{sloppy}
  \item[TEXINPUTS]
                This defines the directory path for finding files
                which are not in the current working directory.
                It is {\em prepended} to file names.  A typical
                value in \UNIX{} would be {\tt
                /usr\-/local\-/lib\-/tex\-/macros/}.

  \end{namelist}

\subsection*{IBM PC Caveats}

The latest version of the drivers has been compiled with
Microsoft C Version 4.0.  With Version 3.0, some {\tt .dvi} files
experienced a fatal ``{\em floating-point stack overflow\/}''
error both with and without a floating-point coprocessor; this
can only be due to code generation errors, and it disappeared
with Version 4.0.

\PCDOS{} by default has only a small number of available open
files, and this number is not adequate for the drivers with the
value of five  for  {\tt MAXOPEN}  set in {\tt machdefs.h}.  You need
to increase the limits by entering the lines
\begin{verbatim}
FILES=10
BUFFERS=10
\end{verbatim}
in the {\tt config.sys} file in the boot directory, then reboot
the system to have the new values take effect.  Larger values are of
course possible, though {\tt FILES=20} is the limit with current
versions of \PCDOS{}.   Run-time performance can be quite sensitive
to these settings, so you may wish to experiment.

  If there is no {\tt config.sys} file, or the settings of {\tt
FILES} and {\tt BUFFERS} are too small, you will find the disk
whirring madly while the driver attempts to open font files with
neighboring magnifications, and then it will finally die with a
message ``{\em unable to open .err file\/}''.  Use of the {\tt
-d24} option may be useful in tracking how many files can
successfully be opened.

The drivers have been loaded with the default Microsoft
floating-point library; the compiler generates calls to library
routines which test a flag initialized at startup time which
indicates the presence or absence of the floating-point
coprocessor chip.  If it is available, the library routines will
automatically use it.  You can force the chip to be ignored by
defining an arbitrary non-empty string value for the environment
variable
{\tt NO87}, for example
\begin{verbatim}
set NO87=no-8087-available
\end{verbatim}
When the DVI translator runs, the value of this variable should
be typed on the screen as the first output line.  On a Leading
Edge PC, this typeout does not appear, for unknown reasons.
On a 4.77MHz PC XT, the translators run twice (!) as slowly when
{\tt NO87} is defined.

The reason that you might need to know this is that the method
employed by the library routines for detecting the presence or
absence of an 8087 (or 80287) chip is not infallible, thanks to
design flaws of some PC's and possibly also the Intel chips.  It
is conceivable that the library might think a coprocessor chip is
present, when in fact it is not, and the first floating-point
instruction executed would hang the machine.

\subsection*{FILES}

The values of {\tt texinputs:} and {\tt texfonts:} below are
system-dependent. On Unix systems, typical values are {\tt

\subsection*{AUTHORS}

David Fuchs at Stanford University wrote DVITYPE in {\sc web} and
defined the DVI file format.

Mark Senn at Purdue University wrote a preliminary version of the
BBN BitGraph driver in C, using DVITYPE as a model.

  Stephan v. Bechtolsheim and Bob Brown at Purdue, Robert Wells
at BBN, and Jim Schaad and Richard Furuta at the University of
Washington, improved it.

Contributions for \POSTSCRIPT{} devices came from Neal Holtz at
Carleton University.  Simon Barnes of Schlumberger Cambridge
Research Ltd., and Robin Rohlicek at BBN provided useful
additions to the BBN BitGraph driver which have been generalized
and incorporated in Version 2.07.

  The transformation to about a dozen other device drivers,
the massive code rearrangement for many new features as well as
easy identification of host- and device-dependent sections, plus
support for {\tt .pk} and {\tt .gf} compact font files,
was carried out at the University of Utah by Nelson H.F.  Beebe.
He also wrote the documents {\em A \TeX{} DVI Driver Family} and
{\em Using \LaTeX{} at the University of Utah College of Science
DEC-20}.   The first describes all of these drivers in detail,
and the second is the {\em Local \LaTeX{} Guide}.

Lon Willett at Utah adapted DVIJEP to make DVIIMP for the Imagen
laser printer family.

John Sauter adapted one of the low-resolution printer drivers to
produce DVIL75 for the DEC LA75 printer, and DVIL3P for the DEC
LN03 Plus laser printer

  Norman Naugle and colleagues at Texas A\&M implemented the
family on several new systems.
