Sample xdm configuration files for X386 1.2E/SVR4
-------------------------------------------------


File		Install Path		Comments
------------------------------------------------
Xdm		/etc/init.d	  	See the comments at the top for
   					info on links you need to set up.  
					Heed the note about using the "vtXX" 
					option when starting the server in 
					xdm's Xservers file (which is done 
					in the sample).

XFilePaths	/usr/X386/lib/X11	Sets up $XFILESEARCHPATH and
					$XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for Xt.  This
					is sourced by Xsession for xdm and
					by .profile for startx.

Xresources	/usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm	Basically the same as the distributed
					one.  The greeting is a little more
					friendly :->

Xservers	/usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm	Specifies the local server.  Note
					the 'vt06' option.  Specify whichever
					Virtual Terminal you want X386 to use.

Xsession	/usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm	Does a much better job of setting up
					the environment than the distributed
					one.  See the comments in the file.
				
Xsetup_0	/usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm	Use this to start up an xconsole, and
					anything else you want on the screen
					with the login prompt (e.g. a clock).

Xstartup_0	/usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm	Use this to put an entry in the utmp
					file corresponding to the xdm session.
					
Xreset_0	/usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm	Use this to remove the utmp entry
					added by Xstartup_0

xdm-config	/usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm	Sets up paths better suited to having
					a vendor X package installed in
					addition to X386.  Also gets the
					server permissions right so xconsole
					can start up.

profile		${HOME}/.profile	A sample profile that coordinates well
					with Xsession and .xsession/.xinitrc
					See the comments in the file.

xsession	${HOME}/.session	Also link it to ${HOME}/.xinitrc
					See the comments in the file.  It's
					set up to let you use one startup file
					for both startx and xdm.
