               An X Window based version of rwho.

xrwho displays the users logged into hosts on the local network.  It
creates a window in which the names of local machines and the users
that are on these machines are displayed.  Each host machine has its
own box in which the users logged onto this machine are shown.

xrwho uses the X Toolkit and Athena widgets.  It requires X11R4 or later.
Check out the man page for info on all the groovy features in xrwho.

You can use the Imakefile to build xrwho by:

      xmkmf
      make depend
      make

or a simple

      gcc -o xrwho xrwho.c -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lX11

should suffice.  "cc" is okay on most machines too.

A sample "Xrwho.apps" file is included which can be customised to your
colour, font, size and shape preferences and then added to your
X resources (~/.Xdefaults) file.  xrwho will work fine without having
to do this though.

xrwho can be compiled with "-DDebug" if you really want lots of junk
all over your screen.  However, if xrwho crashes and burns on your
machine then please set the Debug flag, recompile, attempt to
reproduce the error, and then mail us the results.

Comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome as long as we're
not too close to some damn conference submission date or something...

Enjoy!
