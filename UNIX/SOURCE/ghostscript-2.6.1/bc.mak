# makefile for Ghostscript, MS-DOS/Borland C++ platform.

# ------------------------------- Options ------------------------------- #

###### This section is the only part of the file you should need to edit.

# ------ Generic options ------ #

# Define the default directory/ies for the runtime
# initialization and font files.  Separate multiple directories with \;.
# Use / to indicate directories, not a single \.

GS_LIB_DEFAULT=c:/gs\;c:/gs/fonts

# Define the name of the Ghostscript initialization file.
# (There is no reason to change this.)

GS_INIT=gs_init.ps

# Choose generic configuration options.

# Setting DEBUG=1 includes debugging features (-Z switch) in the code.
# Code runs substantially slower even if no debugging switches are set,
# and also takes about another 25K of memory.

DEBUG=0

# Setting TDEBUG=1 includes symbol table information for the Borland debugger,
# and also enables stack checking.  Code is substantially slower and larger.

TDEBUG=0

# Setting NOPRIVATE=1 makes private (static) procedures and variables public,
# so they are visible to the debugger and profiler.
# No execution time or space penalty, just larger .OBJ and .EXE files.

NOPRIVATE=0

# Define the name of the executable file.

GS=gs

# ------ Platform-specific options ------ #

# If you don't have an assembler, set USE_ASM=0.  Otherwise, set USE_ASM=1,
# and set ASM to the name of the assembler you are using.  This can be
# a full path name if you want.  Normally it will be masm or tasm.

USE_ASM=1
ASM=tasm

# Define the drive, directory, and compiler name for the Turbo C files.
# COMP is the compiler name (tcc for Turbo C++, bcc for Borland C++).
# COMPDIR contains the compiler and linker (normally \bc\bin).
# BGIDIR contains the BGI files (normally /bc/bgi).
#   BGIDIRSTR must be the same as BGIDIR with / substituted for \.
#   (These are only needed if you include the BGI driver.)
# INCDIR contains the include files (normally \bc\include).
# LIBDIR contains the library files (normally \bc\lib).
# Note that these prefixes are always followed by a \,
#   so if you want to use the current directory, use an explicit '.'.

COMP=bcc
COMPDIR=c:\bc\bin
BGIDIR=c:\bc\bgi
# BGIDIRSTR must be the same as BGIDIR with / substituted for \.
BGIDIRSTR=c:/bc/bgi
INCDIR=c:\bc\include
LIBDIR=c:\bc\lib

# Define whether you want to use the Borland code overlay mechanism
# (VROOMM).  Code overlays make it possible to process larger files,
# but code swapping will slow Ghostscript down even on smaller ones.
# See the file overlay.h to control details of overlaying such as
# the overlay buffer size, whether to use EMS and/or extended memory
# to store evicted overlays, and how much of that memory to use.

OVERLAY=1

# Choose platform-specific options.

# Define the processor (CPU) type.  Options are 86, 186, 286, 386, or 486.
# (The 8086 and 8088 both correspond to processor type 86.)
# 286 and up do not use protected mode.  Higher numbers produce
# code that may be significantly smaller and faster, but the executable
# will bail out with an error message on lower-numbered processor types.

CPU_TYPE=286

# Define the math coprocessor (FPU) type.
# Options are -1 (optimize for no FPU), 0 (optimize for FPU present,
# but do not require a FPU), 87, 287, or 387.
# If the CPU type is 486, the FPU type is irrelevant, since the 80486
# CPU includes the equivalent of an 80387 on-chip.
# An xx87 option means that the executable will run only if a FPU
# of that type (or higher) is available: this is NOT currently checked
# at runtime.

FPU_TYPE=0

# ---------------------------- End of options ---------------------------- #

# Swapping `make' out of memory makes linking much faster.

.swap

# Define the platform name.

PLATFORM=bc_

# Define the name of the makefile -- used in dependencies.

MAKEFILE=bc.mak

# Define the ANSI-to-K&R dependency.  Turbo C accepts ANSI syntax,
# but we need to preconstruct ccf.tr to get around the limit on
# the maximum length of a command line.

AK=ccf.tr

# Define the compilation flags for an 80286.
# This is void because we handle -2 and -3 in ccf.tr (see below).
