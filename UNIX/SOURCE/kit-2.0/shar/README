This directory contains a set of shell scripts which are to be used
by kit when cshar is not available. Those scripts are not intended
to be executed directly by the user, hence no manual page is provided
and the scripts are installed in the private library directory.

There should be no difference from the user's point of view when kit
uses those scripts instead of the cshar package. The aim was to make
kit a self-contained package. When possible however, cshar should be
installed. Kit will automatically use cshar whenever it can.

In the design of the shell archive produced by rshar, I freely borrowed
the style used by Rich Salz in his cshar package. In the makeshar script,
the algorithm used to assign each file a part number comes directly from
the makedist perl script found in Larry Wall's dist 2.0.

The scripts are so small they are installed in the public kit library
even if cshar is installed. It might be useful if the kit scripts are
shared accross different machines and some do miss cshar.
