Here is an excerpt from the original public-domain DES package, written
by Phil Karn and cleaned up by Bdale Garbee. I removed all the unneeded
stuff for kit, and I added some defines in the code, so that it can
be meta-configured. I also rewrote the Makefile.

I left the two man pages des.1 and des.3, but the main Makefile won't
install them, because they may conflict with already existing manual
pages. However, des itself is installed, because kit needs it for
its encryption facilities.

Phil asked me to clean this up slightly and package it for distribution.
I've got it running on my Symmetric 4.2bsd system, Phil reports it runs fine
on a variety of systems at Bellcore.  Note that getopt is required but not
provided, as there is already a getopt package in the mod.sources archives.

This package contains a DES subroutine library based on the original public
domain code by James Gillogly, but made faster and more flexible. Commands
using this library have been added for testing and for encrypting and
decrypting files (compatible with the DES command under Sun UNIX), among
other things.

Run make. That will compile everything and run test data (from the NBS
certification suite) through it.  It runs as-is under UNIX. It will run
under MS-DOS with a few minor changes: make sure you define LITTLE_ENDIAN
when compiling des.c, and change the name of the console in getpass.c.  If
you have the byte order flag set wrong, you will get ENCRYPT FAIL messages
when the descert test is run.
