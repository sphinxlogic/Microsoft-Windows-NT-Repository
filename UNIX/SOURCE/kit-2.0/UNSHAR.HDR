Here is the answer to your request:

	maildist vixie@Pa.dec.com kit 2.0


This is a shar file. It will be simpler to unshar it if you own the Rich Salz's
cshar package. If you do not have it, send me the following mail:

	Subject: Command
	@PACK shar
	@SH maildist vixie@Pa.dec.com cshar 3.0

and you will get cshar as shell archives.

Detailed intructions can be obtained by:

	Subject: Command
	@SH mailhelp vixie@Pa.dec.com

Unshar: Save this mail into a file, e.g. "foo1" and wait until
	you have received the 3 parts. Then, do "unshar -n foo*". If you
	do not own "unshar", edit the 3 files and remove the mail header
	by hand before feeding into sh.
