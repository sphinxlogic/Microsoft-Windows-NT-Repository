# Make everything script
# Greg Lehey, LEMIS, 16 January 1994
# This is invoked from the top-level Makefile, which 
# sets up to five environment variables:
#
# package - name of the directory
# install - set if we want to install the finished package
# make-package - set to the name of a script (in SOURCE/cdtools-1.3) to do the make
# clean - set if we want to subsequently make clean
# compress - set if we want to gzip the directory after the make
# This can be mkmkpk, to always rebuild prototype file,
# mkpackage, to never rebuild it (and fail if it is missing),
# or make-package, to make it when needed.
