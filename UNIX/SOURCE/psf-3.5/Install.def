		CONFIGURE PSF FOR AN "UNKNOWN" PRINTER

	Psf likes to have a "printer definition file" (usually
	psfprint.def) to describe the fonts, imageable area, and paper
	tray information needed by psf.  If the .def information
	is an accurate description of your printer, psf can do a
	good job of page rotation, scaling, and double sided printing.
	
	Two way are available to create a .def for an unknown printer:


	GET A COPY OF YOUR PRINTER'S .PPD FILE
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	If you can get a copy of your printer's ".ppd" file from the
	Adobe server by email or from the manufacturer, you can use the
	"table" programme to convert the .ppd information into a .def
	format required by psf. The command:

		table printer.ppd /usr/tmp

	will read your file "printer.ppd" and create a file
	/usr/tmp/printer.def. Copy this "printer.def" file to your psf
	directory:

		cp /usr/tmp/printer.def psfprint.def

	Also, you should probably copy this file into ./defs for future
	reference.


	BUILD A .DEF FILE MANUALLY
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	If you have a printer that is not described when you execute

		selectdef ./defs/*.def

	all is not lost. 

	Here is a summary of the steps:
	
		1. copy getsizes.ps to your printer. This determines
		   the page sizes and imageable area on your printer.
		
		2. copy ./defs/n890_470.def to psfprint.def.
		
		3. edit psfprint.def to reflect the imageable area
		   and font name information for your printer.
		
		4. all done - continue with "make installbsd"
		   or "make installsysv" as described in "Install.unix".

	In more detail:
	
	Generally, your printer is closely approximated by one of the
	known printers. Guess at which one that might be! The best
	guessing method is to look at your printer characteristics and
	compare them to the various files in the ./defs directory :-)

	If you are really lost, then maybe psf's default printer (a NEC
	LC890) is close enough to yours and you don't really need a
	psfprint.def description file.

	With a little work, you can manually construct your own
	psfprint.def. The basic items that you need to know are:

		1. Which paper sizes can your printer handle
		   such as a4, letter, legal, etc?  This can be
		   generated by "getsizes.ps".
		   
		   What is the postscript command needed to select
		   the paper size? Check you reference manual.

		2. What is the imageable area of each paper size?
		   Each paper size has a specific x-y min and max that
		   can be addressed. The postscript programme
		   "getsizes.ps" can give you the imageable areas
		   for your printer.

		3. Which fonts are available? Usually, you can
		   have the printer display all of it's known
		   fonts when you print the printers "test page".
		   Maybe it is in your manual.

		4. How many paper trays are on your system and how
		   do you select them?  This is usually in your
		   printer's technical reference manual.

	Determine the various available fonts from your printer's manual
	or the built-in test page.

	Send the postscript programme "getsizes.ps" to your printer.
	It will attempt to display the imageable area for all paper
	sizes in your printer.  Copy with a command like:

		1.   lp getsizes.ps
		
		2.   cat getsizes.ps > /dev/lp
		
		3.   or what ever, just get it to the printer.

	The resulting printed sizes are needed when you construct your
	own psfprint.def file. The numbers that display are exactly
	those required when you describe the "page dimensions" in the
	.def file.

	Now copy a sample ".def" file to your working copy. Try to choose
	one that might be an approximation to your own printer:

		cp ./defs/n890_470.def psfprint.def
	
	Using the example commented sample "def" file below, edit your
	psfprint.def file to use your printer's appropriate information
	for imageable area, font names and other parameters. Hopefully,
	it is clear enough and you can just follow your intuition!

=========================================================================        

	This is a commented sample of a printer "def" file.

	You will need a list of available fonts and the printed results
	from "getsizes.ps".  Select a .def that is a "reasonable
	approximation" to your printer.  If you cannot find one,
	use ./defs/n890_470.def.

	Look at other files in the ./defs directory to see how things
	should be constructed. For example, if you have only one paper
	tray, then you don't need "*slots" entries. i.e. your resulting
	file would look like:
		...
		*slots 0
		*eof

	The various sections of the file are separated by a line
	starting with "*". The first section describes the page sizes
	known to the printer.

	There should not be any blank lines in your resulting .def
	file.  Line format must be exactly right. No edit checks
	are performed by psf and friends.
