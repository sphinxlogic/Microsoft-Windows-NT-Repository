Changes between V3 patchlevel 4 and patchlevel 5  (May 1992)

     1. fixed loss of first line if "language feature" used.
     
     2. psf can print to a pipe with the -O option.  Hopefully,
        this allows printing to an apple network.  Usually, this
        is installed as a print option in psfprint.def (for lpr/lpd).
     
Changes between psf V3 patchlevel 3 and patchlevel 4  (April 1992)

     1. ISO-Latin1 encoding supportd.
     
     2. Page usage accounting added (printcap "af" support)
     
     3. Psf can read page statistics from a serial/ethernet printer
        (printcap "rw" support).
     
     4. If the printer supports duplex double sided printing,
        the feature is invoked with -D
     
     5. Printing a ctl/D at eoj is not done unless psf is
        printing to a printer device.
     
     6. the -u option to select alternate printer definition files
        now works if psf is used as part of the spooler filter system.
     
     7. Some printer definitions in ./def have been fixed.

Psf changes between version 2 and 3

     1.	Page rotation and scaling has been corrected. In particular,
	problems with landscape printing have been fixed.

     2.	Changes have been made to allow psf to work with the lpr/lpd
	spooling system. Read "Install.lpd" for details.

     3. Reverse order printing is added.

     4.	The original Install.unix and Install.xenix installation scripts
	are no longer used. All installation is done with make. Read
	"Readme.unix" for details

     5.	A postscript programme "getsizes.ps" has been added so that
	the imageable area of almost any page size on almost any
	printer can be determined.  Documentation for manual
	preparation of a .def file has been clarified.

     6.	Xenix is no longer supported - however a xenix installation
	with
			make installxenix
	
	should work.  It has not been tested.

     7. Documentation has been upgraded a bit.

     8. Line clipping on 2 and 4 up printing has been implemented.

     9. Added -s option to display print line and column counts for
        different point and page sizes.

    10. Language support for European languages.

    11. Name conflicts with OpenWindows "forced" changes in names
        of programmes:

        	old name     new name
        	------------ -----------
        	psman	     psfman
        	pnf	     psfbs
        	pmf	     psfmail
        	psnroff	     psfnroff
        	psd	     psfdoub
        	psdouble     psfdouble
        	psmbox       psfmbox
