     NAME
	  psfbs	- postscript nroff backspace filter for	use with psf


     SYNOPSIS
	  psfbs	[ -i ] [ -f ] [	-l n ] [ -r n ]	file ... > out.fil

	  where	    -i	 = use italic font instead of underline
		    -f	 = document has	formfeeds, ignore line count
		    -l n = nroff generated "n" ine pages
			   (default = 66 lines)
		    -r n = number of lines to remove (default =	3)
		    file = input files (or stdin)


     DESCRIPTION
	  Psfbs	is a filter that converts "backspaced text" generated
	  by nroff into	underlined or bold text. It is primarily used
	  to format man	pages, however it can be used to format
	  documents generated with the ms and mm macros.

	  Normally, psfbs is not used directly:	the shell script
	  psfnroff is a	more convenient	interface for nroff text
	  formatting.

	  Nroff'ed documents typically use 66 line pages.  Since psf
	  defaults to 63 lines on Letter size paper (3 lines are
	  unprintable),	three blank lines are usually removed between
	  nroff'ed pages.


     EXAMPLES
	  The man page for "psf" man page could	be printed "2-up"
	  with:

		nroff -man psf.1 | psfbs -r 3 |	psf -2 | lp

	  or 1-up with with italic conversion

		nroff -man psf.1 | psfbs -ir 3 | psf -2	| lp


     OPTIONS
	  -i	   Since the text from nroff usually substitutes
		   underlines for italics, you may use the -i option
		   to regenerate the italic font.


	  -f	   If the document uses	form feeds for page
		   separation, the -f option should be specified.  Any
		   line	count specified	by -l is ignored.

	  -l n	   The -l option specifies the nominal number of lines
		   generated by	nroff for the page.  If	the -l option
		   is used, the	-r option probably must	be specified
		   also.

		   If "-l" is not specified, then 66 line nroff	pages
		   are assumed.


	  -r n	   The -r option allows	you to specify the number
		   blank lines to be removed between each page
		   generated by	nroff.	If "-r"	is not specified, then
		   3 blank lines are removed between pages.

		   The removed lines account for the "unprintable" top
		   an bottom areas of the postscript page.

		   Lines may be	removed	by psfbs or by psf which also
		   has a -r option.  If	line removal is	performed by
		   psf,	then the option	-r0 should be used with	psfbs
		   to disable the removal of the 3 default blank
		   lines.


     PSFBS NOTES
	  Psfbs	converts "backspaced text" generated by	nroff into
	  escape sequences that	can be used by psf to generate
	  underlined or	bold text.  It simply scans for	the
	  "backspace" character	and attempts determine if the
	  backspace is used in the contex of an	"underline" or
	  "multi-strike	boldface".  In some circumstances, it may not
	  correctly detect the print operation (for example, italic-
	  bold is not recognized).

	  The conversion results in the	following generated sequences
	  that can be recognized by psf	(were ^E is <ctrl>E or the
	  octal	value \005):

		  ^EB..text..^Eb   for bold
		  ^EU..text..^Eu   for underline
	  or
		  ^EI..text..^Ei   for italics

	  (italics instead of underline	selected with -i option)

	  The logic cannot handle bold-underlined (nor italic-
	  underlined).


     BUGS
	  Psfbs	is not a full featured nroff filter. It	is intended to
	  process documents generated with the -man macros. Formatting
