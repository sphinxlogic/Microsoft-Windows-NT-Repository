     NAME
	  psfmail - postscript mail pre-filter (psf)

     SYNOPSIS
	  psfmail [ -s ] file file ... > out.file

	  where	    -s = show all header lines
		  file = input files (or stdin)


     EXAMPLE
		psfmail	mail.file | psf	-2 | lp


     DESCRIPTION
	  Psfmail is a very simple filter for mail documents. It
	  italicizes the Subject: and attempts to place	peoples	names
	  in boldface. It can be used to print entire mail boxes while
	  suppressing unnecessary mail headers.

	  Normally, psfmail is not used	directly: psfmbox is used.
	  This is a wrapper for	psfmail	and is much more convenient to
	  use.

	  Mail box message file	may be printed with:

		psfmail	mail.file | psf	-2 | lp

	  If psf has been installed as part of the print spooling
	  system, then the output from psfmail may be passed directly
	  to the lp spooler with:

	       psfmail mail.file | lp

	  If multiple mailboxes	are printed, it	might be preferable to
	  use the command (refer to the	man pages for psfmbox):

		psfmbox	file file ...

	  This date-stamps and identifies the mail box name.  Each
	  mailbox file is treated as a separate	print job.  This may
	  result in printer banner pages for each file.

	  If psfmail and psf are used with ELM the user's elmrc	file
	  should be modified to	specify	the following "print" line (or
	  reasonable approximation):

		print =	/usr/bin/psfmail %s | /usr/bin/psf -2 |	/usr/bin/lp


     OPTIONS
	  -s	   causes all mail headers to be printed.  If this

		   option is not specified, then psfmail will suppress
		   "meaningless" headers such as:

			       Received:
			       References:
			       Path:
			       Message-ID:

		   and other.  If additional headers are to be
		   ignored, the	source for psfmail.c must be modified.
