     DESCRIPTION
	  Psf filters text files for display on	postscript printers.
	  Text may be "1-up", "2-up", or "4-up"	on a page. Psf is a
	  general purpose filter for most text and programme listings.
	  By using various escape sequences (described below), any
	  portion of the text may be printed in	different fonts	and at
	  different point sizes.

	  If "letter" sized paper is used, the page is assumed to have
	  63 lines and 80 columns wide.	 For "legal" sized paper, the
	  effective size is 81 lines by	80 columns.  These dimensions
	  account for the "print region" (excluding margins) of	the
	  page.

	  The actual number of print lines and characters per line may
	  be over-ridden by specifying suitable	options.

	  The most commonly used options are page rotation, setting
	  point	size, column count and line count: all of which	allow
	  you to place more printed information	on a page.  Additional
	  options are for special formatting purposes and may be used
	  if desired.

	  By default, lines wider than the page	width are truncated.
	  Line wrap may	be enabled with	the -e option.

	  Special formatting for nroff'ed documents and	mail box
	  printing are encapsulated in shell scripts such as psfnroff
	  and psfmbox. These scripts hide some of the more complex
	  options.


     EXAMPLES
	  General text may be printed with a command such as:

	       psf this.file that.fil |	lp

	  If page rotation and print scaling is	desired, typical
	  commands are:

	      psf -		     (show help	information)
	      psf my.file my2.fil    (normal print)
	      psf -2  my.file	     (print 2 up on a page)
	      psf -2xn my.c	     (typical source listing)
	      psf -4x my.file	     (print 4 up on a page)
	      psf -p8 my.fil	     (print 8 point)
	      psf -l66 -c132 -w	a.b  (print 66 lines, 132 cols,	landscape)
	      psf -M 1,1,1,1,c a.b   (set 1 cm margins)


     PRINT SIZE
	  Two ways are available to adjust the print size.  If the



     Page 3					      (printed 6/2/92)






     PSF(1)		       Unix System V			PSF(1)



	  point	size (using the	-p option) is used, choosing a smaller
	  point	size than the default of 12 results in smaller letters
	  and more printed lines.  Choosing a larger points size
	  results in larger letters and	reduces	the number of printed
	  lines	and columns on a page.

	  A table of various point sizes, page sizes and their
	  associated line and column count is printed with:

		psf -s

	  If the column	count (-c) or the line count (-l) is adjusted,
	  the number of	printed	rows and columns can be	changed	form
	  the defaults for the paper size.  For	example, a 132 column,
	  60 line page in landscape layout may be selected with:

		psf -w -c132 -l60 my.fil | lp


     OPTIONS
	  -124 Specify the number of logical pages that	are to be
	       printed on a physical page.  By default,	psf will print
	       one logical page	per physical page.

	       If two logical pages are	specified with -2 , then two
	       pages are printed in "landscape"	format:

		     +-----------+-----------+
		     |		 |	     |
		     |	 pg 1	 |   pg	2    |
		     |		 |	     |
		     +-----------+-----------+

	       If two-up printing in portrait layout is	desired, use
	       -2n (i.e. two up, narrow).  On letter sized paper this
	       gives two logical pages:	each is	80 columns by 126
	       lines.  This layout may be preferred for	programme
	       listing.


	       If four logical pages are specified with	-4 , then the
	       pages are printed in "portrait format:

		     +-----------+-----------+
		     |		 |	     |
		     |	 pg 1	 |   pg	2    |
		     |		 |	     |
		     +-----------+-----------+
		     |		 |	     |
		     |	 pg 3	 |   pg	4    |
		     |		 |	     |
		     +-----------+-----------+



     Page 4					      (printed 6/2/92)






     PSF(1)		       Unix System V			PSF(1)



	       Each logical page printed in 2-up or 4-up format
	       contains	the same number	of lines and print columns as
	       if it were printed in 1-up portrait format.  The
	       characters may be compressed or expanded	horizontally
	       to fill to the logical page width.  For example,
	       printing	with:

		      psf -4 my.text | lp

	       creates four miniature pages, each of which would
	       contain 63 print	lines and 80 characters	on a line.

	       Printing	2-up or	4-up preserves the number of lines on
	       a logical printed paged.	Identical results (in terms of
	       lines and columns on a logical page) are	realized with
	       1-up, 2-up or 4-up printing.

	       Clipping	is performed in	2-up and 4-up printing.	 If
	       the line	lengths	on the left half of the	page exceed
	       the logical page	width, the lines will be truncated.


	  -a   If psf is used as part of a spooler filter and the
	       filter has read access to stdout, then the -a option
	       allows the filter to read the actual number of pages
	       printed from the	printer.  If this option is not
	       provided, the computed number of	pages wll be written
	       to the log file.


	  -A acct.fil
	       If psf is used as part of the lpsched spooling system,
	       the specified file is used to record the	accounting
	       information.


	  -b n Select paper bin	n. If this option is not specified,
	       the default paper bin is	used.


	  -c n Sets the	number of print	columns	on a line.  The
	       character width is based	on the Courier font (10	pitch,
	       character width of 7.2 points).	The text is scaled to
	       print the desired number	of characters over the entire
	       page width.  Setting the	character count	does NOT alter
	       the number of print lines.

	       The option -c40 on letter sized paper horizontally
	       elongates the characters	to twice normal	width.
	       Similarly, -c160	on letter size paper compresses	the
	       characters to one half normal width.

	  -D   Use the printer's native	duplex mode for	double-sided
	       printing.  Book format is not supported in this mode.


	  -d   Prepare for double sided	printing.  The resulting print
	       stream is written to psfbook.psd	which must be
	       subsequently filtered with psfdoub. Refer to the	man
	       page for	psfdoub	for operational	details.


	  -e   By default, lines longer	than the page width are
	       truncated.  This	option enables line wrap: long lines
	       will cascade onto successive print lines.  Each wrapped
	       portion of the line is left-justified.


	  -E   This operates similar to	-e however each	wrapped
	       portion of the line is right-justified:	 the end of
	       the wrapped portion of the line is placed at the	right
	       paper margin.


	  -f n Any of the standard postscript fonts may	be selected in
	       lieu of the default Courier.  These are selected	from
	       the following table:

			0 Courier
			1 Helvetica
			2 Times-Roman
			3 AvantGarde-Book
			4 Bookman-Light
			5 NewCenturySchlbk-Roman
			6 Palatino-Roman
			7 Helvetica-Narrow
			8 Garamond-Light
			9 Korinna-Regular
			a Helvetica-Condensed
			b ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

	       The target printer may not have exactly these fonts.
	       To see which fonts are configured, display the psf
	       usage information with:

		    psf	-

	       Since Courier is	the only fixed-pitch font, it is
	       usually used for	printing of man	pages or programme
	       listings.  The other fonts are proportionally spaced.

	       The selected font becomes the new "default font".

	       The font	may be specified either	by the font number or



     Page 6					      (printed 6/2/92)






     PSF(1)		       Unix System V			PSF(1)



	       the font	name.  For example, the	Courier	font could be
	       selected	with either option '-f 0' or '-f Courier'.  If
	       the selection is	by name, then only a few of the
	       characters of the name must be provided.	 The
	       NewCenturySchlbk-Roman font could be selected with the
	       option '-f New'.


	  -g type
	       Sets the	working	paper type.  The type may be one of
	       the following with the default number of	lines and
	       columns (assuming 12 point, 10 pitch Courier
	       characters):

		       type	  lines	    columns
		      -------	  -----	    -------
		      letter	   63	      80
		      legal	   81	      80
		      a4	   67	      78
		      b5	   58	      67

	       The number of lines/columns represents the number of
	       possible	lines/columns in the printable region of the
	       postscript printer - exclusive of the unprintable
	       margin area.


	  -h   The file	name, page number and current date are printed
	       at the top of each page.	 The point size	is
	       automatically scaled to permit the specified number of
	       text lines to be	printed	to account for the additional
	       two lines consumed by the title line.


	  -H text
	       Place a header (like -h ) however use text rather than
	       the filename.


	  -j   generates a ctl/d at the	end of a print job.  If	psf is
	       used at the command line	or within a shell script, a
	       ctl/d is	not generated at the end of a print job: this
	       option forces the generation.


	  -I   Enable or disable the use of ISO	Latin1 character set
	       encoding.  If psf was compiled to use ISO Latin1
	       encoding	by default, the	-I option reverts to standard
	       encoding.  If psf was compiled to use standard
	       encoding, the -I	option enables ISO Latin1 encoding.

	  -i n[pic]
	       Indent the physical page's left margin by n points (p)
	       , inches	(i) or centimeters (c).	Text is	scaled by the
	       amount of the indentation to preserve nominal line and
	       column counts.  This is useful to offset	the left
	       margin for binding or hole-punch.

	       If indentation is desired without causing scaling (i.e.
	       a true "offset" only), then a point size	must be
	       selected	with -P.

		    psf	-i2c -P12 doc.file | lpr


	  -l n Sets the	number of printed lines	per page.  The default
	       is 63 lines for letter sized paper.  If more than 63
	       lines per page are specified, the point size is
	       automatically reduced to	accommodate the	line count.

	       The number of printed lines specified by	-l may be less
	       than the	number of possible print lines specified by -
	       L. For example, the default total number	of print lines
	       is 63 (as though	you had	specified -L63 ).  If you used
	       the option -l20 , then only the first 20	lines of the
	       possible	63 would be printed.  A	skip to	new page would
	       be performed for	the 21st line and the remainder	of the
	       page would be blank.


	  -L n Specifies the number of possible	print lines available
	       on the page.  If	-L is specified, then the page scale
	       is adjusted to accommodate the line count.   However,
	       only the	number of lines	specified by the -l option
	       will actually print.


	  -m n[pic]
	       Move the	physical page's	top margin down	by n points
	       (p) , inches (i)	or centimeters (c). Text is scaled by
	       the amount of the indentation to	preserve nominal line
	       and column counts.  This	is useful to offset the	top
	       margin for binding or hole-punch.


	  -M lm,rm,tm,bm[,pic]
	       All four	margins	on the each logical page (1,2, or 4
	       up) may be set with the -M option. The size of the left
	       (lm), right (rm), top (tm) and bottom (bm) margins may
	       be set in points	(p), inches (i)	or centimeters (c).

	       This option affects each	logical	page: margins set with
	       -i or -m	are used to offset physical margins.



     Page 8					      (printed 6/2/92)






     PSF(1)		       Unix System V			PSF(1)



	       For example,

		   -M 2,3,4.2,5,c

	       will set	a left margin of 2cm, right margin of 3cm, top
	       margin of 4.2cm and a bottom margin of 5cm.

	       If the type of unit is omitted, then "point" is
	       assumed.

	       Only those margin settings desired need be provided.
	       The missing values are assumed to be printer defaults.
	       For example, to offset (left margin only) a page	by
	       1.25 inches, a possible command might be:

		    psf	-M 1.25,,,,i my.file

	       Margin sizes are	absolute and not scaled	when printing
	       in 2-up or 4-up modes.

	       Margins to do not cause line clipping:  long text lines
	       may overflow the	right margin.  Line wrap with -e or -E
	       may be used to preserve the right margin.

	       The margin setting could	be used	in conjunction with
	       the line	and column count to provide positioning	within
	       the page. For example, an 80 column by 60 line page can
	       be centered with	50 point margins with:

		    psf	-M 50,50,50,50,p -l 60 -c 80 my.file

	       If margins are set but the line and column count	are
	       not provided, the printing is scaled to use the default
	       number of lines and columns for the page	and point size
	       in use.	Scaling	for point size may be defeated with
	       the -P n	option.


	  -n   The page	is printed in portrait (narrow)	format.	 This
	       is the default for 1-up and 4-up	printing.  If portrait
	       layout is desired for 2-up printing, then the -n	option
	       must be specified.


	  -O pipe
	       The -O option allows psf	to open	a pipe to another
	       process rather than sending output to stdout.  This
	       option is effective only	for versions of	psf used in a
	       print spooler.

	       The pipe	is the command (with options) that is to be
	       executed.  For example,



     Page 9					      (printed 6/2/92)






     PSF(1)		       Unix System V			PSF(1)



		    -O "auxfilter -p17 -t 'sample heading' -v"

	       Quoted options may be used.


	  -p n Sets the	nominal	point size to n	points.	 This is
	       accurate	only to	"1-up" printing.  If "2-up" or "4-up"
	       or "1-up, landscape" printing is	desired, the nominal
	       point size is automatically scaled.

	       The selected point size becomes the new "default	point
	       size".

	       Character shape is retained as much as possible:
	       however margin adjustment with -M, -i, and -m do	cause
	       general scaling.

	       Line count set with -l and column count sent with -c
	       are honoured, however the point height is preserved.
	       This may	result in horizontally squashed/elongated
	       characters if the -c option is used and/or changes in
	       the spacing between lines if the	-l option is used.


	  -P n Sets the	nominal	point size to n. however the point
	       size is not be scaled if	the margin size	is adjusted
	       with -M.	-i, or -m. Scaling still take place in 2-up
	       and 4-up	printing.


	  -R n removes n lines from the	beginning of the file.


	  -r n removes n lines between pages of	the file.

	       Use this	option if the text file	has blank lines	that
	       must be removed between pages.  For example, a typical
	       "accounting" report may print 60	lines and 132 columns
	       of text.	 Usually, such reports have two	blank lines
	       before the first	printed	text on	a page	and 6 blank
	       lines to	skip to	the top	of the next page.

	       To generate exactly 60 printed lines with psf, the
	       first two blank lines should be removed with -R2	and
	       the blank lines between pages removed with -r6:

		      psf -R2 -r 6 -l 60 -c 132	account.rpt | lp

	       The -r and -R may be used together as needed.

	       If a skip to new	page was caused	by a formfeed imbedded
	       in the text file, then removal of lines is not

	       performed for that page.


	  -s   generates a display of commonly used page layouts,
	       point sizes and the associated line and column counts
	       for the Courier font.  The display looks	like:

			 point size:	  8	  10	   12
				       lin col	lin col	 lin col
		  -- Page Layout --    --- ---	--- ---	 --- ---
		   Letter  portrait:	95 120	 76  96	  63  80
		   Letter landscape:	72 159	 57 128	  48 106
		    Legal  portrait:   122 120	 97  96	  81  80
		    Legal landscape:	72 204	 57 164	  48 136
		       A4  portrait:   101 117	 81  94	  67  78
		       A4 landscape:	70 170	 56 136	  46 113
		       B5  portrait:	87 100	 69  80	  58  67
		       B5 landscape:	60 146	 48 117	  40  97

	       Statistics for point sizes between 6 and	16 are shown.


	  -t n Sets the	width of the tab stops.	 By default this is
	       set to 8.  If the first line of a text file contains
	       the string "ta=", then the tab stop width is
	       automatically determined	from this string.  For
	       example,	if the first text line contains	"/* ta=4 */"
	       then the	tab width is automatically set to 4.  This
	       feature is useful if programme source files use a tab
	       space of	4.


	  -u f.def
	       causes the specified file to be used rather than	the
	       default printer definition file psfprint.def. If	the
	       file cannot be found, the directory containing the
	       default psfprint.def file is also searched.

	       Display the fonts and paper tray	assignment applicable
	       to the alternate	.def file with:

		    psf	-u f.def -\?


	  -v   Print pages in reverse order.


	  -w   The page	is printed in landscape	(wide, horizontal
	       format).	 This is the default for 2-up printing.	 If
	       1-up or 4-up printing is	desired	in landscape mode,
	       then the	-w switch must be specified.

	  -x   Draws a cross in	the to separate	the logical pages.
	       This is effective for 4-up or 2-up printing.  If	1-up
	       is used,	this option is ignored.


	  -Y host
	       If lpsched is used as the spooler, the specified	host
	       name is used in the printer accounting entry.


	  -y user
	       If lpsched is used as the spooler, the specified	user
	       name is used in the printer accounting entry.


	  -z   This option applies to psflpd use for print filtering
	       with lpr	or psffilter used for print filtering with lp
	       spooling	systems.  Ascii	to postscript translation is
	       forced, even if the file	is already postscript code.
	       This allows the printing	of a postscript	programme.


     PSF NOTES
	  Psf filters text in a	"minimally conforming" postscript
	  format (as specified in the Postscript Language Reference
	  Manual).

	  If the text contains escape sequences	(possibly generated by
	  psfbs, psfmail or a text editor), the	escape sequences are
	  analyzed to perform limited font and underline selection.
	  The escape sequences are translated into appropriate
	  postscript code.

	  The permitted	sequences have the following format:

		  ^E<command>

	  The following	sequences are recognized:

		   ^EB	   begin bold (in current font family)
		   ^Eb	   end bold
		   ^EI	   begin italics
		   ^Ei	   end italics
		   ^EU	   begin underline
		   ^Eu	   end underline.
		   ^EFn	   begin font 'n' (0..9, a..f)
		   ^Ef	   revert to default font
		   ^EPnn   begin point size 'nn' (2 digits)
		   ^Ep	   revert to default point size
		   ^E+	   skip	1/2 line forward
		   ^E-	   skip	1/2 line backward




     Page 12					      (printed 6/2/92)






     PSF(1)		       Unix System V			PSF(1)



		   "^E"	is a true ctrl-E character, not
			  the ascii text string	"^", "E"

	  Note that point sizes	with ^EPnn must	be two digits such as
	  ^EP07	or ^EP14.

	  Sequences may	be nested: bold, italic, underlined would be
	  generated with:

	       ^EB^EI^EUbold, italic and underlined^Eu^Ei^Eb

	  Font numbers are consistent across printers.	However, the
	  available fonts may be different on different	printers.  For
	  a given printer, the font numbers available are as specified
	  on the usage menu of psf (generated with "psf	-").

	  Any unrecognized escape sequences are	ignored.


     PRINTER SPOOLING
	  If psffilter has been	installed as part of the lp/lpsched lp
	  spooling system, psf options may be passed in	the lp command
	  line using the -o option for lp :

		  lp -o"-4xh" this.file	that.file
		     --------

	  The additional options of "banner" and "nobanner" may	be
	  passed to the	spooler	to print or not	print a	banner page:

		  lp -o"nobanner -4xh" this.file that.file
	  or
		  lp -o"banner -4xh" this.file that.file

	  The spooler system also recognizes the -z option to force
	  printing of postscript code.

	  If the spooler is lp/lpsched,	then the spooler binary	is
	  normally psffilter. If the spooler is	lpr/lpd, the binary is
	  psflpd.

	  If the system's spooler is lpr/lpd then options may not be
	  passed to the	print filter: usually the system administrator
	  has configured a number of different printer names that use
	  different default printing characteristics of	psf.

	  For example, printing	2-up on	a page could be	done with the
	  command:

	       lpr -P2up my.file

     ENVIRONMENT
	  If the environment variable PSFLP is set, then psf and
	  psfdoub will use the value as	the name of the	output print
	  file.	 If this variable is not set, the default output file
	  is stdout.

	  For example.

	       set PSFLP=prn

	  would	be a convenient	way to always direct the output	of psf
	  to the MSDOS printer prn.

	  If the environment variable PSFDEF is	set, psf uses the set
	  value	as the name of the .def	file to	use.

	  For example:

	       set PSFDEF=/etc/psfprint.def


     DIAGNOSTICS
	  Error	messages are written to	stderr.	 If psf	is used	as a
	  spooler filter, the error messages are written to the
	  spooler error	logging	file.  If a serial/ethernet printer is
	  connected, additional	printer-generated messages may also
	  appear in the	log file.

	  Standard messages generated by psf:

	  no alternate bins permitted
	  paper	bin greater than maximum for printer
	  Double sided or book in reverse ordered not supported
	  Font number invalid
		  - use	'psf -'	to see a list of fonts available
	  cannot create	work file
	       - directory permission?
	  cannot allocate enough memory
	  Cannot open output file
	       - directory permission?
	  Unknown file xxxx
	  Bad psfprint.def file
		  - the	psfprint.def file is corrupted.	 Contact
		    your systems administrator.


     BUGS
	  Double sided reverse ordered printing	with the -dv options
	  is not supported.

	  Line wrap with the -e	option works correctly for Courier
	  font only.  If other fonts are used, inappropriate line



     Page 14					      (printed 6/2/92)






     PSF(1)		       Unix System V			PSF(1)



	  wraps	may result.  Psf does not know about font metrics.

	  Double sided printing	may not	work correctly with top	margin
	  or left margin indentation.

	  Psf has far to many options.
