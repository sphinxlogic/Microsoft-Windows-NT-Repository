where     -i   = use italic font instead of underline
          -f   = document has formfeeds, ignore line count
          -l n = nroff generated "n" ine pages
                 (default = 66 lines)
          -r n = number of lines to remove (default = 3)
          file = input files (or stdin)
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

.I Psfbs
is a filter that converts "backspaced text" generated by 
.I nroff
into underlined or bold text. It is primarily used
to format
.I man
pages, however it can be used to format documents
generated with the
.I ms
and
.I mm
macros.

Normally,
.I psfbs
is not used directly: the shell script
.I psfnroff
is a more convenient interface for
.I nroff
text formatting.

Nroff'ed documents typically use 66 line pages.  Since
.I psf
defaults to 63 lines on Letter size paper (3 lines are unprintable), three
blank lines are usually removed between nroff'ed pages.

.SH EXAMPLES

The man page for "psf" man page could be printed "2-up" with:

.nf
      nroff -man psf.1 | psfbs -r 3 | psf -2 | lp

or 1-up with with italic conversion

      nroff -man psf.1 | psfbs -ir 3 | psf -2 | lp
.fi

.SH OPTIONS

.TP .9i
.B \-i
Since the text from
.I nroff
usually substitutes underlines for
italics, you may use the -i option to regenerate the italic font.

.RE
.TP .9i
.B \-f
If the document uses form feeds for page separation, the -f option
should be specified.  Any line count specified by -l is ignored.

.RE
.TP .9i
.B \-l n
The -l option specifies the nominal number of lines generated by
.I nroff
for the page.  If the -l option is used, the -r option probably must
be specified also.

If "-l" is not specified, then 66 line nroff pages are assumed.

.RE
.TP .9i
.B \-r n
The -r option allows you to specify the number blank lines to be
removed between each page generated by nroff.
If "-r" is not specified, then 3 blank lines are removed between pages.

The removed lines account for the "unprintable" top an bottom
areas of the postscript page.

Lines may be removed by
.I psfbs
or by
.I psf
which also has a
.I -r
option.  If line removal is performed by
.I psf,
then the option
.B -r0
should be used with
.I psfbs
to disable the removal of the 3 default blank lines.

.SH PSFBS NOTES

.I Psfbs
converts "backspaced text" generated by
.I nroff
into escape sequences
that can be used by psf to generate underlined or bold text.
It simply scans for the "backspace" character and
attempts determine if the backspace is used in the contex of an "underline"
or "multi-strike boldface".  In some circumstances, it may not correctly
detect the print operation (for example, italic-bold is not recognized).

The conversion results in the following generated sequences that can
be recognized by
.I psf
(were ^E is <ctrl>E or the octal value \\005):
.nf

        ^EB..text..^Eb   for bold
        ^EU..text..^Eu   for underline
or
        ^EI..text..^Ei   for italics

(italics instead of underline selected with -i option)

.fi
The logic cannot handle bold-underlined (nor italic-underlined).

.SH BUGS

.I Psfbs
is not a full featured
.I nroff
filter. It is intended to process documents generated
with the
.I -man
macros. Formatting with other macros may be incorrectly handled.
