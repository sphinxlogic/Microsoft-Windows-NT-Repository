     NAME
	  psfdoub - print double sided (psf)

     SYNOPSIS
	  psfdoub n [ -u f.def ] [ -v ]	file

	  where	  n  is	the number 1, 2, or 3
		     1 = print first side
		     2 = print second side
		     3 = print both sides (must	have second print tray)
		    -r = reverse order print
	      -u f.def = name of .def file to use
		  file = input file (default: psfbook.psd)


     DESCRIPTION
	  If the postscript filter psf is used with the	-d (double
	  sided) option, the output file psfbook.psd must be passed to
	  psfdoub to print the generated file in "double sided"
	  format.  (See	NOTE below.)

	  The printing is done in two passes:  first to	print side
	  one, second to print side two.

	  The general sequence of commands is be:

		  psf -d my.file
		  psfdoub -1 psfbook.psd | lp
			     <-- re-feed the paper for 2nd pass
		  psfdoub -2 psfbook.psd | lp

	  Psf generates	the intermediate file psfbook.psd. The first
	  invocation of	psfdoub	with the -1 option prints only the
	  front	side of	the pages.  After the printing is complete,
	  the paper must be re-fed into	the print hopper.  The psfdoub
	  -2 command is	then issued to print on	the back side of the
	  pages.

	  If psfdoub is	used with the -3 option, the front sides are
	  printed.  Automatically, the printer is switched to accept
	  input	from the alternate print tray.	As soon	as the
	  alternate print tray is loaded, the second side is printed.
	  E.g.:
		  psf -d my.file
		  psfdoub -3 psfbook.psd | lp

	  The -3 option	may be used only if the	printer	has two	print
	  trays.


     OPTIONS
	  -123 sets the	desired	page size for printing.	 See above.

	  -r   causes the pages	to be printed in reverse order.


	  -u f.def
	       causes the specified printer definition file to be used
	       rather that psfprint.def.


	  file is the name of the file to be processed.	 The file name
	       generated by psf	is psfbook.psd.	If an input file name
	       is not provided,	the psfbook.psd	is assumed.


     NOTE
	  If psf was compiled with the "-DHOPPER" option and the
	  postscript printer has at least two paper hoppers, psf
	  automatically	calls psfdoub to perform double	sided
	  printing. Manual invocation of psfdoub is not	necessary.

	  If psf was not compiled with "-DHOPPER" or if	the postscript
	  printer does not have	at least two paper hoppers, then
	  psfdoub must be used as described above.

	  The use of option "-3" assumes that psf was compiled without
	  the "-DHOPPER" option, however the printer does, in fact,
	  have at least	two paper hoppers.

	  Examine shell	script psfdouble as an example on setting up
	  suitable shell scripts for double sided printing.

	  Psfdoub is also used by psf for reverse order	printing.


     BUGS
	  Double sided reverse ordered printing	is not supported.
