     NAME
	  psfman - print man pages with	psf filters

     SYNOPSIS
	  psfman [ chapter ] page page ...

	   where  chapter is the option	man chapter
		  page	  is the man page to be	printed


     DESCRIPTION
	  psfman prints	one or more man	pages 2-up on a	physical page.
	  Each man page	becomes	a separate print job.

	  The resulting	paper may be filed in an 5.5x8.5 inch binder.


     EXAMPLE
	  The vi man pages may be printed with:

		 psfman	vi

	  or the stty page from	chapter	1:

		 psfman	1 stty


     OPTIONS
	  chapter
	       specifies an optional man chapter.  This	may be a
	       single digit (1..9) or a	Xenix chapter designation.


     BUGS
	  If man uses more -s as a pager (i.e. if more sqeezes
	  multiple blank lines into a single line), then page breaks
	  are not always handled correctly by psfman.  This can
	  usually be corrected with the	man option -Tlp.
