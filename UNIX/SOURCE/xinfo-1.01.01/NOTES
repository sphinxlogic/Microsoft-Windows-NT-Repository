Note (reference) handling can get a little screwy when dealing with
notes that span lines or have lots of strange punctuation in them.
I still don't know whether "Note" is as valid as "note" so I accept
either case at the moment. The only other info driver I have also
breaks on these so it's hard to say what the correct thing to do is.

The R4 Athena List widget seems to do a better job of packing menu items
in the space available, though it doesn't always seem inform to inform
the Paned widget correctly when it needs more space. All in all, however,
this works a good deal better than it used to in R3.

Memory utilization should be correct now, though it's hard to tell since
I haven't got a malloc that gives memory back to the system (I'm still
more-or-less apalled that few, if any, mallocs tend to do so). Let me
know if you find any leaks.

The long awaited Motif conversion is still undone. The info widget is now
subclassed to composite and the code has been cleaned up in preparation, but
I still haven't got round to it. If anyone wants to do it, please contact me.
It's not hard to do, just tedious.

If you use this widget in a larger application, let me know; I'm curious
to know if anyone will use it in any other manner but stand-alone.
