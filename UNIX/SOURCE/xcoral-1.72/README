Build
-----
	Xcoral is built on top of Xlib. You can use your native
	cc compiler as well as gcc.2.3.1 or later version.
		
	If you run MIT X11 R[4|5] on SunOS 4.1.x, Ultrix 4.2
	or other BSD Unix, as usual, just type :
		$ xmkmf
		$ make

	For other systems, edit config.h to set fontnames and
	colornames for your X Window System, edit Makefile.std
	to set INCLUDE and LIBDIR, and try :
		$ make -f Makefile.std
Install
-------	
	$ cp xcoral /usr/local/bin
	$ cp xcoral.man /usr/man/manl/xcoral.l	(and read it).

Platforms (Compiled and tested at our site)
-------------------------------------------
	We have tested xcoral with InterViews/ibuild sources
	files and with our local projects on the following systems :

	Sun 3/4, SS2 SS10 with SunOS 4.1.x and MIT X11 R[4|5] or
		OpenWindows2/3.
	Dec station 3100 with ULTRIX V4.1 and MIT X11 R[4|5].
	Dec station 5000 with ULTRIX V4.2A and Xws (Dec X11R4 server).
	HP 9000-720 with HP-UX 8.07 and HP X11R4 server.
	Mac IIci  with A_UX  and Apple X11R4 server.
