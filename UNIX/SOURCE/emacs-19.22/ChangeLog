Sat Sep 25 12:00:38 1993  Brian Fox  (bfox@ai.mit.edu)

	* build-install.in: Change src/xemacs to src/emacs.  We no longer

	the X libraries if we're using X.

	* configure.in: Test for the presence of/usr/lpp/X11/bin/smt.exp,

	directory's makefile.  This allows the invocation of CPP which
	builds xmakefile to receive these switches.  The SunSoft C
	preprocessor inserts spaces between tokens if it doesn't get the
	-Xs flag requested in src/s/sol2.h.

Mon Jul 12 14:43:38 1993  Frederic Pierresteguy  (F.Pierresteguy@frcl.bull.fr)

	reference, which doesn't work when it's edited into a makefile.
	Expand that variable reference.

	* Makefile.in (CPP): New variable.
	(src/Makefile): Edit CPP into src/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in (src/Makefile): Don't bother exiting single quotes
	and entering double quotes to get the values of LD_SWITCH_X_SITE
	and the other make variables; make substitutes them in anyway.

	* Makefile.in (uninstall): Don't remove the lisp and etc
	directories if they're in the source tree.

        Bring mumbleclean targets into conformance with GNU coding standards.
	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean, clean): Separate these two; just have
	them pass the request to the subdirectory makefiles.
	(distclean): Pass the request down, and then get rid of the
	files configure built, and get rid of the Makefiles.
	(realclean): Pass the request down, and then do the same things
	distclean does.
	(uninstall, info, dvi): New targets.

	* configure.in: Move clause for PC-compatible i386 box to the end

	* Makefile.in (TAGS): cd to src to run etags.

Sat Jun 12 05:54:23 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Pass "-Isrc" to the CPP we run to examine the
	s/*.h and m/*.h files.  Martin Tomes
	<mt00@controls.eurotherm.co.uk> says ISC Unix 3.0.1 needs it.

	absolute.

	* configure.in: Include ${srcdir} in the printed report, to help
	people notice if it's an automounter path.

	* config.guess: New file.
	* configure.in: Use it, tentatively.
	* INSTNALL: Mention its usage.

	s/hpux.h if we don't recognize what we got.

	* Makefile.in (do-install): Don't remove a destination directory
	if it's the same as the source.  If ${srcdir}/info == ${infodir},
	don't try to copy the info files.

	* Makefile.in (COPYDIR, COPYDESTS): Don't mention etc twice; this
	doesn't work if you're not using a separate source directory.
	(do-install): Copy the build tree's etc directory only after
	making sure it's not also the source tree's etc directory.

Wed May 26 13:43:01 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Handle sunos4.1.3 specially.

Tue May 25 12:47:10 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (INSTALL): Add definition.

	* configure.in: Fix some messages.  Support -with-gnu-cc.
	At the end, use `set --', not `set -'.
	Delete spurious `.h' in hpux alternatives.

Tue May 25 05:15:14 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 19.8 released.

Tue May 25 00:55:45 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: When looking for source in the same directory as
	the configure script, make the path thus discovered absolute.
	If the user specifies the `--srcdir' switch, make that directory
	absolute too.

	* Makefile.in (srcdir): Remove comment saying this doesn't work.

	* Makefile.in (src/paths.h): Edit the `infodir' variable into this
	too, as the value of the PATH_INFO macro.

	* configure.in: Check to see if the source lives in the same
	directory as the configure script.

Mon May 24 12:14:41 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install): Split this into `install' and
	`do-install', to give people more control over exactly what gets
	done.
	(do-install): New target, containing the guts of `install'.  Don't
	remove and recreate the directories inside the copying loop - do
	it all before the copying loop.  Pass more flags to the lib-src
	make.
	(mkdir): Create ${infodir}, ${mandir}, and ${sitelispdir} here, to
	avoid errors and warnings.

	* configure.in: For generic IBM PC boxes, insist on "unknown" for
	the manufacturer - the more general case was blocking other i386
	configuration names below, and that's how the names are written in
	MACHINES anyway.

	* make-dist: When breaking links, remove the link before moving
	the copy onto it, to avoid interactive behavior.

	* Makefile.in: Doc fix.

	* configure.in: Doc fix.

	* INSTALL: Mention --exec-prefix option.

	* configure.in: Add support for the `--exec-prefix' option.
	* Makefile.in: Accept that support.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_PROG_INSTALL macro.
	* Makefile.in (INSTALL): Variable removed.
	(INSTALL_PROGRAM, INSTALL_DATA): Accept these values from configure.

	* configure.in: Distinguish between hp800's and hp700's by calling
	"uname -m".

Mon May 24 00:12:26 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

        * configure.in: Recognize configuration names for i860 boxes
	running SYSV.

Sun May 23 00:37:44 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Distinguish between hp800's and hp700's by the
	version of HP/UX they run, since that's something people are more
	likely to know - hp700's run 8.0.
	Add HP 700 configuration.

	* configure.in: Test for the presence of the `rename' function.

	* Makefile.in (C_SWITCH_X_SITE): New variable - get this from
	configure.in.
	(oldXMenu/Makefile): Edit C_SWITCH_X_SITE into this.

	* make-dist: Break intra-tree links.

	* configure.in: Explain that this is an autoconf script, and give
	instructions for rebuilding configure from it.  Arrange to put
	comments in configure explaining this too.

	* configure.in: Make the first line of the configure script be
	"#!/bin/sh".  Leaving the first line blank didn't work.

	* configure.in (long_usage): Removed; made short_usage describe
	the options briefly.

	* configure.in: Implement the --prefix option.
	* Makefile.in (prefix): Add support for it here.
	* INSTALL: Document it here.

	* Makefile.in (install): Don't assume that the files in the `info'
	subdirectory match  *.info.  They don't have that prefix.

Sat May 22 22:53:24 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Add case for version 5 of Esix.

Sat May 22 17:24:06 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

        * Version 19.7 released.

	* make-dist: There aren't any *.com files in lib-src anymore.

	* make-dist: Copy texinfo.tex and texindex.c, rather than linking
	them; they're symlinks to other filesystems on the GNU machines.

	* make-dist: Check that the manual reflects the same version of
	Emacs as stated in lisp/version.el.  Edit that version number into
	the README file.

Fri May 21 17:32:41 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Remove the hack of AC_DEFINE; use
	AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED.

Thu May 20 01:24:24 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't distribute precomp.com, compile.com, or
	link.com from ./src; they're in ./vms now.

	Some time-handling patches from Paul Eggert:
	* configure.in: Add AC_TIMEZONE.

Wed May 19 20:56:26 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	the i386.

Tue May 18 16:31:50 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Distribute some VMS files we got from Richard Levitte.

	* Makefile.in (oldXMenu/Makefile): Take oldXMenu/Makefile.in as
	the source for the sed command, not oldXMenu/Makefile.

Mon May 17 19:33:55 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* INSTALL: Don't claim the srcdir option doesn't work.

Sun May 16 18:41:27 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: Include remarks saying what order the autoconf
	tests should go in, and remind people to change config.h.in
	whenever they add autoconf tests which make #definitions.

	* make-dist: Distribute oldXMenu/Makefile.in, not oldXMenu/Makefile.

Sat May 15 16:47:50 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (oldXMenu/Makefile): Make this depend on
	${srcdir}/oldXMenu/Makefile.in, not itself.

	* PROBLEMS: Some updates from David J. Mackenzie.

	More changes from David J. Mackenzie.
	* Makefile.in (install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix): Targets
	removed; autoconf and config.h should specify all these
	differences.
	(buildlisppath): Make this path depend on ${srcdir}.
	(INSTALLFLAGS): Removed.
	(INSTALL): Include the -c flag.
	(install): Change the way we invoke install accordingly.

	Install ${srcdir} changes from DJM.
	* Makefile.in (SUBDIR_MAKEFILES): Add oldXMenu/Makefile to this
	list.
	(COPYDIR, COPYDESTS): Install files from both the etc directory in
	the source tree and the etc directory in the object tree.
	(${SUBDIR}): Pass the prefix variable down to submakes.
	(everywhere): Use `sed', not `/bin/sed'.  Not all systems have sed
	in /bin.
	(lib-src/Makefile, src/Makefile, oldXMenu/Makefile): Edit in
	values for srcdir and VPATH.
	(install): Add `v' flag to tar command.  Make sure that `dir'
	exists in ${srcdir}/info before copying it.  Remember that the man
	pages come from the source tree, not the object tree.
	* configure.in: Remove remarks saying that the --srcdir option
	doesn't work.
	Create the etc directory in the object tree.
	Recognize configuration names of the form *-sun-solaris*.
	Recognize sunos5 and solaris as operating system names.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME macro, for
	lib-src/getdate.y and src/systime.h.

Sat May 15 00:12:26 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Make links in info subdir.

Thu May 13 15:28:19 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: Call AC_STDC_HEADERS.

Mon May 10 15:19:03 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Sidestep autoconf's quoting of the second argument
	of AC_DEFINE, so we can specify the value to put there.  It would
	be nice if autoconf provided some way to specify computed values
	for macros.

Sun May  9 17:30:48 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (DEFS): Deleted; since we're using AC_CONFIG_HEADER,
	this is always just -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.

	The GNU coding standards specify that CFLAGS should be left for
	users to set.
	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure determine the default value
	for this.  Don't
	have it default to DEFS.
	(${SUBDIR}): Pass CFLAGS down to submakes, not DEFS.
	(lib-src/Makefile, src/Makefile): Edit the default value for
	CFLAGS into these files, not DEFS.
	* configure.in (CFLAGS): Choose a default value for this - "-g"
	normally, or "-g -O" if we're using GCC.  Edit it into the
	top-level Makefile.

	* configure.in: When scanning the machine and system description
	#include files, write their names to conftest.c properly.

Fri May  7 00:57:13 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: In configuration name case for Apallos running
	Domainios, set opsys, not opsysfile.

	* configure.in: Use the autoconf AC_CONFIG_HEADER macro to produce
	src/config.h, instead of AC_OUTPUT; the latter overwrites
	src/config.h even when it hasn't changed, puts a makefile-style
	comment at the top even though it's C code, and produces a
	config.status script which doesn't do the job right.

	* configure.in: Add AC_LN_S test, so we can tell whether or not we
	can use a symbolic link to get the X Menu library into src.
	* Makefile.in (LN_S): New variable.
	(src/Makefile): Edit the value of LN_S into this makefile.

Thu May  6 14:03:16 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Support *-sco3.2v4* as opsystem.

	* make-dist: Don't include calc directory.
	Exclude many files in the man directory; copy a few.

Tue May  4 10:15:32 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Use AC_HAVE_HEADERS to test for sys/time.h, and
	call AC_STRUCT_TM to see what's in time.h.

	* configure.in: Employ quoting stupidity to get the value of CPP
	to expand properly.

Tue Apr 27 13:00:28 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in: Use the AC_PROG_CPP macro, and then use the CPP
	variable to scan the machine and system description files.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_HAVE_HEADERS to check for sys/timeb.h,
	so that getdate.y builds correctly.

Mon Apr 26 19:11:45 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure.in (tempcname): Change this to "conftest.c", so it will
	work properly on systems with short filenames; this is the name
	autoconf uses.

	* configure.in: Also detect the availability of dup2 and
	gethostname.

	* configure.in: Use the AC_ALLOCA test.
	* Makefile.in (ALLOCA): New variable, to be set by ./configure.
	(lib-src/Makefile): Edit the value of ALLOCA into lib-src/Makefile.

Sat Apr 24 23:41:48 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Distribute configure, as well as configure.in.
	Oversight.

Fri Apr 23 17:32:12 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install): Print out the name of the directory we're
	copying, so people can have some idea of whether we're making
	progress.

	* Makefile.in (install.aix, install.xenix, install.sysv, install):
	Don't forget to re-create the COPYDESTS directories after we clear
	them out.

Tue Apr 13 00:58:01 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Add autoconf cookies so that the configure
	script can comment out sections of path variable definitions to
	choose between the installable configuration and the run-in-place
	configuration.
	* configure.in: Add new option `--run-in-place', to select the
	run-in-place path definitions.

	* configure.in: Add a clause to the big configuration name case
	for the NeXT machine.

Mon Apr 12 22:20:30 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install, install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix):
	Make sure that each source directory exists, and is different from
	the destination directory; then, delete the destination before
	copying over the source.

	* make-dist: Distribute configure.in, instead of configure.

Sat Apr 10 04:29:06 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Don't set CC to "gcc -O" if the user specifies
	`--with-gcc'.  Add -O to DEFS if GCC is set.

Fri Apr  9 07:20:40 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (clean mostlyclean): Missing right paren.

	* configure.in: When checking for X windows, search for an X11
	subdirectory of ${x_includes}.

	* configure.in: Check for gettimeofday function, for getdate.y.

        Change `configure' to a mixture of custom code and autoconf stuff.
	autoconf can't derive all the information we need, but we'd really
	like to be able to take advantage of some of its tests, and its
	file-editing facilities.
	* configure.in: Renamed from configure.
	Quote the sections of shell script we want copied literally to 
	the configure script.
	(compile): Initialize this to make the autoconf macros' code happy.
	Use AC_PROG_CC, AC_CONST, and AC_RETSIGTYPE instead of writing out
	code to do their jobs.
	Use autoconf to produce Makefile and src/config.h.
	Remove the Makefile-style comment that autoconf places at the top
	of src/config.h.
	(config_h_opts): Removed - no longer necessary.
	* Makefile.in (configname): Renamed to configuration.
	(CONFIG_CFLAGS): Renamed to DEFS.
	(CC, DEFS, C_SWITCH_SYSTEM, version, configuration): Adjusted to
	get values via autoload @cookies@.
	(libsrc_libs): Get this from autoconf.  We used to do nothing
	about this.
	(${SUBDIR}): Pass DEFS to submakes instead of CONFIG_CFLAGS.

	* Makefile.in (src/paths.h, lib-src/Makefile, src/Makefile): Don't
	echo the move-if-change command.

Thu Apr  8 05:29:14 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Distribute lib-src/rcs-checkin.

	* make-dist: It's oldXMenu/compile.com, not oldXMenu/compile.mms.
	Don't try to make links to the RCS or Old subdirectories.
	Use the appropriate extension for the compression type in use.
	Create the tar file in the shell's initial default directory, not
	in ${tempparent}.
	Erase the whole ${tempparent} tree, not just ${tempdir}.

Tue Mar 30 15:32:59 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (src/paths.h): Don't echo the huge sed command we
	use to build paths.h.
	(lib-src/Makefile, src/Makefile): Similarly.

	* configure: Extend test for working `const' keyword to handle AIX
	3.2 cc.

Wed Mar 24 20:12:05 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Distribute lisp/term/ChangeLog.

        Arrange for C compilation throughout the tree to get
	C_SWITCH_SYSTEM from the configuration files.

	system-dependent files, and save it in the top-level Makefile.
	* Makefile.in (C_SWITCH_SYSTEM): New flag for configure to edit.
	(lib-src/Makefile): Edit C_SWITCH_SYSTEM into lib-src/Makefile.

	* make-dist: Include the VMS support files in oldXMenu in the
	distribution.

Tue Mar 23 00:29:52 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure: Add special code to detect XFree386, and tell
	config.h about it.

	* configure: Properly handle extracting values of LIBS_MACHINE and
	LIBS_SYSTEM that contain spaces.

	* configure: Add `--x-includes' and `--x-libraries' options.  I
	think these are dopey, but no less than three alpha testers, at
	large sites, have said they have their X files installed in odd
	places.  Implement them by setting C_SWITCH_X_SITE and
	LD_SWITCH_X_SITE in src/config.h.

Mon Mar 22 14:57:04 1993  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't distribute etc/Old files.

	* GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE, PROBLEMS: Registered into RCS with their

	compress.

	* make-dist: Use gzip, if we can find it.

	* configure: Recognize strings like "sysvr0" or "sysvr1" as System V.

	* Makefile.in (install.sysv): Add a second `$' in front of
	`${dest}', so that the shell will expand it, instead of Make.

	* configure: When processing the name of the configure script,
	collapse `././' to `./', but leave a single `./' prefix alone.

	* configure: Doc fix.

Thu Mar  4 09:42:29 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure: Handle isc3.0 correctly.

Thu Feb 25 00:31:33 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't try to copy the COPYING notice into
	external-lisp; we're not distributing that directory any more.

Wed Feb 24 17:25:27 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install, install.aix, install.xenix, install.sysv):
	Remove CVS subdirectories from the installed directory trees, as
	well as RCS directories.

Tue Feb 23 06:54:11 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

Wed Feb 17 20:19:06 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't distribute the external-lisp directory anymore.  
	* INSTALL: Remove all references to external-lisp.

	properly, and edit src/config.h accordingly.

	* configure: Tweak layout of final report.

	* Makefile.in (${SUBDIR}): Pass CONFIG_CFLAGS to the submakes, not
	CFLAGS.

	* Makefile.in (locallisppath): Make this default to
	${datadir}/emacs/site-lisp, instead of
	${datadir}/emacs/local-lisp.  ${datadir} and ${statedir} are often
	the same thing, and local-lisp causes completion conflicts with
	lock.
	(lisppath): Add ${externallispdir} to this.
	* INSTALL: Adjust installation directions.

	* Makefile.in (externallispdir): New variable, to say where to
	install the externally-maintained lisp files.
	(COPYDIR, COPYDESTS): Copy the external lisp directory just like
	the others.
	* INSTALL: Describe external-lisp and the new externallispdir
	variable.

Sun Feb 14 08:47:04 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (COPYDIR, COPYDESTS): Remove ${srcdir}/info and
	${infodir} from these variables; we have written out explicit code
	to install the info files.

Mon Jan 25 23:27:53 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't distributed the RCS files in the etc directory.

Sun Jan 24 20:48:02 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Make sure that the COPYING notices in each directory
	are copies, not symlinks.

Sat Dec 19 06:46:05 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* INSTALL: The build process produces an executable called `emacs'
	now.  Change references.
	* Makefile.in: Adjust `install.mumble' targets to install
	`src/emacs', not `src/xemacs'.

	* configure: Start with a blank line; this keeps some old CSH's
	from thinking it's a CSH script.  Most systems will just use
	/bin/sh to run it, which is what we're expecting; the only other
	shells which might try to interpret it themselves are probably
	Bourne-compatible.

Mon Dec 14 07:09:36 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* INSTALL: Improvements suggested by David Mackenzie.

Sat Dec 12 00:31:46 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (install, install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix):
	Don't try to copy the info files if there aren't any; the
	unexpanded globbing pattern disappoints `install'.  Ignore the
	return status of that command.

	* INSTALL: Updated for new configuration arrangement.

	* configure: Don't make the top-level Makefile read-only - people
	may want to edit the values of the path variables.

	* Makefile.in (install, install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix):
	Install the info files in ${infodir}.  Install the executable
	under both `emacs' and `emacs-VERSION'.

	* Makefile.in: Doc fix.

	* Makefile.in (exec_prefix): New variable, as per latest version
	of coding standards.
	(bindir, libdir): Use it, instead of `prefix'.
	(lib-src/Makefile): Edit value of exec_prefix into lib-src/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in (mandir): Make the default value for this depend on
	$(prefix).

	* Makefile.in (datadir, statedir, libdir): Make these all default
	to ${prefix}/lib.
	(lispdir, locallisppath, etcdir, lockdir, archlibdir): Adjusted
	to compensate.

	* Makefile.in (install, install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix):
	Install the etags and ctags man pages too.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't delete backup files; that's the
	job of extraclean.
	(extraclean): Like distclean, but deletes backup and autosave files.

Thu Dec 10 21:10:40 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	Make path specification conform to GNU coding standards.
	* configure (long_usage): Remove all traces of old arguments from
	usage messages, and document the options we do accept in more
	detail: -with-x... and --srcdir.
	(options, boolean_opts): Deleted; we don't have enough options to
	make this worthwhile.
	(prefix, bindir, lisppath, datadir, libdir, lockdir): Deleted,
	along with the code which supported them; these should be set as
	arguments to the top-level make.
	(config_h_opts): Since this no longer doubles as a list of option
	names, make them upper case; this simplifies the code which uses
	them to build the sed command to edit src/config.h.  Change the
	code which sets them.
	(cc, g, O): Don't allow the user to set these using options; they
	should be specified using `CC=' and `CFLAGS=' arguments to the
	top-level make.  Just choose reasonable default values for them,
	and edit them into Makefile.in's default CC and CONFIG_CFLAGS
	values.
	(gnu_malloc, rel_alloc): Don't allow the user to set these using
	options; use them whenever the configuration files say they're
	possible.
	Simplify the argument processing loop.  Don't accept abbreviations
	for option names; these might conflict with other configuration
	options in the future.
	Add some support for the `--srcdir' option.  Check for the sources
	in . and .. if `--srcdir' is omitted.  If the directories we will
	compile in don't exist yet, create them under the current directory.
	Note that the rest of the build process doesn't really support
	this.
	Edit only the top Makefile.  That should edit the others.  Edit
	into the makefile: `version', from lisp/version.el, `configname'
	and `srcdir' from the configuration arguments, `CC' and
	`CONFIG_CFLAGS' as guessed from the presence or absence of GCC in
	the user's path, and LOADLIBES as gleaned from the system
	description files.
	Simplify the report generated; it doesn't need to include any
	description of paths now.
	Make `config.status' exec configure instead of just calling it, so
	there's no harm in overwriting `config.status'.
	* Makefile.in (version, configname): New variables, used to choose
	the default values for datadir and libdir.
	Path variables rearranged into two clearer groups:
	- In the first group are the variables specified by the GNU coding
	  standards (prefix, bindir, datadir, statedir, libdir, mandir,
	  manext, infodir, and srcdir).
	- In the second are the variables actually used for Emacs's paths
	  (lispdir, locallisppath, lisppath, buildlisppath, etcdir, lockdir,
	  archlibdir), which depend on the first category.
	datadir and libdir default to directories under
	${prefix}/lib/emacs instead of ${prefix}/emacs, by popular
	demand.
	etcdir and lispdir default to subdirectories of datadir.
	archlibdir defaults to libdir.
	The new installation tree is a bit deeper than it used to be, so
	use the new make-path program in lib-src to build them all.
	Always build a new src/paths.h.tmp and then move-if-change it to
	src/paths.h, to avoid unnecessary rebuilds while responding to the
	right changes.
	Remove all mention of arch-lib.  Run utility commands from
	lib-src, and let the executables be copied into archlibdir when
	Emacs is installed.
	Add targets for src/Makefile, lib-src/Makefile, and
	oldXMenu/Makefile, editing the values of the path variables into
	them.
	Let lib-src do its own installation.
	(datadir): Default to putting data files under
	${prefix}/lib/emacs/${version}, not /usr/local/emacs.
	(emacsdir): Variable deleted; it would only be confusing to use.
	(lispdir, etcdir): Default to ${datadir}/lisp.
	(mkdir): Use make-path for this.
	(lockdir): Do this in mkdir.
	(Makefile): New target.

	* configure (usage_message): Rename to long_usage.

	* make-dist: Don't bother creating an arch-lib directory; that's
	only for installation now.

Fri Nov 20 06:15:14 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Use GCC-style configuration names, using config.sub.
	Change the usage and help messages.

	* configure: Initialize window_system, not indow_system.

	* configure: Report which window system, compiler, and signal
	handler return type we decide to use.

	* make-dist: Explain what's going on if config.sub and gmalloc.c
	can't be linked.  Place the code which copies them near the code
	which links the rest of the files around them.

Sun Nov 15 20:59:55 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@apple-gunkies.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't bother to distribute src/*.com, or
	src/vmsbuild; those have all been moved to `../vms'.

Sat Nov  7 15:11:39 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't forget that the way to avoid filenames starting
	with `=' is to use the pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9]*.h', not
	`[a-zA-Z0-9].h'.  Add a new section for dealing with files that we
	couldn't make hard links to, since we have two already, and
	perhaps more to come.

Wed Nov  4 15:09:07 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: When editing parameters into lib-src/Makefile, change
	the definition of CONFIG_CFLAGS instead of CFLAGS itself; CFLAGS
	needs some other flags too.

Tue Nov  3 05:42:55 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Remove spurious echo of the configuration name.

	* make-dist: Don't distribute files in src/m and src/s whose names
	begin with `='.

Tue Oct 27 04:06:30 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure: Update GNU_MALLOC and REL_ALLOC in config.h.
	Also LISP_FLOAT_TYPE.

Mon Oct 26 19:55:01 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Copy config.sub, since it's a symbolic link to a file
	on another file system.

Sat Oct 17 17:04:24 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Include lib-src/makedoc.com and emacs.csh in the
	distribution.

	* config.sub: New file, to help us recognize configuration names.
	* make-dist: Include it in the distribution.

Mon Sep 14 17:43:50 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure: Convert `-' to `_' in specified option names.
	Accept options with --.  Delete --highpri and --have-x-menu options.
	New options --with-x and --with-x10 replace -window-system.
	Don't mention options --gnu-malloc, --rel-alloc
	or --lisp-float-type in help message.

Sun Sep 13 06:30:52 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

        * make-dist: Include the `vms' subdirectory in the distribution.

Thu Sep 10 16:14:21 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Remove lines starting with "# DIST: " when building
	lib-src/Makefile and src/Makefile.  This allows us to mark the
	"Makefile.in" files with explanatory comments which won't also get
	stuck in the Makefiles.

Sat Sep  5 07:10:43 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Don't use the '+' operator in the sed regular
	expression that extracts the version number from lisp/version.el;
	Ultrix sed doesn't seem support the operator.  Just double the
	operand and use *.

Tue Sep  1 15:56:14 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Doc fix.

Mon Aug 31 00:25:44 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Rewrite sed command to remove at most one ./ prefix;
	Ultrix's sed doesn't allow us to apply the * operator to a \( \)
	group.

Tue Aug 25 18:57:41 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (src/paths.h): Use sed, not /bin/sed.

Tue Aug 18 16:02:22 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Go ahead and build a new TAGS file, unless the
	--newer option was specified.  Don't try to delete a TAGS file
	from etc; it's not kept there, and shouldn't be deleted anyway.

Fri Aug 14 12:54:25 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: If the lisp directory contains a default.el, don't
	distribute it.

	* configure: When searching signal.h for the type of a signal
	return handler, make a copy of it, not a symbolic link to it; that
	way, it will work on systems that don't have symbolic links.

Fri Aug 14 12:31:45 1992  Eric S. Raymond  (eric@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: taught it about vcdiff and rcs2log, added --newer
	option for generating incremental distributions.  Stopped it from
	generating a TAGS file into the distribution; that sucker is
	*big*, and easily enough generated with the toplevel makefile.

Thu Aug 13 13:02:31 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: When writing config.status, don't prefix progname 
	with a '.'; it might be absolute.

Wed Aug  5 13:54:39 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Choose to use X11 if either /usr/lib/libX11.a or
	/usr/include/X11 exist, not only if both exist.

Mon Jul 27 17:41:50 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Make the new external-lisp directory a duplicate of
	the external-lisp directory, not the lisp directory.

Tue Jul  7 14:47:31 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in (clean, mostlyclean): Don't bother trying to `make
	clean' in arch-lib; it doesn't even have a Makefile.	

	* Makefile.in (clean, mostlyclean): In the test which tries to
	distinguish between the build directory, which should be cleaned,
	and the installed directory, which shouldn't, cd to `${emacsdir}',
	not `${DESTDIR}${LIBDIR}'.

Tue Jun 30 05:05:29 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Be sure to delete the .c and .h files that YACC and
	BISON create from getdate.y.

        * external-lisp: New directory; see `external-lisp/README'.
	* make-dist: Added support for the external-lisp subdirectory.

	* make-dist: Changed message which complains that make-dist wasn't
	invoked in the right directory to indicate which files it was
	looking for.

Mon Jun 29 16:24:41 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Add comments explaining why we can't translate
	character ranges or control characters in `tr'.

Wed Jun 24 00:18:54 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: When generating the configuration message, we used to
	build the message from the start so that each line began with "# "
	so that it would be a comment in `config.status'.  However, this
	causes trouble if any of the variables we use in the message
	expand to more than one line of text - as gnu_malloc_reason
	sometimes does.  So instead, we build the message as it should be
	printed to the user (i.e. without the "# " prefixes), and stick on
	the "# "s when we write it to `config.status'.

	* Makefile.in (clean, mostlyclean): Don't neglect to clean out
	`lib-src' and `arch-lib'.

	* configure: When generating report and `config.status' file, note
	that bindir only determines where `make install' and
	`build-install' will place the executables; this should make it
	clear that the ordinary build process will not try to install
	things.

Wed Jun 10 19:20:27 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-dist: Change messages to say that we are 'making links to
	X', rather than 'copying X'.  And put `' quotes around file names.

	* make-dist: Include '.tmp' in the name of the staging directory.

	* make-dist: Pass the `-f' option to rm when you're not sure that
	the files you're removing actually exist.

	* make-dist: When setting up etc/COPYING, always nuke whatever is
	there, and then copy it in, to make sure we get a real file.

	* make-dist: Don't try to distribute *.defns files any more.  The
	only such file was for simula.el, which has been superceded by a
	version which doesn't have a separate .defns file.

Thu May 28 09:51:46 1992  Ken Raeburn  (Raeburn@Cygnus.COM)
	
	* make-dist: Don't distribute configured versions of config.h.in,
	paths.h.in, Makefile.in in src.
		
	* configure: Delete .tmp files before creating them; don't bother
	trying to make final targets writeable first, since it won't
	matter to move-if-change.

Tue May 19 18:33:04 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (mkdir, lockdir): Don't put dashes in front of the
	mkdir and chmod in the center of all the conditionals.  GNU Make
	will strip these out, but other makes won't.

Mon May 18 03:14:40 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Include move-if-change in list of files to distribute.

Mon May  4 20:46:16 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Remove any "." elements from the program name.

	* configure: Don't record the values of all the possible arguments
	in config.status; only record the options that the user specified.

	* configure: Use move-if-change to move in the new src/config.h.

Wed Apr 29 23:13:25 1992  Ken Raeburn  (Raeburn@Cygnus.COM)

        * move-if-change: New file, copied from gcc release.
        * Makefile.in (src/paths.h): Use it, and put the "sed" output into
        a temp file, so we don't update paths.h if an error occurs or if
        it doesn't need changing.

Tue Apr 28 17:00:07 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (src/paths.h): Do not install a value for the
	PATH_SUPERLOCK value; that macro doesn't exist anymore.
	* build-install.in: Same thing.

Fri Apr 24 02:10:56 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: Check the flag called "make_tar", not "make_dir"; the
	latter, being a typo, is always false, resulting in a program
	whose default behaviour is to painstakingly build a copy of the
	source tree, and then delete it.  Rah.

	* Makefile.in: Add dist target, and comment for it.

	* configure: When scanning <signal.h> for a declaration for
	signal, create a symbolic link with a name ending in .c, so the
	compiler won't complain that it's only been given .h files.

	* configure: Check whether there are any arguments available
	before shifting to get the value of a non-boolean parameter.

	* make-dist: Doc fix.

Mon Apr 20 09:54:48 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Instead of grepping /usr/include/signal.h for a
	signal declaration, run /usr/include/signal.h or
	/usr/include/sys/signal.h through cpp and grep for the
	declaration.

	* configure: Redirect the output of grep to /dev/null instead of
	using grep -s - that flag means different things on other systems.

	* Makefile.in: Use 'buildlisppath' instead of 'dumplisppath',
	since the former is recognizable even if you don't know what
	'dumping' is.
	* configure: Accomodate that change.

	* configure: Accept options for all of the directories you can
	change in the Makefile.

	* configure: Accept "-OPTION VALUE" as well as "-OPTION=VALUE". 

	* INSTALL: Mention that you have to copy all the 'FOO.in' files to
	FOO before you can use them.

	* build-install.in: Made the "Where To Install Things" section
	conform with the similar section from Makefile.in.  Copied section
	which builds src/paths.h from src/paths.h.in from the Makefile.

Sun Apr 19 05:29:03 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Write config.status to pass its command-line
	arguments on to configure, so that people can use it to recreate
	an old configuration, with minor changes.

Thu Apr 16 22:49:13 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Don't rely on option variables being unset if their
	values are the empty string.  In particular, when producing the
	English report, don't assume that highpri will be unset when no
	increased priority has been requested; -highpri='' should be the
	same as omitting -highpri altogether.

	* configure: Fix dumb bug: when running the system and machine
	description files through cpp, mark those lines that we want to
	evaluate with the string '@configure@', and then only evaluate
	them.  This way if the files include anything that actually
	generates text (type definitions or external declarations, say),
	we won't try to eval it.

Sat Apr 11 16:00:52 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-dist: New shell script.

	* configure: When creating foo from foo.in, make foo read-only to
	remind people to edit the .in file instead.

	* INSTALL: Changed references to config.h-dist to config.h.in.
	The "BUILDING GNU EMACS BY HAND" section neglected to mention how
	to build src/paths.h from src/paths.h.in; added a paragraph to do
	this.
	* configure, Makefile, build-install: Changed filenames like
	FOO-dist to FOO.in.

Wed Apr  8 00:58:46 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile, build-install: Renamed to Makefile.in and
	build-install.in; the configure script will edit these to produce 
	the usable Makefile and build-install.
	* configure: Changed to produce ./Makefile, ./build-install,
	lib-src/Makefile, and src/Makefile from their *.in counterparts,
	instead of editing them in place.

Tue Apr  7 16:44:54 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile: Re-arranged so that the undumped Emacs will search
	../lisp *after* the site's local elisp files.
	(locallisppath, dumplisppath): New variables.
	(lisppath): This variable's default value is now chosen based on
	$(locallisppath) and $(lispdir); while it used to be the
	customization point for adding site-local elisp directories to
	load-path, that job is now handled mostly by locallisppath.
	(src/paths.h): Edit the value of a new macro, PATH_DUMPLOADSEARCH.
	Check the values being assigned to the *LOADSEARCH macros for null
	path elements (like '::' in 'foo::bar').

	* configure: When checking if the machine- and system-dependent
	files define a particular macro or not, actually run them through
	CPP and test the macros with #ifs, instead of just grepping for
	the macros' names.  In particular, check for SYSTEM_MALLOC in this
	way.

Fri Apr  3 22:25:50 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile (install): Don't use -s in install.  (Keep the symbols.)

Thu Apr  2 01:54:22 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* configure: Make the config.status file an executable shell
	script which will recreate the same configuration.  Include the
	verbal description of the current configuration as a comment in
	the script.
	* INSTALL: Doc fix.

	* Makefile: brought the Makefile up to the GNU coding 
	standards, as described in standards.text:
	(TAGS): New name for the target which rebuilds the tags table.
	(check): New target; doesn't do anything yet.
	(mostlyclean): New target, synonymous with clean.
	(realclean): New target.  Currently, this just calls the
	subdirectories's makefiles and then deletes config.status.
	(INSTALL, INSTALLFLAGS, INSTALL_PROGRAM, INSTALL_DATA): New
	variables.
	Installation directory variables changed to conform.
	(install, install.sysv, install.xenix, install.aix): Changed the
	code which copies the directories into their installed location to
	allow the installed locations to be in several different
	directories; the old version assumed that they would all be in
	$(emacsdir).
	(mkdir, lockdir): Allow the installed locations to be in several
	different directories.
	* INSTALL: Doc fix.

	* build-install: Use the same variable names as the Makefile.
	Allow the installed locations to be in several different
	directories.

Tue Mar 31 10:25:57 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile (src/paths.h): Instead of using a single sed command to
	edit both the PATH_LOCK and PATH_SUPERLOCK macros, edit the two
	separately, and don't forget to append "/!!!SuperLock!!!" to the
	value of the PATH_SUPERLOCK macro.

	* config.emacs: Renamed to configure, for consistency with other
	GNU products.  Internal references changed.
	INSTALL, Makefile: References changed.

	* lock: New directory, which should always be empty.  If this
	directory doesn't exist, Emacs won't complain; it just won't lock.
	Having this here means that people can just unpack Emacs, build
	it, and have locking work.

	* share-lib: Re-renamed to etc, for the sake of tradition.
	* config.emacs: Changed default value for datadir to ../etc.
	* INSTALL, README: Adjusted.	

Wed Mar 18 15:54:58 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* config.emacs: Guess the value for LOADLIBES in lib-src/Makefile
	by running CPP on the appropriate s/*.h and m/*.h files.

Mon Mar 16 17:38:50 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* config.emacs: Make sure to set the "exit on error" flag once
	we've removed config.status; errors should abort the configuration.

Sat Feb 15 17:23:07 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb at pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* config.emacs: Added -distribute option, so that the Makefile
	paths are in their proper form.  I don't know why this matters.

Fri Feb 14 13:58:57 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb at pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* local-lisp: New directory, empty in the distribution, for people
	to put local elisp code in.
	* config.emacs: Include it in the default load path.

	* config.emacs: Guess the type of signal handling functions based
	on the contents of /usr/include/signal.h.

	* config.emacs: Print out progress report messages.
	
	* Makefile (src/paths.h): Don't generically replace
	/usr/local/lib/emacs with LIBROOT.  This can hide bugs in the
	editing of the other entries, and each entry should be dealt with
	explicitly anyway.

	* build-install: Converted from C-shell to Bourne shell.
	* config.emacs: Edit build-install properly.

	* config.emacs: Doc fix.

Mon Jan 13 12:00:14 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb at pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* config.emacs: Removed support for the `maintain-environment'
	option; the only important difference between this and its absence
	has been removed.
	* INSTALL: Removed mention of `maintain-environment'.

	* config.emacs: Fix arguments to sed when processing boolean
	arguments.

	* config.emacs: New file, to help automate the installation
        process.

	* Makefile: Lots of changes to support the separation of etc into
	architecture-dependent and -independent files:
	(EMACSROOT): New variable, giving the directory under which all of
	Emacs's libraries should be installed.  Changed rest of file to
	use it. 
	(LIBDIR): Now denotes only architecture-dependent dir - relevant cha
	(DATADIR): New variable, denoting architecture-independent dir.
	(LOCKDIR): New variable, for completeness.
	(SUBDIR): No more etc, new lib-src.
	(COPYDIR): No more etc, new arch-lib and share-lib.
	(src/paths.h): Set PATH_DATA and the LOCK macros too.
	(src): Now depends on lib-src, not etc.
	* build-install: Changes parallel to the above.
	* README: Describe the new arrangement.
	
	* vms: New subdirectory for all the VMS stuff.

Wed Aug  3 19:20:13 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile (lockdir): Rename `lock' target.

Mon May 16 02:08:08 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: Changed LIBDIR and BINDIR back to /usr/local/{emacs,bin}
