	Unfortunately this requires putting a carriage return in the
	source code.  Don't assume that rlog will tolerate times like
	`10:10:60'; RCS 5.7 won't allow this.

Wed Mar 10 20:03:09 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (main): Set the ownership of the stdin file descriptor
	to the current process.  Print error messages if either of the
	fcntl's fails.

	* timer.c (sigcatch): Declare this to return SIGTYPE (defined in
	../src/config.h), not void.

Sat Mar  6 16:17:47 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* b2m.c (main): Don't exit upon reading a blank line.

Mon Mar  1 19:06:26 1993  Francesco Potorti`  (pot@fly.CNUCE.CNR.IT)

	* etags.c (C_entries): New local variable quotednl.  Used for
	parsing of #define's spanning multiple lines.

	* etags.c (C_entries): Save the definedef status
	even when a newline is met inside a string.

Fri Feb 26 06:10:58 1993  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (notify): Initialize waitfor properly.

Mon Feb 22 12:48:14 MET 1993  Francesco Potorti`  (pot@CNUCE.CNR.IT)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Don't reset definedef when a newline inside a
	comment is met.

Thu Jan 14 14:57:00 1993  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (find_entries): If filename ends in .f or .for,
	don't try anything but Fortran.

Fri Jan  8 15:27:42 1993  Michael I Bushnell  (mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* timer.c (notify): Flush stdout after writing message to avoid lossage
	on terminals.

	(notify): Also, write a newline after the token.

Sat Dec 12 01:00:29 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (exec_prefix): New variable.
	(bindir, libdir): Use it instead of `prefix'.

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): #define HAVE_CONFIG_H, too.

	* Makefile.in (libdir): Default to ${prefix}/lib.
	(archlibdir): Adjusted to match.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't delete backup or autosave files.
	(extraclean): Like realclean, but does delete backup and autosave
	files.

	* Makefile.in (realclean): Ignore errors from rm.

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Don't bother to delete ../arch-lib;
	that doesn't exist anymore.

Fri Dec 11 00:51:13 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (prefix, bindir, libdir, srcdir): New variables, as
	described in the top-level Makefile.
	(UTILITIES): Add make-path to the list of utility programs.
	(../arch-lib): Replaced by the ${archlibdir} target, which places
	the executables in their permanent home.
	(install, install.sysv, install.xenix): Consolidated into one
	target which should work under all circumstances, modulo a few
	ignored error messages.

	* make-docfile.c (scan_c_file): Since DEFVAR_PER_BUFFER now takes
	a different number of arguments than other DEFVARs, recognize it
	specially, and expect the right number of commas.

Fri Dec  4 15:05:36 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-path.c: New program, to help with the installation process.
	* Makefile.in (make-path): New target.

	* make-path.c (touchy_mkdir): Remove debugging output.

Thu Nov  5 23:35:53 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (getdate.o): Added explicit target for this, so we
	can indicate that it depends on ../src/config.h.

Wed Nov  4 15:10:28 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@totoro.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in (CONFIG_CFLAGS): Let the configure script edit this
	instead of CFLAGS.
	(CFLAGS): Add -Demacs and -I../src to CONFIG_CFLAGS to produce this.

Wed Sep 30 17:42:19 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* getdate.y: Correctly recognize Mt. Xinu BSD running on an HP
	9000/300 as BSD; don't include both <sys/time.h> and <time.h> on
	that system.

	* Makefile.in (arch-lib): Give rm the `-f' option.

Mon Sep 28 23:40:10 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Rewritten to correctly print
	&optionals before the first identifier, but after the first paren.
	This code used to just wait for commas or spaces; now it notices
	identifier boundaries.

Sat Sep 26 21:56:46 1992  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* rcs2log: When getting date, use %02d instead of %.2d in awk printf.

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Print the argument lists properly
	when the first argument is optional.

Sat Sep 19 20:41:45 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sorted-doc.c (main): Redefine special chars to use fonts tensy, teni.
	Redefine @item.  Set catcode of +.

Sat Aug 22 03:09:48 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* emacsclient.c (main): Set IPC_CREAT in msgget call.

Thu Aug 20 01:09:32 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (TEX_funcs): Keep just 1 of two redundant nested loops.
	(TEX_decode_env): Make `tab' one element longer.

Thu Aug 20 17:24:46 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (PF_funcs): Recognize the "entry" keyword.

Tue Aug 18 20:30:56 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Add rcs2log and vcdiff to the list of utilities.

Fri Aug 14 13:06:07 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (events): Rather than having slots marked as in use or
	out of use by the `token' field, keep all pending events at the
	beginning of the array.  When we delete an event in the middle of
	the array, we move the last event into its place.
	(num_events): New variable.
	(schedule): It is now cheaper to find a free event slot;
	events[num_events] is the first free slot.
	(notify): Scan events[0 .. num_events-1], instead of the whole
	array.  When an event fires, move the last event in the array into
	its spot.  Use num_events to determine whether or not there are
	any pending events, not wait_for.
	(getevent): Deleted unused variable `ep'.
	(sigcatch): It's now easier to find all the active events.
	(main): Initialize num_events.

	* etags.c: Rather than fret about which systems have index and
	which systems have strchr, and how to tell the difference between
	them, we just write out our own versions.  Big deal.
	(index, rindex): Extern declarations removed.
	(NEED_INDEX, NEED_RINDEX): Special hacks for hpux removed.
	(etags_index, etags_rindex): New declarations.
	(process_file, find_entries, pfnote, TEX_funcs, TEX_decode_env,
	TEX_getit, substr): Use the etags_*index functions, rather than
	the native *index functions.
	(rindex, index): Renamed to etags_rindex and tags_rindex, and
	made them unconditionally defined, rather than having them depend
	on NEED_*INDEX.

	* etags.c (savenstr): Add declaration for this at top of file.
	(TEX_decode_env): Don't declare it local to this function.

	* b2m.c: #include "../src/config.h", so we can test for the USG
	macro, and decide whether to include <string.h> or <strings.h>.
	* Makefile.in: Note that b2m.c depends on ../src/config.h.

Thu Aug 13 14:17:49 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c: Reformatted according to the GNU coding standards.
	Removed arbitrary limits on the number of events queued and the
	length of the tokens used to identify them.
	Removed casts to (void).
	Removed debugging printfs; they clutter the code, and the need
	can be better filled using a real debugger.

Fri Aug  7 19:41:40 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c: Installed new version from Eric Raymond; this is more
	portable, since it doesn't try to use SIGIO.

Fri Jul 17 17:04:40 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* emacsclient.c (main): If we can't find the socket in this
	person's home directory, print a message which asks if they've
	started the server, instead of just printing the message from
	sys_errmsg; Cygnus finds that people are much less confused by
	this.

Tue Jul 14 16:55:56 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c: Rather than defining "notdef" when "hpux" is #defined,
	so that index and rindex get defined, why don't we actually
	control index and rindex using symbols called "NEED_INDEX" and
	"NEED_RINDEX", and define them if hpux is defined?  Isn't that a
	little more readable than defining something whose name implies
	that it's not?

Wed Jul  8 17:57:18 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* movemail.c: Merged changes from Jamie Zawinski's byte compiler
	distribution:
	Miscellaneous doc fixes.
	(skip_white, read_lisp_symbol): New functions.	
	(scan_lisp_file): Instead of using long hairy strings of ifs, call
	read_lisp_symbol and then see what we got.  Call skip_white
	instead of writing out a loop to do its job.  Correctly extract
	docstrings from "defmacro" declarations.

Thu Jun 25 21:36:08 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* movemail.c (strcpy): Declare this to return char *.

Thu Jun 18 18:52:36 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): When we find a C++ comment, do actually
	skip to the end of the line; do a 'break' instead of a 'continue'.

Thu Jun 11 16:19:48 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (getit): Add missing parenthesis to expression which
	decides if this token is an identifier.

Thu Jun  4 21:14:43 1992  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (consider_token): Recognize `ENTRY' macro used in libc.

Sat May 30 15:30:54 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (put_entries): Always put space between name and line num.

Thu May 28 09:58:53 1992  Ken Raeburn  (Raeburn@Cygnus.COM)

	* etags.c (getit): Parenthesize &&/|| expression to avoid gcc
	warning.
	(LEVEL_OK_FOR_FUNCDEF): Ditto.

Tue May 19 01:22:58 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Pass both arguments to putc.

Sun May 10 14:14:56 1992  Roland McGrath  (roland@albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Fixed reading of "..." strings.
	(consider_token): Recognize `SYSCALL' and `PSEUDO' macros, used in
	the C library source.

	* etags.c (C_entries): When we see a backslash inside a quoted
	string, skip to the next character.  This allows us to correctly
	deal with strings containing quotes.

Fri May  8 00:34:26 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* make-docfile.c (write_c_args): Print the C argument names as
	they would be written in Elisp; print '_' as '-'.

Thu May  7 16:11:26 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* movemail.c [POP]: Get user name via getpwuid.

Mon May  4 20:34:51 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile.in: flags in CC invocations rearranged for no reason.

Mon Apr 20 16:33:51 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (print_help): Remember not to imbed raw newlines in
	strings - end the lines with `\n\'.

Fri Apr 17 06:04:25 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* timer.c (getevent): Removed declaration of memcpy; since
	different systems have different return types, and we're not even
	using the return type anyway, it wasn't doing us any good.

Thu Apr 16 23:48:03 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* emacsserver.c (msgcatch): Use the SIGTYPE macro to declare the
	type of this function.

Tue Apr 14 17:59:46 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* ChangeLog: Since the old etc contents have been split into etc
	and lib-src, the old etc's ChangeLog has been duplicated in the
	new etc and lib-src.  That means that each contains complete and
	coherent information, although each contains extraneous
	information.	 

Wed Apr  8 00:54:55 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* lib-src/etags.c: "--no-warning" option renamed to "--no-warn",
	to be consistent with other GNU programs, like makeinfo.

	* lib-src/Makefile: Renamed to Makefile.in; the configure script
	will edit this to produce Makefile.

Tue Apr  7 02:39:25 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (print_help, print_version): New functions.
	(main): Options added to support them.

	* etags.c (longopts): New array of long names for the options.
	(main): Recognize them.

Mon Apr  6 22:29:38 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Removed comment saying that \" in a string
	isn't recognized as magic, because it is correctly handled.

	* getopt.c, getopt.h: New files, from GNU C library.
	* etags.c: Rewritten to use getopt.
	#include "getopt.h".
	(file_num): Variable deleted; its role is now played by getopt's
	optind.
	(main): Argument processing loop rewritten to call getopt to get
	next option.  Options which take parameters (-o and -i) rewritten
	to get parameter from optarg instead of argv[1].  Filename
	preprocessing loop and update command changed similarly.
	* Makefile (etags, ctags): Depend on and link with getopt.h,
	getopt.o, and getopt1.o.
	(getopt.o, getopt1.o): New targets for the GNU getopt routines.

	* etags.c (outfflag): Variable deleted; it is non-zero iff outfile
	is non-zero.

	(main): In the argument processing loop, the 'goto next_arg'
	statements are breaking out of the switch statement in exactly the
	same way that a simple 'break' statement would; replace the gotos
	with breaks, and remove the label.

Mon Apr  6 17:29:21 1992  Richard Stallman  (rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Clear tydef and next_token_is_func at start.
	(consider_token): Move next_token_is_func to global.

Thu Apr  2 02:03:48 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile: Conform with GNU coding standards:
	(mostlyclean): New target, synonymous with clean.
	(TAGS, check): New targets.
	(INSTALL, INSTALLFLAGS): New variables.

Tue Mar 31 10:30:56 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

    	* lib-src/Makefile, etc/MACHINES, etc/NEWS: Changed references to
	`config.emacs' to `configure'.

	* lib-src/Makefile: Adjusted for renaming of share-lib to etc.
	* etc/MACHINES: Same.

Mon Mar 30 21:34:42 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb@pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* movemail.c (main): Allow tempname to be as long as necessary,
	instead of limiting it to 39 characters.

	* movemail.c (main): Move declaration of buf from top of function
	to local block surrounding the copy loop.  This makes it less
	likely to be confused with the buf used by the code which checks the
	permissions on outname's directory.

Fri Mar 20 08:58:40 1992  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* SERVICE: Remove my entry.

	hardcoded -g.

	* movemail.c (xmalloc): Return char *, not int.
	(main) [!MAIL_USE_FLOCK]: Add a new conditional, MAIL_UNLINK_SPOOL,
	that is off by default -- normally don't unlink the mail spool
	file, just empty it.  Pass creat mode 0600, not 0666.

Fri Feb  7 16:28:01 1992  Jim Blandy  (jimb at pogo.cs.oberlin.edu)

	* Makefile (../arch-lib): Depend on ${EXECUTABLES}.
	(all): Instead of here.
	(install): Don't use the -s option, since people need symbols to
	debug code.

Sun Jan 19 11:29:00 1992    (Eric Youngdale at youngdale@v6550c.nrl.navy.mil)

	* etags-vmslib.c (fn_exp): Add type cast.

	* emacsserver.c, emacsclient.c [BSD]: Use either /tmp or ~
	for the socket, depending on SERVER_HOME_DIR.
	If using /tmp, put host name in the socket name.

	* movemail.c (pfatal_and_delete): New function.
	(main, popmail): Use it.
	(popmail): Close output before deleting messages.
	Check for error on close and on fsync.
	Use `fatal' where appropriate.
	(main): Remove (void).

	* aixcc.lex: New file.  Not officially part of Emacs.
	* Makefile: Rules for that.

Wed Dec  4 15:16:22 1991  Jim Blandy  (jimb at pogo.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* yow.c (main): Rename all references to PATH_EXEC to PATH_DATA.

	* etags.c (main): Properly cast call to alloca that initializes
	included_files.

Sat Aug 17 21:33:34 1991  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (files_are_tag_tables): Remove global var.
	(process_file): Don't test it.  Also remove hack checking for a
	file named "TAGS".
	(main): -i now takes an arg which is the name of a file to include.
	Collect these names and emit include tags for them after processing
	all the argument files.

Tue Jul 30 17:03:41 1991  Richard Stallman  (rms at mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* wakeup.c: Terminate if parent goes away.

Thu Jul 18 18:09:51 1991  Richard Stallman  (rms at mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c (C_entries): Process token before handling end of line.
	When inner loops reach end of line, just back up.
	Let the real end of line processing happen in just one place.

Fri Jan 25 22:37:29 1991  Jim Blandy  (jimb at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile: Find the arguments to a C function correctly,
	by not ignoring the character that read_c_string returns.  Don't
	even try to find argument names for functions that take MANY
	or UNEVALLED arguments, since they're a figment of the docstring's
	imagination.

Mon Jan 14 18:47:17 1991  Jim Blandy  (jimb at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* make-docfile: Read the .elc files generated by the new byte
	compiler.

Mon Dec 31 17:51:53 1990  Richard Stallman  (rms at mole.ai.mit.edu)

	* refcard.tex: Use cm fonts, not am, in multi-column mode.

Thu Nov 29 17:34:14 1990  Richard Stallman  (rms at mole.ai.mit.edu)

Tue Nov 27 17:50:37 1990  Richard Stallman  (rms at mole.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile (install*): No need to install wakeup.

Mon Nov 26 20:31:47 1990  Richard Stallman  (rms at mole.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile (install*): Install emacsclient like etags.

Tue Nov 13 00:01:54 1990  Richard Stallman  (rms at mole.ai.mit.edu)

	* movemail.c (error): Handle 3 args.
	(main): Don't check input access if using pop.

Tue Aug 14 21:34:50 1990  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* emacsclient.c [USG]: Pass msgsnd only 4 args.

Thu Aug  9 10:36:18 1990  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	* etags.c: Rename `flag' variables for what they do instead of
	which option character sets them.
