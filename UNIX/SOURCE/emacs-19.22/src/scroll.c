/* Calculate the insert and delete line costs.
   Note that this is done even when running with a window system
   because we want to know how long scrolling takes (and avoid it).
   This must be redone whenever the frame height changes.

   We keep the ID costs in a precomputed array based on the position
   at which the I or D is performed.  Also, there are two kinds of ID
   costs: the "once-only" and the "repeated".  This is to handle both
   those terminals that are able to insert N lines at a time (once-
   only) and those that must repeatedly insert one line.

   The cost to insert N lines at line L is
   	    [tt.t_ILov  + (frame_height + 1 - L) * tt.t_ILpf] +
	N * [tt.t_ILnov + (frame_height + 1 - L) * tt.t_ILnpf]

   ILov represents the basic insert line overhead.  ILpf is the padding
   required to allow the terminal time to move a line: insertion at line
   L changes (frame_height + 1 - L) lines.

   The first bracketed expression above is the overhead; the second is
   the multiply factor.  Both are dependent only on the position at
   which the insert is performed.  We store the overhead in
   FRAME_INSERT_COST (frame) and the multiply factor in
   FRAME_INSERTN_COST (frame).  Note however that any insertion
   must include at least one multiply factor.  Rather than compute this
   as FRAME_INSERT_COST (frame)[line]+FRAME_INSERTN_COST (frame)[line],
   we add FRAME_INSERTN_COST (frame) into FRAME_INSERT_COST (frame).
   This is reasonable because of the particular algorithm used in calcM.

   Deletion is essentially the same as insertion.
