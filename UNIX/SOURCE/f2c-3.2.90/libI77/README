If your system lacks /usr/include/local.h ,
then you should create an appropriate local.h in
this directory.  An appropriate local.h may simply
be empty, or it may #define VAX or #define CRAY
(or whatever else you must do to make fp.h work right).
Alternatively, edit fp.h to suite your machine.

If your system's sprintf does not work the way ANSI C
specifies -- specifically, if it does not return the
number of characters transmitted -- then insert the line

#define USE_STRLEN

at the beginning of wref.c .  This is necessary with
at least some versions of Sun software.

If you get error messages about references to cf->_ptr
and cf->_base when compiling wrtfmt.c and wsfe.c or to
stderr->_flag when compiling err.c, then insert the line

#define NON_UNIX_STDIO

at the beginning of fio.h, and recompile these modules.

You may need to supply the following non-ANSI routines:

  access(char *Name, 0) is supposed to return 0
if file Name exists, nonzero otherwise.

  fstat(int fileds, struct stat *buf) is similar
to stat(char *name, struct stat *buf), except that
the first argument, fileds, is the file descriptor
returned by open rather than the name of the file.
fstat is used in the system-dependent routine
canseek (in the libI77 source file err.c), which
is supposed to return 1 if it's possible to issue
seeks on the file in question, 0 if it's not; you may
need to suitably modify err.c

  char * mktemp(char *buf) is supposed to replace the
6 trailing X's in buf with a unique number and then
return buf.  The idea is to get a unique name for
a temporary file.

To check for transmission errors, issue the command
	make check
This assumes you have the xsum program whose source, xsum.c,
is distributed as part of "all from f2c/src".  If you do not
have xsum, you can obtain xsum.c by sending the following E-mail
message to netlib@research.att.com
	send xsum.c from f2c/src
