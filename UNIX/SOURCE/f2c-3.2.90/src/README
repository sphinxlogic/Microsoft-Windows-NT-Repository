Type "make" to check the validity of the f2c source and compile f2c.

The file usignal.h is for the benefit of strictly ANSI include files
on a UNIX system -- the ANSI signal.h does not define SIGHUP or SIGQUIT.
You may need to modify usignal.h if you are not running f2c on a UNIX
system.

Should you get the message "xsum0.out xsum1.out differ", see what lines
are different (`diff xsum0.out xsum1.out`) and ask netlib to send you
the files in question "from f2c/src".  For example, if exec.c and
expr.c have incorrect check sums, you would send netlib the message
	send exec.c expr.c from f2c/src

On some systems, the malloc and free in malloc.c let f2c run faster
than do the standard malloc and free.  Other systems cannot tolerate
redefinition of malloc and free.  If yours is such a system, you may
either modify the makefile appropriately, or simply execute
	cc -c -DCRAY malloc.c
before typing "make".  Still other systems have a -lmalloc that
provides performance competitive with that from malloc.c; you may
wish to compare the two on your system.

On some BSD systems, you may need to create a file named "string.h"
whose single line is
#include <strings.h>
you may need to add " -Dstrchr=index" to the "CFLAGS =" assignment
in the makefile, and you may need to add " memset.o" to the "OBJECTS ="
assignment in the makefile -- see the comments in memset.c .

Please send bug reports to dmg@research.att.com .  The index file
("send index from f2c") will report recent changes in the recent-change
log at its end; all changes will be shown in the "fixes" file
("send fixes from f2c").  To keep current source, you will need to
request xsum0.out and version.c, in addition to the changed source
files.
