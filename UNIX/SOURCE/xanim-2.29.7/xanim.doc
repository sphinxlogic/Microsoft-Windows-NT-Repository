This describes the animation types supported and some of their special
features. It's more of an organized rambling but might give insight
into what's going on.

FLI/FLC Animations:

  FLI is by Autodesk Animator for the PC's. Support is for the 320x200
  images. The file is composed of a series of images and deltas(a delta
  is data that can generate the next image given a previous image) to
  be played in sequence. An FLI animation can also change the color map
  during the anim(this isn't supported for True Color displays).    
  FLC's have a few additional chunks and has support for larger image
  sizes.

IFF Animations and Images:

  IFF files were developed for the Amiga. Sound chunks are ignored. IFF 
  Animation files are meant to be double buffered. The deltas refer not to 
  the previous image, but the image before the previous(two back). I know
  of 7 types of compressions 1,2,3,4,5,l and J. I've only included types 3,
  5,l and J because those are the only ones I could test. The J type 
  compression has an ANSI chunk at the end which includes the order in
  which the deltas are to be applied and they can be used more than once.
  Type l (small L) type anim is also support in revs 229 and higher. It's
  a compression type I've only found in older animations.

  IFF animations can be looping or non-looping. Looping means the last
  two deltas produce images that are the same as the 1st two images. To
  continuously loop an animation, you would not jump back to the beginning
  but to the 2nd image instead. In order to loop non-looping animations
  you would need to jump to the 1st image. There's no way to know ahead
  of time which is which so the default is looping and if you have a
  non-looping animation use the -c switch.

  The Amiga has a couple of weird display modes, EHB and HAM. XAnim fully 
  supports EHB animations. HAM can produce 4096 colors(4 bits each red,
  green, and blue) and XAnim will display HAM animations as 332(3 bits
  red, 3 bits green and 2 bits blue). Surprisingly enough, it's not too
  bad. HAM is not truncated to 332 on True Color displays.

  IFF supports color cycling chunks that specify color ranges to be
  cycled at specified intervals. Since there's no obvious end to this
  type of animation, I just display it until the key 'g' is pressed inside
  the display window.

  Single IFF images are supported as well. no compression and 
  compression 1 are supported. (XAnim makes use of the public domain
  unpacker routine by Jerry Morrison and Steve Shaw). see unpacker.c.

GIF Images/Animations.

  The GIF file consists of a screen color map and then a series of images,
  each with their own optional color map. The images don't have to be at
  the origin and can be any size smaller than the screen size. This allows
  GIF animations to be created that only update the part of the screen
  that changes. I don't have a program that does this yet but txtmerge is
  a step in that direction. Also the GIF89a spec has included some extensions
  that are animation specific.  Rev 2.29.1 and up has limited support for 
  these.  Comment fields in GIF files are display if you use the -v (verbose)
  option.

  GIF images are automatically uncompressed when read in.

TXT files

  Probably should be called something else. Basically it is a ascii text
  file that lists a number of GIF files to be displayed. Optionally, you
  can specify the sequence the files are displayed in.  Comments aren't
  supported. I need to put a lot of work and thought into improving this
  one.

  TXT format needs to have txt91 as the 1st 5 characters in the file.
  Following that there are a series of fields. Fields just have to be
  separated from each other by white space. No extraneous characters
  (ie comments) are supported, yet.

     txt91    <--- header so XAnim knows what kind of file it is
     4        <--- number of GIF filenames that follow
     a.gif    <--- gif file to be read in. 1st file is number 0.
     b.gif    
     c.gif
     d.gif    
     6	  <--- number of frames that follow. 
     0 1 2 3  <--- display images in this order.
     2 1

  The sequence will be a.gif b.gif c.gif d.gif c.gif b.gif. Most likely
  this anim will be looped and the last b.gif will flow smoothly into
  a.gif as it starts over.

DL files

  I only threw these in because it was easy and pressure from friends.
  As far as I know, they come in three resolutions, 320x200, 160x100 and
  80x50. They consist of a series of images with a frame list at the end
  that gives the order they are displayed in. There's also a field for
  Author and Title that is displayed if you specify -v (verbose) option.
