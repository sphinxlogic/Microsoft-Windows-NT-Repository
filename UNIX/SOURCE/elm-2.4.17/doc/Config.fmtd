               This document is intended as a supplement to the  _E_l_m  _U_s_e_r_s
          _G_u_i_d_e and _E_l_m _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _G_u_i_d_e and should be of interest mainly to
          people at a site either installing or maintaining the source code
          to the EEEEllllmmmm mail system, or modifying the code.

          It is _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_d that installation be done by using  the  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e
          script  supplied  with  the system.  Please see the file _I_n_s_t_r_u_c_t
          for further information on running _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e.

          The remainder of this document will discuss the various questions
          asked  by  the  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e  script  and  the options available via
          direct editing of various files  and  parameters.   As  indicated
          above,  almost  all of the sites that install EEEEllllmmmm should find the
          _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script more than sufficient.

          of Elm to fit that system and its  environment.   Where  the  in-
          staller  has  a choice, it asks questions of the installer.  _C_o_n_-
          _f_i_g_u_r_e provides its own instructions when run, so  they  are  not
          repeated  here.   However, when the installer is presented with a
          choice, this next section explains some of the options available.
          Not  all  the  questions  or  options  to those questions are ex-
          plained.

          EEEEllllmmmm, like all Mail User Agents, has times when it needs exclusive
          access  to the mail spool file.  There are three methods of lock-
          ing the mail spool file: .lock, fcntl() and  flock().   .lock  is
          the  original  method, and is used by mail MUA and Mail Transport
          Agents (MTAs).  Whenever possible .lock should be enabled to  as-
          sure backwards compatibility with older MUAs and MTAs.

          BSD systems introduced flock() style locking.  It uses  a  system
          call  to  lock the file on the local node.  System V later intro-
          duced fcntl() style locking, which can also use  a  protocol  for
          remote  locking across the network.  Where both styles are avail-
          able, it is advisable to use both, unless you are sure that  only
          one is in use at your site.

          Under many System V Release 4 systems, they  both  use  the  same
          underlying  system  call.   (Flock()  is  translated into fcntl()
          style locking) so for that version of UNIX, flock() is not needed
          and fcntl() style alone can be used.

          EEEEllllmmmm has a feature to take specially marked lines within mail mes-
          sages  and add them to a file for use by the system calendar pro-
          gram.  The command to do this extraction needs to be  enabled  to
          work.   There  is also a follow on question regarding the name of
          the calendar file:

          Elm uses the full name from the password file if it is available.
          There  are  two major ways this name is stored.  Berkeley/V7 sys-
          tems place the name as the entire GCOS field string, that  is  it
          starts  directly  after  the  ':'  that delimits the fields.  USG

          Elm needs to know the correct name of the host on which it is ex-
          ecuting  to be able to create the proper headers for the outbound
          mail.  Some systems use one name for uucp and  another  name  for
          the  system  and  others just don't reply to the subroutines with
          the proper name.  In this case it will be necessary to compile in
          the  name.   In all other cases this should not be needed.  It is
          provided just in case there is a problem with your system.

          Starting with System V Release 4,  many  of  the  Mail  Transport
          Agents  are  binary  transparent.  This allows for sending binary
          messages, such as Voice or graphics.  In doing so, they no longer
          can tolerate changes in the message content by the mailers to aid
          in determining the start of the  next  message.   To  solve  this
          problem  the Content-Length: header was added.  Elm generates the
          Content-Length: header, but to make full use of  it,  Elm  should
          also  not escape such sequences as 'From ' at the start of a line
          of the message.  If your Mail Transport Agent (mailer) does honor
          the  Content-Length: header for determining the start of the next
          message, answer this question YES.

               Along the same lines, but now obsolete and being phased out,
          is a problem where a Mail Transport Agent will think a message is
          terminated by a single lone period on a line.   Sendmail  has  an
          option  to  turn  off this behavior and this option is set by de-
          fault in Configure.  If your mailer cannot turn off this  option,
          add    a    line    to    sysdefs.SH   to   define   the   symbol
          NEED_LONE_PERIOD_ESCAPE.  This symbol will turn  a  line  with  a
          lone period into a period and then a blank to avoid this problem.
          This symbol is ignored if the honors Content-Length: is  answered
          YES.

          Elm will work with systems that can process the `@' character  of

          mat  addresses, they should be used and this question is answered
          yes.  If when you send mail with the `@' format  addresses  (such

          On USG type systems and many other types, access to the mailboxes
          and the mailbox directory is via the group permissions.  The mail
          user agents, such as Elm, need write access into  this  directory
          to be able to move the mailbox around due to internal editing and
          to create lock files.  If the permissions on your mailbox  direc-
          tory are drwxrwxr-x, then Elm needs to be a setgid program.

          which editor to use.  The editor is used to compose outbound mail

          This is the standard pager to use for reading messages.   Besides
          the usual system pagers, two EEEEllllmmmm specific internal options exist:
          builtin and builtin+.  The built-in pager is  faster  to  execute
          but  much  less  flexible than the system provided pagers.  The +
          version just clears the page before  displaying  the  next  page.
          Otherwise the two versions are identical.

               The following parameters rarely need to be changed, but  are
          provided  if  you need them.  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e does not prompt for their
          values.  To change them, edit the  _h_d_r_s/_s_y_s_d_e_f_s._h  file  directly
          after running Configure.

          MAX_IN_WEEDLIST
                    The maximum number of headers that can be specified  in
                    the  weedout  list of the ._e_l_m/_e_l_m_r_c file.  A suggested
                    alternative approach if this number is too small is  to
                    specify  initial substrings in the file rather than in-
                    creasing the number.  For  example,  say  you  want  to
                    weedout  the  headers  ``Latitude:'' and ``Latitudinal-
                    Coords:'', you could simply  specify  ``Latitud''"  and
                    match  them  both!   Furthermore you could also specify
                    headers like ``X-'' and remove  all  the  user  defined
                    headers!

          MAX_HOPS  When replying to a G)roup, this is the  maximum  number
                    of hops that a message can have taken.  This is used to
                    try to optimize the return address (remove cyclic loops
                    and so on) and regular use should show that the default
                    of 35 is plenty more than you'll ever need!

                    This is the file that contains the  hashed  version  of
                    the system aliases.

          system_data_file
                    This is the other file the _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s command installs in
                    the system alias area and contains the actual addresses
                    for each of the aliases contained in  the  hashed  data
                    file.

          ALIAS_TEXT

          OLDEBUG   The name of the file to save the previous debug  output
                    as (this feature was added to ensure that users wanting
                    to mail bug reports  wouldn't  automatically  overwrite
                    the debug log of the session in question).

          mailtime_file
                    File to compare date to to determine if a given message
                    is New since the last time the mail was read or not.

          readmsg_file
                    File to use when communicating with the _r_e_a_d_m_s_g program
                    (see that program for more information).

          smflags   Defines the flags to hand to _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l if and  when  the
                    program chooses to use it.

          smflagsv  Defines the flags to hand to _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l in verbose voyeur
                    mode.

          mailer    If you don't have _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l, this is the mailer  that'll
                    be used.

          helpfile  The help file name prefix.

          ELMRC_INFO
                    The file containing textual  messages  associated  with
                    each  EEEEllllmmmm variable setting in the user's ``._e_l_m/_e_l_m_r_c''
                    file.  This is used when the user chooses to  auto-save
                    the options from within the main program.

          elmrcfile The name of the automatic control file within the  ._e_l_m
                    directory (currently _e_l_m_r_c).

          old_elmrcfile
                    When a new elmrc file is saved, the  old  one  is  also
                    saved, being renamed to whatever this identifier is set
                    to.

          system_rc_file
                    The  name  of  the  global  elmrc  file   (default   is
                    $_l_i_b/_e_l_m._r_c).   This  is where the system administrator
                    puts global default values for any  parameters  located
                    in the ._e_l_m/_e_l_m_r_c file.

          mailheaders
                    The name of the optional file that users may have  that
                    will  be  included in the headers of each outbound mes-
                    sage.

          dead_letter
                    If the user decides not to send a message it  will  in-
                    stead  be saved to this filename in their home directo-
                    ry.

          unedited_mail
                    In the strange case when the mailer suddenly finds  all
                    the  directories  it  uses shut off (like /_u_s_r/_m_a_i_l and
                    /_t_m_p) then it'll put the current mailbox into this file
                    in the user's home directory.

          newalias  How to install new aliases (note: you MUST have the  '-

               No global default file is provided as part of the  installa-
          tion  of EEEEllllmmmm.  If you wish to override any default parameters for
          all users, create a  file  as  defined  in  the  "system_rc_file"
          above.   An  easy  way to create it is to copy a saved ._e_l_m/_e_l_m_r_c
          and edit it to remove all user-specific parameters.  Of  particu-
          lar  interest are three additional parameters you may set: "host-
          domain," "hostfullname," and "hostname." See  the  "String  Vari-
          ables"  section  in the second chapter of the _E_l_m _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _G_u_i_d_e
          for details on these variables.

               The _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script has run successfully tens of  thousands
          of  times.  But maybe your system is the one in ten thousand that
          will confuse it.  For example, _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e  assumes  that  if  your
          system  has  a feature it would like, then it should be used.  If
          vendors never made mistakes, then that might be  a  good  assump-
          tion.   In  reality,  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e might want to use a feature you'd
          prefer it didn't.

          When _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e completes its examination of your system, it gives
          you a final chance to make changes.  When _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e asks

               IIIIffff yyyyoooouuuu nnnneeeeeeeedddd ttttoooo eeeeddddiiiitttt ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg....sssshhhh,,,, ddddoooo iiiitttt aaaassss aaaa sssshhhheeeellllllll eeeessssccccaaaappppeeee hhhheeeerrrreeee::::

          you may briefly jump out of _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e to make changes.  For exam-
          ple, if ``vi'' is your preferred editor, type ``!vi config.sh''.

          Unfortunately, _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e makes the same mistakes  every  time  it
          runs.   This  means  that if you ever apply updates or changes to
          the EEEEllllmmmm system and rerun _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e, you  will  have  to  manually
          make the same configuration changes.  Or more likely, you'll for-
          get that the changes are required.

          The solution to this problem is to create a _c_o_n_f_i_g._o_v_e_r  file  in
          the  EEEEllllmmmm base directory.  This file may contain any valid _s_h com-
          mands,  and  is  loaded  by  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e  immediately  before   the
          _c_o_n_f_i_g._s_h  file is created.  For example, supposed that _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e
          creates a _c_o_n_f_i_g._s_h file with the definition

               dddd____ffffeeeeaaaattttuuuurrrreeee====ddddeeeeffffiiiinnnneeee

          but instead you want it to say

               dddd____ffffeeeeaaaattttuuuurrrreeee====uuuunnnnddddeeeeffff

          All you need to do is create a  _c_o_n_f_i_g._o_v_e_r  file  and  put  that
