               While there are  a  lot  of  mail  systems  that  allow  the
          transmission of text and primitive pictures, to send and reply to
          more complex forms is simply not possible.   EEEEllllmmmm,  however,  took
          the  forms  mode implemented as part of the AT&T Mail package and
          has expanded on it to be a smoothly fit part of the overall  mail
          system.

          Forms mode gives you the ability to send `template' files to peo-
          ple and receive the filled-in replies.1 Let's look at an  example
          right off.

          Say we were going to use computer mail as a way to  file  defects
          with  software.  There is a certain amount of information we want

          to be able to collect when each report is made, and if it is in a
          specific  format we can use programs to file the defects upon re-
          ceipt.

          This form can actually be created almost exactly as listed  above
          in the EEEEllllmmmm mail system by using your standard editor and can then
          be mailed about as needed.

          Let's say that we want a bit more information, however, especial-
          ly  with  fields  like  ``Defect  Type'', we want to list all the
          recommended answers.  To create the actual form, we  need  merely
          to  replace  the  underlines  in the above form with spaces.  The
          multi-line comments can simply be indicated by a `:' by itself on
          a line;

          As we can see, it is quite simple to create forms!!


          Now that we have an idea what we're talking about, let's actually
          officially define the system...




          October 1, 1992                                            Page 3





          Forms Mode Guide                                      Version 2.4


          FFFFoooorrrrmmmmssss MMMMooooddddeeee SSSSppppeeeecccciiiiffffiiiiccccaaaattttiiiioooonnnn

          [Note that this is all taken from the document _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d  _f_o_r  _E_x_-
          _c_h_a_n_g_i_n_g _F_o_r_m_s _o_n _A_T&_T _M_a_i_l, Version 1.9 of 6/7/86, from AT&T]

          The forms mode is really quite simple.  Simple enough that it  is
          amazing  that  it  hadn't  been implemented before AT&T Mail came
          along!!

          In a nutshell, each field is delimited by a  `:'  followed  by  a
          number  of blank spaces or tabs that represent the valid size for
          that field.  That is, if we have a line in the form like;
               ``Phone (area-code):     Number:          ''
          The area-code field will be limited to three characters  and  the
          number  to  nine.   (this is kind of hard to see with the propor-
          tionally spaced formatted copy, alas).  The only exception to the
          rule is that a `:' by itself on a line represents a field that is
          as large as the user entering the data desires.

          The actual form that is transmitted, in AT&T Mail parlance, is  a
          ``SIMPLE''  forms handler message (as opposed to the ``ADVANCED''
          handler).  This means that it contains three sections;
               _T_h_e _M_e_s_s_a_g_e _H_e_a_d_e_r
               [_O_P_T_I_O_N_S-_S_E_C_T_I_O_N]
               ***
               [_F_O_R_M_S-_I_M_A_G_E]
               ***
               [_R_U_L_E_S-_S_E_C_T_I_O_N]
          EEEEllllmmmm generates form messages with the ``options''  section  filled
          out,  but ignores it when receiving mail.  The filled out section
          is:
               WIDTH=80
               TYPE=SIMPLE
               OUTPUT=TEXT
          The FORMS-IMAGE section is  that  described  above.   The  RULES-
          SECTION  can  contain explicit rules about the possible values of
          each field, but this is currently ignored by EEEEllllmmmm, being a  ``SIM-
          PLE'' forms mode mail system.

          Forms also have the header ``Content-Type: mailform'' to indicate
          to the mail system (either EEEEllllmmmm or AT&T Mail) that a form is being
          sent.

          EEEEllllmmmm further indicates that a form has been received by having  an
          ``F''  as the status character in the header display section (in-
          stead of ``N'' for new, etc).

          CCCCoooommmmppppoooossssiiiinnnngggg aaaannnndddd SSSSeeeennnnddddiiiinnnngggg aaaa FFFFoooorrrrmmmm

          The first step to enable sending forms is to change  the  setting
          of the variable _f_o_r_m_s in your ._e_l_m/_e_l_m_r_c file to ``ON''.  E.g.:
               forms = ON
          The next step is to send the message to  someone  using  the  `m'
          (_m_a_i_l) command.  This then will drop you into an editor.  Type in


          October 1, 1992                                            Page 4





          Forms Mode Guide                                      Version 2.4


          the form as indicated above, with  appropriate  colons  and  com-
          ments, and end the entry by leaving the editor.

          The prompt is now;
          Choose: E)dit msg, edit H)eaders, M)ake form, S)end or F)orget : @
          so we choose `m' - _M_a_k_e  _f_o_r_m.   The  program  then  will  either
          rewrite the prompt without the M)ake form option, indicating that
          the form has been accepted, or will indicate the problem and give
          you a chance to correct it.

          Once it has been accepted, simple use the `s' -  _s_e_n_d  _m_e_s_s_a_g_e  -
          command and it's off!

          _N_o_t_e _t_h_a_t _y_o_u _c_a_n_n_o_t _r_e_p_l_y _t_o _a _m_e_s_s_a_g_e _w_i_t_h _a _F_o_r_m.

          Let's reply to the form message we  generated  now.   The  header
          page  of  the EEEEllllmmmm mail system will indicate that the message is a
          form by having an `F' next to it.  So we use `r' to reply and the
          screen is immediately cleared and we're prompted, field by field,
          for the data requested.  Each field has underscores in the  input
          area to indicate the size field that is expected.

          After answering all the questions we'll have a screen that  looks
          like;

          As was said at the beginning, this way  of  sending  about  forms
          could  prove  to  be very helpful and useful in a variety of con-
          texts.  On the other  hand,  until  a  more  sophisticated  forms
          language  is used for the forms, this should be sufficient to em-
          body the power of the idea.

          I welcome any comments and thoughts on this system and also  wel-
          come possible enhancements.

          I also gratefully thank Dale DeJager of AT&T Information  Systems
          for  sending me more information on AT&T Mail than I could possi-
          bly digest in any finite amount of time.
