               This document is intended as a supplement to the  _E_l_m  _U_s_e_r_s
          _G_u_i_d_e  and  is  only  of  interest  to  those users desiring more
          knowledge about how aliases work and how to  create  strange  and
          exciting  aliases for their systems (okay, so maybe it's not _t_h_a_t
          exciting!)

               This document is broken up into the following sections; user
          aliases,  group  aliases,  system aliases, editing and installing
          new aliases, general warnings and other chit-chat.


          1111....  UUUUsssseeeerrrr AAAAlllliiiiaaaasssseeeessss

          The simplest type of aliases in the  EEEEllllmmmm  system  are  individual
          user aliases.  These are made up of three parts;
                  _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t  =  _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e  =  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
          __________
          1.  aliasnames  can  be  any  combination  of  letters,
          numbers,  dashes  (`-'),  periods (`.'), or underscores
          (`_').  Letter case is not significant.  That is `FRED'


          Alias Users Guide                                     Version 2.4





          Alias Users Guide                                     Version 2.4


          Where the _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t is either a single aliasname1 or a  list
          of  aliasnames separated by commas.  Aliasnames are case insensi-
          tive and will be converted to all lower case by the alias system.

               _U_s_e_r_n_a_m_e is used to indicate the full  `real  name'  of  the
          user.   For  example,  if you had an alias for `taylor' to get to
          me, the _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e field would contain  `Dave  Taylor'  or  perhaps
          `Dave  Taylor at HP' or some other permutation.  The name can op-
          tionally be entered in the format of `Taylor; Dave'.   When  this
          is  done,  the alias system can sort aliases on a last name basis
          for presentation on the alias menu within eeeellllmmmm.  EEEEllllmmmm uses this in-
          formation to add the users full name to the addresses of outbound
          mail to get more readable addresses.  No matter  which  format  a
          name  is  entered, eeeellllmmmm will display it and put it in mail headers
          the way you would expect (i.e., `Dave Taylor').

               _A_d_d_r_e_s_s is either the users full electronic mail address or,
          if your system uses a smart mailer, the minimum address needed to
          specify the destination.  For example, say smart mailer contained
          information  on  how  to  get to machine `hp-sdd' and I wanted to
          have an address for my friend Ken there - I could  have  his  ad-
          dress  specified  as  simply  `ken@hp-sdd' (or alternatively `hp-
          sdd!ken' since the two are functionally equivalent).

               Let's get on to some examples, shall we?

               Consider this excerpt from my own ._e_l_m/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s._t_e_x_t file;

               # Mail aliases for Dave Taylor
               # Friends from UCSD
               addie          = Addie Silva    = addie@hp-sdd.SDD.HP.COM
               frank,minjarez = Frank Minjarez = Minjarez.Verify@dockmaster.ddn.mil
               pizzini        = Ken Pizzini    = hplabs!ucbvax!ucdavis!pai!ken
               george         = Burdell; George P., Famous GT Guy= gburdell@matd.gatech.edu

          Note that the alias for Frank Minjarez has two _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e_s associ-
          ated with it, frank and minjarez.  Also notice that the first and
          second aliases  use  the  Internet  style  naming  convention  of
          _u_s_e_r@_m_a_c_h_i_n_e   whereas  the  third  uses  the  UUCP  notation  of
          _m_a_c_h_i_n_e!_u_s_e_r.  The fourth alias illustrates two features for  the
          _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e  field.  An individual's name can be entered in the form
          of `lastname; firstname' which allows the alias system to be able
          to sort alias names on a last name basis.  Additionally, any text
          after the comma is treated as a comment.  It  is  stored  in  the
          alias file and displayed on the alias menu but will not appear in
          the comment field (between the ()'s) in the header of a  message.
          This  allows  you  to enter useful notes about an individual that
          you would not otherwise want to include on the To: line of a mail
          message.



          __________
          and `Fred' are identical.


          October 1, 1992                                            Page 2





          Alias Users Guide                                     Version 2.4


               For the most part,  the  notational  format  is  transparent
          within  the  alias file - the only time it _d_o_e_s make a difference
          is if you have to specify more than the machine that the user  is
          receiving mail on (as in the third example above).

               Suffice to say that if you must specify  any  sort  of  uucp
          route  that  you should use the uucp notation as much as possible
          to ensure that the  system  expands  the  correct  machine  name.
          Similarly,  if  you're  bouncing  mail through different Internet
          sites (to get to a foreign system, as in the example  below)  you
          should use the notation that system expects:

                              listserv%byuadmin.BITNET@rugters.edu


          2222....  GGGGrrrroooouuuupppp AAAAlllliiiiaaaasssseeeessss

          After the confusion of user aliases, group aliases are even  more
          fun!  For the most part the notation is very similar;

                         _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t   =   _g_r_o_u_p_n_a_m_e   =   _l_i_s_t _o_f  _p_e_o_-
          _p_l_e

          Where _a_l_i_a_s_n_a_m_e _l_i_s_t and _g_r_o_u_p_n_a_m_e are exactly equivalent to  the
          corresponding fields in user aliases.

               The interesting part is the _l_i_s_t _o_f _p_e_o_p_l_e field; this field
          is  actually  in the same notation as the aliasname list, so it's
          really quite easy to create.  It's best to illustrate by example:

               friends, mypals = The Gang of Six = joe, larry, mary, joanna,
                                                   nancy, michael

          (Notice that you can continue onto as many lines as you'd like so
          long  as  each additional line start with either a SPACE or a TAB
          character)

               At times it may be desirable to send a message  to  everyone
          in  the group except one or two people.  This can be accomplished
          by adding the individual(s) actual id(s) to the To: list, preced-
          ed  by  a  minus  sign  "-".   For  example, if you were having a
          surprise party for nancy from the above group and you  wanted  to
          discuss  the  details with the others, you could mail the message
          to:

               friends -nancy


               Unlike in prior versions of eeeellllmmmm, group aliases need not be a
          _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s_l_y  _d_e_f_i_n_e_d  _a_l_i_a_s or a valid mail address on the current
          machine.  Any valid delivery address, local user, or prior  local
          or group alias may now be part of a group alias.

          System aliases are functionally equivalent to the individual  EEEEllllmmmm
          alias  lists  each  EEEEllllmmmm  user  has  (both  user aliases and group
          aliases) but are _r_e_a_d _o_n_l_y for everyone but the  EEEEllllmmmm  administra-
          tor.   The format of the file is identical to the users file, and
          the only difference is that this file is expected to  be  located
          in   the   directory   that  contains  the  _s_y_s_t_e_m__h_a_s_h__f_i_l_e  and
          _s_y_s_t_e_m__d_a_t_a__f_i_l_e files (see the _E_l_m _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e for  more
          details on these variables).

               Simply create the system alias file in the specified  direc-
          tory  as  you  would a normal alias file, and install it the same
          way (see the following section for more details on that).

               Voila!!


          4444....  EEEEddddiiiittttiiiinnnngggg aaaannnndddd IIIInnnnssssttttaaaalllllllliiiinnnngggg NNNNeeeewwww AAAAlllliiiiaaaasssseeeessss

          To install new aliases, you need merely to create, or modify, the
          file  ._e_l_m/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s._t_e_x_t  until  you're  satisfied  with it and it
          meets the requirements discussed above.  You can then try to  in-
          stall it with the command;

                         $ nnnneeeewwwwaaaalllliiiiaaaassss

          which will either report back the number of aliases installed  or
          any  errors encountered trying to parse and store the given alias
          list.

               Note that blank lines are no problem and that  comments  are
          not  only  allowed  but actually encouraged, and must have `####' as
          the first character of each comment line.

          Probably the biggest question you have in your mind right now  is
          ``But  how the heck does this relate to my existing _B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _M_a_i_l
          aliases and the lower-level _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l alias system??''  Well, rest
          assured  that if you _r_e_a_l_l_y want to have your aliases down in the
          transport you can.  No problem.  All you'll need to do is to turn
          off the address validation routine in EEEEllllmmmm.

               And for those ex-_B_e_r_k_e_l_e_y _M_a_i_l fans, you can translate  your
          aliases  into  the  format that EEEEllllmmmm wants by running them through
          the _a_w_k script listed in the appendix.

               Finally, if you have any problems or questions, try  looking
          in the _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s manual entry.
