warnings.
From: Syd via prompt from wdh@grouper.mkt.csd.harris.com (W. David Higgins)

Traditional C used 'unsigned preserving' rules when an integral data
value is widened to integer and ANSI C changed the rules to 'value
preserving'. This is one of the few things that the ANSI X3J11 comitte
did that might break existing programs.  Casting to (int)
From: Bo.Asbjorn.Muldbak <bam@jutland.ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM>

When ELM is reporting "appending to <foldername>" I never get to see
but a flash of light, before the message line has been replaced by a
dummy "Messages saved" string.  And if you happen to have mistyped the
foldername or the leading '=', you never see the foldername.

This fix will change file.c to show either

	Message <what> to <foldername>

or
	<#> messages <what> to <foldername>
From: Bo.Asbjorn.Muldbak <bam@jutland.ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM>

This implements the use of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 as discussed on the
mailing list recently, and adds them to the documentation.

List_folder knew only about '=' but nothing about the rest
of [+=%] as one would have expected.
From: Jukka Antero Ukkonen <ukkonen@venus.csc.fi>

Fix where the user creates a first new alias, then deletes it, the
alias stays on screen, but the file really will be empty if it was the
last alias, so the retry to delete gives 'cannot open ...file' messages
From: "Robert L. Howard" <robert.howard@matd.gatech.edu>

Make Elm complain about spaces that are not after commas in
alias and address lists
From: "Robert L. Howard" <robert.howard@matd.gatech.edu>

From: Sigmund Austigard <austig@solan.unit.no>

I was playing with the metamail stuff and Sun's Openwindows Mailtool
and discovered that I was able to 'display' messages generated with
Mailtool in elm using metamail.  This marks the Sun Attachments as
needing metamail.

Patch Set - Patch 11: Tues Nov 17 1992
Elm 2.4PL10 -> Elm 2.4PL11

Quickie fix to handle a botched edit of a test line in Configure




=========================================================
Patch Set - Patches 9 and 10 : Sat Nov 14 21:34:44 EST 1992
Elm 2.4PL8 -> Elm 2.4PL10

I think that the code in 'newmbox.c' which handles bad 'Content-length'
entries is incomplete. The file-ptr for the mail file is
backed up, but the file-ptr of the temp file WAS LEFT UNMODIFIED !
From langesw.ssw.de!root Wed Nov 11 14:28:57 1992

When elm copies the temp mailbox back to the mail spool to resync or
quit, it changes to the mailgroup before attempting to diddle in the
mail spool, but when it copies the temp mailbox back to the mail spool
after editing, it forgets to change to mailgroup.  This patch appears
to work, but I haven't exhaustively checked for some path that leaves
the gid set
wrong.  From: dwolfe@pffft.sps.mot.com (Dave Wolfe)

There's an error in two messages in s_aliases.m which causes elm2.4
to core dump when resyncronize aliases. (%s/%s) should be (%c/%c).

This bug doesn't show up unless you use message cataloges, since the default
message in a_quit.c is correct.
From: Jan Djarv <Jan.Djarv@sa.erisoft.se>

Fix how nls emulation lib gencat links prev pointers
From: Jan Djarv <Jan.Djarv@sa.erisoft.se>

The alias message_count isn't set to zero if the last alias has
been deleted from the alias table. As no aliases are reread from
the aliases database the message_count is left as it was before.

Fixed that the function do_newalias() sometimes returns without freeing
the buffer allocated before. The patch adds these free calls.

When you erroneously type a number in your folder elm asks you for
a new current message number. But now if you erase this one number
and leave the string empty elm will set the new current message to
the second message on our sun4! The patch adds a check for an empty
string and returns the current number if no number was entered.
From: vogt@isa.de (Gerald Vogt)

The situation is that the .elm/aliases file is missing, but
.elm/aliases.dir and .elm/aliases.pag exist (isn't serendipity
wonderful?).  The ndbz functions tolerate this and just put a NULL
pointer in the db structure for the data file FILE pointer.  However,
get_one_alias() in listalias and elm doesn't account for the db_open()
succeeding but the dbz_basef field being NULL, so it passes the NULL
pointer to fread().  Detect null and return 0
From: dwolfe@pffft.sps.mot.com (Dave Wolfe)

Clear the screen before displaying MIME:
From: marius@rhi.hi.is (Marius Olafsson)

Add regexp processing to filter.
Add execc operator

=========================================================
Patch Set - Patches 7 and 8 : Sat Nov  7 15:54:44 EST 1992
Elm 2.4PL6 -> Elm 2.4PL8

Add some tolerance for incorrect Content-Length header (fixes bug where
Elm would combine two messages if content-length header was incorrect.
Still has problem if incorrect content-length exactly matches multiple
messages)
From: Syd

Change Makefile in doc to use -f as some shells don't have -x in test
From: Syd

The first is that when doing a summary, macros are expanded when printing the
rule. IMHO they should be printed as with the -r option (i.e. %t is
printed as "<time>" and so on).

The second one is that the summary printed "applied n time" regardless of
the value of n, not "applied n times" when n > 1.
From: Jan Djarv <Jan.Djarv@sa.erisoft.se>

There is no need to write out the MIME-Version header in subparts
From: Klaus Steinberger <Klaus.Steinberger@Physik.Uni-Muenchen.DE>

fix null dereferences from patch 5
From: Jukka Ukkonen <ukkonen@csc.fi>

Fix where elm duplicates the entry's from the global elm.rc.
It will however still copy the global weedout headers to your local
elmrc if they where not already in it.
From: janw@fwi.uva.nl (Jan Wortelboer)

another typo (2.4.6 Ref.guide)
From: David.W.Tamkin@gagme.chi.il.us (David W. Tamkin)

comments should be allowed anywhere in the alias file.

Fix redefinition complaint by SCO 3.2v2.0.

Enhanced printing support.  Added "-I" to readmsg to
suppress spurious diagnostic messages.
From: chip@chinacat.unicom.com (Chip Rosenthal)

These small typos stopped me from making forms, so here is a patch.
From: andrew.mcparland@rd.eng.bbc.co.uk (Andrew McParland)

Add a hack to not use ti/te on list folders and do print

New header parsing routine header_cmp to allow for linear

From: dwolfe@pffft.sps.mot.com (Dave Wolfe)

More changes to folder creation confirmation
From: Larry Philps <larryp@sco.COM>

fix a bug in the forms reply caused by the Cc: buffer not being
cleared.  If one has sent mail just prior to replying to the form and
specified a Cc:  address, the form reply is also sent to those Cc:
address(es).
From: dwolfe@pffft.sps.mot.com (Dave Wolfe)

Add missing MAKE variable in doc/Makefile.SH
From: Syd

it invokes metamail (the pseudo is because "text" isn't a legal Content-Type).
in src/mime.c notplain() tries to check for text but fails because it should
look for "text\n" not "text".
From: Jan Djarv <Jan.Djarv@sa.erisoft.se>

Use copy_message in mime shows to get encode processing
From: bjoerns@stud.cs.uit.no (Bjoern Stabell)

Fixes SysV style forwarding
From: Baruch Cochavy <bcochavy@ilux39.intel.com>

fix newmail attempting to close a file descriptor even if the corresponding
open failed.
From: "Peter A. Bigot" <pab@cs.arizona.edu>

In our global elm.rc I keep the four options as below

	confirmappend = OFF	Don't confirm every append to any file.
	confirmcreate = ON	Confirm creation of every new file.
	confirmfiles = ON	Confirm append to non folder files though.
	confirmfolders = ON	In case someone does not want to be asked
				every time when creating a new file try
				to confirm creation of folders though.
From: Jukka Ukkonen <ukkonen@csc.fi>

changes found by using codecenter on Elm 2.4.3
From: Graham Hudspith <gwh@inmos.co.uk>

There is now an additional elmrc option "displaycharset", which
sets the charset supported on your terminal. This is to prevent
elm from calling out to metamail too often.
Plus a slight documentation update for MIME composition (added examples)
From: Klaus Steinberger <Klaus.Steinberger@Physik.Uni-Muenchen.DE>

More typos

From: Tom Moore <tmoore@fievel.DaytonOH.NCR.COM>

Add AIX to src/curses.c for define of window size in different include

From: Syd via note from Tom Kovar

get_return() assumes that message_count reflects the number of
messages in the current folder, but the message_count it's seeing
from the alias subsystem is actually the *alias* count.
toggle the main state before and after calling get_return().
From: cliff@sfn.ORG (R. Cliff Young)

Add missing setlocale and getopen to newalias and listalias.
From: Syd

Touchups on config guide
From: David Barr <barr@pop.psu.edu>

Fix segv in wildcards if SHELL= has no / character in path
From: Syd

1. If firstname && lastname is null then copy aliasname into the 
personal name field (inside the ()'s) when creating an alias
from the menu using the 'n' command.

2. Now if for some reason and alias has a null personal name field
(the person hand edited aliases.text) the blank () is not printed
as part of the address.  This actually cured another problem, where
the To: field on the screen (when you hit 'm' on the alias menu)
used to be blank, now the address shows up....
From: "Robert L. Howard" <robert.howard@matd.gatech.edu>

Updated AIX 3.2 section of README file
From: Syd

fixed a bug in the .lp macro in doc/tmac.n.  The lp macros is always
called with a unit specified for the second argument, however, the
macro added a "n" unit specifier to that argument.  The following patch
fixes this problem.

The various .guide books use the troff .tl macro liberally, but often the
extra ' characters needed at the end of the lines to explicitly specify
the trailing nulls fields were left off.  The following patch fixes the
erroneous lines.
From: Larry Philps <larryp@sco.COM>

While installing elm2.4 on a Sun4 running SunOS4.1.2, the Configure script
doesn't recognize F_SETLK because it searches in /usr/include/sys/fcntl.h
which includes /usr/include/sys/fcntlcom.h (where F_SETLK is).
From: dax@ulysse.enst.fr (Philippe Dax)

change dbm name to dbz to avoid conflicts with partial call
ins from shared librarys, and from mixing code with yp code.
From: Syd via prompt from Jess Anderson
