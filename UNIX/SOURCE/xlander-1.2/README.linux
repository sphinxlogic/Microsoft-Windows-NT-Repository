The Imakefile needed some changes to get it to work properly on my setup.
Some Posix-like signal stuff was added to the code, between #ifdef POSIX
lines. This was taken from a postage of Miquel van Smoorenburg 
(miquels@htsa.aha.nl). I hope it works out well.

Building:

   gcc -s -o xlander xlander.a -lX11 -lm
