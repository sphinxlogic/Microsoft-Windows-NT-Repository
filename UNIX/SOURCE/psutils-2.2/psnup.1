.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Psnup
is a script making the use of 
.I pstops 
easier.
It sets up standard width and height parameters and 
.I Pstops
rearranges pages from a PostScript document, creating a new PostScript file.
The input PostScript file should follow the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions.
.I Pstops
can be used to perform a large number of arbitrary re-arrangements of
Documents, including arranging for printing 2-up, 4-up, booklets, reversing,
selecting front or back sides of documents, scaling, etc.
.PP
The
.I \-w
option gives the width, the default is (21cm),
.I \-h
option gives the height, the default is (29.7cm), 
and are normally specified in
.B "cm"
or
.B "in"
to convert 
PostScript's points (1/72 of an inch)
to centimeters or inches
.PP
The
.I \-b
option prevents any
.B bind
operators in the PostScript prolog from binding. This may be needed in cases
where complex multi-page re-arrangements are being done.
.PP
Pstops normally prints the page numbers of the pages re-arranged; the
.I \-q
option suppresses this.
.SH EXAMPLES
The potential use of this utility is varied but one particular 
use is in conjunction with 
.I psbook(1).
For example, using psroff to create a PostScript document and lpr as 
the 
.SM UNIX 
print spooler a typical command line might look like this: 
.sp
psroff -ms \fIfile\fP | psbook | psnup -2 | lpr
.sp
Where file is a 4 page document this command will result in a 
two page document printing two pages of \fIfile\fP per page and
rearranges the page order to match the input pages 4 and 1 
on the first output page and
pages 2 then 3 of the input document 
on the second output page.
