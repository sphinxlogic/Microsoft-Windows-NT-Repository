This package contains the GNU find, xargs, and locate programs.  find
and xargs comply with POSIX 1003.2, as far as I know.  They also
support some additional options, some borrowed from Unix and some
unique to GNU.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

If you are not running NIS or Hesiod, you might want to compile with
-DCACHE_IDS.  It could speed up the -nouser and -nogroup options to
find.

To gain speed, GNU find now avoids statting files whenever possible.
It does this by:
1. Checking the number of links to directories and not statting files
that it knows aren't directories until it encounters a test or action
that needs the stat info.
2.  Rearranging the command line, where possible, so that it can do tests
that don't require a stat before tests that do, in hopes that the
latter will be skipped because of an OR or AND.  (But it only does
this where it will leave the output unchanged.)

The locate utility is based on James Woods' public domain fast-find
code, which is also distributed with the 4.3BSD find.  Because POSIX
requires `find foo' to have the same effect as `find foo -print', the
fast-find searching has been moved to a separate program, `locate';
the same thing has been done in 4.3BSD-reno/4.4BSD.  If you use
locate, you should run the included `updatedb' script from cron
periodically (typically nightly).
