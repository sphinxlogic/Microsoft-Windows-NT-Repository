Here are the complete sources and a .a file for xloadimage.  The .a
can be compiled with

gcc -s -o xloadimage xloadimage.a -lXext -lX11 -lm

This can replace xsetroot, xsetbg, and so forth.  It handles a *lot*
of formats with aplomb.  The only problem I have had with it is that
it will use up memory *very* quickly when expanding images.  I have
only tested the .gif and .xbm modes, but I am confident the others
work.  Let me know how it works out!
