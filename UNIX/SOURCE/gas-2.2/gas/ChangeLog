	BFD_RELOC_MIPS_GPREL.  Added new case a.
	(set_at, load_register, macro): Changed calls to macro_build to
	pass new argument for i, j and o cases.

	the .subspace directive.  Likewise for the section alignment.
	Pass the current space to update_subspace and create_new_subspace.
	(pa_spaces_begin): Only use space/subspace aliases if USE_ALIASES
	is true.  When not using aliases, create a BFD section for each
	subspace encountered.  When not using aliases replace the default
	text, data, and bss segments with new ones.
	(create_new_subspace): When not using aliases each subspace has a

	in favor of more specific names.  (E.g., when we get Alpha
	support, we'll still only support VMS for Vax.)

	* config/tc-sparc.c (md_end): Function deleted.
	(BFD_RELOC_*): Delete macros that used to help keep the non-bfd

	through inclusion of tc-hppa.h.  Delete all forward declarations
	for functions only used within tc-hppa.c, likewise for structures,
	variables, and #defines.  Try to group OBJ_ELF and OBJ_SOM
	conditional code in a few small places.

	* config/tc-hppa.c: Major cleanup.  Use GNU-style comments.  Group
	structures, global variables, forward declarations together.
	Reduce (or in some cases eliminate) OBJ_ELF and OBJ_SOM
	conditional code -- try to group conditional code together
	into a few places.   Make all functions and variables which
	are only used within tc-hppa.c static.  PARAMize all functions.
	Add comments to functions.  Delete unused functions, variables,
	#defines, etc.  Delete unused members within structures.  Delete
	ldil;ble hacks -- it is believed they were installed to work
	around old gas bugs.   Avoid using mixed case for local
	functions, variables, and structures.  Fix formatting problems
	not found by GNU-indent.  Add FIXME notices for things which
	should be worked on the near future.  Delete lots of old
	useless (1.36 PA-SOM) code.  

	* config/tc-hppa.c: (fix_new_hppa): Initialize the fx_r_type

	ore.

	prototypes for all static functions.  Moved existing minimal
	debugging format support info #ifndef OBJ_ECOFF blocks.
	(macro_build_lui): Eliminated sign_extend argument, because ECOFF

	current segment as an argument.  (Ignored in all cases but VMS.)
	All callers and definitions changed.

Tue Mar  2 11:56:19 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	Should use aout.

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Depends on configure.in.

	* config/tc-mips.c (append_insn): Don't check for alignment of
	frag in memory; alignment of instructions in section is a separate
	matter.

	* config/tc-mips.c (macro_build_lui): Fix some assumptions of ANSI
	C availability.

	* listing.h: Always provide function declarations, not macros, so
	pcc won't lose.

	  "ifdef OBJ_VMS".
	* expr.c: Add "const" modifier to hex_value.
	* symbols.c: Finish conversion to S_* macros in the VMS only
	  parts of the program.  Add "const" modifier to
	  md_[long,short]_jump_size. Remove declaration of const_flag
	  (which will be declared in obj-vms.h).
	* write.c: Add "const" modifier to md_[long,short]_jump_size.
	  Fix arguments to VMS_write_object_file.
	* config-gas.com: New file.  Script for VMS systems to set up the

	  stabs directives.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_write_object_file): Define all vtable psects

	  versions.
	* bignum-copy.c (bignum_copy): Fix bug where we pad with zeroes.

Wed Dec 30 10:18:57 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* app.c, config/tc-*.c: Don't include read.h, since it is already
	included by as.h.

	* These are based on patches from Minh Tran-le
	<mtranle@paris.intellicorp.com>.
	* configure.in (i[34]86-ibm-aix*): Accept i486 for host.  Use
	obj_format coffbfd and gas_target i386coff for target.
	(i[34]86-*-isc*): New host (uses sysv).
	* config/i386aix.mt: Removed (no longer used).
	* config/mh-i386aix (RANLIB): Use true rather than /bin/true.
	(MINUS_G): Removed.
	(LDFLAGS): Added, defined as -shlib.

	* config/te-sco386.h (LOCAL_LABEL): Don't define.
	(DOT_LABEL_PREFIX): Define.
	* expr.c (operand): If DOT_LABEL_PREFIX, use .L0\001 as a label
	name rather than L0\001.
	* read.c (s_lcomm): Make a frag in SEG_BSS rather than using
	local_bss_counter.
	* symbols.c, symbols.h (local_bss_counter): Removed.

	local_bss_counter.  Pass correct data and bss size to
	VMS_write_object_file.
	* config/obj-vms.c (VMS_write_object_file): Accept bss size as
	argument, rather than using local_bss_counter.
	* config/tc-m88k.c (s_bss): Don't use local_bss_counter.
	* config/tc-sparc.c (s_reserve): Don't use local_bss_counter.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (had_lineno, had_reloc): Removed.
	(size_section): Restored sanity check.
	(do_relocs_for): Base section address on s_paddr rather than
	computing it.  Adjust a29k R_IHIHALF special case to account for
	section paddr (used to require paddr to be zero).  If there are no
	reclos, set s_relptr to 0.  Set relocation size in object_headers.
	(fill_section): Always set s_vaddr here, removing
	ZERO_BASED_SEGMENTS case.  Force s_scnptr for bss to 0.  Don't set

	H_{SET,GET}_* macros.
	(do_linenos_for): Set lineno size in object_headers.
	(write_object_file): Use H_{SET,GET}_* macros.  Don't bother to
	set s_vaddr here.  If string_byte_count remains 4, set it back to
	0, and only write strings out if there are some.  Call
	fill_section before do_relocs_for and do_linenos_for.
	(obj_coff_section): Handle optional quoted second argument giving
	section characteristics.
	(obj_coff_bss): Added to handle .bss.
	(obj_coff_ident): Added to handle .ident (puts string in .comment
	section).
	(obj_coff_lcomm): Put common symbols in .bss, not .data.
	(fixup_mdeps): Change to segment.  Call frag_wane after
	md_convert_frag.
	(fixup_segment): Explicitly check S_IS_COMMON before making 386
	adjustment (already happened only for common symbols, but this is
	clearer).
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h (OBJ_COFF_OMIT_OPTIONAL_HEADER): Define.
	* config/tc-i386.c (s_bss): Don't use if I386COFF.

	and "0b".  If LOCAL_LABELS_DOLLAR, check for "0$".

	* config/obj-coff.h: Don't use #elif.

	* config/ho-sunos.h: Don't include sys/stdtypes.h; 4.0.3 doesn't
	have it.  (Reported by Noah Friedman, friedman@gnu.ai.mit.edu.)

	never set segment address for SEG_E2 (.bss) and don't write out
	SEG_E2 contents.  Set .init and .fini sections to STYP_TEXT.
	(obj_coff_endef): Don't merge labels or symbols awaiting forward
	definitions, and don't merge tags with non-tags.  Check for .bf
	rather than just checking whether the second character is b and
	the third character is f.
	(obj_coff_val): gcc can generate values which we don't handle
	correctly; discard information for now, since it only affects the
	debugging information.
	(tag_find_or_name): Don't insert tags in the symbol table.
	(yank_symbols): Don't merge labels.
	(write_object_file): Don't define SUB_SEGMENT_ALIGN if it is
	already defined.  Fill subsegments with NOP_OPCODE, not 0.  Don't
	set segment address if ZERO_BASED_SEGMENTS.
	(obj_coff_section): Accept and ignore a trailing quoted string, as
	used in AT&T i386 syntax.

	the strerror, like perror does.

Wed Sep  9 11:06:25 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: use gas_target instead of modifying target_cpu.
	From Steve Chamberlain:
	Makefile.in: Handle m68*-*-coff*.

	* messages.c (as_warn): Use fputs, not fprintf, with a buffer that

	(as_bad): Likewise.

Wed Aug 19 11:20:59 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* tc-m68k.c, tc-m68kmote.c: the cas2 instruction is supposed to be

	* config/tc-m68k.c (m68k_ip): If instruction is invalid for the
	selected architecture, print a message saying so and listing what
	processors support it, rather than saying "operands mismatch".

	characteristics have been), default to 68020.  Don't need extra
	quotes around error string.

Fri Jul 31 12:26:34 1992  Jim Wilson  (wilson@sphagnum.cygnus.com)

	* read.c (potable): Revert sac's incorrect change made Jul 13.

	* expr.c: If an expression is single comma, then return with
	SEG_ABSENT rather than an error - since the sparc front end does
	really strange things with things like fbge,a

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.
	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): don't core dump when there's no
	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on
	the H8.
	* config/tc-h8300.[ch] : fix bugs reported by HMSI, and make
	errors nices

Sat Feb 22 12:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.
	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.

Fri Feb 21 06:21:07 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: put header files before C source for TAGS; remove

	* obj-aout.c: do not include stab.gnu.h if NO_LISTING.

	* tc-i860.c, a.out.gnu.h: move i860 relocs to a proper place.

	* a.out.h: removed.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  Minh Tran-Le (TRANLE@INTELLICORP.COM)

	* symbols.c (local_label_name): symbols now start with ^A.

	* read.c, subsegs.c, write.c obj-coff.c: added handling of
	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

	* tc-i386.c: tc-i386.c: added handling of the following opcodes:
	  i/o opcodes - inb, inw, outb and outw.  string manipulation with
	  att syntax - scmp, slod, smov, ssca, ssto.

	* obj-coff.c: (for aix386) Moved the symbols .text, .data and .bss
	  to just after .file .

	  In obj_crawl_symbol_chain() where it tries to put the external
	  symbols apart, with the condition:
	    (!S_IS_DEFINED(symbolP) &&
	     !S_IS_DEBUG(symbolP) &&
	     !SF_GET_STATICS(symbolP))
	  it was moving too many symbols out. So I switch it back to the
	  condition:
	    (S_GET_STORAGE_CLASS(symbolP) == C_EXT && !SF_GET_FUNCTION(symbolP))

	  In obj_emit_relocations() added the conditional on KEEP_RELOC_INFO
	  so that we don't use the F_RELFLG which make the linker complain
	  that somebody has stripped the relocation info.

	  Also, the AIX ld program require that the relocation table
	  is sorted by r_vaddr like the standard ATT assembler does.

	  [he also changed the sizeof(struct ...)'s into the coff
	  style FOOSZ macros.  I'm not sure this is right, but I can't
	  remember why.  xoxorich.]

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install

Tue Feb 18 02:21:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

	* tc-m88k.[hc]: pulled in from hack's unfinished work.  These
	  aren't yet integrated.

	* tc-i860.[hc]: blew off the dust.  Something must still be done
	  about conflicting relocation types.

	* tc-ns32k.c: Replaced previous tc_aout_fix_to_chars stub with the
	  real thing.

	* tc-i960.c, tc-sparc.c: white space and comments only.

	* tc-a29k.h: delete duplicate macro definition.

	* new file atof-ns32k.c copied from hack's last unreleased gas.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.

	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
