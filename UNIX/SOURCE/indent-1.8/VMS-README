The rest of this file describes how to build indent under VMS.



If you are using GCC, you should run GNUC-MAKE.COM.

If you have VAXC on your machine, run VAXC-MAKE.COM, to create
indent.exe.  When compiling INDENT sources, VAXC will issue warning
messages about the length of some external identifiers. You can
ignore these warnings.

Set up symbol INDENT as a foreign command, for example:

    INDENT :== "$DUA0:[INDENT-DIR]INDENT.EXE"
