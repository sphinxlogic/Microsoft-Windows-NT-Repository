Release Notes for GNU indent version 1.8.

* VMS and MS-DOS are now supported.  Thanks to MEHRDAD@glum.dev.cf.ac.uk
  and hnyman@lesti.hut.fi for their contributions.

  Please note that I have no way of testing this code, and with slight
  modifications, have installed it "as is".

  Also, note that these systems do not use `configure'.  See the file
  VMS-README for details of the VMS installation.  For the MS-DOS
  version, it is expected that the compiler will recognize the define
  __MSDOS__ as being set.

* C++ comments are now recognized.  More C++ support will be
  forthcoming, possibly along with support for Objective C.

* Formatting can be disabled for sections of code by placing that code
  between lines containing the comments /* *INDENT-OFF* */ and
  /* *INDENT-ON* */ (this also works in C++ comments).  See the info
  node "Disabling Formatting" for more info.

* The processing of comments has been changed.  See the info node on
  "Comments" for a description.

* The default (i.e., GNU) behaviour of struct handling has been
  slightly changed.

* All reported bugs have been fixed.
