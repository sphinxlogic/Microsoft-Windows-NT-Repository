Thu Jun 25 08:50:17 1992  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at mumble.cs.Colorado.EDU)

	* Version 2.18.3

	* Dave Nichols Sez: Oops! I messed up. I forget to enclose the 4
	new files in my changes here they are. The new distribution won't
	compile without them.
    
	* Version 2.18.3

	* Changes By Dave Nichols. Stanford Exploration Project,
	dave@sep.stanford.edu. 6-24-92.

	Major changes to allow compliation with all possible DPS rendering
	types (DPS,NEWS,Ghostscript). The rendering method is chosen at run
	time. Three new entries in xtexResources, .useDPS, useNEWS
	and useGhostScript. Only one of these is set to true by the routine
	checkExtensions() in DviPage.c

	The Preamble resource is split into a gsPreamble and a not gs
	version. Maybe we will need separate preambles for NEWS and DPS at
	some time.

	The psfig{Begin,End,Plotfile} routines call a renderer dependent
	routine chosen at runtime. (comment, more of the renderer independent
	code could be moved into these routines to prevent code duplication
	but I didn't have the stamina to do this.)

	The user can set the useGhostScript resource to force ghostscript
	rendering. If they do not it will try DPS, then NEWS, then
	ghostscript. DPS and NEWS rendering code is split into two new source
	files with corresponding header files.  DviPageNEWS.[ch] and
	DviPageDPS.[ch] ( The NEWS file will need updates for OpenWindows-3.0
	). The "epsf plots upwards" support was moved to psfigBegin**** so
	that it would work for DPS and NEWS as well.

	Changed the Imakefile to support linking with everything.

	Other changes: Fixed the setting of the DISPLAY environment variable
	for ghostscript so that xtex -display ... works OK.

	Turn off button and keyboard sensitivity while drawing a page, this
	is because impatient users keep hitting the return key while
	ghostscript is plotting a figure so they never get to see it.

	In DviPage.c I changed the backing_store check to check the
	backing_store member and not the save_under member. save_under only
	takes True or False. I still don't understand why backing store seems
	to work except when the obscurung window is a top-level widget (the
	most common case). This is using tvtwm and "*BackingStore: Always".

	In mark.c the busyCursor stuff check how many "busy" calls are
	outstanding so that it doesn't turn off the clock cursor prematurely.

	In mark.c I activated the XtAppNextEvent stuff for R5 and later.

Tue Jun 23 14:28:55 1992  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald@foobar.cs.Colorado.EDU)

	* Installed Vivek Kheras (khera@cs.duke.edu) changed to support
	EPSF specials. His comments follow:
 
	the files modified in this set of patches is: DviPage2.c and
	DviPageGS-2.c. here's a summary of what the patches below do (for
	xtex 2.18.0):

	specials of the form ``PSfile=foo.ps llx=0 lly=0 urx=257 ury=144
	rwi=2570'' are recognized.  these are specials output by the
	\epsfbox{} macro from the epsf.sty which comes with dvips.  These
	are recognized and handled even if you don't have a PostScript
	interpreter by just drawing an empty box.  I have no idea if this
        works under the DPS versions, but it does work under GhostScript.

	The only thing i don't like that much about the code is the bit
	about the MAGIC_CONSTANT.  i have no idea whatsoever what this
	value represents, but by comparing the output of \psfig{} and
	\epsfbox{} for the same figure at the same scale factors, i
	empirically figured out this constant.  if the PostScript file is
	not found while xtex is running (and we are using GhostScript to
	image it), it will detect this and just draw a grey box instead of
	causing the ghostscript interpreter to fail loudly when it
	attempts to open the file.


	i also did a little bit of cleaning up of the scaling calculation
	code since the values being used were always cast to floats, while
	they were stored as ints. just changed them all to be doubles to
	improve precision and speed (at least for k&r C compilers which
	must convert floats to doubles before doing the calculation.)


	* Version 2.18.0 released

	* Included code from Shankar Ramamoorthy (shankar@cse.ucsc.edu) to
	support ghostscript (rather than e.g., DPS)

Thu Jun 20 12:15:39 1991  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at mumble.Colorado.EDU)

	* (xtex.c, DviPage2.c, page.c) Added -showPostScript resource,
	defaults to true; also added actions to enable/disable showing of
	postscript from the menu. This speeds up previewing if you don't
	always care about postscript.

Tue May  7 08:22:33 1991  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar.Colorado.EDU)

	* (dvi-simple.c) Don't barf on missing TFMPATH environment variable.

	* (Imakefile) move clean:: dep for DPS_OBJ into #ifdef, to avoid
	problems on non-DPS platforms 

Wed Apr 24 12:51:17 1991  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar.Colorado.EDU)

	* Minor patches, upgrade to 2.17.1

Tue Feb 19 15:04:20 1991  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar.Colorado.EDU)

      * Problems found and fixed as of 2/19/91 by Andreas Stolcke
        (stolcke@icsi.berkeley.edu)

      * Xtex/xtex.c: main() -- properly strip argv[0] to obtain ProgName.
        avoid dereferencing argv[1] without checking argc > 2 first 

      * Xtex/mark.c:
	TeXSystemCallRead() -- make select/read loop to catch ALL child
	process output. 

	TeXSystemCall() -- place TeXSystemCallRead() in polling loop to
	avoid child blocking due to pipe overflow.  Also allows progress
	of child process to be monitored in message window.

	* Xtex/dialog.c: DialogMessage() -- used to dump core in
	XtGetValues(). Fixed after letting XawTextReplace() do all text
	editing, including deletions to make room for new output. 

	* Xtex/DviPage2.c:
	psfigEnd() --
		NeWS call was not conditional on DPS extension, caused core
		dump under MIT server.

	* Xtex/Xtex.AD:
	removed class specifier from makeFont resource.
	replaced all color names by black/white to avoid indistinguishable
	colors on monochrome diaplays.

	* Xtex/TeXtoXfont.SCRIPT:
	check for MIT server and fall back on standard snf format if so.
	Allows xtex and TeXtoXfont to be used with both MIT and proprietary
	server (e.g., XNeWS).  Things would be easier if Xtex knew about
	the existence of two sets of servers, MIT and vendor. It would
	know about 2 fontpaths, 2 TeXtoXfont scripts, etc.

	* Xtex/Imakefile:
	Add -u _xv_psview_pkg to News DPS_LIB to avoid undefined symbol
	error from run-lime linker.
	Add install target for style file installation.

	* Texsun/texsun.c:
	Changed defaultTexsunPrint to use standard BSD spooler command.

	* Imake.Config:
	-o option to convertfont expects filename without .fb suffix.
	-f 64 option to bldfamily avoids filename compression.
	bldfamily output too verbose, to /dev/null (lists all fonts in
	directory).
	MIT's X_FONT_MAKE_DIR is called mkfontdir.
	Define TEX_BINDIR and TEX_MANDIR directories for non-X utilities to be
	installed separately.
	Define TEXINPUTS for style file installation.
	Define common paths (LIBTEXROOT,LIBTEXSRC,LIBTEX,DEPLIBTEX) here
	instead of in Imakefiles.

	* Imakefile:
	use $(MAKE) for recursive makes to allow non-standard make use.

	* */Imakefile:
	Common paths put in Imake.Config.
	Format streamlined to MIT conventions, use specialized macros
	(SimpleProgramTarget).
	Allow non-X programs to be installed in separate directories.

Mon Feb 11 17:04:48 1991  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar.Colorado.EDU)

	* DviPage, Xtex.AD, etc - Integrate Steve Cole's changes to
	support open windows postscript display.

Thu Feb  7 17:26:32 1991  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar.Colorado.EDU)

	* x11fonts.c - Add code from mjk to produce fonts if not found. I
	changed the interface considerably to also confirm w/the user that
	he wants to create the font and to use extant xtex functions.

Tue Jan 15 14:21:11 1991  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar.Colorado.EDU)

	* (IMakefile, Imake.Config) - added XTEX_FONT_PATH to Imake.Config
	and changed Imakefile to modify Xtex.ad, substituting XTEX_FONT_PATH.

	* (fontpath.c) added file to add site-specific font paths to the
	server font path. This is less than optimal, and people should
	really do this themselves. However, everyone wanted the option.
	(xtex.c) added -fontPath as well.

Mon Oct 29 16:01:35 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* mark.c - Make the ``print'' function expand %f to the file name.
	If no file name is requested in the string, simply append the file
	name.

	* dvip-simple.c - correct constant for centimeters.

	* DviPage.c - use XDrawImageString rather than XDrawString to have
	correct background painted on color machines (WFS@texas.edu)

Thu Sep 27 18:17:56 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* x11font.{c,h} - fix to make MAX_SHRINK be computed automatically
	and fix TeXFontNewFile().

Thu Aug 23 13:06:49 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (mio.h) __STDC__ -> __GNUC__ for inlines.

	* (mark.c) make cursor busy/non-busy around system call. Code came
	from nichols@hanauma.stanford.edu

Fri Aug 10 16:40:59 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (xtex.c) removed hoffset/voffset aliases for leftOffset and
	topOffset because they caused left/top to not work correctly.

	* (page.c) fixed it so you're left with a non-blank display while
	fonts are loaded.

Mon Aug  6 15:36:39 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (page.c) unmapped/mapped the ViewPort widget before fiddling
	with the DviPage size; this briefly leaves you with a blank
	display, but reduces the number of repaints needed. This is A Good
	Thing when using DPS or Ghostscript.

Thu Aug  2 14:38:14 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* added boxColor resource so boxes show up on color workstations.

Wed Jul 25 10:37:22 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Installed patches by kagotani@hohoi.cs.titech.ac.jp to 
	  + (Xtex/Dvipage.c) set line_width = 0 to speed up ruler
	  + (page.c) made vertbar/horizbar work better
	  + possible bug on index of per_char[], because not all tex fonts
	    start at 0.

Tue Jul 10 15:03:37 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Upgraded to new McTeX library

Thu Jul  5 12:07:42 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* released 2.15.4

	* (DviPage.c, dvi-simple.h, dvi-simple.c) add patches to correct
	ruler for different Numerator & Denominator values.

	* (DviPage.c, dvi-simple.h, dvi-simple.c) add patch from johan
	widen (jw@sics.se) to grab Numerator & Denominator from DVI file
	rather than using the TeX constants. This adds support for 'groff'
	output formatted using -Tdvi.

	* (Valuator.c) add patch from johan widen (jw@sics.se) to avoid
	possible divide by zero.

Wed Jun 20 15:08:47 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* remove maxDrift resource & change things to keep drift less than
	a single pixel.

Mon Apr 30 12:40:30 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (page2.c) Implemented 'page stacks', and two actions to push and
	pop items from the page stack. This lets you move around (using,
	e.g., buttons) and return to whence you came. Also wrote
	'xtex.sty', which uses the buttons to push to references and
	citation labels.

	* (DviPage2.c) - Implemented buttons and page stack. Buttons
	are signaled by 'xtex' specials, and associate an action string
	with a region of the display.

Wed Apr 25 11:58:37 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (DviPage2.c) - Include changes by Martin Jourdan (tpic2 support)
	- see comments in DviPage2.c.

Wed Apr  4 12:57:53 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* added pushOnStart resoure to allow a page to be popped
	  up when you start xtex. (xtex.c, xtex.h, Xtex.ad, xtex.man)

Mon Apr  2 12:43:52 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Considerably cleaned up display postscript code with
	assistance from kent@wsl.dec.com.

	* Remove optional ``table widget'' support.

	* Remove X11R3 support, DECwindows support. Only X11R4
	  with possible option of DisplayPostscript.

Thu Mar 15 13:13:51 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (mark.c) put quotes around file names in call to dviselect to
	  allow files with '#' as leading character (for latex-mode).

	* (DviPage) use GXcopy as suggested by Matthieu Devin;
	much simpler & it is significantly faster on things like
	color sparcstations.

Fri Feb 16 14:25:07 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (Xtex.ad) Added default display postscript preamble,
	  stole it from dvips (rokicki) with some mods.

	* (Makefile) Added configuration option for display postscript.

	* (DviPage.h, DviPage.c, DviPage2.c) - added DisplayPostscript
	  support for included psfig postscript. No other postscript
	  specials supported.

Fri Feb  2 11:49:38 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Added menu to select scale units.

	* Added scaleUnits resource to control ruler.

	* Added ruler to DviPage.c using Label widget.
	  Very slow. Might want to go back to creating a private window.

Thu Jan 25 11:49:54 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (page.c) - fix auto-resize policy to avoid extra scroll bar
	  and not resize on each page for/back-ward

	* (mark.c) - make mark-push/mark-pop also update the mark display.

	* (EzMenu, page.c) - added menus package

	* (DviPage.c) changed placement computation to check if new
	character puts us over the drift threshold, as opposed to if the
	current string is over the threshold. This makes placement more
	exact. 

Thu Jan  4 19:45:19 1990  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (DviPageP.h) change maxDriftString from int to char*

	* (DviPage.c) Add resource to control depth of DviPage. Don't know
	if there is a default for this or not.

Wed Dec 20 13:47:56 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (page.c, Xtex.ad) move valuator parameters to defaults file

Tue Dec 19 15:12:50 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (page.c) make the goto-popup cancel/confirm buttons use action
	procesures for consistency

	* (page.c, Xtex.ad) made many more layout decisions be in the
	application defaults file.

	* (page.c) added a string-query popup to verify the printing
	mechanism and to allow you to cancel printing.
	

Mon Dec 18 13:25:00 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (page.c) added a goto-popup using my valuator widget.

Tue Dec 12 14:06:54 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* renamed TeXxResources -> xtexResources

	* no longer use TEXFONTS in the makefile; now uses
	  xtexResources.tfmPath to find TFM fonts.

Sun Nov 26 22:19:49 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Argle. XeT taken. Use xtex instead.

Fri Nov 24 17:20:08 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Repackage Imakefiles for X11R4

	* Renamed texx2 -> XeT for X11R4

Tue Nov 14 10:20:16 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Fix problem in DviPage::DviDisplay, where I forgot to initialize
	startHH and startVV when starting a new cached string. Also, flush
	the string cache before more actions (specials & the like).

Mon Oct 30 11:25:31 1989  Dana A. Chee  (dana at dino)

	* (mark.c) add parens around summation so that amount of space
	  malloced is correct.

	* (file.c) add amounts to strncpys

Fri Oct 27 20:38:53 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Released as 2.10

	* Added a menu box showing the pages marked for printing.

	* Flush pending character cache when doing right/down movements.
	This makes umlates work correctly.

	* Clean up ``flushing the pending character cache'' in DviPage.c,
	adding routine DviDisplayFlush & wrapping much stuff in structure.

	* Fixed computation of spPerDot in DviPage - makes for longer runs
	of characters (typically entire words now). Much faster.

	* Make dialog clear box an option, since the dialog code works
	correctly now.

	* Allow use of the Table widget rather than form.

Thu Oct  5 15:16:17 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (many files) made all interaction with the program occur
	  though action procedures. Enhanced printing options, page
	  marking (now has stack & push/pop of marked pages),
	  magnification interface, etc. Now *requires* application
	  default file.

	* (dialog.c) improved dialog code by deleteing top lines
	  rather than entire dialog when dialog is full.

	* (all files) renamed files

	* (texx2-error.c) includes Ultrix as knowing about vsprintf.

	* Following bugfixes from: Hiroto Kagotani (kagotani@cs.titech.ac.jp)

	* (dvi-simple.c) FALSE incorrectly defined, but not used.

	* (DviPage.c) possible to over-run dvi stack space,
	  increase allocate stack space.

Sun Aug  6 23:39:11 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* (DviPage.c) Check that charwidth table exists before
	  ref'ing it. If it doesn't, assume chars take maximum
	  width (does this always exist?). Fix for PC/RT AIX/X11R2.

	* (texx2-error.c) From: Mark Davies <mark@comp.vuw.ac.nz>
	  Include hpux as knowing about vsprintf.

Wed Jul  5 08:47:06 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Added distinction between horizontal and vertical dpi
	  because many monitors (Sun lores) aren't uniform.

Sat Jun 10 16:34:59 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Released as 2.9

	* (texx2-page.c) when reloading document, you return to proper
	  logical page, not the physical page.

Tue Jun  6 12:16:55 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* (texx2-font.c) make font names always be in lower-case

	* (many) added actions & ability to not show buttons on the
	  dvi page. This lets us view entire pages at once.

	* (many) added options to set topOffset & leftOffset.

Wed May 31 08:47:18 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* (texx2.c) add -pageMaxWd and -pageMaxHt options to set max
	  popup size of dvipage.

	* (texx2-page.c) removed ``resize'' and ``resizable'' attributes,
	  putting them into the .ad file.

	* (dvi-simple.c) regiserFont - fix OBO in font width compute loop.

Tue May 16 12:01:12 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* repackaged as 2.8.7

	* made glyph placement know about actual width of glyphs;
	  improves placement, making document look better.

	* added MaxDrift resource to DviPage.h

Mon May 15 15:10:36 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* repackaged as 2.8.6

	* installed accelerators, provided default Texx2.ad.
	  accelerators between the DviPage and every button
	  on that page. accelerators between the filename
	  input buffer and everything on that page.

	* fixed texx2-page.c, file pushForwardButton to not let you
	  walk past last page (OBO).

Tue Feb 28 18:41:45 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* repackeged as 2.8.5

	* (texx2-font.c) Calculation of mag ignored mag specified in
	  document. Fixed.

	* (texx2-file.c) Made the file name be stuffed into the input box

Sun Feb 26 16:44:46 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Compensate for scroll-bars. Now, mag=333 on a sun3 gets rid
	  of horiz scroll.

Sat Feb 25 13:19:50 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* texx2-page.c - added TeXPageSlamPages, in case we fail
	  to open a file and need to close exising windows. If we
	  don't, they can move around or redisplay, referencing dead
	  data structures.

	* texx2-page.c - reopening a file now leaves pages at the same
	  page number in the new file. this means you don't have to
	  reposition yourself when you open a file.

	* Released as 2.8

	* texx2-page.c - split TeXPageNewFile into two parts, because
	  value of DviTotalPages changes after an open, causing
	  bogus free().

	* texx2.c - stat the command line file name to make certain
	  it's a regular file before doing a setFile

	* texx2-mark.c - plug last double free? Now explicitly zero variables
	  after *all* frees.

Fri Feb 24 14:47:13 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

        * Released as 2.7

	* texx2.c - allow single argument to set the file name

	* DviPage.c - fix problem with inlines & optimization. Fontdefs
	  weren't being skipper properly, causing font names to be displayed.

	* texx2-page.c - optimize tied pages for single-page-ahead
	  with foreward travel (avoid freeing next page until it gets it)

	* texx2-page.c - fix double free in TeXPageNewFile (forgot to zero)

	* dvi-simple.c - fix double free for DviCount (forgot to zero)

	* dvi-simple.c - use strncpy

	* texx2-page.c - found out about XtNallowShellResize.
	  remove include of ShellP.h

	* texx2-font.c - reverse order of -mag and -scaled in error
	  message to make cut & paste buildfonts easier

	* Imakefile - remove tabs

	* texx2-error.c - Apply patch from Dana to fix over-write of
	  dialog box.

	* DviPage.c, DviPage2.c - removed setGC, use single globalGC
	  which is rebuilt on each redisplay.

	* DviPageP.h - removed `clearGC', renamed setGC to globalGC

	* texx2-file.c - merged BuildPageLevel into BuildFileLevel.

Fri Feb 24 14:50:36 1989  Dana A. Chee  (dana at dino)

	* texx2-error.c - removed unneeded resource XtNresize (not used in
	  text widgets).
	  
	* texx2-file.c - changed strcpy to proper strncpy; created widgets
	  in order used for chaining (Form widget goes through child list
	  once to place children, if the order of their chaining is
	  different from their creation order, the results will not be
	  satisfactory).

	* texx2-widgets.c - let widgets dimension the form; build widgets
	  in correct order for chaining (Page within File now, see above
	  reasons).

	* texx2.c - use proper program and class names for XtInitialize.

Thur Feb 23 17:30:10 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* texx2-page.c - Added `large' and `small' buttons
	* texx2.c - Added `largeMag' and `smallMag' resources

Sun Feb 19 17:30:10 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Released as 2.5

	* Added `clear marks' button

	* Fixed error in DviPageWidget - wasn't setting the setGC
	  properly, causing redraws to fail when not using backing store

	* Changed all args to widgets to be built use XtSetArg instead of
	automatic aggregate initializations.

	* Changed all callbacks to be built using XtAddCallback instead
	of automatic aggregate initializations.

	* Changes texx2-error.c to build a temporary _iobuf structure
	for _doprnt to print erorr messages if vsprintf is unavailable.

	* (texx2-page.c) made pushGotoButton goto the page with a count[0]
	field matching the selected page number, as opposed to the ordinal
	page number.
