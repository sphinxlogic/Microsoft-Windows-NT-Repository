Scripto is a program for building cursive writing from text.  To run scripto,
the file scripto.set must be in the current directory.  You may run scripto
interactively by starting the program and entering any readable text.  The
cursive equivalent will appear on the screen.  Of course, input and output may
be redirected so it is possible to type cursive to disk by running this way:
"scripto >cursive.txt" or disk to disk using "scripto <input.txt >output.txt"
or to printer with "scripto >prn" (note: when writing to printer - dot matrix
only - compressed mode is recommended).

If you wish, you may add or change the "font" dataset: scripto.set. After
looking at a few examples, it should become obvious how a font is stored.
Each character uses the same number of lines.  The "@" sometimes found on the
"base" line marks where the next cursive letter would be written.  It is a
primitive form of proportional spacing.

Enjoy!
