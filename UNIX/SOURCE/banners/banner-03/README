banr is a banner program with a relatively small (4 line) font.  It uses the
terminal's underline capability (from termcap) if found and not suppressed
(with -n) to produce a more readable font.

This program is in the public domain.  Do whatever you want with/to it.

Installation:

	Compile with "make".

	It was successfully built on SunOS 3.5 - 4.1.1.

	rindex() can be replaced by strrchr() [or throw it away -- it doesn't
	do anything important].

Included are test/demonstration files produced by:

	banr -n < banr.f0 > banr.f1
	banr < banr.f0 > banr.f2	(on an xterm)
