                         Banner: The ultimative banner
                         =============================

Revision history:

1.00 -- Written in 1987 by Wolfgang Ocker, reccoware systems, Puchheim.
1.01 -- Tested on OS-9/68000, SunOS, System V 3.2.
1.02 -- Some cleanups by Frank Kaefer (fkk@stasys.sta.sub.org).
1.10 -- Paul E. Black (paul@delfin.com):
        - Added a C interface to the banner routine itself so it
          can be linked with an application.  The user interface now
          sets flags and calls the C interface.
        - Letters can be any height, not just single or double.
        - Multi-height italic are smoother: it shifts one column per
          printed row rather than one double-column per double-row.
        - Cleaned up and sped up some of the low level loops some what.
1.11 -- Banner is now under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE,
        Version 2, June 1991 (fkk)
