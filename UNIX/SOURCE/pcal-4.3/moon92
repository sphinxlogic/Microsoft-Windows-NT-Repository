# 1992 moon phase information for Pcal (from Old Farmer's Almanac)
#
# This file is to be called .moon92 (or moon92) for Un*x, moon92.dat for VMS;
# it is to live in the same directory as the .calendar file or in the directory
# where the Pcal executable lives.
#
# Moon file syntax:
#
#	The user may enter the dates and (optionally) times of quarter
#	moons (from a reliable source such as an almanac or astronomical
#	table) into a file called .moon%y (moon%y.dat on VMS), where %y is
#	the last two digits of the year.  If such a file exists (in the
#	same directory as the date file, or in the directory where Pcal
#	itself lives), Pcal will interpolate the phase of the moon from the
#	information in this file instead of using the default algorithm.
#
#	(Pcal originally used an extremely simplistic moon phase algorithm;
#	the moon file was added to v4.0 to enable Pcal to interpolate the
#	phase of the moon from the [presumably more accurate] information
#	within.  More recently, the original moon phase algorithm was
#	superseded by an astronomer-strength version, largely obviating
#	the need for a moon file; however, it will continue to be
#	supported for the foreseeable future.)
#
#	Entries in the moon file must conform to the following syntax:
#
#	  if -A flag (American date formats) specified:
#	    <quarter> <month><sep><day> {<hour><sep><min>}
#
#	  if -E flag (European date formats) specified:
#	    <quarter> <day><sep><month> {<hour><sep><min>}
#
#	where
#
#	  <quarter> := "nm", "fq" or "1q", "fm", "lq" or "3q" (new
#			moon, first quarter, full moon, last quarter)
#	  <hour>    := number 0-23 (24-hour clock)
#	  <min>     := number 0-59
#
#	This file must contain entries for all quarter moons in the year,
#	in chronological order; if any errors are encountered, Pcal will
#	revert to using its default algorithm.
#
#	As in the date file, comments start with '#' and run through
#	end-of-line.  
#
# Dates and times below are for Boston (EST), in -A format; you may wish to
# adjust these dates and times to conform to your location.
