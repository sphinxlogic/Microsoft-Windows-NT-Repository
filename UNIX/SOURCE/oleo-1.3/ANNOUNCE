This is beta release 1.3 of GNU Oleo.  

Oleo is a spreadsheet program (better for you than the more expensive
spreadsheet).  It supports X windows and character-based terminals,
and can generate embedded Postscript renditions of spreadsheets.
Keybindings should be familiar to Emacs users and are configurable by
users.

I believe all reported bugs have been fixed; if you spot a bug from a
previous release, please re-report that bug.

This release introduces many new features.  

- On line help.  ^H is the help prefix.  ^H ^W creates a wallchart of
  keybindings.

- Oleo speaks gnuplot.  The prefix M-g leads to a menu of commands for
  drawing graphs.

- Tax forms.  The first spreadsheet contributed by a volunteer: 1992
  federal and State of Connecticut tax forms.  Load the file `irs-1992.oleo'.

- The keybindings are more Emacs-like.

The file NEWS describes these changes in more detail.

The file USING is the only manual-type documentation there is at this
time.  It is somewhat out of date.  The on-line documentation is more
up to date.

Future plans include:
  - More options for postscript printing than just EPS.

  - Incrementally improving the Oleo command set and display interface.

  - Extending the data model to support
    - Multiple spreadsheet files (like multiple buffers in Emacs).
    - Multiple named variables and arrays within a single file
      (or shared by multiple files).
    - Symbolic addressing (rather than only row/column addressing).

  - A volunteer has offered to work on a manual for Oleo.
