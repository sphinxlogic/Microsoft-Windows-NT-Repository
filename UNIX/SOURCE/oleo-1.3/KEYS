			   General Utility

Abort the current command, or partial keysequence	 ^G
Set repeat counts and other prefix arguments		 ^U
Jane, stop this crazy thing				 ^X ^C
Redraw the screen					 ^L
Suspend Oleo						 ^Z
Call a command by name					 ^[ x
Recalculate						 ^X !


			    Help Commands

Describe key briefly	 ^H c
Describe key		 ^H k
Describe function	 ^H f
Describe formula	 ^H F
Where is		 ^H w


When a complex command is being invoked (i.e., when Oleo is prompting
you for arguments), the next command displays documentation for the
command being invoked.  This can often be used to get more information
about what is being prompted for:

Help with command	 ^H C



			  Cell Cursor Motion

Every window has it's own cell cursor.  The most recently used window
defines the current cell position.  There is one cell marker, global to 
the spreadsheet.

Move the cell cursor to a specific address		 ^X j
Set the cell cursor and the cell mark			 ^[ j

Set the cell mark to the current cell			 ^@
(to set the cell cursor equal to the mark, and clear the mark,
 use ` ^U ^@').

Exchange the cell cursor and cell mark			 ^X ^X
(To clear the mark, use ` ^U ^X ^X'.)



			      Navigation

Under X, and on some terminals (those following the ANSI standard)
arrow keys can be used to move the cell cursor.

up	 ^P		down	 ^N
right	 ^F		left	 ^B

Though they have no default bindings, there are also the commands:
   upright-cell, upleft-cell, downright-cell, downleft-cell

Some commands go to extremes but leave their mark (if none is already set):

Upper left	 ^[ <
Lower right	 ^[ >

Beginning of row	 ^A
Beginning of col	 ^[ ^A
End of row		 ^E
End of col		 ^[ ^E

These commands find the boundries between filled and empty cells. They
are similar to word motion commands in Emacs.

Scan up		 ^[ p
Scan down	 ^[ n
Scan right	 ^[ f
Scan left	 ^[ b


			  Scrolling commands

These are used to change the visible range of a window.

Scroll up	 ^[ v
Scroll down	 ^V
Scroll right	 ^X >
Scroll left	 ^X <

These commands are also availble but not normally bound:
scroll-upright, scroll-upleft, scroll-downright, scroll-downleft



		      Commands related to macros

Oleo can read keystrokes, and can save keysequences in cells for later
re-execution.
  
Start entering macro	 ^X (
Stop entering macro	 ^X )
Call last kbd macro	 ^X e
M-x end-macro
Store last macro	 ^X =
M-x run-string-as-macro



			    Global options

These are global parameters under user control (e.g. The a0/noa0
option that selects a syntax for cell addresses (either A1 or R1C1)).

Show options		 ^H o
M-x set-option



			      Variables

Variables are symbolic names for regions of a spreadsheet.  Once
defined, they can be used in cell formulas as region addresses.  They
can also be used as arguments to any command that expects a region
address.

Set variable		 ^X :
Show variable		 ^H v
Show all variables	 ^H ^V



			    File commands

Read a spreadsheet	 ^X ^V
Save a spreadsheet	 ^X ^S
Merge spreadsheet	 ^X i
M-x write-region-to-file

By default, if a spreadsheet defines a variable `load_hooks', the
macro in that region is executed when the spreadsheet is first read.
This behavior can be disabled or reinabled by:

M-x toggle-load-hooks

The next command reads a file of commands (such as a .oleorc file):

M-x read-commands



			       Printing

Write an ascii rendition of a region			 ^[ ^P a
Write an embedded postscript rendition of a region	 ^[ ^P p p
Set page size for postscript printing			 ^[ ^P p s



			       Plotting

The command ` ^[ g' accesses the Oleo interface to gnuplot.  If
you have gnuplot, you can draw graphs of Oleo data, either on the
screen, or in postscript.

			    Editting cells

Edit cell			 =
Set region formula		 ^[ =

Delete cell			 ^?
Delete region			 ^[ ^?

M-x clear-spreadsheet

From the main keymap, typing almost any printable character begins 
to edit the value of a cell.

These commands provide efficent motion while editting cells:

Next edit			 ^I
Next edit-set			 ^J


These commands set the directions used by ` ^I' and
` ^J': 

Auto move up			 ^X m ^
Auto move down			 ^X m v
Auto move left			 ^X m <
Auto move right			 ^X m >
Auto move up left		 ^X m `
Auto move up right		 ^X m '
Auto move down left		 ^X m /
Auto move down right		 ^X m \
Auto move no motion		 ^X m
