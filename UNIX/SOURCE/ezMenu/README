		README for EZMENU - Menu Widgets with Resources

DESCRIPTION:

    The EzMenu package provides a resource manager interface to the Athena
    simpleMenuWidgets. This code is lifted from the xtex distribution,
    copyright 1989 by Dirk Grunwald. The EzMenu code is itself straight out
    of the X distribution, hence requiring the following disclaimer, to which
    I needn't add anything. I just wrote a short man page.

    27 Feb 1991: gf: Removed use of whitespace to separate arguments in
		     action specs, otherwise it's too hard to quote them
		     and escape the quotes when needed. Comma is the only
		     separator now.

INSTALLATION:

     1. Edit the Imakefile to reflect any changes for your site. For
	example, by default the library created will be of the form

		libezMenu-sparc.a

	for example, where "-sparc" comes form the $(TARGET_MACH) variable
	defined in Sun make. If you only use one architecture, or want
	to make separate targets for separate architectures, just edit
	or duplicate and edit the single target.

     2. Execute
		% xmkmf
	to create the Makefile.

     3. Execute
		% make depend
	to add the dependencies to the Makefile. This is optional for
	this package unless you edit the header files.

     4. Make the package using
		% make
