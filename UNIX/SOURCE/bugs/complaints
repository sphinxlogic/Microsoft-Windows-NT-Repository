	1) Sockets emulation doesn't work right.

	2) Some dork put a bogus /usr/include/link.h file on UNIXware so
	   gdb won't compile till you steal the proper link.h file from
	   SVR4.0 systems or stock USL 4.2.

	3) Another genius wiped out the beautiful "Catch the Wave" pixmap
	   in /usr/X/lib/pixmaps/usl128.xpm and replaced it with that
	   awful UNIXware puke-me-out-the-door red logo. You need to snarf
	   this off a stock USL distribution to restore beauty to the
	   xdm login screen. B^).

	4) The stock X server leaves bit droppings around at various resolutions
	   the only fix is to compile up XFree 1.2 with Type1 font support and
	   run it instead borrowing the Adobe fonts from the stock server. The
	   USL boys should just hang it up with that X11R[234] server and
	   fully replace it with the XFree server. XFree gives better
	   performance in the TS scheduler than that dog of a USL server does
	   in Real Time scheduling; Sheeeeeesh.

	5) USL 4.2 is missing SLIP, CSLIP and PPP. Get with the program dudes
	   even SCO provides this! And SCO's PPP also automates the PPP
	   startup so you don't have to jump through hoops.

	6) The connection server needs to be taken into a field and shot. The
	   thing will lock out a port if cu is aborted at the wrong time for
	   security purposes. The connection server/daemon also screws up
	   UUCP. I think the whole smash needs to be rethought out before
	   screwing up more serial communications. I like the idea of being
	   about to authenticate and crypt over a cu or UUCP connection but
	   fer crying out loud let me turn the damn thing off if I don't
	   WANT it. This also effects logins as the connection server
	   authentication thing is called before login on a ttymon line.
	   Somebody mentioned users getting root because the filled in
	   the owner field of the ttymon _pmtab. This is related to how
	   the connection server interacts with /usr/bin/shserv. See
	   /etc/saf/ttymon3/_pmtab.

	 7) The application server gets bent out of shape if a Novell server
	    doesn't exist. Come on guys, not all the world is Netware so
	    cut us some slack would ya?
	 
	 8) The X server needs a way to TEST new card configs so one doesn't
	    needa $%^&^$%^& reboot to get the screen back to sanity!

	 9) The damn install program doesn't understand that SMC ethernet
	    cards can be set to IRQ's other than 2,3,4,5. This REALLLLLLLLLY
	    pissed me off. I had to waste time figuring out the obfusicated
	    network startup process to make sure that my changes in /etc/conf
	    would stick. How about some doco's on the goofy way the networking
	    is "autoconfig'd"; GAK!

	I know Compaq need their $%^$&$%^& audio hardware neutered before the
	OS can work OK with ethernet and non-scsi cart. tapes. This is
	really Compaq's fault, the machines are garbage anyways as they
	don't have a reset switch or custom drive config available.

	Works on most clones I've seen as long as the hardware is set to
	specific addresses. Hey USL, take a clue from SCO and allow people
	to specify device addresses, IRQ and ports from the boot prompt. You
	DO have loadable device drivers so this shouldn't be THAT hard to
	do.

|> It almost sounds like time to start a UnixWare FAQ  :-)
|> 
	True. Here's my grumbling contribution... Overall I really do like
	UNIXware, it's just that it has some annoing misfeatures. Not as
	many as SCO tho! Except for the connection server 4.2 security get's
	the hell out of my way; SCO is still lying when it says you can
	"relax" security. Oh ya, delete /tcb and /etc/auth on a SCO 3.2.4
	system and see how far you get...
