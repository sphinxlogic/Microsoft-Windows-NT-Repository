I just got *two* calls from David Bianco and Roger Klorese at Veritas.
This was prompted by someone at either USL or Univel who kindly forwarded
my article to them.

Both David and Roger explained a lot more of the workings of Veritas to me.

The long and short of it is that I can either:

1) Get the Advanced Filesystem Feature Package (or something like that)
   from Univel.  This includes "fsadm", which will allow me to repack
   the filesystem in place.

2) cpio the filesystem off to tape, remove the files from the disk,
   and cpio it back onto the disk.  In my case, there's only one
   filesystem, "/" on the whole disk.  All the fragmentation has been
   occuring under the /home directory, so I think I can just cpio
   the /home off to tape, remove /home, and then bring it back in.
   This is a pretty standard way to get rid of fragmentation in
   filesystems - I was just not sure if this would work for vxfs
   filesystems.

Univel: this information should be included in the File System
Administration manual (or whatever its called).  Mere mortal users
won't know what to do otherwise.

Veritas did enter an enhancement request for me.  It would work
something like this.  If there are just 1, 2, or 4K extents left
and an 8K or greater extent is needed, the filesystem would allocate
from the smaller extents, but produce a warning on the console that
the filesystem has become severely fragmented and should be repacked
at the earliest convenient time.  At least, that is my suggestion.

BTW, for reference, here's the major usage pattern of the machine for
the last two months or so:
	1) UUCP free.software.tar.Z to /usr/spool/uucppublic
	2) cd $HOME/src
	3) zcat /usr/spool/uucppublic/free.software.tar.Z | tar xv
	4) cd free.software
	5) make install to target /usr/local
	6) make clean
	7) tar cvf - free.software | gzip > free.software.tar.z
	8) rm -rf free.software /usr/spool/uucppublic/free.software.tar.Z
	9) repeat 1) to 8) until bored or sleepy

I'll bet a lot of you hackers have a similar pattern.  You'd be wise
to do a df -o s once in a while to check for fragmentation.

Actually, I had posted my first response before we heard from them in the 
first place...

It probably would.

Yep.

** There is a problem, or at least a tradeoff, with this.

   If you are familiar with UFS file systems, you know that each inode has
   pointers to 12 direct blocks, an indirect address block, and a double
   indirect address block.
   
   VxFS has similar structures.  But the 10 direct extent pointers point
   to extents of variable size; the indirect blocks must all be allocated
   of size 8k.  (This is a "permanent" restriction, for some definition
   of "permanent.")
   
   This would mean that, if there are no 8k extents left, a new file
   would never be allowed to grow beyond 40k (10 4k extents); an
   existing file would be prevented from growing as soon as it needed
   to go indirect.
   
** By the way, notice that the filesystem in question is fuller than UFS' 
   normal 90% cutoff.  Without tunefs, this would have been effectively full
   on UFS as well.  You have 19MB "left"; UFS would have cut you off at
   52.5 by default.  We gave you 33.5MB more than the UFS default.  Even
   with minfree=0, fragmentation (see next graf) would keep you from
   using about 10-15MB on a UFS filesystem of this size; the difference
   is you never see it...
   
** Also, there's a difference in df behavior which affects what you see
   as free space.
   
   df reports free space based on available blocks.  But a VxFS 1k "block"
   is more like a UFS "fragment," and a UFS 8k "block" like a VxFS "extent,"
   than you might expect for the purposes of this calculation.

   In UFS, if space is unavailable for use because of fragment allocation
   policies, it will not show up in df, because it is not a countable
   "block."

   In VxFS, if space is unavailable because of block/extent allocation
   policies, it will show up as free space, because it is a "block" and
   is available under some specific circumstances.

   QUESTION to VxFS USERS: Would you prefer that we follow UFS' lead and
      *not* show this space as free?

Absolutely.

BTW: I'm posting this from home because my newsfeed's better.  This is
perhaps the oddest disclaimer you'll ever see: contrary to appearances,
this message *does* speak for VERITAS Software!
