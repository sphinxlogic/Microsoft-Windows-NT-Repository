In some cases VLB is transparent, that is to say that for instance, the
Adaptec 1542 driver will work for the BT 445S BusLogic local bus
SCSI Host Adapter, as will the 32 bit BT 742A drivers.

But Univel has dumped driver resposibility into the laps of the hardware
makers for most products. The U34F Ultrastor local bus V4.2 driver
is available from Ultrastor and can be downloaded from the Ultrastor
BBS.

In other cases, for graphics boards, the bus makes no difference to the 
driver, and the ATI Ultra Pro EISA for example is supported by the same
driver as the AT Ultra Pro ISA, and the Ultra Pro VLB, but none is
supported directly by 4.2; you need the PPc, or other 3rd party
package. Interstingly, for accelerated or co-processed graphics boards
the bus makes no real difference in performance; an ISA board can be
marginally faster than an EISA or VLB; for dumb frame buffer boards
the VLB does show improvement.

But, to put it directly, no, Univel does not explicitly support
local bus with any of the products' drivers supported and included with
Unixware.

OF course, Vesa Local Bus is a waste of time anyway for Unix, but that's
another story. EISA is the way to go.
