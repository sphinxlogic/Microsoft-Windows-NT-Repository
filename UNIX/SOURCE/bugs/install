We had the new Interactive, and Unixware seems to be easier to configure,
setup, etc. once you have all the necessary parts [read on].
Having a GUI makes some things like administration easier.  However, our
Interactive server was pretty solid whereas Unixware has locked up 3 times in
about a week.  Still working on it though.

Very nice, the Unixware server lets you access Netware volumes in a NFS like
manner, like it was mounted but without running NFS, and presumably running
IPX rather than TCPIP.

Man do I have a story:

Our CDROM uses a Future Domain TMC-850M SCSI controller.  So before ordering
Unixware, I call Univel and ask if this card is supported.  They say it is.
All good so far, I go to install it [Unixware] and it doesn't recognize the 
SCSI controller.  Ok, I call Univel and ask "What's up?" They say that I must
contact Future Domain and get a disk with Unixware drivers.  Ok I sez, no 
problem: I call FD.  They say they don't have a driver for Unixware, ETA is 
two months or something.  I call back Univel and ask "What's up?"  

Well, to summarize a weeks worth of telephone tag with Univel and FD, it turns
out that FD had promised Univel a driver for Unixware and based on that 
promise, they [Univel] added that card to their "Approved and Tested 
Compatible" list.  Well FD *%#$%* up and didn't have their driver finished
in time.

After annoying FD enough times, I finally persuaded them to send me a SCSI 
card that they DO have drivers for, on loan, so I can install Unixware.  This
was last week, I'm still waiting for the card.  In the meantime, I borrowed
an Adaptec 1542 [a real SCSI card] from a friend and did the install.

[Flame on]

This is real BS, since when did "Approved and Tested" become "Well, we hope
it's gonna work, but we don't even know if it exists" ????  If I had a dollar
for every time a piece of software was delivered late, I'd be a bilionaire.  
For Univel to publish this kind of information is both a disservice to the user
[me] and just plain irresponsible.

Future Domain lied to Univel, and Univel lied to me.  
Net result: I got screwed.

[Flame off]

We bought direct from Unixware because no one knew what we were talking about.
Maybe a vendor would have been more helpful though :(
