Here is texi2roff, a program to convert documents written using the
Texinfo macro language for TeX to be printable with nroff and troff,
using -ms, -me or -mm macros.  texi2roff is of use to people who want
to read GNU project documentation but don't have TeX available.
All Texinfo commands are supported to some extent, even if by carefully
discarding them.
