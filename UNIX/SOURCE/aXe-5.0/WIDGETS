default.

AxeiiText
=========
Implements the actions of aXe but only provides hooks (mechanism)
in the form of callback lists for those actions that require input,
e.g. goto-line, load-file, save-file, or produce output, e.g. where,
size.

Implements mechanism for receiving notification of first change after
a request to be notified of such changes.

a FileNominator, for example, for input of file names.
