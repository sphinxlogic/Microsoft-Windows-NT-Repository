The only non-original code is in

 o insertfile.c, taken from ...mit/lib/Xaw/TextPop.c of Release 4 of X.

 o parts of AxeiiSink.c, being lightly modified R5 AsciiSink.c code.

 o match.c, taken form Byron Rakitzis' rc command interpreter that is based
   on AT & T's Plan 9 shell of the same name.

 o regexp.c - Henry Spencer's regular expression code. Comments in regexp.h
   and regexp.c explain minor modifications that have had to be made.

 o the (Xp)Table widget from the 2.5 distribution of Wcl, in case you don't
   have Wcl.

 o the R5 Porthole widget, which is used in the ScrollingText widget. It is
   included for the benefit of those still at R4.

WARNING: This version may not work at R4. You use it at your peril.

See INSTALL for instructions on building and installing.
