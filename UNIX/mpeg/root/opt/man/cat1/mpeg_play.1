     notices are sent to stderr.

          options. The possible values are:

          ordered - ordered dither. This is the default.

          fs4 - Floyd-Steinberg dithering  with  4  error  values
               propogated.

          fs2 - Floyd-Steinberg dithering  with  2  error  values
               propogated.

          fs2fast - Fast Floyd-Steinberg dithering with  2  error
               values propogated.

          hybrid - Hybrid dithering,  a  combination  of  ordered
               dithering  for  the  luminance  channel and Floyd-
               Steinberg 2 error dithering  for  the  chrominance
               channels.  Errors  are NOT propogated properly and
               are dropped  all  togethor  every  two  pixels  in
               either direction.

          hybrid2 - Hybrid dithering as  above,  but  with  error
               propogation among pixels.

          2x2 - A dithering technique using a 2x2 pixel area  for
               each  pixel. The image displayed is 4 times larger
               than the  original  image  encoded.  Random  error
               terms are added to each pixel to break up contours
               and gradients.

          gray - Grayscale dithering. The image is dithered  into
               128  grayscales. Chrominance information is thrown

               away.

          color - Full color display (only available  on  24  bit
               color displays).

          none - no dithering is done,  no  image  is  displayed.
               Used to time decoding process.

          mono  -  Floyd-Steinberg   dithering   for   monochrome
               displays.

          threshold  -  Floyd-simple  dithering  for   monochrome
               displays.

     ----lllloooooooopppp : makes the player loop back to  the  beginning  after
          reaching the end.

     -eachstat : causes statistics to  be  displayed  after  each
          frame. Only valid when compiled with -DANALYSIS.

     -shmem_off : turns shared memory off.

     The player expects MPEG-1 video streams  only.  It  can  not
     handle  multiplexed MPEG streams or video+audio streams. The
     player uses the paris entropy coding  table  set  (which  we
     believe  to  be the MPEG-1 standard), but can not handle any
     bitstreams that use the "berlin" entropy coding  table  set.
     Berlin  data  is  relatively  rare so there shouldn't be too
     much to worry about here, but be  aware  of  the  difference
     when looking for streams to play.

     Most streams do not end with the proper  sequence  end  code
     and  will  probably  generate an "Unexpected EOF" error when
     done playing.

     This player can play XING data files.  Be  aware  that  XING
     makes  no use of temporal redundancy or motion vector infor-
     mation. In other words, they do not use any P or B frames in
     their  streams. Instead, XING data is simply a sequence of I
     frames. Since I frames take significantly longer to  decode,
     performance of the player using XING data is not representa-
     tive of the player's ability.
