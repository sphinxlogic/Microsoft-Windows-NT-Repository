     _E_n_s_l_a_v_e  starts   MandelSpawn   computation   servers   (see
     _m_s_l_a_v_e_d(8))  on hosts listed in the file $_H_O_M_E/._e_n_s_l_a_v_e.  If
     a list of hostnames is given as arguments, then servers  are
     started only on those hosts.

     The ----vvvv option causes _e_n_s_l_a_v_e to print the  rsh  commands  it
     executes to start the servers.  With the ----nnnn option, the com-
     mands are printed but not executed.

     The file ._e_n_s_l_a_v_e in the user's home directory contains  the
     information  necessary to start the computation servers.  It
     contains one line per host, each consisting of two  or  more
     whitespace-separated  fields:  the  host name, the directory
     where the binaries of _m_s_l_a_v_e_d and _m_s_l_a_v_e_d_c are  stored,  and
     any  options  that are to be passed to _m_s_l_a_v_e_d_c.  The direc-
     tory name may be relative to the user's  home  directory  on
     the remote host and should end with a slash.

     In addition to the ._e_n_s_l_a_v_e file, _e_n_s_l_a_v_e  uses  information
     from  the  user's  ._r_h_o_s_t_s  file to determine a username for
     executing commands on each of the remote hosts.   Additional
     hostname-username  pairs for non-trusted hosts may be stored
     in ._r_h_o_s_t_s format in the file ._r_h_o_s_t_i_l_e.

     Forking off one rsh per host in parallel may  be  considered
     anti-social behaviour if the number of hosts is large.

     Hostname aliases are not taken into  account,  so  hostnames
     must  be spelled identically in ._e_n_s_l_a_v_e, ._m_s_l_a_v_e_s, ._r_h_o_s_t_s,
     and ._r_h_o_s_t_i_l_e.
