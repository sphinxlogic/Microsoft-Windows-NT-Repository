     _x_i_n_v_a_d_e_r_s is  an  implementation  of  the  old  Atari  Space
     Invaders game, on top of the X11 window system.

     The game will start with all the invaders drawn.  Press  'p'
     to play, and you're off, or use the newly provided buttons.

     The controls are:


     zzzz       Fire a shot.  You will only be able to fire one shot
             at a time, so be careful.

     ,,,,       Move left.  Pressing this key will start you  moving
             to the left, releasing it will make you stop.

     ....       Move right.  Pressing this key will start you moving
             to the right, releasing it will make you stop.

     pppp       Pause or Play.  Pressing this will either pause  the
             game,  or  play  it.  Remember, you must press it to
             start the game (either at  the  very  beginning,  or
             between new games).

     qqqq       Quit the game.  Do this and you will end  the  game.
             No ifs, ands or buts about it.


     The mouse controls are active, and rather obvious:

     The lowest monsters are worth 10 points, the next are  worth
     20,  and  the  highest  are worth 30.  Space ships are worth
     anything from 50-300 points  (in  50  point  increments,  of
     course).

     As with all standard X applications, _x_i_n_v_a_d_e_r_s may  be  cus-
     tomized through entries in the resource manager.   This game
     also works on monochrome screens, but the colors don't  mean
     anything (surprise!).

     There are lots of resources.  You can change all the timings
     involved.  Have fun with it.

     Although you can resize the gamewindow,  I  don't  recommend
     it.

     The buildings aren't as good as the arcade, but  hey,  what-
     dayawant  for free?  It also doesn't handle auto-repeat very
     well, so you should probably turn it off.

     This is mine.  I'm only letting you use it.   Period.   Feel
     free  to  rip  off any of the code you see fit, but have the
     courtesy to give me credit.  Otherwise great hairy  beasties
     will  rip  your  eyes  out and eat your flesh when you least
     expect it.

     I'd like to give a lot of credit to Terry Weissman  for  his
     roids games.  It gave me the guidance on how to do something
     like this.
