     _X_m_a_n_d_e_l is a user  friendly  interface  for  generating  and
     colouring  Mandelbrot and Julia sets.  It initially comes up
     with with eleven or so command buttons, which are  described
     below,  for  controlling the execution.  A Mandelbrot set is
     drawn in the window of the initial form when the _m_a_n_d_e_l but-
     ton  is  selected.  A separate window is created for drawing
     the Julia sets.

     Let z0 be a number in the complex plane (x + yi).  Choose  a
     complex constant C. Calculate z1 = z0 ** 2 + C.  Repeat this
     recursively, so that z2 = z1 ** 2 + C, z3 = z2 ** 2 + C  and
     so on.  z[n] will either tend to infinity or zero, depending
     on its initial value and the constant  C.   Specifically  if
     the  absolute  value of z[n], expressed as |z| = sqrt(x**2 +
     y**2) is greater than 2, then  the  recursive  formula  will
     diverge.

     So, to calculate a Julia set, take each point  near  (0,0i),
     and use the formula z = z**2 + C recursively.  The Julia set
     is the set of points for which z = z**2 +  C  would  iterate
     indefinitely  for  the  constant C.  Pixels, which represent
     numbers in the complex plane,  are  set  to  the  number  of
     iterations before |z| exceeds 2.  This then becomes an index
     into the hardware colormap.  Each color then represents  the
     number of iterations before divergence is detected.

     To calculate a Mandelbrot set, again take  each  point  near
     (0,0i), use the same formula z = z**2 + C recursively.  This
     time let C be the initial value of the  point  itself  (C  =
     z0).   Rather  than having the same C for every point in the
     complex plane as in Julia set calculations, C  is  different
     for  each  point in the plane.  Again let the pixel value be
     the number of iterations before |z| exceeds 2.

     On monochrome displays, the pixel value is set to 1  if  the
     iteration count is 64, otherwise 0.

     Mandelbrot sets and Julia sets are obviously closely related
     as  can be seen from the similarity of their respective for-
     mulas.  If the constant C is chosen from the interior of the
     Mandelbrot set, then the Julia set calculated from that con-
     stant C will be connected, that is have no gaps  or  discon-
     tinuities.   If  the  constant  C is chosen from outside the
     Mandelbrot set, the Julia set  will  be  disconnected,  more

     like  grains  of  dust (Fatou clouds).  If the constant C is
     chosen from the border of the Mandelbrot set, then the Julia
     set  will  be  more  convoluted.   Given  this  relationship
     between points in the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set  gen-
     erated, Xmandel provides user selection of the constant C by
     mouse selection in the Mandelbrot window.

     To control execution of the  calculations,  various  buttons
     are  provided.   The  buttons are somewhat different between
     the Athena Widget and  Motif  Widget  implementations.   The
     buttons are:

     mmmmaaaannnnddddeeeellll
          Calculates a Mandelbrot set from (-2.25, -1.5) to (1.0,
          1.5) and display it in the window provided.

          Pressing a mouse button with the cursor in the  drawing
          window terminates the calculations.

     jjjjuuuulllliiiiaaaa
          Calculates a Julia set.  The user is required to select
          a  point  inside  the  Mandelbrot window using the left
          mouse button as the constant C for the Julia set calcu-
          lation.   It  will  open  a  new window if needed.  The
          Julia set is centered around (0,0), going  from  (-1.5,
          -1.5)  to (1.5, 1.5).  Julia set points can be selected
          from zoomed in Mandelbrot windows as well.   Beware  of
          selecting points outside the Mandelbrot window.

          Pressing a mouse button  in  the  drawing  window  ter-
          minates the calculations.

     IIIImmmmaaaaggggeeee
          After the Mandelbrot or Julia  set  is  generated,  the
          _I_m_a_g_e  button  identifies  which  set is to be used for
          various manipluations such as _z_o_o_m or +_c_o_l_o_u_r. If  this
          button  is  pressed,  the  active image toggles between
          "Mandel" and "Julia" to identify the set that is to  be
          manipulated.

          The Motif implementation uses radio  buttons  for  this
          toggle.

     zzzzoooooooommmm In order to zoom in on a given area in  the  Mandelbrot
          or  Julia  set, a zoom button is provided.  The area to
          be zoomed in on is selected with the left mouse button.
          Left  button  down  begins the selection, dragging with
          left button down draws a rubber banded box to show  the
          zoom  area,  and left button up begins the calculation.
          You can zoom in on a zoomed in area until you reach the
          limits  of the precision of your hardware.  Selecting a

          zoom area that crosses a window border doesn't work.

          To a certain degree, the zoom rubber banded box may  be
          moved, enlarged and otherwise resized by careful use of
          the mouse.

          Zoom requests less than 5 pixels wide are ignored.  The
          zoom  request may be terminated by pressing button 2 or
          3 while creating the rubber band.

          If the Motif version is used, the zoom coordinates  may
          be  specified  in  the _Z_O_O_M _C_O_O_R_D_I_N_A_T_E_S dialogue boxes.
          After the desired coodinates are enterd,  pressing  the
          _z_o_o_m button activates the drawing.

     uuuunnnnzzzzoooooooommmm
          Return to previous zoom. Note that you can zoom all the
          way out by selecting the _m_a_n_d_e_l button.

          Recompute the set at the current coordinates.  This  is
          useful  to  redisplay the current image after the set's
          window has been resized.

          If the Motif  version  is  used,  the  coordinates  for
          recalculation  may  be modified in the _Z_O_O_M _C_O_O_R_D_I_N_A_T_E_S
          dialogue boxes.

     ccccoooolllloooouuuurrrr
          The _c_o_l_o_u_r button selects colour rotation value  to  be
          applied when the +_c_o_l_o_u_r or -_c_o_l_o_u_r buttons are used.

          The "colour step" value is added to each  pixel  colour
          before  redisplay.   The  effectively rotates the image
          through the available  colour  map.   By  default,  the
          rotation  value is set to the number of bit planes: for
          an 8 bit display, the rotation value is 8; for a 2  bit
          display, the rotation value is 2; etc.

          The selected set and rotation value is "remembered" for
          use with the +_c_o_l_o_u_r and -_c_o_l_o_u_r buttons.

          The "rotate" dialogue box in the Motif edition is  used
          to set the colour rotation value.

     ++++ccccoooolllloooouuuurrrr
          The default set is  rotated  in  a  positive  sense  by
          adding  the  previously specified colour rotation value
          to all pixels.

          An interesting "colour zoom" effect can be achieved  by
          first  setting  the  colour  rotation  value  to  1 and

          The default set is rotated in a negative sense by  sub-
          tracting   the  previously  specified  colour  rotation
          value.   In  effect,  -_c_o_l_o_u_r  undoes  the  effect   of
          +_c_o_l_o_u_r.

     ggggiiiiffff  Either the Mandelbrot or Julia image may be captured to
          a  GIF  file.   The  Mandelbrot  image  is saved in the
          specified file name if the _M_a_n_d_e_l_b_r_o_t radio  button  is
          pressed,  the  Julia  image is saved if the _J_u_l_i_a radio
          button is pressed.

          For the Motif implementation, the desired file name  is
          entered  into  the _G_i_f _f_i_l_e dialogue box.  Pressing the
          _S_a_v_e button saves the default image (set by  the  radio
          buttons) as a gif file.

          Remove the Julia set window.  It will be  recreated  if
          another Julia display is requested.

          This button is not used in the Motif edition: the Julia
          set may be removed by closing the Julia window.

     The _d_e_f_a_u_l_t set is selected by the radio buttons  _m_a_n_d_e_l  or
     _j_u_l_i_a.  The  default  set selection is used when the _r_e_c_a_l_c,
     +_c_o_l_o_u_r, -_c_o_l_o_u_r, or other buttons are pressed.   For  exam-
     ple,  if the _j_u_l_i_a radio button is selected, the _r_e_c_a_l_c but-
     ton will recompute the Julia set.   The  Mandelbrot  set  is
     unaffected.

     The additional dialog boxes allow you  to  manually  provide
     the  Mandelbrot zoom coordinates. Changes to the _P_O_I_N_T _C_O_O_R_-
