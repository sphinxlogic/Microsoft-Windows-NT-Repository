     xxxxbbbboooommmmbbbb is an rewrite and extension of  the  mmmmiiiinnnneeeesssswwwweeeeeeeeppppeeeerrrr  game
     found  on various PCs.  The object of the game is to clear a
     field of deadly bombs.  To do this requires only  two  mouse
     buttons, one key and devastatingly clever wit.

     The board is a rectangle of hidden bombs  and  empty  spots.
     When  a  bomb  is stepped on, you die, and the game is over.
     When an empty spot is stepped on,  you  find  out  how  many
     bombs  are adjacent to the spot (horizontally, vertically or
     diagonally).  With clever  deduction,  you  can  figure  out
     where the bombs must lie (and the bombs never lie).

     The left mouse button establishes that a space on the  board
     is  empty.   It's  as  if  you strolled onto that particular
     space.  If it is empty, then it immediately becomes a number
     (as  described  above).   If there's a bomb, then, well, you
     can always play again.

     Any non-left mouse button (or _a_n_y shifted button) toggles  a
     flag.  Flags are reminders to yourself that there's probably
     a bomb at that particular spot.  To help you out, the  total
     number  of  bombs  left  unflagged is presented in the upper
     left.  If you misplace a flag, then  the  number  is  decre-
     mented, but you don't die.

     There are a few keystrokes that can help you (or kill you).


     ^^^^QQQQ   Quit the game.  Always the best key to know  when  run-
          ning a new program.


     gggg,,,,GGGG  Make a random guess somewhere on the  board.   If  it's
          empty,  then  you get some knowledge.  If not, you die.
          True afficianados scoff at this move.


     ssss,,,,SSSS  Scan the board.  This turns all flags into bombs.  If a
          flag  was  placed  on  an empty spot, then you die.  If
          not, it's a good way of establishing your hypotheses.

          obvious.
           If, for example, you have an 8 on the board, then  all
          of  its  neighbors must have bombs.  The 'p' key places
          any obvious flags.

          You are now ready to play, but you should probably  use
          a few of the more convenient options, so read on...

     XXXXbbbboooommmmbbbb has more options than you can shake a stick at.   Here
     they  are, in some kind of bizarre order, starting with com-
     mon X options.  You are not obliged to specify any of these,
     and you can specify most of them in your

          can give an initial position.  I like +2+2 to put it in
          the (almost) upper left.

          Now for the more interesting Non-X options...


      ----AAAA  Auto-replay mode.  If this is set, then when  you  die,
          you have to explicitly quit to get out of the game.


      ----hhhh hhhheeeeiiiigggghhhhtttt
          Use a board that is height spaces high.  A  good  value
          for this is 24.  Default is 20.


      ----wwww wwwwiiiiddddtttthhhh
          Use a board that is width spaces wide.   A  good  value
          for this is 34.  Default is 20.


      ----ffff  Use a better follow algorithm.  Consider an empty  spot
          that has three adjacent bombs.  If all three bombs have
          been  established  (using  the  's'  key),   then   the
          remainder  of  the  neighbor  spots must be empty.  The
          better following algorithm does this for you.   Playing
          the  game without it a few times will convince you that
          it's a godsend.


      ----nnnn NNNN
          Hide N bombs on the map.  By default,  N  will  be  one
          quarter of the width times the height.  Maximum, N will
          be one half the width times the height.  Solving a maze
          filled  with  a  quarter  bombs is tough, and solving a
          maze filled with more than a quarter  bombs  can  quite
          ridiculious.  Our record (for a 24x34 map) is 225 bombs
          (204 is one quarter).


      ----nnnnaaaa nnnnaaaammmmeeee
          Play using name instead of your userid.  The name  must
          be at most 8 characters long.


      ----qqqq  Quiet mode.  Only report the scores if  you  manage  to
          break into the high scorers list.


      ----rrrr sssseeeeeeeedddd
          Play with a  particular  random  seed.   This  disables
          scoring,  so  don't  even try it.  You can find out the
          random seed for a game when you die by hitting 'r'.

      ----ssss  Print the high score list.  By default (in the  regular

          Assign a solver.  Solvers (described  below)  are  user
          programs  that  do  better  jobs  of figuring out where
          empty spots and flags should  be.   There  are  several
          solvers  distributed  with xxxxbbbboooommmmbbbb ,,,, and this manual page
          describes how to build  them  yourself.   A  solver  is
          bound  to  a given number key so that when you hit that
          key, the solver is invoked.  If  you  don't  specify  a
          number, xxxxbbbboooommmmbbbb uses the next available spot.

          Solvers are given by pathname relative to  the  current
          directory,  or  relative  to the xbomb library (perhaps
          ////uuuussssrrrr////llllooooccccaaaallll////ggggaaaammmmeeeessss////lllliiiibbbb////xxxxbbbboooommmmbbbb ).


      ----tttt  Ted mode!  Ted mode  automatically  decrements  numbers
          whenever  a  bomb  has  been  established next to them.
          Thus, when you do an 's'  the  numbers  all  decrement.
          Now  the  numbers  indicate  the  number of neighboring
          unplaced bombs rather than the total number, and  which
          makes  the  game  lots easier (and more fun, if you ask
          me).  Why is it called Ted mode?  Ask Ted.


      ----zzzz  Instead of starting the game in the upper left  corner,
          this  will  find a zero somewhere in the maze and start
          you there.  It makes the game easier, but it also elim-
          inates you from high scoring.

     ``Information'' is a number line  containing  either  ``num-
     bombs  N''  or  ``mouse  X  Y''  (N,  X, and Y are numbers).
     ``Map'' is the line ``map'' followed by an ASCII copy of the
     map terminated by a blank line.  In the map, digits show the
     number of neighboring bombs, X's show bombs that  have  been
     verified,  f's designate flags, e's indicate squares flagged
     as ``empty'' (not yet implemented), and periods are  unknown
     squares.

     After a solver receives a map,  it  must  respond  with  any
     actions  it  wishes  to take followed by a blank line.  Each
     action is of the form ``X Y A'' where X and Y are  the  grid
     location and A is either ``f'' for flag as a bomb, ``m'' for
     move to this location, or ``e'' for flag as empty (``e''  is
     not yet implemented).  A solver _m_u_s_t respond with at least a
     single blank line or the game will not continue.

     xxxxbbbboooommmmbbbb comes with a bunch of solvers,  Well, three  (or  so).

     interface, and so introduced a bug allowing anyone to  write
     the score file.  Michial Gunter (gunter@cs.ucla.edu) did the

     plete any maze perfectly.
