This directory contains source and objects for regex, a POSIX.2
conformant regular expression library.

Program:	libregex.a (library)
Revision:	2.1 alpha
Author:		Henry Spencer
Date ported:	7 September 1993
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.4.5

Prerequisites:	none

Documentation:	(where is it, how do you make it, how do you install it)?

Installation:	The SVR4.2 header files do not always handle the
		C++-style declarations in this package. Therefore, the
		header files regex.h and cdefs.h need to be installed
		to /usr/include. This is done with make install, as is
		everything else.


Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

Modifications:

0. Mod regex.h to define POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX, include a Berkeley cdefs.h
   to make up for the missing files in SVR4.2. Write a Makefile - the
   sources I had didn't include one.
