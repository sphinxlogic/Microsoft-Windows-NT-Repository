As is described on the outside of this CD-ROM, the products on the ROM
are supplied without any support obligation. USL and Novell are not
responsible for the contents, and there is not even a guarantee that
it will work on your machine. If you want support, you will have to
pay for it.

This doesn't sound very nice. Obviously, we didn't go to the trouble
of making this CD-ROM so that people would install non-functional
software. On the other hand, we earn our livelihood from software
support. For the following reasons:

- We want to bring out more CD-ROMs, which should be even better than
  this one
- We want our customers to be satisfied
- We want advertise our services 

we can offer you a free DM 100 worth of technical support of whatever
kind you want. This sum is exclusive of VAT (TVA, Mehrwertsteuer), and
expires on 30 September 1994

In order to take advantage of this, you must register with us for
support. This places you under no further obligation: you can use up
your DM 100 and then never call us again, and you won't get a bill.
But we need to know with whom we are dealing - that's the reason for
the registration. If you use up your free DM 100 and continue calling
us, we'll tell you that your free offer has expired. If you then
continue using our services, you will get a bill.
