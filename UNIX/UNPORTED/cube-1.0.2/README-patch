PATCH INFO:

SORRY for such an early patch. There was a mistake in the cube.h file
that became manifest when cube was built using gcc. It worked ok when 
built with our bundled cc (SUN OS 4.1)

ldfile.c had something that gcc didn't like either. 

   Execute the following in the cube directory.
          patch < patch1
          patch < patch2

   Then rebuild:
          make
