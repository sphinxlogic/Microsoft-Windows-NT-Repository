REQUIREMENTS:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

XCube requires the following resources:

    - An ANSI compiler  (GCC with no options should work just fine)
    - X11               (only R4 and R5 tested)


INSTALLATION:
-------------

*   Cd to the cube directory.

*   Edit the cube/Imakefile and cube/lib/Imakefile files to suit your environment.  If you
    don't have imake stuff you may have to hack a bit on Makefile.std., or Makefile.hp

*   First issue the following command:

        xmkmf 

*   Now make: (this generates Makefile in subdirectory lib)

        make Makefiles

* And then 
        
        make 

* And optionally (this does a xrdb -merge MagicCube)
        
        make merge_resource

* then to run enter
       
        magicCube 


MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION:
-------------------------
The resource file MagicCube contains the following keyboard bindings
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Keyboard Control of Cube:
   a -- puts board into pristine state
   r -- rotates cube
   s -- spins cube
   f -- flips cube
   q -- quits
   t -- twists the front of the cube
   y -- twists the left side
   u -- twists the right side
   i -- twists the back side
   o -- twists the top side
   p -- twists the bottom 

Of course you can change this by changing the MagicCube resource database.
