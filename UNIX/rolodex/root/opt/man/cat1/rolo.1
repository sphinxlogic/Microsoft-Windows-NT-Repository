     rolo - use an online rolodex, containing  information  about
     people.

     By default _r_o_l_o reads in a rolodex data file from the user's
     home  directory,  prints out a menu of choices, and lets the
     user scan, update, delete and add to his  personal  database
     of  people.   If  no rolodex database exists one is created.
     _r_o_l_o checks to see that the rolodex database is not  already
     in use.

     The command line options are:

     ----uuuu ooootttthhhheeeerrrruuuusssseeeerrrr
          Uses the  rolodex  database  in  the  'otheruser'  home
          directory.   This  may not be possible if the directory
          or the database is read or write protected.  For VMS or
          DOS,  it will simply use files found in directory 'oth-
          eruser'; this need not be the home directory.

     ----ssss   Prints people's names,  work  phone  numbers  and  home
          phone numbers in a nice format to standard output.

     ----llll   Normally the rolodex  database  is  locked  when  being
          used.   This  option unlocks the database as soon as it
          is read in.  The -s option implies this.

     ----rrrr   Readonly mode.  Assuming that the files  may  be  read,
          this allows readonly access to the database.

     Invoking _r_o_l_o followed by a list of  names  causes  _r_o_l_o  to
     search  the  database  for all people whose names or company
     affiliations contain any  of  the  name  arguments  as  sub-
     strings.   All  the information about each person is printed
     to standard output, the program pausing after each record is
     printed.   Using  this feature causes the database to become
     unlocked, since this is a read-only mode.

     Extensive help is available on-line.  Typing '?'  or  'help'
     will generally print a help file for you.

     Peter Webb wrote the first rolodex program.

     JP Massar revised and then complete rewrote this older  ver-
     sion.  Net address: massar@think.com, ihnp4!think!massar.

     Dave Ihnat revised the program to work for  VMS  and  MS/PC-
     DOS;   and   to  support  the  readonly  command-line  flag.
     Numerous other minor  enhancements,  bug  fixes,  delinting,
     etc.  Net address: ihnp4!homebru!ignatz.


     Steve Steiner implemented the pretty-print option, and  with
     Dave  Ihnat  hammered  out the current version which runs on
     VMS, AT&T Unix Sys III/V, BSD 4.x Unix, and MS/PC-DOS  under
     Microsoft   C   and   Turbo-C.   (*whew!*)    Net   address:

     There is no way to keep certain entries private.

     You can't get a short summary of only a subset of people.
