     _X_t_e_t_r_i_s is a game involving dropping blocks.  As  they  drop
     you  can  move  them to the left or to the right by clicking
     the left or right mouse buttons respectively.  Pressing  the
     shift key while clicking the button causes the falling shape
     to rotate anti-clockwise (left mouse  button)  or  clockwise
     (right  mouse  button).  Pressing  the  middle  mouse button
     causes the shape to quickly drop. Note that the  mouse  must
     be  in the window in which the shapes are dropping for these
     actions to work correctly.

     You can also use the keyboard: h for moving to the  left,  l
     for  moving to the right, j to rotate clockwise, k to rotate
     counter-clockwise and space for dropping quickly..

     You can also use the direction pad,  if  your  keyboard  has
     one:  (Left)  to move left, (Down) to rotate clockwise, (Up)
     to rotate counter clockwise, and (Right) to move right.

     Points are scored for each block that comes to rest  on  the
     gradually  building  up  pile of blocks. Different blocks in
     different orientations have different point values. When the
     pile reaches the top of the screen and no further blocks can
     be dropped the game ends. When a row of  blocks  across  the
     screen is completely filled, that row is removed and all the
     blocks above it drop down.  As more  rows  are  deleted  the
     blocks drop faster.

     A high  score  table  is  kept  which  is  retained  between
     separate  executions  of  the game.  You can avoid recording
     your score, by using the -_n_o_s_c_o_r_e option.

     _X_t_e_t_r_i_s requires the installation of an application defaults
     file,     probably    in    the    file    /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_X_1_1/_a_p_p-
     _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s/_X_t_e_t_r_i_s. If that file does not exist, _x_t_e_t_r_i_s  can-
     not  run.  (It will probably print out something like "Width
     zero.  Terminating.")  Almost everything about  _x_t_e_t_r_i_s  can
     be  configured  in  your .X11defaults file.  You can use the
     application defaults file as a guide.

     _X_t_e_t_r_i_s takes standard _X options (see  _X(_1)).  It  adds  the

             the game board adjusts to _b_o_x_s_i_z_e.

             Sets the game's speed.  By default _s_p_e_e_d is 10.   20
             causes  the  game to be 2 times faster, 5 makes it 2
             times slower.  "-speed 50" makes  for  an  extremely
             fast game, however you will need a fast processor to
             support it.  Keep in mind  that  as  you  knock  out
             rows,  the  game's speed increases.  If you set your
             speed below the standard of 10, your score will  not
             be recorded in the score file.
