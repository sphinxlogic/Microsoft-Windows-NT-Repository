     _x_g_a_s is a physical simulation of an ideal gas  in  a  heated
     box.   Gas  molecules  move  around  the box with velocities
     dependent on their temperature.  A chamber consisting of two
     boxes  contains  the  gas molecules; the temperature of each
     box can be independently controlled by  a  scrollbar.   When
     gas  molecules  collide  with  the  walls, their temperature
     approaches that of the box.

     Use mouse button 1 to create molecules one at a time at  the
     cursor  position.   Use mouse button 2 to create the maximum
     number of molecules at the cursor position.

             In each wall collision, a molecule  bounces  elasti-
             cally (angle of incidence = angle of reflection).  A
             component of randomness  is  added  to  this  angle.
             RandomBounce  varies from 0.0 (no randomness) to 1.0
             (completely random angle of incidence).

             During each wall  collision,  a  molecule's  kinetic
             energy approaches that corresponding to the tempera-
             ture of  the  wall.   If  equilibrium  is  1.0,  the
             molecule  reaches  the wall temperature immediately.
             For  values  between  1.0  and  0.0,  the   molecule
             approaches the temperature of the wall more slowly.

     When the chamber is resized, molecules should be  rearranged
     appropriately.   Instead, the molecule arrays are reinitial-
     ized.
