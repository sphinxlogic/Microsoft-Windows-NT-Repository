war game simulator

Program:	xpilot
Revision:	1.1
Author:		Bjørn Stabell and Ken Ronny Schouten
Date ported:	18 May 1993
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.3.3

Prerequisites:	

Documentation:	man pages: xpilot, xpilots

Installation:	in subdirectory src: xmkmf, make Makefiles, make
		depend, make

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		This program does not handle errors well. If xpilot
		(the requestor) is started before xpilots (the
		server), it will wait a while and then stop without
		any message. We have also had difficulty starting it
		on displays with only 16 colours.

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4

1. strcasecmp missing - use the BSD version.
