     XPilot is a multiplayer game which looks a bit like  TTTThhhhrrrruuuusssstttt,
     the  good  old  action  game  for the CCCCoooommmmmmmmooooddddoooorrrreeee 66664444.  Several
     clones have appeared for  various  computers,  among  others
     GGGGrrrraaaavvvviiiittttyyyy FFFFoooorrrrcccceeee for the CCCCoooommmmmmmmooooddddoooorrrreeee AAAAmmmmiiiiggggaaaa.

     The main objective of the game varies as you can choose dif-
     ferent  game  modes, although the only modes supported as of
     today are _c_o_m_b_a_t and _r_a_c_e.  The  former  mode  focuses  more
     strongly  on  shooting  each other down, while the latter is
     more a piloting test than anything else.

     To start playing, you need only to connect to  a  sssseeeerrrrvvvveeeerrrr  by
     using  a  small  hhhhaaaannnndddd----sssshhhhaaaakkkkeeee program called _x_p_i_l_o_t.  If there
     are no servers running, you will have to start one  on  your
     own (see man-page _x_p_i_l_o_t_s(_6)).

                    Lets you use an alternative name  during  the
                    play  (may be handy :).  If this option isn't
                    specified, and you haven't set the X resource
                    name, you will be known by your _l_o_g_i_n _n_a_m_e.

                    various  effects  -  you  cannot harm another
                    team member (and they cannot harm  you),  and
                    you  can  see  (though  not on radar) cloaked
                    team-mates.  Note however, that you can still
                    harm  yourself.  This option will probably be
                    much more enhanced in the  future.   You  may
                    also specify a team number using X resources,
                    see below for details.  Team 0 is  equivalent
                    to no team.

     get a prompt asking you for directions.  You may type 'h' or
     '?' to list the available commands.  These are quite obvious
     and deal with communication to the current server only.  You
     may enter the game by pressing CR (Return/Enter).

     If you are the owner of the server you will have a few extra
     options.  See _x_p_i_l_o_t_s(_6).

     When you enter a game you will hopefully be presented a win-
     dow.  This window is divided into three major areas:

           TTTThhhheeee rrrraaaaddddaaaarrrr   This area shows the map the server you are
                       playing  on  is using as well as the posi-
                       tion  of  your  fellow  players  (if  they
                       aren't  cloaked).   In race mode the radar
                       also outputs the position of  the  control
                       posts.

           TTTThhhheeee ppppllllaaaayyyyeeeerrrr lllliiiisssstttt
                       This  area  shows  the  list  of   players
                       (sorted  with respect to rating) currently
                       logged on  the  server.   A  sample  field
                       looks like this:

                            ****9999   SSSSeeeellllaaaacccc               000000003333       66664444

                       The asterisk (*)  means  that  the  player
                       Selac  (me) has the best <rating>/<deaths>
                       ratio.  You can  also  see  that  I  am  a
                       member  of  team  no.  9, that I have died
                       003 times and have a rating of 64.

                       This is where the action is.  Most notably
                       you will see your fighter in the middle of
                       the screen, hopefully you  won't  see  any
                       shots or explosions yet!

                       is the HHHHUUUUDDDD (Head Up Display) which greatly
                       simplifies  and compresses the information
                       you need  to  know.   Currently,  the  HUD
                       displays the following information:

                 SSSSppppeeeecccciiiiaaaallll iiiitttteeeemmmmssss
                             You may notice some numbers  on  the
                             top  left  or  bottom left corner of
                             the HUD, this means  that  you  have
                             either  ssssmart  shots  (missiles)  or
                             mmmmines and the number  indicates  how
                             many  smart  shots  /  missiles  you
                             have.  Smart shots are shown in  the
                             bottom  left corner (with and S pre-
                             fixing the number) and missiles  are
                             in  the  top  left corner (with an M
                             prefixing the number).

                             Also,  other  special   items   like
                             ccccloaking  devices,  wwwwide angle shots
                             and rrrrear shots are only indicated by
                             a  letter appearing on the left side
                             of the HUD.

                 FFFFuuuueeeellll        A fuel  meter  will  appear  on  the
                             right  side  of the HUD when you are
                             getting low on fuel, it  will  start
                             flashing  when  your fuel level gets
                             dangerously low.  The fuel is numer-
                             ically displayed on the bottom right
                             corner of the HUD.

                 LLLLoooocccckkkk        The name  of  the  player  you  have
                             currently  locked on is shown on the
                             top of the HUD.  Also, the  distance
                             and bearing to the player is visual-
                             ized by a dot where placement of the
                             dot  gives  the  direction,  and the
                             size of the dot gives the  distance.
                             The dot will be filled if the player
                             is not on the same team as you.  The
                             distance  to the player also numeri-

     The game has really no main purpose but to have  fun.   This
     is  achievable  in many ways, but mainly by bbbbllllaaaassssttttiiiinnnngggg aaaawwwwaaaayyyy on
     friends and cannons.  Both will naturally fire back at  you,
     so you will also need some nifty ppppiiiilllloooottttiiiinnnngggg sssskkkkiiiillllllllssss and/or some
     heavy equipment to really enjoy living.  Another vital  part
     of your machinery is your eeeennnneeeerrrrggggyyyy////ffffuuuueeeellll - without it, you will
     surely die a horrible death.

     During the game you might encounter red  triangles  -  these
     are  special  items which will make your life easier.  As of
     today, these are:


           FFFF           More fuel.

           CCCC           Cloaking device.

           RRRR           Rear shot.

           WWWW           Wide angle shots.  The more you  pick  up,
                       the more awesome your firepower gets.

           SSSS           Pack of smart shots  (missiles).   Default
                       is four missiles in each pack.

           MMMM           Pack of mines.  Default  is  one  mine  in
                       each pack.

     The game understands quite some keys, but not  all  of  them
     are  equally  important.   The following keys are in priori-
     tized  order,  and  note  that  a  |  is  used  to  separate
     equivalent keys.

       _P_r_i_m_a_r_y _k_e_y_s

     type:

          xxxxppppiiiillllooootttt

     This will force the program to search after a server on  all
     the  machines on your sub-domain (i.e. all the machines with
     the all but the last part of the IP address in common).

     Say this don't work (it often  doesn't  unfortunately),  and
     you  know  where  the  server  is,  and you don't want to be
     prompted (handy in scripts etc.), you may type for example:
