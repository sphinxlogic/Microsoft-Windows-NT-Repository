     Xwave plots a perspective projection of a plane grid  oscil-
     lating in three-space in real time.  You can select the size
     of the grid, a forcing function to apply (and where to apply
     it),  and  what  wave  propagation  model  to  use.  You can
     display a plot of the velocity of the points in the grid  as
     well as the position.  Double buffering is simulated using a
     background pixmap.  Other options are described below in the
     "OPTIONS" section.

     While the wave is being displayed, you  can  pan  and  zoom,
     stop  and  start  updates,  and make other changes.  This is
     described below in the "INTERACTIVE USE" section.

          Select the amplitude of the forcing function.   Typical
          numbers  are  between 20 and 100.  Default amplitude is
          100.

          Select which corners and edges of the  grid  are  bound
          and  which are free.  By default, all corners and edges
          are bound.  If you specify a single "0" or "1"  as  the
          argument to -bound, it applies to all eight corners and
          edges.  Otherwise, each character in the string applies
          to  one  corner  or edge: if that character is "0", the
          corresponding corner or edge is free; else it is bound.
          The  sequence  of  corners  and edges in the string is:
          lrlc, lr, lrhc, hc, hrhc, hr, hrlc, lc, where l is low,
          h  is  high,  r  is row, and c is column.  For example,
          -bound "00111000" means the  high  column  end  of  the
          grid, including those corners, are bound, and all other
          corners and edges are free.

          detailed  wave displays, but take longer to compute and

          to  a  specific set of switches (which you can see with
          the -printdemo command line option).  For a quick  tour
          of  the  program, run "xwave -demo N" starting with N=0

          Allows the user to interactively shape the  wave  while
          the  program  is  running.  When the program is in edit
          mode, the mouse controls an X-shaped cursor that  moves
          over  the  surface of the grid.  Position the cursor to
          where you want to modify the wave and  press  and  hold
          the  left  mouse  button.   At this point, dragging the
          mouse up and down will modify the amplitude of the wave
          and  dragging  it  left and right will control the fre-
          quency.  Releasing the mouse button will allow  you  to
          modify  additional points.  When you are finished edit-
          ing points, press the right mouse button to enter  con-
          tinuous run mode.

          full  cycle  should  force  a  zero  value  during  the
          remainder of the cycle.  By default, the forcing  func-
          tion takes no action during this part of the cycle, but
          lets the point move freely.  This affects the following
          forcing    functions:    delta,   pulse,   onehalfsine,
          onehalfsinesquared.

          onehalfsine, onehalfsinesquared.   If  "-omega2  1"  is
          specified,  each  of  these  functions will have a duty
          cycle of 1/2; if "-omega 2" is  specifed,  it  will  be

          the  grid  should appear below the plot of the position
          of each point in the grid.  The velocity information is
          updated only by the "wave" propagation function.

          Specify the name of the wave  propagation  function  to
          use.  You can specify none, which allows you to see the
          "naked" forcing function.  You can specify relax, which
          gives  a pleasant demo with the multisine forcing func-
          tion (the original xwave  program).   You  can  specify
          wave, which uses a physical wave propagation model.  In
          the wave model, each point has a mass of 1 and a  velo-
          city  as  well as a position.  A simple spring model is
          used, F = -K*x -B*v, where K  is  the  spring  constant
          (specified with -springconst) and B is the damping fac-
          tor (specified with -dampfactor).   The  distance  used
          for  x  is the simple vertical distance between a point
          and its neighbors.  Note that since this is a  discreet
          simulation,  the  simulation  is highly dispersive (low
          frequencies travel faster), so  single  pulses  do  not
          travel  very  well.   However,  you  can  still see the
          effects of reflection against a free or bound end,  set
          up  nice standing waves, see how the velocity is out of
          phase with the position, etc.

     While xwave is running, you can change  the  perspective  by
     using  the  mouse buttons.  You can pan the picture as it is
     running by holding down the middle mouse button  and  moving
     the mouse.  You can zoom in and out by holding down the left
     or right mouse buttons.  (Note that these operations do  not
     work unless xwave is running in continuous run mode.)

     There are a number of single-key keyboard commands  you  can
     enter into the graphics window of xwave.  These commands can
     be entered whether or not xwave is in continuous  run  mode.
     If  the  command  is not understood, the bell is rung.  Note
     that there may be a bit of delay in  processing  a  keyboard
     command when the program is in continuous run mode.

     cccc    Clear the data and reset  the  forcing  function  time;
          everything starts over again.

     dddd    Load the forcing function data.  This is useful when in
          step mode.

     ffff    Select a different forcing function.  The  new  forcing
          function name is printed out.

     pppp    Print out data.  Prints out all velocity  and  position
          data which is non-zero.  Mainly useful in step mode for
          debugging.

     rrrr    Toggle run/step mode.  In run mode,  the  program  runs
          continuously  and  updates  the  screen.  This consumes
          100% of the available cpu time,  and  looks  nice.   In
          step  mode,  you  can  step  through each generation by
