     xxxxccccmmmmaaaapppp is an X11 program that displays the  contents  of  the
     colormap  on  4,  6,  and  8-bit  PseudoColor (or GreyScale)
     displays.  It displays a grid  of  squares,  (4x4,  8x8,  or
     16x16   grid,  depending  on  the  number  of  planes)  that
     correspond to entries in the colormap.  The squares are  (of
     course) drawn in their corresponding color.

     You may click  (with  the  left  button)  on  any  of  these
     squares.  Doing so will display the pixel number correspond-
     ing to that square, and its red, green, and blue  components
     (as  4-digit  hex  numbers).  It will continue to do this as
     long as you hold the button down.

     Note:  This program points out a bug in the X11R2 server for
     the  IBM  RT Megapel display.  Essentially, the problem is a
     discrepancy between what the server THINKS the colormap  is,
     and what the colormap in the hardware ACTUALLY is.

     This program  only  works  on  colormapped  displays  (Pseu-
     doColor,  GreyScale,  StaticColor,  and StaticGrey visuals).
     Running it on a display that has a default  visual  type  of
     'TrueColor'  or  'DirectColor' will do nothing of value, and
     may or may not work at all.

     Also, this program only works on 4, 6, and  8-bit  displays.
     Period.
