     bbbbggggggggeeeennnn is a program that  generates  a  width-pixel  wide  by
     size-pixels  high vertical stripe.  The top of the stripe is
     in color (r1,g1,b1), and the bottom  of  the  stripe  is  in
     color  (rn,gn,bn).   Intermediate  colors  are  interpolated
     between these colors.  If you specify more  than  2  colors,
     the  stripe  passes through all the specified colors, in the
     order specified.

     The '-b' option specifies the number of significant bits  in
     the  (output) color specifications.  It must range between 1
     and 8, inclusive.  Use values less than 8 (the  default)  to
     limit color use by increasing the color granularity.

     Values for 'r', 'g', and 'b' should range between 0 and 255,
     inclusive.  0 means 'off', and 255 means 'fully on'.

     bbbbggggggggeeeennnn doesn't  actually  affect  your  background  directly.
     bbbbggggggggeeeennnn  merely generates a small PPM (Portable Pixmap Format)
     datafile that XV can read and display.

     To use bbbbggggggggeeeennnn, you should pipe its output into an XV command,
     such as:  "xv -root -quit -slow24"

     The default 'size' is 1024 pixels, which should be  as  tall
     as  your  display.  If your display is taller than that, you
     should specify its actual height, otherwise you will  get  a
     bizarre  repeating  effect,  that  you probably didn't want.
     Note:  If you specify small values of '-s', you can get some
     neat effects.

     The '-w' argument has been added to improve the  performance
     of  various  stippling algorithms (as in XV).  More informa-
     tion to work with, and such.  Try using  '-w  16'  on  these
     command lines to see what is meant.

     It'd probably be nice if the program used some  X  calls  to
     determine  screen  size.   It'd also probably be nice if the
     program could take colors by 'name', and also by hexadecimal
     value.
