     _x_v is an X11 program that displays images in the GIF,  JPEG,
     TIFF,  PBM,  PGM,  PPM, X11 bitmap, Utah Raster Toolkit RLE,
     PDS/VICAR, Sun Rasterfile,  BMP,  PCX,  IRIS  RGB,  possibly
     PostScript,  and  PM  formats  on workstations and terminals
     running the X Window System, Version 11.

     The documentation for XV is  now  distributed  *only*  as  a
     PostScript  file,  as it has gotten considerably larger, and
     is no longer very well suited  to  the  'man'  page  format.
     Print   a  copy  of  the  (100-ish  page)  manual  found  in
     'docs/xvdocs.ps'.  If you are unable to get  the  manual  to
     print on your printer, contact the author for further infor-
     mation.
