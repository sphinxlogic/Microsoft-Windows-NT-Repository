     ccccjjjjppppeeeegggg compresses the named image file, or the standard input
     if  no  file  is named, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on the
     standard output.  The currently supported input file formats
     are:  PPM  (PBMPLUS  color  format), PGM (PBMPLUS gray-scale
     format), GIF, Targa, and RLE (Utah Raster  Toolkit  format).
     (RLE is supported only if the URT library is available.)

OOOOPPPPTTTTIIIIOOOONNNNSSSS
     All switch names may be abbreviated; for example, ----ggggrrrraaaayyyyssssccccaaaalllleeee
     may  be  written ----ggggrrrraaaayyyy or ----ggggrrrr.  Most of the "basic" switches
     can be abbreviated to as little as one  letter.   Upper  and
     lower  case  are equivalent (thus ----GGGGIIIIFFFF is the same as ----ggggiiiiffff).
     British spellings  are  also  accepted  (e.g.,  ----ggggrrrreeeeyyyyssssccccaaaalllleeee),
     though for brevity these are not mentioned below.

     The basic switches are:

     ----qqqquuuuaaaalllliiiittttyyyy _N
          Scale quantization  tables  to  adjust  image  quality.
          Quality  is  0  (worst)  to  100 (best); default is 75.
          (See below for more info.)

     ----ggggrrrraaaayyyyssssccccaaaalllleeee
          Create monochrome JPEG file from color input.  Be  sure
          to  use  this  switch  when compressing a grayscale GIF
          file, because  ccccjjjjppppeeeegggg  isn't  bright  enough  to  notice
          whether a GIF file uses only shades of gray.  By saying
          ----ggggrrrraaaayyyyssssccccaaaalllleeee, you'll get a smaller JPEG file  that  takes
          less time to process.

     ----ooooppppttttiiiimmmmiiiizzzzeeee
          Perform optimization of  entropy  encoding  parameters.
          Without  this,  default  encoding  parameters are used.
          ----ooooppppttttiiiimmmmiiiizzzzeeee usually makes the JPEG file a little smaller,
          but  ccccjjjjppppeeeegggg  runs  somewhat  slower  and needs much more
          memory.  Image quality and speed of  decompression  are
          unaffected by ----ooooppppttttiiiimmmmiiiizzzzeeee.

     ----ttttaaaarrrrggggaaaa
          Input file is Targa format.  Targa files  that  contain
          an  "identification"  field  will  not be automatically
          recognized by ccccjjjjppppeeeegggg; for such files  you  must  specify

          ----ttttaaaarrrrggggaaaa to make ccccjjjjppppeeeegggg treat the input as Targa format.

     The ----qqqquuuuaaaalllliiiittttyyyy switch lets you trade off compressed file  size
     against  quality  of the reconstructed image: the higher the
     quality setting, the larger the JPEG file,  and  the  closer
     the  output  image  will be to the original input.  Normally
     you want to use the lowest quality setting  (smallest  file)
     that  decompresses into something visually indistinguishable
     from the original image.  For this purpose the quality  set-
     ting should be between 50 and 95; the default of 75 is often
     about right.  If you see defects at ----qqqquuuuaaaalllliiiittttyyyy 75, then go  up
     5 or 10 counts at a time until you are happy with the output
     image.  (The optimal setting will vary  from  one  image  to
     another.)

     ----qqqquuuuaaaalllliiiittttyyyy 100 will generate a quantization table of all  1's,
     eliminating  loss  in  the  quantization  step (but there is
     still information loss in subsampling, as well  as  roundoff
     error).  This setting is mainly of interest for experimental
     purposes.  Quality values above about 95 are nnnnooootttt recommended
     for  normal  use;  the compressed file size goes up dramati-
     cally for hardly any gain in output image quality.

     In the other direction, quality values below 50 will produce
     very small files of low image quality.  Settings around 5 to
     10 might be useful in preparing an index of  a  large  image
     library, for example.  Try ----qqqquuuuaaaalllliiiittttyyyy 2 (or so) for some amus-
     ing Cubist effects.  (Note: quality values  below  about  25
     generate  2-byte  quantization  tables, which are considered
     optional in the JPEG standard.  ccccjjjjppppeeeegggg emits a  warning  mes-
     sage  when  you give such a quality value, because some com-
     mercial JPEG programs may be unable to decode the  resulting
     file.)

     Switches for advanced users:

     ----mmmmaaaaxxxxmmmmeeeemmmmoooorrrryyyy _N
          Set limit for amount of memory  to  use  in  processing
          large  images.  Value is in thousands of bytes, or mil-
          lions of bytes if "M" is attached to the  number.   For
          example,  ----mmmmaaaaxxxx 4444mmmm selects 4000000 bytes.  If more space
          is needed, temporary files will be used.

     ----rrrreeeessssttttaaaarrrrtttt _N
          Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows, or every N
          MCU  blocks if "B" is attached to the number.  ----rrrreeeessssttttaaaarrrrtttt
          0000 (the default) means no restart markers.

     ----ssssmmmmooooooootttthhhh _N
          Smooth the input image to  eliminate  dithering  noise.
          N,  ranging  from  1  to 100, indicates the strength of
          smoothing.  0 (the default) means no smoothing.

     ----vvvveeeerrrrbbbboooosssseeee
          Enable debug printout.  More  ----vvvv's  give  more  output.
          Also, version information is printed at startup.

     ----ddddeeeebbbbuuuugggg
          Same as ----vvvveeeerrrrbbbboooosssseeee.

     The ----rrrreeeessssttttaaaarrrrtttt option inserts extra markers that allow a  JPEG
     decoder   to   resynchronize  after  a  transmission  error.
     Without restart markers, any damage  to  a  compressed  file
     will  usually  ruin the image from the point of the error to
     the end of the image; with restart markers,  the  damage  is
     usually  confined to the portion of the image up to the next
     restart marker.  Of course, the restart markers occupy extra
     space.   We  recommend  ----rrrreeeessssttttaaaarrrrtttt  1111  for images that will be
     transmitted across unreliable networks such as Usenet.

     The ----ssssmmmmooooooootttthhhh option filters the input to eliminate fine-scale
     noise.   This  is  often useful when converting GIF files to
     JPEG: a moderate smoothing factor of 10 to 50  gets  rid  of
     dithering patterns in the input file, resulting in a smaller
     JPEG file and a better-looking image.  Too large a smoothing
     factor will visibly blur the image, however.

          Use the quantization  tables  given  in  the  specified
          file.   The  file should contain one to four tables (64
          values each) as plain text.  Comments preceded  by  '#'
          may be included in the file.  The tables are implicitly
          numbered 0,1,etc.  If ----qqqquuuuaaaalllliiiittttyyyy N is also specified, the
          values  in  the  file  are  scaled according to ccccjjjjppppeeeegggg's
          quality scaling curve.

     ----ssssaaaammmmpppplllleeee _H_x_V[,...]
          Set JPEG sampling factors.  If you  specify  fewer  H/V
          pairs  than  there  are  components, the remaining com-
          ponents are set to 1x1 sampling.  The  default  setting
          is equivalent to ----ssssaaaammmmpppplllleeee 2222xxxx2222.
