Program:	xv
Revision:	2.20
Date ported:	15 May 1993
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.3.3

Prerequisites:	

Documentation:	none, apparently. jpeg has man pages. Install with
		install-sysv.

Installation:	xmkmf, *modify Makefiles*, make depend, make, make
		install, install-sysv

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4

1. Top level has Imakefile, but it doesn't affect the subdirectories.
   The Makefiles here needed to be modified by hand.

Revision:	3.0
Date ported:	6 February 1994
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.5.8

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4

1. Fix top level Imakefile to build Makefiles in subdirectories
   (missing IHaveSubdirs in the Imakefile).

2. xcmap.c includes <strings.h>. Conditionally use <string.h> instead
   if SVR4 set.

3. jpeg/cjpeg failed to link with missing jmem_init and friends. Seems
   that the Imakefile forgot to default the memory management
   routines. Add jmemansi.[co] for SVR4.

4. xv fails to link with missing sigblock. Adding -lucb kills xv
   because of the broken directory routines in /usr/ucblib/libucb.a.
   Copy libucb.a to the local directory and remove readdir.o and
   scandir.o

5. install.man fails in jpeg: two man pages are incorrectly named, the
   other doesn't exist. Create a dummy entry for ckconfig.
