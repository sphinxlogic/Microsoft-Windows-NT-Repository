     is a simple straight forward bitmap editing program.  It  is
     designed to read and write either PPM or XBM format images.

     XPaint is broken up into two major components:  the toolbox,
     used  for  selection of an operation; and image areas, where
     actual editing takes place.

TTTToooooooollllbbbbooooxxxx
     The toolbox window is displayed when xpaint is started.  The
     toolbox  is  used  to  select an operation which can then be
     applied to any image area presented  (painting  window,  fat
     bits,  pattern editor, etc.).  The window has a selection of
     painting operations (as icons) and  four  pull  down  menus:
     "File",  "Brush",  "Line"  and  "Font".   _I_c_o_n_s Click on the
     painting operation that you are interested in performing  on
     the canvas.  Can be one of: Brush, Spray, Pencil, Line, Arc,
     Fill, Text, Select Rectangle, Select Area, Box, Filled  Box,
     Oval,  Filled  Oval,  Connected  Line,  Polygon,  or  Filled
     Polygon.  Both Box, and Oval support holding down the  shift
     key to provide for Square and Circle operations.

     FFFFiiiilllleeee      The file  menu  allows  you  to  create  either  a
               default  sized canvas (512x512) or choose the size
               that you wish.  You  can  also  read  an  existing
               image from disk via the "Open" option.

     FFFFoooonnnntttt      Choose the font you are interested in via  one  of
               the default choices or use the browser.

     LLLLiiiinnnneeee      Choose either a given line width or input a  value
               via  a  dialog  box.  Widths must be between 1 and
               1000.

     BBBBrrrruuuusssshhhh     The brush menu has two choices: change  the  brush
               style or the spray paint gun.  If the brush opera-
               tion is currently selected, the new brush style is
               applied  immediately when clicked upon.  The spray
               paint gun may be changed by modifying  the  radius
               area and density parameters.

     The painting window contains a canvas where editing  of  the
     image  takes  place  and  a  pattern  area for selecting the
     current color/pattern.  It should be fairly simple to figure
     out  what  to do.  Given any selected tool from the toolbox,

     it will paint upon the image with the current pattern.

     _C_a_n_v_a_s    The canvas is where the selected tool  is  applied
               to the current image.

     _P_a_t_t_e_r_n_s  The pattern area presently contains two  parts:  a
               set of solid colors (on a color display) and a set
               of black and  white  patterns.   The  two  buttons
               start  the  Pattern  Editor  (described  below) to
               change or add patterns for the current session.

     FFFFiiiilllleeee      The file menu allows you to save either the  whole
               image or a region (if one is selected).  Addition-
               ally, this is where the  close  window  option  is
               located.

     EEEEddddiiiitttt      You can either undo the last action that you  per-
               formed,  or  cut/copy/paste  the  current selected
               region.  It is possible to cut images between dif-
               ferent painting windows, if you wish.

     IIIImmmmaaaaggggeeee     This menu allows you to change  the  current  zoom
               factor  for  the  editing  area or the image size.
               Additionally, the grid (snap) can be set or  unset
               and the grid spacing changed.

     This window is presented when adding a new  pattern  to  the
     system,  or  editing an existing pattern.  It functions very
     similarly to the standard painting window.  It includes it's
     own  "Palette" region, where you can select (and change) the
     current color map for the image and pattern.

     _C_a_n_v_a_s    This is simply a zoomed version  of  the  pattern,
               all standard operations apply to it.

     _P_a_l_e_t_t_e   The palette area consists of two  parts:  all  the
               available  colors that which can be applied to the
               current pattern; and a set of  sliders  to  adjust
               the  red,  green, and blue values of the currently
               selected color.

     FFFFiiiilllleeee      File is primarily to LLLLooooaaaadddd  existing  patterns  off
               disk,  or to SSSSaaaavvvveeee the current pattern to the disk.
               Any image may be loaded as a pattern, but will  be
               truncated  to  a 32x32 image.  CCCClllloooosssseeee from the file
               menu is the same as saying ok, which applies  your
               changes to the current pattern.

               Ok applies changes or  additions  to  the  current
               patterns  and  exits.   Cancel  aborts any changes
               that have been made during the Pattern Editor ses-
               sion.

     David Koblas, koblas@netcom.com. I am interested in how this
     program  is  used,  if you find any bugs, I'll fix them.  If
     you notice any rough spots, or think of some way in which it
     could be better, feel free to drop me a message.
