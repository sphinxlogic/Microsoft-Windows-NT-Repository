This directory contains source and objects for glibc, the GNU C
Library

Revision:	1.07
Author:		Roland McGrath, Free Software Foundation
Date ported:	5 February 1994
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.5.8
		gas-2.2

Prerequisites:	GNU as, GNU make to build.

Documentation:	info, .dvi hardcopy

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		This package still has beta status. We have tested it,
		but not very extensively. If you run into trouble,
		please contact both us and the folks at the FSF.

		This package has the most opaque Makefile structure I
		have ever seen. It relies heavily on features only
		available in GNU make. This explains why I have
		chosen to do some things by hand rather than to
		analyze the Makefiles.

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4.

1. Assembly of sysdeps/i386/add_n.S fails. Turns out that it requires
   gas syntax. After porting gas, discover that gas-2.2 doesn't
   understand the loop command any more (will always produce an error
   message, even if the target is in range). Fix by defining the
   instruction as a byte sequence. This also occurs in sub_n.S.

2. TeX dies trying to format glibc documentation (700 pages). Rebuild
   TeX with larger limits.

3. Multiple problems with make install:

   - For some reason, make install fails when invoked from the
     automated scripts: make claims a circular dependency and tries to
     install non-existent files. Perform install and package
     construction without the aid of the LEMIS scripts.  - Building
     stubs.h has an incorrect rule: it looks for a file
     manual-stubs.h, which does not exist. Rather than tamper with the
     intricate Makefile structures, just create the (empty) file.

--------------------

3. Make install dies anyway with problems ignoring non-existent
   documentation. This is after all documentation has been installed,
   so just ignore it.

4. Install did not, however, install stubs.h, maybe because it was a
   dummy file. Do manually.
