     _F_a_s_t_m_a_i_l is a low-level interface to the  mail  system  that
     allows  batch processing of mail.  It's intended for mailing
     to very large groups of people in a staggered fashion.

     The starting options are;

     ----bbbb bbbbcccccccc----lllliiiisssstttt
               This allows a list of  people  to  receive  blind-
               carbon copies, or BCCs, of the message.  This list
               should be full email addresses.

     ----cccc cccccccc----lllliiiisssstttt
               This allows a list of  people  to  receive  carbon
               copies,  or CCs, of the message.  This list should
               be full email addresses.

     ----dddd        Debug.  This is helpful  for  strange,  unfriendly
               errors from the program (etc).

     ----ffff ffffrrrroooommmm   This overrides the users name in the  From:  line,
               so  that  if  the user was x@y, and their name was
               MrX then the default From: line  would  be  "From:
               x@y  (MrX)".   Using  "-f Joe" when invoking this,
               though, would change it to "From: x@y (Joe)"

     ----rrrr rrrreeeeppppllllyyyyttttoooo
               Occasionally, you might send  mail  but  want  the
               replies  to go to a different address (very common
               with mailing lists). There is a  header  for  this
               purpose  called  "Reply-To:" which can be utilized
               by using this starting option.   For  example,  we
               could send mail with a reply-to to list-request by
               using "-r  list-request".   The  header  generated
               would   then  be  of  the  form  "Reply-To:  list-
               request".

     ----ssss ssssuuuubbbbjjjjeeeecccctttt
               The subject of the message is specified  by  using
               this starting option.

     Either the name of the file containing the message, or  a  -
     to indicate usage of standard-in is required.

     Let's say we're user "big" on machine "big-vax" and we  have
     a shell script called 'batch-mail' that contains the follow-
     ing lines:

        #
        # Batch Mail - batch mailing of a file to a LOT of users
        #
        # Usage: batch-mail "from" "subject" filename

        sender_copy = $LOGIN
        replyto = "The-Mr-Big-list"

        fastmail -b $sender_copy -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person1
        sleep 10
        fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person2
        sleep 10
        fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person3
        sleep 10
        fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person4

        < etc >

     with the invocation:

        batch-mail "Mr. Big" "Warning to all" warning.text

     would mail a copy of the  'warning.text'  file  to  person1,
     person2, person3, etc.  "$LOGIN" will also receive a copy of
     the first message in the  mail,  _s_i_l_e_n_t_l_y.   Each  resultant
     message will include the headers:

         From: big-vax!big (Mr. Big)
         Subject: Warning to all
         Reply-To: The-Mr-Big-list

     This program should turn out to be considerably faster  than
     the alternative methods of accomplishing this task.
