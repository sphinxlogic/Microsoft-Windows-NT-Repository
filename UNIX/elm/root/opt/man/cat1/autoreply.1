     to  enable  users  to easily set up an automatic response to
     all mail they receive.  This is typically during a  vacation
     or  some other period of time that the user is not available
     to reply to mail (although some people get enough mail  that
     they  have it permanently running to simply send an "ack" to
     each message)

     The system is quite easy to use...  You can type "autoreply"
     and  be informed of your current status in the system (on or
     off), or "autoreply off" will turn your autoreplying off.

     To add yourself to the system, you need merely to compose  a
     form  response  in  a  file  somewhere, then type "autoreply
     _f_i_l_e" where _f_i_l_e is the name of the file.

     For this to function  correctly,  the  program  "arepdaemon"
     must  be  running  as  a daemon in background.  This program
     automatically checks all the currently  enrolled  users  for
     new mail in their mailboxes...

     Unfortunately, this program isn't too brilliant about  iden-
     tifying  mail that shouldn't be responded to (like mail from
     other daemons, or your mother) but  that's  a  more  general
     problem anyway.

     Also, occasionally a user will remove  themselves  from  the
     autoreply  system  and the system won't turn their autoreply
     off.  This is a problem that hasn't been solved  yet  (obvi-
     ously  since  it's  in the "bugs" section!!) and any further
     information would be appreciated!
