Hints on setting up sendmail

Greg Lehey, LEMIS, 1 May 1993

- grading in this flavour of uucp is either high, medium or low (at
  least on our system). If your sendmail.cf file contains a different
  -g flag for uux, everything will seem to work fine, uux will print a
  message into a virtual bit bucket and stop. To see what grades you
  have on your system, enter

    # uuglist
    high
    low
    medium
    #

    Choose whichever of these seem appropriate for the function.
