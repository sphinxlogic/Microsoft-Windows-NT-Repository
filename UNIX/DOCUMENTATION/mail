the svr4 mail situation is a little unusual, so let me try to clarify:
svr4 comes with *two* completely different mail systems:

1. the "native" mailer (for lack of a better name), is a completely new
   implementation of /bin/mail (transport and user agent) based on prior
   work done at bell labs research (upas) and attmail code (pmx).  it uses
   a regular-expression based parser (/etc/mail/mailsurr) to route mail.
   it also has, as a separate subsystem, an smtp queuer and receiver.
   this smtp implementation is from research as well, and it interfaces
   to the mail system proper in a way very similar to uux.  this smtp
   queuer does handle mx records.  at&t easylink services (former attmail)
   develops this for unix system laboratories (usl).  this is considered
   the "real" mailer of svr4, and has no relation whatsoever to sendmail.

2. "sendmail" exists in the "berkeley compatibility section" of svr4.
   it is based on the latest sun os sendmail; there is really no difference
   at all between bsd sendmail and svr4 sendmail.  it does everything
   the usual sendmail way: smtp built in, mx handling, etc.  nobody is
   actively developing sendmail; it is only in svr4 to satisfy those
   who need to transition from bsd.

there's also an enhanced mailx (aka berkeley mail) which merges the
system v and sun os variants plus adds some new features and bug fixes.
this is also developed by easylink.

so there are two mailers: the native one, which does lots of new and
different stuff, is radically different from sendmail, and is being actively
developed and enhanced; and then there's sendmail, which is just a port
of the sun os version, and nobody much cares about it.

Presence of the mailsurr file would indicate that this is either SVR4
mail or some other derivative of attmail. 
I have posted an overview of setting things up for SVR4 mail(1)/rmail(1),
I hope this may be useful for folks new to the SVR4 mailer.

Yes, we have the same here in London. We use an SVR3.2 machine as our
gateway running UNIX SVR4.1 Mail (has mailsurr and mailcnfg in /etc/mail).
Internally we have various machines running SVR4 , SVR4.1 and SVR3.
The internal hosts are hidden from the outside world.

There are two directories used by the SVR4 mailer
/etc/mail - contains configuration files 
/usr/lib/mail - contains utility programmes used by the mail subsystem

The following notes concentrate on /etc/mail.

1) /etc/mail
A typical contents listing of /etc/mail follows:
binarsys        fullnames       groups          lists           localiases 
mailcnfg        mailsurr        mailx.rc        namefiles       

The key files for use are mailcnfg and mailsurr:
/etc/mail/mailcnfg:

This is used to initialise the mail(1) and rmail(1) commands
the fields CLUSTER, DOMAIN and SMARTERHOST are of particular importance.

CLUSTER - can be used to name a group of machines. The string supplied
          is used instead of the domain name when mail supplies the
          remote from line.
DOMAIN  - string used to supply the domain name for the From: line
SMARTERHOST - can be set to a machine that has better routing information
            in case the local machine does not understand the address

Some other useful fields

FAILSAFE - can be used to denote a machine to which delivery should
           be made in case local delivery fails - useful when using
           mail in a networked environment
DEL_EMPTY_FILE - if value set to no empty mailfiles are not deleted by
                 mail or mailx

# -----example /etc/mail/mailcnfg -------
# the combination of CLUSTER and DOMAIN make mailx give the From: 
# line as CLUSTER@DOMAIN, in this example usr@foo.dom.co.uk
CLUSTER=foo	
DOMAIN=dom.co.uk

# Setting SMARTERHOST lets the system send mail to a host
# that can handle the routing if it does not understand the
# address
# for internal hosts SMARTERHOST should be the name of the gateway
# for the gateway, SMARTERHOST could be the nearest backbone
SMARTERHOST=backbone	

# If for some reason we can't deliver the mail locally, pass
# it internally to another FAILSAFE machine
FAILSAFE=olim386
# ------end example-------

/etc/mail/mailsurr:

This file contains a set of rules for routing and transport of mail.
Each entry in the file consists of three fields.

'sender'	  'recipient'	'command'

The sender and recipient fields are regular expressions.  If
these first two fields match those of the mail message being
processed, the associated command is ran.

Examples of mailsurr entries follow, for a full explanation
you should refer to the SVR4 man page for mailsurr(4).

#    Prevent all shell meta-characters

'.+'	'!*#.*'			'Deny'

#    If none of the above work, then ship remote mail	off to a smarter host.

#    Log successful message deliveries
'(.+)' '(.+)'	'>/usr/lib/mail/surrcmd/logger \\1 \\2'

/etc/mail/namefiles:
SVR4 mail has a convenient method of alias processing, and the
mailer calls a utility called mailalias. The mailalias utility if
it cannot find a user locally or a mailbox (SVR4 mail delivers to
mailfiles as well as user) looks for a list of alias files in
/etc/mail/namefiles

The default files are /etc/mail/lists and /etc/mail/names. I have
added a couple of local files, /etc/mail/groups for internal groups,
/etc/mail/localiases for internal distribution and /etc/mail/fullnames 
which has long names so this file looks like:

# --- example /etc/mail/namefiles -----
/etc/mail/lists
/etc/mail/names
# Local add-ons
/etc/mail/groups
/etc/mail/localiases
/etc/mail/fullnames
# -----end example ----

/etc/mail/groups could be:

# ---- example /etc/mail/groups -----
#	All the local groups within Sitename.This is the definitive copy used by
#	all the mail interfaces (it's totally transparent to them all).
#

managers	john fred wendy june
staff		joan michelle rita \

all		managers staff
# --- end example --

/etc/mail/localiases could be:

# ----- example /etc/mail/localiases ----
#	localiases:
#		These are purely local, readily changeable aliases for mapping
#	user@site.domain to internal host!user
#

# --- end example ----

/etc/mail/mailx.rc:
Same as pre-SVR4 /usr/lib/mailx/mailx.rc. Contains start up
defaults for mailx(1).

/etc/mail/binarsys:
A file containing a list of sites to whom it is possible to
send binary mail. Can be set to default=n , if you don't
want to send binary mail.

2) /usr/lib/mail:
The directory contains utilities used by the SVR4 mail system.
The contents of the top level directory are mainly used for 
delivery to pipes (mail_pipe) and the /usr/bin/vacation command.

An ls of /usr/lib/mail reveals:

mail_pipe mailsurr notify2 surrcmd vacation2

The /usr/lib/mail/surrcmd contains ancillary commands used by
the mailsurr file:

ckbinarsys fromsmtp smtp smtpd smtpqer smtpsched tosmtp

The standard utilities provided are for  support of smtp and
checking binary mail can be sent. Other locally added scripts
can be placed in this directory.
