self-isa is (was?) a valid decl.  It is still a valid decl under  
NeXTSTEP 3.0 too.

While it might be valid it is EXTREEMLY bad programming style to use
it.  For it to be valid, you MUST declare the object typed rather than
"dynamically typed" as with "id".  For example:

        Object *myObject;

        printf ("%s\n", myObject->isA);

Is valid, but it is not guaranteed to always work.  It's my opinion
that if you HAVE to use this to make it work, then your machine or
compiler is broken.  Since I use Alphas daily, I can testify that it's
the machine that's broken in my opinion.  Anyway, when I get some
spare time I'm going to work on getting the GCC compiler to work
better on the boxes... if I have to use them, I should at least have a
decent compiler.
