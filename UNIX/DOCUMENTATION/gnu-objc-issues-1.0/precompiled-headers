Here is some quick info on precompiled headers:

The precomp format is:

- generated by cpp-precomp (NeXT integrated cpp/parser framework)
- independent of the compiler proper (cc1)
- intended to support various programming activities (as demonstrated by HeaderViewer/precompiled headers)

The current implementation:

- supports ANSI-C/Objective-C (not C++)
- is undocumented (the API might be included in a future release)

I was thinking.

What about using the precompiled headers produced by NeXT gcc? Rather than
hacking extensively on the compiler, much of the information for providing
runtime information on C++ classes might easily be extracted from them.  I
don't know a lot about the structure of them (lacking in documentation) but
I believe the NeXT HeaderViewer relies on it exclusively to provide sufficient
data for viewing the ObjC class hierarchy.  Might this work for C++ as well.
