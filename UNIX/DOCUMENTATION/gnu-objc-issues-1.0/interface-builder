whoops, sorry, I might as well share this with all just for knowledge's 
sake.

NeXT's Interface Builder (which some tout and others scorn)
creates NIB files, which are loaded in by the Application
Object (usually) before an [App run] message is sent.

It is basically an archive of all the instanciated objects that
were created in the Interface Builder.  Thus is contains "more
than one object" which the previous discussion was about.

Multiple NIB files are often used for parts of the program that
may or (usually) may not be brought into play.  Such as a window
with detailed help features or an "info box".
