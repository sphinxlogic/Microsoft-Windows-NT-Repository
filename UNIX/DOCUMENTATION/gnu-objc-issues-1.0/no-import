This is really annoying, and I don't understand why gcc has this warning on by default.  I posted a question about this to gnu.misc.discuss and got no replies.  You can stop the pest by putting -Wno-import on the command line when you compile, or if you want to kill it forever edit /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<machine-type>/2.3.2/specs:

[...]

*cpp:
%{!ansi:-D__EXTENSIONS__} -D_MIPSEB -D_SYSTYPE_SYSV %{.S:      
-D_LANGUAGE_ASSEMBLY %{!ansi:-DLANGUAGE_ASSEMBLY}} %{.cc:      
-D_LANGUAGE_C_PLUS_PLUS} %{.cxx:        -D_LANGUAGE_C_PLUS_PLUS} %{.C: 
-D_LANGUAGE_C_PLUS_PLUS} %{.m:  -D_LANGUAGE_OBJECTIVE_C -Wno-import} %{!.S:
                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^
%{!.cc: %{!.cxx: %{!.C: %{!.m: -D_LANGUAGE_C %{!ansi:-DLANGUAGE_C}}}}}}

[...]

I could not find any documentation on the specs file so I'm guessing that my modification won't break anything.  Another route would be to modify the cccp source code.
