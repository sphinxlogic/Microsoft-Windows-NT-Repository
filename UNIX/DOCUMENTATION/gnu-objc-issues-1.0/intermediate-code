These are some trivial questions, but I can't seem to get them answered 
anywhere else:

1:  When I compile an Obj-C program using gcc (Version 2.3.2) and -Wall, I
  get the following warning occuring N times, where N is (apparently) the number
  of methods I have in the class:

  List.m:299: warning: aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer

  Where line 299 is the line AFTER the last line in the file.  What does this 
  error mean?

2: Is there anyway to get gcc to give me the intermediate C code that is
  produced from the Objective-C code that I write?  i.e. I'd like to be able
  to write stuff in Objective-C, but give the programs to people who only have
  a C compiler.

3: Why does gcc not like "#import" statements?  It seems that
  using "#include" with the #ifndef _File_INCLUDE_ statements is kind of a
  ugly way to do this.

Bzzz... thank you for playing :-) GCC doesn't generate anything like C
from Objective-C, but instead generates a "generic" pseudocode (RTL I
believe it's called).  This is portable between GCCs on different
platforms, but not to other compilers.  You could theoretically run
the second pass manually I guess to convert this to object code.  But
Objective-C is not translated a'la C-front code for C++.

I was able to get enough info out of the .s file to write C that worked like Objective C.  It helped clarify the documentation on the NeXT Objective C funtions.

for example

  ...
Integer *myValue = [Integer new: 17];

[myValue increment:21];
[myValue print];
 ...

can probably be written in C

  myValue = msgSend(getClass("Integer"), getUid("init:"), 17);
  msgSend(myValue, getUid("increment:"), 21);
  msgSend(myValue, getUid("print"));

NOTE:  I have not tested the C code above.  I did get something like the above to work with Modula-2 calling Objective-C.  C should be easier.
