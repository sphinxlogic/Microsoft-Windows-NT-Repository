@node Conclusion

This guide is far from complete---the Internet changes on a daily (if
not hourly) basis.  However, this booklet should provide enough
information to make the incredible breadth and complexity of the
Internet a mite less imposing.  Coupled with some exploration and
experimentation, every user has the potential to be a competent net
citizen, using the facilities that are available to their fullest.
