Some System Administration Problems encountered with UNIX/386 System
V.4.2, and some possible answers.

The following problems are in the format Problem (P:), Explanation
(E:), Solution (S:) and Workaround (W:).

P: When I load or unload a cartridge tape, the system freezes until
   the load/unload is complete.

E: This looks like a driver problem. It has been reportted to USL, but
   as of the time of writing, no solution has been reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P: When compiling big programs, I get the message "no more processes"
   from the compiler. I don't seem to be out of processes.

E: This message comes from the assembler and seems to indicate an
   overflow of an internal table. The message itself is incorrect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P: When trying to create a big file, I get the message "File too big".
   What does this mean?

E: This is caused by the ulimit being set to an unrealistically low
   value. You can check this with the command `ulimit'. Novell, for
   example, sets this value to 8192 by default, which means that you
   can't create files larger than 8192 sectors (of 512 bytes, giving a
   maximum file size of 4194304 bytes.

S: This is documented in the System Performance Administration manual,
   page 3-25. However, the information presented there is not correct.
   To raise the limit, you need to be root and enter the following
   commands:

     /etc/conf/bin/idtune HFSZLIM LIMIT
     /etc/conf/bin/idtune SFSZLIM LIMIT

   This sets the tunable parameters HFSZLIM (hard file size limit) and
   SFSZLIM (soft file size limit) to the value LIMIT. This is the
   maximum number of bytes in a file. To dispense with any limit, set
   LIMIT to 0x7fffffff. For example, to set the limit to 100
   Megabytes, you could enter

     /etc/conf/bin/idtune HFSZLIM 100000000
     /etc/conf/bin/idtune SFSZLIM 100000000

   In addition, you need to modify the ulimit value either in
   /etc/default/login. For example, to set the limit to 100 Megabytes,
   you will have to set ulimit to the number of 512 byte blocks in 100
   Megabytes. Enter the line:

      ulimit 200000

   to set ulimit to 200000 blocks.

   Finally, you need to rebuild the system. Enter

     /etc/conf/bin/idbuild

   and then reboot the system. After rebooting, the limit will be
   changed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P: I have installed NFS on my system and mounted some remote file
   systems. After reboot, the file systems don't come up again. If I
   try to get them to come up manually, the system doesn't complain,
   but I don't get a connection.

E: There are a number of reasons for this. The most serious is that
   the graphical user interface frequently drops error messages. If
   you did this in the graphical user interface, start a terminal and
   enter:

     $ su
     Password:     (enter the root password)
     # mount -f nfs remote:/fs /remotefs

   This assumes that the remote system is called `remote', that the
   name of the file system on the remote system is `/fs', and that you
   want to mount it under the directory name `/remotefs' on your local
   system.

   When you do this, there is a good chance that you will get the
   message

     NFS: mount failed - rpcbind not running

   Round about here, we don't know what's going on either. You should
   first check whether the message is correct. Enter

     # ps -ef|grep rpcbind

   If rpcbind is running, you should get a reply like

     root   135   131  0  Apr 23  ?        0:44 rpcbind

   If it isn't, you can start it:

     # /etc/inet/rpcbind&

   but in our experience, rpcbind will be running. Sorry, we don't
   know what's going on here either.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P: I have uninstalled TCP/IP support from my system and reinstalled
   it, but now I can't get it to start up.

E: Check whether you still have a network interface:

   # netstat -i

   You should see at least one line (apart from lo0, which is a
   loopback interface which doesn't require network hardware). We have
   seen cases where the network interface gets deleted by disinstall,
   but the only way we have found to get it back again is to install
   the system from scratch.

W: Installation works fine when it works, but you have to be careful
   not to have too many special wishes. If something goes wrong, it is
   frequently easier to re-install the system from scratch than to
   recover.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P: I have an SVGA card in my computer, but install still gives me a
   low-resolution 640x480 display. How do I get it to give me
   1024x768?

S: Run /usr/X/adm/setvga. It helps to know what chipset your SVGA
   board has. Frequently this is supplied with the documentation;
   otherwise you can check the big square chips on the board itself,
   which may give you something to go by.

   The first thing setvgamode asks you for is which chipset you have;
   however, the category 0 `misc SVGA' includes some of these too. The
   final column in the display is an undescribed mnemonic, but seems
   to be related to the manufacturer. Your guess is as good as ours
   here. Choose what you think will be a good resolution, and cross
   your fingers.

   When you next restart the desktop, the new definitions will be in
   effect. You should do this by rebooting the system: that way, if
   something goes wrong (and it frequently does), you will be able to
   return to the character mode interface from the login screen by
   entering Alt-E. If you start your desktop directly, you may not be
   able to see enough to stop the desktop again.

   Note that only a few boards are described directly. For example,
   you can choose a Diamond SpeedStar from the Tseng ET4000 chipset
   descriptions. If you have a `compatible' board, however, you may
   find that things don't work. This is because most boards have
   different dot clocks: under DOS this is covered up for by the
   drivers supplied with the board, but of course this doesn't work
   under UNIX. If you really can't find a way to get the board to
   work, you can always get hold of XFree86, a public domain version
   of X11R5, which has more configuration capabilities than the
   standard server.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P: In the terminal interface, when I enter something like

     $ chmod me *

   I get the message `argument list too long'.

S: This may be due to an unrealistically low maximum argument list
   length in the kernel (ARG_MAX). According to POSIX.1, it should be
   20480 bytes, but some standard kernels have as few as 5000 bytes.
   To change this, need to be root and enter the following commands:

     /etc/conf/bin/idtune ARG_MAX 20480
     /etc/conf/bin/idbuild

   and then reboot the system. After rebooting, the limit will be
   changed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

P: If I try to access files on diskette while reading tapes, the
   system claims that the diskette is unreadable.

E: You are probably getting overrun errors on the diskette drive.
   These occur when the system doesn't acknowledge data quickly
   enough, which can happen if some other part of the system is very
   busy. If you do this from the console (i.e. not in the Unix
   Desktop) you should then see error messages stating that an overrun
   has occurred.

W: Don't access diskettes and tapes at the same time.
