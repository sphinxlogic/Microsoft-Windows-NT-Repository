This directory contains source and objects for gdb, the GNU debugger

Revision:	4.11
Author:		Free Software Foundation
Date ported:	31 January 1994
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.5.8

Installation:	make, make install. The compressed man page is
		installed as well with make install.

Prerequisites:	none

Documentation:	Reference card: make refcard.dvi (TeX dvi format) or
		make refcard.ps (Postscript).

		Manual: make gdb.dvi (TeX dvi format) or
		make gdb.info (info files)

		man page

Comments:	This directory includes copies of some other helper
		functions. It represents Cygnus' intention to
		restructure the GNU directories, but is currently
		incomplete. The real gdb stuff is in the subdirectory
		gdb.

		This program will not compile with UnixWare version
		1.0: Univel's version of the header file
		/usr/include/link.h is not related to UNIX, and does
		not contain any definition for the structure r_debug,
		which is needed in order to compile gdb. The header
		file from which we derived the correct definitions is
		unfortunately subject to a USL license agreement, so
		we cannot include it in this distribution. If you want
		to recompile this package under UnixWare, please
		contact Univel for the correct link.h header file.

		To install the formatted man pages, a couple of
		less-than-nice tricks were played on the Makefile.
		These need to be reconsidered.

Modifications:

0. CC=gcc CFLAGS="-g -O3" configure --prefix=/opt. CFLAGS and CC were
   ignored; fix Makefile.in, configure --prefix=/opt.

1. Compile of gdb/solib.c fails with undefined struct r_debug. This is
   defined in link.h, but in UnixWare link.h contains Netware-specific
   information, and the correct link.h is not included in the
   distribution. Use the link.h from Consensys V4.2.

2. Compile of bfd/elf32.c failed: sigset_t is only defined in
   sys/signal.h if __STDC__ is 0, or _POSIX_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE
   are defined - obviously not the real intention. Modify header file
   to ignore the value of __STDC__, as long as it is set.n

3. The final object failed to link with memory problems. 

     ld: gdb: libelf error:  Memory error: output file space elf_update:
     make[1]: *** [gdb] Error 1
     make: *** [all-gdb] Error 1

   After removing -g from the CFLAGS, it compile and linked clean.
   This appears to be a problem with CCS.

4. Install to /opt fails: install script expects parent not to be root
   directory. Modify install script at install-dirs.
