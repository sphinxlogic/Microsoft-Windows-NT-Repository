     _x_b_o_a_r_d is an X11/Xt/Athena Widgets chessboard that can serve
     as  a user interface for GNU Chess or for the Internet Chess
     Server.

     As an interface to GNU Chess, _x_b_o_a_r_d lets you  play  a  game
     against the machine, set up arbitrary positions, force vari-
     ations, or watch a game between two machines.

     As an interface to the Internet Chess  Server,  _x_b_o_a_r_d  lets
     you  play  against  other  ICS users, observe games they are
     playing, or review games that have recently finished.

     You can also use _x_b_o_a_r_d as a chessboard to play  out  games.
     It  will  read  through  a  game  file  or allow you to play
     through a variation manually.  This is  useful  for  keeping
     track  of email postal games, browsing games off the net, or
     reviewing GNU Chess and ICS games you have saved.

     After starting _x_b_o_a_r_d, you make moves by pressing mouse but-
     ton  1  while the cursor is over a square with your piece on
     it and dragging the mouse to another square.

     The following command line options correspond to X resources
     with  the same names, so you can set them in your ._X_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s
     file if you like.  For options  that  have  two  names,  the
     longer one is the name of the corresponding X resource.

             _x_b_o_a_r_d accepts standard Xt  options  like  -display,
             -geometry, and -iconic.

             If this option is True, _x_b_o_a_r_d alerts you by ringing
             the  terminal  bell  after  each  of your opponent's
             moves (or after every move if you  are  observing  a
             game on the Internet Chess Server).  The bell is not
             rung after moves you make or moves read from a saved
             game file.  Default: False.

             If you turn on this option when  using  _x_b_o_a_r_d  with
             the Internet Chess Server, you will probably want to
             give the "bell" command to the ICS, since  otherwise

             the  ICS  will ring the bell itself after every move
             (not just yours).

             adds  the  specified  amount  of  time to his clock.

             server.   Useful ICS commands include _w_h_o to see who
             is logged on, _g_a_m_e_s to  see  what  games  are  being
             played, _m_a_t_c_h to challenge another player to a game,

             review  a  completed  game,  or  resume an adjourned
             game, _x_b_o_a_r_d retrieves and parses the list  of  past

             The string that is sent to initialize the chess pro-
             gram.  Default: "new\nbeep\nrandom\neasy\n".

             If you change this resource, don't remove the  "new"
             and  "beep"  commands.   You can remove the "random"
             command if you like; including it causes  GNU  Chess
             to  randomize its move selection slightly so that it
             doesn't play the same moves  in  every  game.  (Even
             without "random", GNU Chess randomizes its choice of
             moves from its opening book.)  You can  also  remove
             "easy"  if  you like; including it toggles easy mode
             off, causing GNU Chess to think on your time.   That
             is,  if  "easy"  is  _i_n_c_l_u_d_e_d in the initString, GNU
             Chess thinks on your time;  if  not,  it  does  not.
             (Yes, this does seem backwards, doesn't it!)  To see
             what GNU Chess is thinking about, you  can  add  the
             "post" command and run _x_b_o_a_r_d with -_d_e_b_u_g_M_o_d_e set to
             True.  You can also try adding other commands to the
             initString;  see  the  GNU  Chess  documentation for
             details.

             connect  directly to the ICS but is able to rsh to a
             gateway host that can connect to  the  ICS.   As  an
             example,   suppose   the   gateway  host  is  called
             gate.wassamatta-u.edu, and you set resources as fol-
             lows:

             XBoard*icsPort:               5000 Then when you run
             _x_b_o_a_r_d  in  ICS  mode, it will connect to the ICS by
             using   rsh   to    run    the    command    "telnet
             valkyries.andrew.cmu.edu      5000"      on     host

             If this resource is set to  True,  _x_b_o_a_r_d  uses  the
             _t_e_l_n_e_t(1)  program  to communicate with the Internet
             Chess Server instead of opening a direct TCP connec-
             tion.  The default is False.

             This resource is useful if your machine is unable to
             connect directly to the ICS but is able to telnet to
             a gateway host that can connect to the ICS.   It  is
             more  general than the gateway resource, because you
             may be able to telnet to a host that you cannot  rsh
             to,  but it's not as convenient to use.  As an exam-
             ple,   suppose   the   gateway   host   is    called
             gate.wassamatta-u.edu, and you set resources as fol-
             lows:        XBoard*useTelnet:                  True
             XBoard*internetChessServer:    gate.wassamatta-u.edu
             XBoard*icsPort:              23 Then  when  you  run
             _x_b_o_a_r_d in ICS mode, you will get a login prompt from
             the gateway host.  Log in there and run  the  telnet
             program    (giving    a    command    like   "telnet
             valkyries.andrew.cmu.edu 5000") to  connect  to  the

             or  through a game file.  If you hold down the shift
             key while selecting Forward, _x_b_o_a_r_d jumps forward to
             the last remembered position in the game.  F or f is
             a keyboard equivalent.

             Steps backward through a series of remembered moves.
             If you hold down the shift key while selecting Back-
             ward, _x_b_o_a_r_d jumps backward to the first  remembered
             position  in  the  game.   B  or  b  is  a  keyboard
             equivalent.

             Backward normally only  reviews  old  positions;  it
             does  not retract moves.  If you are playing against
             GNU Chess and want to change  your  last  move,  you
             must  use  Force Moves mode to do so.  Wait until it
             is your turn,  press  Force  Moves,  press  Backward
             twice, make a different move, and then press Machine
             White or Machine Black to get GNU  Chess  back  into
             the game.

     PPPPaaaauuuusssseeee   Pauses updates to the board, and if you are  playing
             against  GNU Chess, also pauses your clock.  To con-
             tinue, press Pause again, then  press  Shift+Forward
             if you want to immediately update the display to the
             latest position.  P or p is a keyboard equivalent.

             If you press Pause when you are playing against  GNU
             Chess  and  it  is  not your move, GNU Chess's clock
             will continue to run and it will eventually  make  a
             move,  at  which point both clocks will stop.  Since
             board updates are paused, however, you will not  see
             the  move until you press Forward.  This behavior is
             meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

     set,  _x_b_o_a_r_d  actually  changes  its  working  directory  to

     as well.

     The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

     The internal move legality tester does not look at the  game
     history,  so  in some cases it misses illegal castling or en
     passant captures.  However, if you attempt such a move  when
     using  _g_n_u_c_h_e_s_s  (or  the ICS), it will reject the move, and
     _x_b_o_a_r_d will undo it and let you try another.

     In ICS mode, _x_b_o_a_r_d cannot handle observing (and/or playing)
     more  than  one  game at a time.  It may get confused if you
     try to do this, though it tries to recover gracefully.   Use
     the  Reset  button  and  the ICS refresh command if you have
     problems.

     Your password gets echoed when you log on to the ICS.   This
     happens  because _x_b_o_a_r_d does not implement the telnet proto-
     col.  Also, if useTelnet is set to True, every line you type
     to  the  ICS gets echoed an extra time. This happens because
     _x_b_o_a_r_d does not put the keyboard into raw mode and  let  the
     telnet  program  do all the echoing.  (The details of how to
     do so vary on different systems.)

     Some _x_b_o_a_r_d functions may not  work  with  versions  of  GNU
     Chess  earlier  than 4.0, patchlevel 52. In particular, with
     GNU Chess 3.1 the timeControl resource can be given only  to
     the nearest minute, restoring a saved position with black to
     play may not work, and if you use the Backward button  after
     a  mate or draw, the clocks are reset (because GNU Chess has
     exited and must be restarted).
