This directory contains diffs for errneous header files in the version
of UNIX V.4.2 which we at LEMIS used for the portation. You may need
to apply these to your system in order to recompile some of the
packages. If so, *please* first look at the header files: they may
differ more than you expect. If you run into any problems, or find
other corrections, please let us know - send email to lemis@lemis.de.
