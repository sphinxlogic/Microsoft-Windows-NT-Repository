This directory contains source and objects for X, a windowing system.

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated

		If you don't already have an Xconfig file, a sample
		can be found in /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/Xconfig.sample. We
		don't install this file automatically, because it
		needs a lot of manual modification. If you run into
		trouble with poor display geometry, look at the
		package vgaset, which might help you.
