.SH DESCRIPTION
The GNU 
.B objcopy
utility copies the contents of an object file to another.  
.B objcopy 
uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the object files.  It can
write the destination object file in a format different from that of
the source object file.  The exact behavior of 
.B objcopy
is controlled by command-line options.
.PP
.B objcopy
creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes them
afterward.
.B objcopy
uses BFD to do all its translation work; it knows about all the
formats BFD knows about, and thus is able to recognize most formats
without being told explicitly.
.PP
.I infile
and
.I outfile
are the source and output files respectively.  If you do not specify
.IR outfile ,
.B objcopy
creates a temporary file and destructively renames the result with the
name of the input file.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-I \fIformat
.TP
.B \-\-input\-format=\fIformat
Consider the source file's object format to be 
.IR format ,
rather than attempting to deduce it.
.TP
.B \-O \fIformat
.TP
.B \-\-output\-format=\fIformat
Write the output file using the object format 
.IR format .
.TP
.B \-F \fIformat\fB
.TP
.B \-\-format=\fIformat
Use 
.I format
as the object format for both the input and the output file; i.e.
simply transfer data from source to destination with no translation.
.TP
.B \-S
.TP
.B \-\-strip\-all
Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.
.TP
.B \-g
.TP
.B \-\-strip\-debug
Do not copy debugging symbols from the source file.
.TP
.B \-x
.TP
.B \-\-discard\-all
Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.
.TP
.B \-X
.TP
.B \-\-discard\-locals
Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols. (These usually start
with "L" or ".").
.TP
.B \-v
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of
archives, "\fBobjcopy \-V\fR" lists all members of the archive.
.TP
.B \-V
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show the version number of
.B objcopy
and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show a summary of the options to
.B objcopy
and exit.
