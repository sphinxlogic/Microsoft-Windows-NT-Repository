This is the file /opt/info/dir, which contains the topmost node of the
Info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke Info you start off
looking at that node, which is (dir)Top.

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree
  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics. 
  Typing "d" returns here, "q" exits, "?" lists all INFO commands, "h" 
  gives a primer for first-timers, "mTexinfo<Return>" visits Texinfo topic,
  etc.

  Note that the presence of a name in this list does not necessarily
  mean that the documentation is available. It is installed with the
  package in question. If you get error messages when trying to access
  documentation, make sure that the package has been installed.
