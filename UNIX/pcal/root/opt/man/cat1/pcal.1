     _P_c_a_l generates PostScript to produce landscape or portrait
     calendars for any month and year.  The arguments mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh,
     yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr, and nnnnmmmmoooonnnntttthhhhssss, if provided, should be numeric.  The
     mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh value should be in the range 1 - 12, and the yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr
     value should be specified as 1 or 2 digits or as the full 4
     digit year.  If no numeric arguments are provided, the
     calendar for the current month and year will be generated.

     If one numeric argument is provided, it is interpreted as
     the yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr value, and calendars for the entire year will be
     generated.  Otherwise, nnnnmmmmoooonnnntttthhhhssss months, starting with mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh
     and yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr, will be generated.

     For whole-year calendars (i.e. the ----wwww option is given), the
     command line arguments are interpreted somewhat differently.
     By default, all months in the current year are printed,
     starting with January.  If the mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh argument alone is
     given, it is expected to be the desired yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr to print, and
     prints all of the months in the given year.  If both mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh
     and yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr are given, then 12 consecutive months are printed
     starting at the given month and year.  If the mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh, yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr,
     and nnnnmmmmoooonnnntttthhhhssss arguments are all present, printing begins with
     the given month and year and nnnnmmmmoooonnnntttthhhhssss months are printed,
     rounded up to the nearest multiple of 12.

     By default, _p_c_a_l simply prints an empty calendar.  Its real
     power is in its ability to place ``events'' in appropriate
     days on the calendar, thus allowing the user to create per-
     sonalized calendars.  This is achieved through the use of
     the ``date file''.

     The date file is named ._c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r (_p_c_a_l._d_a_t under MS-DOS), or
     _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r for compatibility with older versions.  _P_c_a_l will
     look in several places for such a file.  First, if the
     environment variable PPPPCCCCAAAALLLL____DDDDIIIIRRRR is defined, _p_c_a_l searches the

     directory indicated by that variable.  Next, _p_c_a_l searches
     the user's home directory (as specified by the HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE environ-
     ment variable).  If neither PPPPCCCCAAAALLLL____DDDDIIIIRRRR nor HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE is defined,
     _p_c_a_l searches the current directory instead.  Finally, the
     directory where the _p_c_a_l executable resides will be checked.
     If no date file is found, an empty calendar is printed; no
     error is generated.

     If a date file is found, it will be searched for lines with
     leading dates matching the requested month and year.  Any
     text following the dates found will be printed on the calen-
     dar under the appropriate day of the month.  Dates in the
     ._c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r file may be expressed in any of several formats:

          <ordinal> <day_spec> in <month_spec>{*} {<text>}
          <day_spec> <prep> <date_spec>{*} {<text>}
          <date_spec>{*} {<text>}

     Where:

          <month_name>   := first 3+ characters of name of month, or ``all''
          <month_spec>   := <month_name>, or ``year''
          <day_spec>     := first 3+ characters of name of weekday, ``day'',
                         ``weekday'', ``workday'', ``holiday'', ``nonweekday'',
                         ``nonworkday'', ``nonholiday'', ``new_moon'',
                         ``first_quarter'', ``full_moon'', or ``last_quarter''
          <ordinal> := any ordinal number (``1st'', ``2nd'', etc.), ``first'' ... ``fifth'',
                         ``last'', ``odd'', ``even'', or ``all''
          <prep>         := ``before'', ``preceding'', ``after'', ``following'',
                         ``on_or_before'' (``oob''), or ``on_or_after'' (``ooa'')
          <sep>          := one or more non-numeric, non-space, non-`*' characters
          <month>   := a numeric month (1-12)
          <day>          := day of month (1-31)
          <year>         := a numeric year

     If the ----AAAA option (American date formats, the default) is
     given:

          <date_spec>    := <month_name> <day> | <month><sep><day>{<sep><year>}

     If the ----EEEE option (European date formats) is given:

          <date_spec>    := <month_name> <day> | <month><sep><day>{<sep><year>}

     _P_c_a_l also allows format specifiers in both the text and foot
     strings (see the ----LLLL, ----CCCC, ----RRRR, and ----NNNN options below); each
     will be replaced by a corresponding string as outlined in
     the table below.  Most of these are derived from the ANSI C
     strftime() ffffuuuunnnnccccttttiiiioooonnnn;;;; tttthhhheeee %%%%[[[[lllloooouuuuwwwwMMMMDDDD]]]] and %%%%[[[[oooo0000++++----]]]] format

          %{-N}[DWMY]    adjust date by -N days/weeks/months/years

     The %%%%uuuu specifier considers the week containing 1/1 as week 1
     and the following logical Sunday (the first day of the week
     as printed; cf. the ----FFFF option below) as the start of week 2;
     %%%%UUUU considers the first logical Sunday as the first day of
     week 1. %%%%wwww and %%%%WWWW behave like %%%%uuuu and %%%%UUUU respectively, but
     use the first logical Monday instead.  Note that %%%%wwww
     strftime().

     The %%%%oooo format specifier prints a number as an ordinal, with
     the appropriate suffix (``st'', ``nd'', ``rd'', or ``th'' in
     English) appended.  For example, %%%%oooodddd prints the day of the
     month as ``1st'', ``2nd'', ``3rd'', etc.

     Unlike strftime(), _p_c_a_l defaults to printing numbers (except
     %%%%yyyy) without leading zeroes.  If leading zeroes are desired,
     the `0' prefix may be used.  For example, %%%%0000jjjj prints the
     first day of year as ``001''.

     The %%%%++++ and %%%%---- format specifiers direct _p_c_a_l to substitute
     the following/previous month/year in the following [[[[bbbbBBBBmmmmyyyyYYYY]]]]
     specifier.  For example, %%%%++++BBBB prints the name of the next
     month.

     The %%%%{{{{[[[[++++----]]]]NNNN}}}}[[[[DDDDWWWWMMMMYYYY]]]] format specifiers do not print anything,
     but instead adjust the working date by +_ NNNNdays (DDDD), weeks
     (WWWW), months (MMMM), or years (YYYY).  Subsequent format specifiers
     use the adjusted date instead of the current date.  For
     example, %%%%++++1111MMMM %%%%BBBB %%%%YYYY adjusts the date forward by one month

     ward by two weeks and prints the resulting month and day
     (``Jul 26'' on August 9).

     Such date adjustments are normally cumulative; for example,
     %%%%++++1111YYYY%%%%----1111DDDD adjusts the date forward by one year and then back-
     ward by one day.  If %%%%DDDD or %%%%MMMM is specified alone (or if NNNN is
     zero), _p_c_a_l restores the original date.  Note that %%%%MMMM has a
     different meaning to the strftime() ffffuuuunnnnccccttttiiiioooonnnn....

     The ``Notes'' box (see below) uses the first of the current
     month as the default date.  All foot strings use the first
     of the current month in single-month mode and the first of
     the starting month in whole-year mode.

     Examples:

     Any non-numeric character may separate numeric dates.  Holi-
     days may be flagged by following the date immediately with
     `*' as in the examples above; this will cause the date to be
     printed in gray.  ``Each'' and ``every'' are accepted as
     synonyms for ``all'', and any word may be used in place of
     ``in''.  The abbreviations ``oob'' and ``ooa'' may be used
     in place of the keywords ``on_or_before'' and
     ``on_or_after'', respectively.  ``Nearest'' attempts to
     match the specified date; if that fails, it tries the day
     after, then the day before, then two days after, two days
     before, and so forth until a match occurs.

     Wildcard day names are also provided.  The keyword ``week-
     day'' applies to any days which are normally printed in
     black on the calendar.  The keyword ``workday'' is the same,
     but does not include any holidays.  The keyword ``holiday''
     includes only those days flagged as holidays.  The keywords
     ``nonweekday'', ``nonworkday'', and ``nonholiday'' are also
     recognized as negations of the above.  See the CCCCAAAAVVVVEEEEAAAATTTTSSSS below
     for important notes on using these keywords.  Moon phases
     may also appear as wildcards; ``nm'' is accepted as a
     synonym for ``new_moon'', ``1q'' and ``fq'' for
     ``first_quarter'', ``fm'' for ``full_moon'', ``3q'' for
     ``third_quarter'', and ``lq'' for ``last_quarter''.

     Ordinal day numbers may be used to specify dates, either
     relative to the month or to the year.  Either words or
     numeric abbreviations may be used for ``first'' through
     ``fifth''; higher numbers must be given using the numeric
     equivalent (e.g. 100th).  Negative ordinal numbers may even
     be used.  For example, ``-2nd'' means ``next to last''.

     ``Odd'' and ``even'' do not refer to the actual date;
     instead, ``odd'' means ``alternate, starting with the
     first'', and ``even'' means ``alternate, starting with the
     second''.  Thus, ``odd Fridays in March'' refers to the
     first, third, and (if present) fifth Fridays in March - not
     to those Fridays falling on odd dates.

     ``All'' refers to each individual month; ``year'' refers to
     the year as an entity.  Thus ``odd Fridays in all'' refers
     to the first, third, and fifth Friday of each month, while
     ``odd Fridays in year'' refers to the first Friday of Janu-
     ary and every other Friday thereafter.

     Text in the date file may use C-like escape sequences (i.e.
     a `\' followed by a character, 1 - 3 octal digits, or `x'
     followed by 1 - 2 hexadecimal digits).  Escaped whitespace
     (including nnnneeeewwwwlllliiiinnnneeee ) and the standard ANSI character escapes
     (`\a', `\b', `\f', `\n', `\r', `\t', `\v') are all replaced
     by a single blank.

     Lines in the ._c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r file consisting of yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr ################ (where
     ################ is a numeric year) can be used to set the year for fol-
     lowing entries.  This assumes that the following entries do

     Lines in the ._c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r file consisting of nnnnooootttteeee{{{{////<<<<nnnnuuuummmmbbbbeeeerrrr>>>>}}}}
     <<<<mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh>>>> can be used to place notes regarding the entire
     month in one of the unused blocks of the calendar.  The
     <<<<mmmmoooonnnntttthhhh>>>> indicator may be either a number 1 through 12 or an
     alphabetic month name as described above;  ``note all'' will
     place the associated text in the notes block for each month
     in the current year.  <<<<nnnnuuuummmmbbbbeeeerrrr>>>> is an optional positive or
     negative number specifying the empty box where the associ-
     ated text is to be placed.  If positive, _p_c_a_l counts forward
     from the first empty box; if negative, _p_c_a_l counts backward
     from the last empty box.  Thus, ````````nnnnooootttteeee////1111'''''''' places the asso-

     empty box, immediately preceding the small calendars on the
     bottom row; cf.  ----SSSS, ----kkkk, and ----KKKK, below).

     Comments are supported in the ._c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r file.  Any charac-
     ters following a `#' character through the end of the line
     are ignored.

     _P_c_a_l supports rudimentary _c_p_p-like functionality in the date
     file, allowing the following constructs:  ddddeeeeffffiiiinnnneeee |||| uuuunnnnddddeeeeffff,

     that these are not preceded by `#' as they are in C.  Symbol
     names defined using these keywords (or via the ----DDDD option)
     are case-insensitive.  It is not an error to uuuunnnnddddeeeeffff an unde-
     fined symbol, nor to ddddeeeeffffiiiinnnneeee a previously-defined one.  An
     iiiiffffddddeeeeffff alone is always ffffaaaallllsssseeee; an iiiiffffnnnnddddeeeeffff alone is always ttttrrrruuuueeee.
     iiiiffff is accepted as a synonym for iiiiffffddddeeeeffff.

     The name of the file in the iiiinnnncccclllluuuuddddeeee directive may optionally
     be surrounded by either "" or <>, both of which are ignored.
     If the name is not an absolute path, it is taken to be rela-
     tive to the directory where the file containing the direc-
     tive is located.  _P_c_a_l is smart enough to translate ~~~~//// to
     the user's home directory.

     In addition to pre-processing keywords, _p_c_a_l also accepts
     boolean expressions in iiiiffff{{{{{{{{nnnn}}}}ddddeeeeffff}}}} and eeeelllliiiiffff directives.
     These expressions consist of symbol names joined by the
     boolean operators !!!!, &&&&, ^^^^, and ||||, in order of precedence,
     high to low.  Parentheses may be used to alter the pre-
     cedence.  The synonyms &&&&&&&& and |||||||| are accepted for &&&& and ||||.
     A symbol name evaluates to ttttrrrruuuueeee if currently defined, ffffaaaallllsssseeee
     if not; thus:

     If a file of the name ._m_o_o_n## (_m_o_o_n##._d_a_t under MS-DOS),
     where ######## is the last two digits of the calendar year, exists
     in the same directory as the date file (or in the directory
     where _p_c_a_l resides), _p_c_a_l uses the information contained
     within to calculate the phase of the moon.  If no such file
     exists, _p_c_a_l uses an approximate algorithm.

     Entries in the moon file must conform to the following syn-
     tax:

     If the ----AAAA option (American date formats, the default) is
     given:

          <quarter> <month><sep><day> {<hour><sep><min>}

     If the ----EEEE option (European date formats) is given:

          <quarter> <day><sep><month> {<hour><sep><min>}

     Where:

          <quarter> := ``nm'', ``fq'' or ``1q'', ``fm'', ``3q'' or ``lq'' (new moon,
                         first quarter, full moon, last quarter)
          <hour>         := number 0-23 (24-hour clock)
          <min>          := number 0-59

     This file must contain entries for all quarter moons in the
     year, in chronological order; if any errors are encountered,
     _p_c_a_l will revert to using its default algorithm.

     As in the date file, comments start with `#' and run through
     the end of the given line.

                 when ----ffff is used.  If _c_a_l is an absolute file

     ----llll          Causes the output to be in landscape mode
                 (default).  This also resets the x- and y-axis

                 for landscape mode.

     ----pppp          Causes the output to be in portrait mode.  This

     Any option which normally takes an argument may be specified
     without the argument in order to reset the value to the pro-
     gram default.  Note that while the ----DDDD option alone clears
     all the defined symbols, the ----UUUU option alone has no effect.
     The ---- (or -------- as per System V) argument may be used to disam-
     biguate command lines such as:

     The ``workday'' and ``holiday'' keywords are aware of only
     those holidays which have already been flagged at the point
     where they appear.  For example, consider January 1990:

                        January 1990
                     S  M Tu  W Th  F  S
                        1  2  3  4  5  6

                    14 15 16 17 18 19 20

                    28 29 30 31

     If the ._c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r file looked like this:

          workday on_or_before all 15   payday
          3rd Mon in Jan*               MLK day

     ... then _p_c_a_l would mark the 15th as ``payday'' since at
     that point in the ._c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r file it has no way of knowing
     that January 15th will later be flagged as a holiday.  If

     the two lines were reversed, such that the holiday preceded
     the ``workday'' wildcard, then _p_c_a_l would work as intended,
     marking instead the 12th as ``payday''.  Also, beware of
     year boundaries which affect the handling of all of the day
     wildcard keywords.  In general, it is best to place monthly
     wildcards such as the example above at the end of each year
     to achieve the desired effect.

     When the ----wwww and ----pppp options are used together, _p_c_a_l revises
     the y-scale factor in order to use the entire portrait page;
     therefore, the user should avoid using use the ----yyyy option
     when using both the ----wwww and ----pppp options.  Use of the ----wwww option
     in any case effectively disables the ----mmmm, ----MMMM, ----jjjj, and ----JJJJ
     options.

     The output of the ----cccc option may be used as input to subse-
     quent runs of _p_c_a_l.  Note, however, that oooopppptttt lines (except
     for an automatic oooopppptttt ----[[[[AAAA||||EEEE]]]]), comments, ``note'' text, and
     iiiiffffddddeeeeffff'd-out source will be lost.

     The ----SSSS option interacts with nnnnooootttteeee{{{{////<<<<nnnnuuuummmmbbbbeeeerrrr>>>>}}}}; if used, it
     should be specified either on the command line or prior to
     the first nnnnooootttteeee line in the date file.

     The original PostScript code to generate the calendars was
     written by Patrick Wood (Copyright (c) 1987 by Patrick Wood
     of Pipeline Associates, Inc.), and authorized for modifica-
     tion and redistribution.  The calendar file inclusion code
     was originally written in _b_s(1) by Bill Vogel of AT&T.
     Patrick's original PostScript was modified and enhanced
     several times by others whose names have regrettably been
     lost.  Ken Keirnan of Pacific Bell assembled the original
     ``C'' version upon which this is based; additional modifica-
     tions and enhancements are the work of Joseph P. Larson, Ed
     Hand, Andrew W. Rogers, Mark Kantrowitz, Joe Brownlee, Jamie
     Zawinski, Richard L. Dyson, Bill Hogsett, Floyd Miller, Andy
     Fyfe, and Geoff Kuenning.
