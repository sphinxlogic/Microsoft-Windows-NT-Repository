     _X_f_i_g is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw  and

     or  three-button mouse. _f_i_l_e specifies the name of a file to
     be edited. The description of objects in the  file  will  be
     read at the start of _x_f_i_g.

     When using a two-button mouse use the  <Meta>  key  and  the
     right  button  at  the same time to effect the action of the
     middle button.

     The _T_r_a_n_s_F_i_g package is used to print the output from _x_f_i_g.

     Note for previous _x_f_i_g users:

     The _f_2_p and _f_2_p_s translators have been  phased  out  because
     the  _T_r_a_n_s_F_i_g package from Micah Beck is a more general pur-
     pose translator for more graphics languages.   The  _T_r_a_n_s_F_i_g
     package  can be used as a back-end processor to _x_f_i_g to pro-
     duce various types of output:

     LaTeX -     _f_i_g_2_d_e_v -_L _l_a_t_e_x translates _x_f_i_g to  _L_a_T_e_X  pic-
                 ture environment commands which can be processed
                 along with other _L_a_T_e_X commands.

     Postscript -
                 _f_i_g_2_d_e_v -_L _p_s produces a _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t output.

     Pic -       _f_i_g_2_d_e_v -_L _p_i_c produces a pic output.

     PiCTeX -    _f_i_g_2_d_e_v -_L _p_i_c_t_e_x produces _P_i_C_T_e_X output.   This
                 contains macros that can be used with the _P_i_C_T_e_X
                 environment under _T_e_X or _L_a_T_e_X.

     Others -    _f_i_g_2_d_e_v has options for these  other  languages:
                 _b_o_x, _e_p_i_c, _e_e_p_i_c, and _e_e_p_i_c_e_m_u.

     The _T_r_a_n_s_F_i_g package is available  via  anonymous  ftp  from
     export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/transfig.tar.Z.

     Note: _T_r_a_n_s_F_i_g versions 2.1.4 and later support color output
     for _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t.

     A compound object is  composed  of  primitive  objects.  The
     primitive  objects  that  constitute  a  compound can not be
     individually modified, but they can  be  manipulated  as  an
     entity; a compound can be moved, rotated, flipped vertically
     or horizontally, scaled, copied or erased.  A compound  that

     moved if desired.

               A popup message window will appear and  diagnostic
               messages  will  be  written  if  _x_f_i_g  changes any
               "illegal" object  values  to  legal  values.   For
               example,  older  versions  of  _x_f_i_g were lax about
               initializing unused parts such as _d_e_p_t_h, and would
               produce  very large, random values.  _X_f_i_g now will
               "clean up" bad values and inform you when it  does
               so.   Also,  if  you read in an older file format,
               _x_f_i_g will inform you that it is converting  it  to

               _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t.  The figure may be  saved  as  an  X11
               bitmap by choosing _X_b_i_t_m_a_p as the output language.
               The bitmap is created from the figure, the size of
               which  is determined by the enclosing rectangle of
               all the figure plus a small border.

          _P_r_i_n_t _t_o _P_r_i_n_t_e_r
               Pressing this button  or  <_M_e_t_a>_p  will  send  the
               current figure (or the batch file if it is has any
               figures in it)  to  the  printer,  by  passing  it
               through  _f_i_g_2_d_e_v  to convert it to PostScript then
               to the unix _l_p_r (on BSD equivalent Unixes)  or  _l_p
               (on  SYSV  systems) program.  If the batch file is
               printed by this button then it  is  removed  after
               printing.

               Note that the figure that is printed is  what  you
               see  on  the  canvas,  not  necessarily the figure
               file.  I.e., if you haven't saved the figure since
               the  last  changes,  the figure from the canvas is
               printed. _X_f_i_g writes the  figure  to  a  temporary
               file   to  do  this.  The  name  of  the  file  is

     The indicator panel contains buttons to set certain  drawing
     parameters,  such  as  line thickness, canvas grid, rotation
     angle etc.  All of the buttons use the  same  mouse  buttons
     for setting values. Pressing mouse button 1 on the indicator
     will pop up a panel in which either a  value  may  be  typed
     (e.g.  for  a line thickness) or the mouse may be clicked on
     one of several buttons (e.g. for grid style or  font  name).
     For  those that expect a value, pressing return in the value
     part of the window will set the new value and pop  down  the
     menu.

     Pressing mouse button 2 on an indicator will  decrement  the
     value (e.g. for line thickness) or cycle through the options
     in one direction (e.g. font  names),  while  pressing  mouse
     button  3  will  increment  the  value  or cycle through the
     options in the other direction.

          the zoom button. Ruler, grid and linewidth are  scaled,
          too.  Pressing  mouse  button  2 will decrease the zoom
          factor by 1.0 unless it is less  than  1.0  already  in

          which  case it will reduce to the nearest 0.25.  Press-
          ing mouse button 3 will increase the zoom factor by 1.0
          unless  it  is  less  than  1.0  in  which case it will
          increase it to the nearest 0.25.  Pressing the  control
          key and mouse button 3 together will set the zoom scale
          to 1.

          The figure may also be zoomed by defining a  zoom  rec-
          tangle  by  pressing the control key and mouse button 1
          together.  This will define one corner of the zoom rec-
          tangle.   Move the mouse and click mouse button 1 again
          to define the opposite corner of the zoom rectangle.

     _G_R_I_D _M_O_D_E
          With this button the user may select no grid, 1/4  inch
          (5mm in metric mode) grid or 1/2 inch (10mm) grid.

          This button controls the coarseness of object placement
          on  the canvas. The options are exact (on pixel) place-
          ment, 1/16 inch (2mm in metric mode), 1/4 inch (5mm) or
          1/2  inch (10mm).  This allows the user to easily place
          objects in horizontal or vertical alignment.

          This also restricts which objects may be "picked up" by
          the  mouse  when  editing.  If a corner of an object is
          not positioned on the canvas on a multiple of the point
          positioning  resolution you may not be able to pick it.
          If this happens, a black square will temporarily appear
          above  the  mouse  cursor. This square will also appear
          anytime the user tries to pick a nonexistent object.

          The  rotation  angle  for  rotating  objects   may   be
          set/increased/decreased  with  this  button.  Note that
          not all objects may be rotated, and certain objects may
          only be rotated by certain angles.  Pressing mouse but-
          ton 2 will decrease the angle in steps of  15  degrees,
          while  mouse  button 3 will increase the angle the same
          amount.  To select other angles, press mouse  button  1
          and enter the angle in the popup menu.

          on,  lines  which  link box-like objects together (hen-
          ceforth called _l_i_n_k_s) are treated specially when one of
          the  box-like objects is moved.  When set to _M_O_V_E mode,
          the end point of the link which  touches  (or  is  very
          near) the perimeter of the box is moved with the box so
          that the box and the end point remain linked.  When set
          to  _S_L_I_D_E  mode,  the end segment of the link slides so
          that the box remains linked and the angle  of  the  end
          segment  is maintained.  This is useful for keeping the
          last segment of a link horizontal or vertical.

          (At the moment, this mode only works for the  _M_O_V_E  and
          _C_O_P_Y  functions  and  only works for _P_O_L_Y_L_I_N_E links and
          box-like objects.  Another limitation at the moment  is
          that  if  both  ends  of  a  link  touch  the box being
          operated  on,  only  one  end  of  the  link  will   be
          adjusted.)

          both.   If  one or both arrow head modes are turned on,
          then arrow heads are automatically drawn  when  drawing
          _P_O_L_Y_L_I_N_E, _S_P_L_I_N_E or _A_R_C objects.

     _T_E_X_T _J_U_S_T_I_F_I_C_A_T_I_O_N
          The adjustment of text may be set to  _l_e_f_t,  _c_e_n_t_e_r  or

     _T_E_X_T _S_I_Z_E
          The text size may be set/increased/decreased with  this
          button.  The default is 12 points.

     _T_E_X_T _S_T_E_P
          The    interline    spacing    of    text    may     be
          set/increased/decreased  with  this button.  The number
          displayed gives the multiple of the  font  height  that
          will  be placed between lines on hitting <_r_e_t_u_r_n>.  The
          default is a factor of 1.2 times the current font size.

     _T_E_X_T _F_O_N_T
          This button allows a selection of  35  fonts  available
          for most Apple _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t printers.  There are two but-
          tons at the top of the menu.  The  _c_a_n_c_e_l  button  pops
          down  the  menu without changing the current font.  The
          _u_s_e _l_a_t_e_x _f_o_n_t_s will switch the menu to the _L_a_T_e_X  font
          choices. When the _L_a_T_e_X font menu is up, besides a _c_a_n_-
          _c_e_l button there is a button  to  switch  back  to  the
          _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t fonts.

          The name of the font is printed in the font  itself  so
          that  one  may  see  what  that  font looks like.  If a
          corresponding X11 font exists, new text is  created  on
          the  canvas using that font.  _x_f_i_g uses the size of X11
          font closest to that selected by the font size  button.
          If  the  X11  font  doesn't  exist,  _x_f_i_g uses the font
          selected by the "-normal" option.  To  abort  selection
          of a font, click mouse button 1 on _c_a_n_c_e_l.

     The drawing mode panel contains buttons used to  create  the
     various  _x_f_i_g  objects.   Once the drawing mode is selected,
     the object is created by moving the mouse to  the  point  on
     the canvas where the object is to be placed and pressing and
     releasing mouse button 1. After that the mouse is  moved  to
     the second point and mouse button 1 is again pressed for the
     next point. For those objects which may have more  than  two
     points (e.g. a line), mouse button 1 may be pressed for each
     successive point, and mouse button 2 must be pressed to fin-
     ish  the object. To create a single point using the _P_O_L_Y_L_I_N_E
     button, press and release  mouse  button  2.   For  the  _A_R_C
     object,  which  requires exactly three points mouse button 1
     is used for all three points.

     At any time mouse button 3 may  be  pressed  to  cancel  the
     creation of the object.

     _A_R_C  Create an arc.  Specify three points using mouse button
          1.   The  first and last points will form the endpoints
          of the arc and the second specifies any  point  on  the
          arc.

     _B_O_X  Create rectangular boxes. Start by clicking mouse  but-
          ton  1 on any corner of the desired box and finish with
          the same mouse button on the diagonally opposite corner
          of the box.

     _A_R_C-_B_O_X
          Create rectangular boxes with  rounded  corners.  Start
          and  finish with mouse button 1 in the same way as _B_O_X.
          The radius of the corners is selected by the _B_O_X  _C_U_R_V_E
          button.

     _C_I_R_C_L_E
          Create circles by specifying their radii or  diameters.
          Click  mouse  button  1 on the center of the circle and
          drag the mouse until the desired radius or diameter  is
          attained.   Click  mouse  button  1 again to finish the
          circle.

     _E_L_L_I_P_S_E
          Create ellipses using the same  procedure  as  for  the
          drawing of circles.

     _E_N_C_A_P_S_U_L_A_T_E_D _P_O_S_T_S_C_R_I_P_T _O_B_J_E_C_T (_E_P_S)
          Click mouse button 1 on any corner for the  _E_P_S  object
          and  finish  by  clicking  mouse  button 1 again on the
          diagonally opposite corner.  The _E_D_I_T popup panel  will
          appear  and  the  file  name  of  the _E_P_S object may be
          entered.   After  pressing  _D_O_N_E  or  _A_P_P_L_Y  (see   the
          description  of  the  EDIT  panel  for  the  difference

          the _E_P_S object will appear in the box just created.  If
          no _E_P_S file is available yet or no name is  entered  or
          there  is  no  _p_r_e_v_i_e_w _b_i_t_m_a_p in the _E_P_S file, pressing
          _D_O_N_E will pop down the edit panel and the word  <_e_m_p_t_y>
          or  the  _E_P_S  file  name  will  remain  in the _E_P_S box.
          Later, when the name of the _E_P_S file is  known  or  the
          file  is  available, you may re-read the _E_P_S file using
          the popup edit panel and the bitmap  part  of  the  _E_P_S
          file will replace the name in the box.
          If you want the original size of the _E_P_S object,  press
          the  "Use  orig  size"  button  and the eps bitmap will
          enlarge or shrink to the size specified in the  preview
          bitmap  of the _E_P_S file.  If you want the _E_P_S object to
          be approximately the size of  the  rectangle  specified
          with  the mouse but want the aspect ratio to be same as
          the original, press either "Shrink to orig" or "Enlarge
          to  orig"  buttons.  You must press the APPLY button to
          see these effects.

     _I_N_T_E_R_P_O_L_A_T_E_D _S_P_L_I_N_E
          Create (cubic spline) spline  objects.   Enter  control
          vectors  in  the same way as for creation of a _P_O_L_Y_L_I_N_E
          object.  At least three points  (two  control  vectors)
          must  be  entered.   The  spline  will pass through the
          entered points.

     _P_O_L_Y_L_I_N_E
          Create polylines (line segments connecting  a  sequence
          of points).  Enter points by clicking mouse button 1 at
          the desired positions  on  the  canvas  window.   Click
          mouse button 2 to finish.

     _P_O_L_Y_G_O_N
          Same as _P_O_L_Y_L_I_N_E except that a line  segment  is  drawn
          connecting the first and last points entered.

     _R_E_G_U_L_A_R _P_O_L_Y_G_O_N
          The number of sides is  first  selected  with  the  _N_U_M
          _S_I_D_E_S button in the indicator panel.  Then mouse button
          1 is clicked on the center and the mouse dragged to the
          desired size.  The object may be rotated as it is being
          created by moving the mouse up or down relative to  the
          starting point.  Click mouse button 1 to finish.

     _C_L_O_S_E_D _I_N_T_E_R_P_O_L_A_T_E_D _S_P_L_I_N_E
          Create closed or periodic  splines.   The  function  is
          similar  to  _P_O_L_Y_G_O_N  except that a closed interpolated
          spline is drawn.  The  spline  will  pass  through  the
          points (knots).

     _C_L_O_S_E_D _S_P_L_I_N_E
          Create closed or periodic spline objects.  The function

          is  similar to _P_O_L_Y_G_O_N except that a closed spline will
          be drawn instead of polygon.  The  entered  points  are
          just  control points; i.e. the spline will not pass any
          of these points.

     _S_P_L_I_N_E
          Create (quadratic spline) spline objects.   Enter  con-
          trol vectors in the same way as for creation of a _P_O_L_Y_-
          _L_I_N_E object.  At least three points (two  control  vec-
          tors)  must  be  entered.   The  spline  will only pass
          through the two end points.

     _T_E_X_T Create text  strings.  Click  mouse  button  1  at  the
          desired  position on the canvas window, then enter text
          from the keyboard.  Text may be pasted from the PRIMARY
          cut buffer (xterm cut/paste buffer) by pressing the _F_1_8
          function key (the _P_a_s_t_e key on Sun  keyboards)  or  any
          key/button  defined  in  the  translation table for the
          canvas.  See the default _F_i_g._a_d file for example.  Text
          is drawn using the current font, font size and justifi-
          cation settings.  A DEL or ^H (backspace) will delete a
          character, while a ^X will erase the entire line.  Fin-
          ish by clicking mouse button 2 or typing  the  <_r_e_t_u_r_n>
          key.  If  <_r_e_t_u_r_n>  is used, the text pointer automati-
          cally moves to the next "line", a distance of the  font
          height  times  the  value  in the TEXT STEP button, and
          text input mode is re-entered.  To finish  text  fully,
          click  mouse  button  2 or choose any panel button that
          changes modes (e.g. box, save,  etc).   To  edit  text,
          click  on  an existing text string with mouse button 1.
          Insertion of characters will take place at that  point.
          Or, use the popup _E_D_I_T mode to modify the text.

          Eight-bit characters may  be  entered  using  the  meta
          (compose)  key.   For example, to create an "a umlaut",
          hold down the meta key while pressing the  letter  "a",
          then  press  "  (quote).   To create a "c cedilla", use

          Compound objects  are  created  by  first  tagging  the
          objects to be compounded and then pressing mouse button
          3 to group the tagged objects into a  compound  object.
          Single  objects  are  tagged  by  clicking on them with
          mouse button 1.  A number of objects can be  tagged  at
          once  by  using mouse button 2 to define the upper-left
          and lower-right  corners  of  a  region  enclosing  the
          objects.   Tagged  objects  are  shown with highlighted
          markers.  Tagged objects which are  selected  (see  the
          SELECTING  OBJECTS  section  above) will be temporarily
          unhighlighted.  There is currently no  special  command
          to  tag  or  untag  all of the objects within a figure.
          You can untag all of the objects by changing from  GLUE
          mode  to  some  other  mode (apart from BREAK) and back
          again.

          Break a compound object to allow  manipulation  of  its
          component  parts.   Click  mouse button 1 on one of the
          corner markers of the compound object or along  one  of
          the  imaginary lines defining the compound box.  Click-
          ing with mouse button 2 will achieve  the  same  effect
          but  will  also  tag  the component parts (although you
          will not see the tags until  you  change  to  the  GLUE
          mode).   You  can  use this feature to easily alter the
          objects within a compound.

          on  a  _B_O_X  or _A_R_C-_B_O_X object, then that object will be
          scaled proportionally to its aspect  ratio.   If  mouse
          button  2 is pressed on any object, that object will be
          scaled up or down about its center.  Text may  only  be
          scaled if inside a compound object and then only if its

          are the cumulative effect of  vertically  aligning  the
          objects  to the _T_O_P, _M_I_D_D_LE or _B_O_T_T_OM edge and horizon-

          _T_E_X_T  and _C_O_M_P_O_U_N_D objects.  For unrestrained movement,
          click mouse button 1 over the desired point, reposition
          the  point,  and click the _l_e_f_t button again.  For hor-
          izontally or vertically constrained move,  click  mouse
          button  2 on the desired point and move either horizon-
          tally or vertically.  Notice that once you  choose  the
          direction  (horizontal  or  vertical), movement is con-
          strained in that direction.  If, after moving the mouse
          initially, it is moved in the other direction a greater
          distance than the current position of the  mouse  rela-
          tive  to  the starting point, then that will be the new
          constraint direction.  In otherwords if you first  move

          _v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l_l_y 1.3 inches, the  direction  will  switch  to
          _v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l   until  any  _h_o_r_i_z_o_n_t_a_l  motion  exceeds  1.3
          inches.  When the object is positioned  where  desired,
          click  mouse  button  1  to place it if that button was
          used to start the move (unconstrained), or mouse button
          2 (constrained) if that button was used.

          or  mouse  button  2  (constrained  move) on any corner

          horizontal/vertical  constrained movement (mouse button

          By pressing mouse button 1 on an  object,  the  current

          style, area fill etc.) which  have  been  selected  for
          update  are  copied  into  that  object.  When  _x_f_i_g is
          started, all indicator buttons which are components  of
          objects  are selected for update.  To unselect an indi-
          cator, click on the update button and click mouse  but-
          ton  1 on the small button in the upper-right corner of
          the indicator.  When that  indicator  is  selected  the
          foreground  color  (default  black)  shows.  When it is
          unselected the background color (default white) shows.

          If mouse button 2 is clicked on an object, the settings
          in  the  object that are selected by the indicator but-
          tons are copied into those indicator  button  settings.

     Not all operations employ smart redrawing of  objects  which
     are  altered as a by product of the operation.  You may need
     to use _R_e_d_r_a_w in these cases.

     Must compile _x_f_i_g with ----DDDDOOOOPPPPEEEENNNNWWWWIIIINNNN in order to make _x_f_i_g  han-
     dle OpenWindows scalable fonts correctly.

     Some servers do not allow bitmaps/pixmaps  taller  than  the
     screen  height  or wider than the screen width.  That is why
     there is a limit on the width of the top ruler and height of
     the  side  ruler.   If you need wider/taller rulers AND your
     server allows bigger pixmaps, you may define MAX_TOPRULER_WD
     and/or  MAX_SIDERULER_HT  in  your  Imakefile in the DEFINES
     line.  For example, to have a maximum  top  ruler  width  of
     1160 pixels, add -DMAX_TOPRULER_WD=1160 to your DEFINES line
     in the Imakefile.

     There is a bug in OpenWindows 2.0 which relates  to  pixmaps
     in  widgets.   You  must compile _x_f_i_g with the ----DDDDOOOOPPPPEEEENNNNWWWWIIIINNNN____BBBBUUUUGGGG
     option for this problem.

     If the image is panned or the _x_f_i_g window iconified and  de-
     iconified  during  the  middle  of  an operation (e.g. while
     drawing a line), the picture will be distorted.  This can be
     corrected using _R_e_d_r_a_w after the operation is complete.

     Rotated text will be displayed horizontally on  the  screen.
     They will be rotated only when printed on _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t output.

     Corners of object scaled with point positioning  in  one  of
     the grid modes will not always fall on the grid line, but to
     the closest pixel.
