     _t_e_x_i_2_r_o_f_f converts documents which  use  the  Texinfo  macro
     language  for TeX so they can be formatted by nroff or troff
     instead.

     The named _f_i_l_es are read and processed in order. If no  _f_i_l_e
     is  given or if the _f_i_l_e is '-' _t_e_x_i_2_r_o_f_f reads the standard
     input.

     All Texinfo commands are supported to some extent,  even  if
     by  carefully  discarding them. Since Texinfo allows the use
     of arbitrary TeX commands provided the leading \ is replaced
     by @, some common TeX commands not explicitly in Texinfo are
     supported as well.  To see how various commands are  handled
     examine  the  translation tables.  Any command whose type is
     DISCARD will disappear with all contained text  (unless  the
     -t option is used).

     (typewriter-like) font.  If this is not the standard at your
     site, run your _t_e_x_i_2_r_o_f_f output  through  sed  or  edit  the
     translation tables.

     -m   indicates which macro package you intend  to  use  with
          nroff  or  troff.  Specify one of -me, -ms, or -mm.  If
          your site has both -ms and -msnew  macros,  use  -msnew
          with nroff/troff for better results.

     -I   causes Texinfo "Info file" menu and node  contents  and
          'ifinfo'  text to appear in the output.  Info files are
          a kind of hypertext feature of Texinfo.  This  material
          would  not  normally  appear in a printed Texinfo docu-
          ment, but may contain  interesting  information  or  be
          useful when searching a document for a topic.

     -t   (transparent) prints contents  of  otherwise  discarded
          commands,  for  people  who are afraid of missing some-
          thing.  For best results with the -t option, use -It.

     Errors are reported giving file name and line number.

     Unrecognized Texinfo commands may corrupt the program's com-
     mand  stack  because  it is hard to tell how to discard them

     when their closing tokens are unknown. The program may guess
     wrong  about  which command is at fault when giving an error
     message for the closing token, but  will  generally  recover
     and  translate  the  remainder  of  the  document after such
     errors.

     Written in February 1988 at the  University  of  Toronto  by

     Appendices will come out as unnumbered sections, instead  of
     being  "numbered"  with  consecutive capital letters.  Cross
     references are printed, but not with page numbers as Texinfo
     does. Indices and tables of contents are not generated.

     Since \fP is a toggle, not a stack, nested Texinfo  commands
     that  generate  nested  font  changes  would  not  'un-nest'
     correctly if it were used as a close to a font change.   The
     program  needs  a  font  stack. In the interim, it uses \fR,
     which causes less trouble than \fP.

     There are a number of differences in formatting details com-
     pared  to  Texinfo. The -ms macros probably give the closest
     emulation.  Indentation is occasionally imperfect.

     Since literal double quotes (")  cause  bizarre  effects  in
     macro arguments for -me macros, _t_e_x_i_2_r_o_f_f replaces them with
     \(fm\(fm (foot marks - '') when the -me option is used.

     _t_e_x_i_2_r_o_f_f may generate output which falls afoul of  bugs  or
     strange features in nroff/troff.  The program tries to avoid
     generating sequences that cause trouble.

     "A program  designed  for  inputs  from  people  is  usually
     stressed  beyond  the  breaking  point by computer-generated
     inputs."

     - Dennis Ritchie
