     _X_p_h_o_o_n sets the X root window to a picture of  the  moon  in
     its  current  phase,  including  the partial lighting of the
     dark side by reflected earthlight.

     ----bbbb   Defeats the earthlight feature, forcing the  dark  side
          to be black.

     ----tttt   Have _x_p_h_o_o_n keep running and update the  picture  every
          _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l minutes.  (Normally, _x_p_h_o_o_n just sets the root
          picture and exits.)

     ----iiii   Forks a background process and prints the process-id to
          stdout.   Useful  if  you want to make menu commands to
          refresh or kill _x_p_h_o_o_n.

     The original motivation for this program was  that  xsetroot
     was  ttttoooooooo  sssslllloooowwww....  Loading  a full-screen bitmap took about 15
     seconds.  We made a trivial program that had fullmoon.bitmap
     compiled  in,  and  it  ran  in  less  than  a second.  (And
     incidentally, the executable was smaller than fullmoon.xbm.)
     Then  later  we  came  up with the phase hacking, the earth-
     light, and the auto-scaling.
