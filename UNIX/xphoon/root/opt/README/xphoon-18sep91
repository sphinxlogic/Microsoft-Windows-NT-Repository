This directory contains source and objects for xphoon, a program for
displaying the current phase of the moon on the root window.

Program:	xphoon
Revision:	19 September 1991
Author:		Jef Poskanzer, Craig Leres
Date ported:	20 May 1993
Ported by:	Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.3.3

Prerequisites:	

Documentation:	man page, installed with install-sysv

Installation:	xmkmf, make depend, *modify Makefile*, make, make
		install, install-sysv

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first.

		Like xfishtank, xphoon is a program which contains a
		large quantity of bitmap data. gcc cannot handle this
		well. As a result, the file moon.c, which includes
		this bitmap data, was compiled with the CCS compiler.
		To do this, manual modifications to the Makefile were
		necessary.

Modifications:

0. configure for svr4

1. Define macro SYS5, which this program uses instead of SYSV.
