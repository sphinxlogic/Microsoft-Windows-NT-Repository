# unlink-package: remove a package. This uses the information in
# <package>/root to remove the files relating to a package. It
# will work whether the package has been installed or just linked.
# If it has been installed, you should use pkgrm rather than
# this script, in order to keep the pkgadd housekeeping up to date.
