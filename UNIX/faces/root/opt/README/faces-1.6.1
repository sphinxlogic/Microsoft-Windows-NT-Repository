This directory contains source and objects for faces, a visual list
monitor.

Program:	faces
Revision:	1.0
Date ported:	2 May 1993
Ported by:	Andrew Josey, USL
		Greg Lehey, LEMIS
Compiler used:	gcc-2.3.3

Prerequisites:	none

Documentation:	man page

Installation:	make x11, make install-sysv (make install will install
		unformatted man pages). Note that some subordinate
		Makefiles contain incorrect install commands: they
		will attempt to strip non-binary files, which gives
		rise to harmless error messages.

Comments:	Comments in the file ../README.LEMIS are not repeated
		here. You should read ../README.LEMIS first
		

Modifications:

-1. Although this is an X11 application, Imakefile is missing. Proceed
    by hand.

0. Mod Makefiles as described above. The real work was done by Andrew
   Josey.

1. compface/compface.h includes strings.h instead of string.h. Modify
   tests.
