     _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e is a  function  for  generating  highly  compressed
     representations  of 48x48x1 face image files.  _u_n_c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e is
     an inverse function which performs an inverse transformation
     with  no  loss  of data.  The algorithm used is highly tuned
     for its purpose and achieves  better  than  a  five  to  one
     compression  ratio  on average.  In both functions, input is
     via a NULL terminated string and a  NULL  terminated  output
     string  is written over the input string.  _B_u_f should there-
     fore point to a block of 2K size or  more  to  avoid  buffer
     overruns during output generation.

     The input format for _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e (and  the  output  format  for
     _u_n_c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e)  is  48  lines each of 3 sixteen bit hexadecimal
     integers, comma terminated in C initialiser style.  The out-
     put format of _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e (and the input format for _u_n_c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e)
     is some number of lines made  up  of  a  space  followed  by
     printable   characters   (in   the   range  ``!''  to  ``~''
     inclusive).  The first line contains 72 characters and  fol-
     lowing lines contain 79 characters except that the last line
     may be short.

     The amount of compression obtained varies between face image
     files  but  the  output  of  _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e averages less than 200
     characters.  The average number of output lines is three.

     The return value is normally 0.  1 will be returned if extra
     input  has  been ignored during a compress operation.  -1 is
     returned in the case of an  invalid  input  format.   -2  is
     returned if an internal buffer overrun occurs.
