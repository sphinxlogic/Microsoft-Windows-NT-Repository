     _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e  is  a  filter  for  generating  highly  compressed
     representations  of 48x48x1 face image files.  _u_n_c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e is
     an inverse filter which performs an  inverse  transformation
     with  no  loss  of data.  The algorithm used is highly tuned
     for its purpose and achieves  better  than  a  five  to  one
     compression ratio on average.  Arguments operate identically
     for both programmes.  The first argument, if present, causes
     input  to be taken from the named file instead of from stan-
     dard input unless it is the string ``-''.   A  second  argu-
     ment,  if  present,  causes  output  to go to the named file
     instead of to standard output unless it is the string ``-''.
     Subsequent pairs of arguments may be used to specify further
     pairs of input and output files.

     The input format for _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e (and  the  output  format  for
     _u_n_c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e)  is  48  lines each of 3 sixteen bit hexadecimal
     integers, comma terminated in C initialiser style.  The out-
     put format of _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e (and the input format for _u_n_c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e)
     is some number of lines made  up  of  a  space  followed  by
     printable   characters   (in   the   range  ``!''  to  ``~''
     inclusive).  The first line contains 72 characters and  fol-
     lowing lines contain 79 characters except that the last line
     may be short.

     The amount of compression obtained varies between face image
     files  but  the  output  of  _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e averages less than 200
     characters.  The average number of output lines is three.

     Exit status is  normally  0.   Possible  errors  include  IO
     errors when opening, reading or writing files, format errors
     in _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e input files and invalid arguments.  Each results
     in  an  explanatory  message  on  standard error and an exit
     status of 1.  A warning will be produced if _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e detects
     extra input data.

     Nominating standard input as input more than once  does  not
     work.
