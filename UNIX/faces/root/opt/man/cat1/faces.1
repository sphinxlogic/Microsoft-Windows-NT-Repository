     _F_a_c_e_s is a window based tool for  visual  monitoring  lists.
     Typically  it is used to monitor mail, print queues or users
     on a system. It contains graphical interfaces for NeWS, Sun-
     View,  XView  and X11. It has five different modes of opera-
     tion:

     The default (no ----aaaa, ----HHHH, ----PPPP or ----eeee arguments) will monitor for
     new  mail.  By  default,  only  the  last  ten  messages are
     displayed. Using the left mouse button  it  is  possible  to
     toggle the text in the faces window. This will either be the
     username or the time the mail message arrived. You can clear
     this  area  to  the background pattern by hitting the Delete
     key (but see below, under sssseeeetttt bbbbuuuuttttttttoooonnnn1111cccclllleeeeaaaarrrr).  The icon shows
     the image of the last message to arrive.

     The second choice (----aaaa) is to monitor the  whole  of  a  mail
     file.  The open window will automatically adjust its size to
     correctly show the face icons. The open window  options  are
     the  username  or  the  timestamp and number of message from
     that user. The icon will display the image of the last  mes-
     sage,  and  a  count  of the total number of messages in the
     spool file or mail folder.

     The third option (----PPPP) allows this program to monitor a given
     print  queue.  This will generate a single face icon showing
     the job at the top of the print queue, and the text  message
     will  display the printer name plus the number of jobs to be
     printed. Opening the window will show images of all the jobs
     in the queue. The text on each image can be toggled, choices
     being the owner's name and the size of the job in bytes.

     With the fourth mode (----HHHH), you can monitor who is logged  in
     a  machine.   For each user, a face image is displayed. Text
     can be either the username or the time they logged  on.  The
     iconic form displays the total number of users.

     Finally you can specify a program or  shell  script  to  run
     (----eeee).  The standard output from this program will be read by
     the faces program, and the appropriate faces displayed using

     tion is given in the faces manual page.

     There are special displays for no mail, no faces  found,  no
     print  jobs,  no  paper  in the printer, and no users logged
     into a machine.

     ----AAAA          Enable audio support (where applicable).

     ----BBBB _s_o_u_n_d_f_i_l_e
                 The name of the sound file to  play  instead  of
                 making  the  bell sound. Audio support has to be
                 enabled.

     ----CCCC _a_u_d_i_o_c_m_d An alternative command to use to play the  audio
                 files. Audio support has be be enabled.

     ----HHHH _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e Name of the machine to monitor.  Faces  will  be
                 displayed  for each user logged in. Note that on
                 some systems, the -ut option should be used with
                 the  _x_t_e_r_m  program, if you wish to prevent each
                 _x_t_e_r_m showing as a separate user.

     ----MMMM          Used when the user is using a mail reader  which
                 is  capable of shrinking the mail spoolfile (Elm
                 and MH mail being two  such  examples)  and  the
                 default  mail  monitoring  facility within _f_a_c_e_s
                 adjusts accordingly.

     ----PPPP _p_r_i_n_t_e_r  Printer name to monitor.  If  this  and  a  mail
                 spool  file  are given with the ----ssss option, _f_a_c_e_s
                 will monitor the print queue.

     ----SSSS _s_p_o_o_l_d_i_r Specify an alternate mail spool  directory.  The
                 folder  that  will  be  monitored  will  then be

                 the user currently logged in.

     ----UUUU          Automatically send mail to a special mail alias,
                 to  update the _f_a_c_e_s database when a new X-Face:
                 record is read. By default this special alias is
                 _f_a_c_e_m_a_k_e_r.   This   should   be   aliased   (see
                 _a_l_i_a_s_e_s(_7)) to:
                 facemaker:     "|/usr/local/bin/face_update"
                 By default the _f_a_c_e__u_p_d_a_t_e shell script will not
                 overwriting  existing  ikons  in the faces data-
                 base.  Overwriting will take  place  if  the  ----wwww
                 option  is specified.  You should also note that
                 the installation of this mail alias is not  done
                 automatically,  as  this  might  be considered a
                 security risk on some systems.

                 program  will  read,  and   then   display   the
                 appropriate  face  images.  The  format of these

     ----ffff _f_a_c_e_p_a_t_h If specified, this is a colon-separated list  of
                 paths  to  be  searched for face images.  A null
                 entry in the path will be replaced by  the  com-
                 piled  in default face directory.  If not speci-
                 fied, the directories specified by the  FACEPATH
                 environment  variable will be used.  If there is
                 no FACEPATH environment  variable,  the  default
                 face  directory  will  be searched.  The default
                 face  directory  is  normally  ////uuuussssrrrr////llllooooccccaaaallll////ffffaaaacccceeeessss.
                 Note  that  in  previous versions of _f_a_c_e_s, a -f
                 option added the directory to the  search  path,
                 which  already  consisted  of the system default
                 faces. Using the -f option now,  supercedes  the
                 system  default  faces,  and  you must include a
                 trailing colon in the list of paths, in order to
                 have them included.

     _F_a_c_e_s is capable of playing sounds for each user when  moni-
     toring for new mail.  Audio support needs to be enabled, and
     there must be a face.au file present for that user (see FACE

     There is a special faces directory containing a  multi-level
     hierarchy,  which by default is /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_f_a_c_e_s.  The first
     few levels are the machine name,  where  each  part  of  the
     machine name is at a separate level. One level below this is
     the user name, and one level below that is the  actual  face
     image,  which can be stored in four formats.  If the file is
     named _4_8_x_4_8_x_1 then it is  a  Blit  ikon,  if  it  is  called
     _s_u_n._i_c_o_n then the image is stored in Sun icon format, if the
     file is named _f_a_c_e._x_b_m then  it  is  an  X11  xbm  formatted
     image,  and  if  the file is called _f_a_c_e._p_s then it contains
     executable NeWS code. Multiple formats can be stored in  the
     same  username  directory, and the one used will depend upon
     which graphics interface is currently being used.

     It is also possible to store audio files in the faces direc-
     tory.  These  files are called face.au, and should be stored
     under the appropriate user directory.

     To access the face for  the  mail  name  _m_a_c_h_i_n_e._d_o_m._a_i_n!_u_i_d

     consists of the following choices, in the given  order:   r1
     c1          l1          l1          l1          l1         .

     SunView   -    sun.icon, 48x48x1,  face.xbm
     X11  -    face.xbm, sun.icon, 48x48x1 Domain names  are  now
     fully supported. For example, if mail arrives from _f_o_o@_a._b._c
     then _f_a_c_e_s will use the directories _c/_b/_a, _c/_b and _c for the
     machine  name.   The  directory  _M_I_S_C hold faces for generic
     users such as _r_o_o_t and _u_u_c_p. If the faces directory  hierar-
     chy is not found, then a blank face image will be used.

     Faces information is administered by a pair of  ASCII  files
     in  the  faces directory that associate related machines and
     faces. The machine table _m_a_c_h_i_n_e._t_a_b  attaches  machines  to
     communities; the line
           stard=sunaus
     puts the machine _s_t_a_r_d  in  community  _s_u_n_a_u_s.  The  machine
     table may be used to alias entire communities; the line
           wseng.sun.com=eng.sun.com
     will cause the _w_s_e_n_g._s_u_n._c_o_m domain  to  be  mapped  to  the
     _e_n_g._s_u_n._c_o_m   community.   The  people  table  associates  a
     community/alias pair, with a real username.
           sunaus/rburridge=richb
     causes the alias _r_b_u_r_r_i_d_g_e to be translated  into  the  real
     username _r_i_c_h_b for the community _s_u_n_a_u_s

     Note that you still need to use _m_a_i_l_t_o_o_l or some other  mail
     reading  utility to actually read the mail that this program
     monitors; _f_a_c_e_s simply displays who the mail is from.

     When new mail arrives, _f_a_c_e_s will beep and  flash  appropri-
     ately, depending upon the set parameters in the user's faces
     startup file.  This is looked for in the user's home  direc-
     tory;  first the file ._f_a_c_e_s_r_c is tried, and if that file is
     not found, ._m_a_i_l_r_c is looked for.  The file, if found,  will
     be examined for lines in the following form:

     sssseeeetttt bbbbeeeellllllll ==== _n_u_m_b_e_r

          For those who liked the behaviour of previous  versions
          of  _f_a_c_e_s,  this  causes  button  1 to clear the window
          (like typing Delete).   The  ``toggling''  function  of
          button  1  is  moved to button 2 if this option is set.
          If you are using the X11 version, these parameters  may
          be  set  via  your  X  resources  rather than the faces
          startup file.  See the  XXXX  DDDDEEEEFFFFAAAAUUUULLLLTTTTSSSS  section  for  more
          details.

     If you are using the NeWS version and creating  face  images
     of  the  _f_a_c_e._p_s  form,  then the following points should be
     noted:  All graphics operations should be performed  on  the
     unit  square; and the final image will be translated to a 64
     x 64 square image at the appropriate position in  the  faces
     display.

     If you are using the ----eeee option, then  the  user  program  or
     shell  script  needs  to generate a set of records which are
     interpreted by the _f_a_c_e_s program. The first record should be
     in the following fixed format, beginning at column 1:
           Cols=mm Rows=nn
     where mm is the size in columns for  the  faces  window  and
     icon, and nn is the size in rows. A window will be generated
     with these dimensions.

     This record is followed by  the  face  information  records.
     These  records  can  have  upto  six  fields,  each  one TAB
     separated. As well as providing the username  and  hostname,
     there  are  four  other fields which can be filled in, which
     denote what is displayed on the left or the right  sides  of
     the bottom area of each face image in the normal display and
     the alternate display (normally selectable by  clicking  the
     left mouse button).

     The fields are:

           username
           hostname
           normal left
           normal right
           alternate left
           alternate right

     Any of these fields may be left blank. There are  also  four
     special  usernames, which will display the appropriate stan-
     dard icons. These are NNNNOOOOMMMMAAAAIIIILLLL,,,, NNNNOOOOPPPPAAAAPPPPEEEERRRR,,,, NNNNOOOOPPPPRRRRIIIINNNNTTTT and NNNNOOOOUUUUSSSSEEEERRRRSSSS....

     There can also be one optional information  record  for  the
     faces  icon  display.   This  uses  the  first four of these
     fields, and if this record is present, it should  be  before
     the  Cols record. If not present, then the icon will contain

     _F_a_c_e_s is capable of recognising a compressed face  image  in
     the  mail  message header.  It uses special X-Face: lines to
     do this. It is very simple to add your compressed face image
     to a mail header.

     The  following  method  works   for   Berkeley   Mail   (aka
     /usr/ucb/mail),  Open Windows mailtool and mush. It probably
     works for others too.

     It is suggested that each user store  the  compressed  image
     (generated  by  _c_o_m_p_f_a_c_e  )  in a file called ._f_a_c_e in their
     home directory. See the compface manual page for more infor-
     mation  on  how  to  generate the compressed face image. The
     first line should have the  X-Face:  prepended;  second  and
     subsequent  lines  should  have  a  preceding tab, and there
     should be a trailing blank line. Here  is  a  typical  ._f_a_c_e
     _f_i_l_e:

     X-Face: *7O.<19S{MCsaxxe=iCc*y5!i:>e,K40m^btp"<`~gNx5>o?eJMzUng=j]%KybY
          /VaZ/3a4pD%#rGu7D<M$.TDpaDN8#8eJC&^^&Mr]@~}Pa,*F-ePrMg5.}e,,bu
          qROdT{Vzn{!ouXy.&*#V#Q&Zf7a8lX2Kb}"$UT^VhnsJ?){wFU5r+,duO>4@L

9     Each user should add the line:

     set sendmail=/usr/local/bin/faces.sendmail

9     to their ~/._m_a_i_l_r_c file, where /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_b_i_n is the  direc-
     tory where your _f_a_c_e_s binaries were installed.

     A similar method exists with  the  Elm  mailer.  The  user's
     compressed face image should be setup in a ~/._f_a_c_e file, but
     without the initial "X-Face:", and  leading  spaces  removed
     from each line. There is also no trailing blank line. Here's
     an example:

     *7O.<19S{MCsaxxe=iCc*y5!i:>e,K40m^btp"<`~gNx5>o?eJMzUng=j]%KybY
     /VaZ/3a4pD%#rGu7D<M$.TDpaDN8#8eJC&^^&Mr]@~}Pa,*F-ePrMg5.}e,,bu
     qROdT{Vzn{!ouXy.&*#V#Q&Zf7a8lX2Kb}"$UT^VhnsJ?){wFU5r+,duO>4@L

9     To automatically include this into a header into an Elm mail
     message, just add the following line to your .elm/elmheaders
     file:

     X-Face: `cat $HOME/.face`
