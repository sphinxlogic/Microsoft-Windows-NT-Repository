     _g_p_e_r_f reads a set of ``keys'' from _k_e_y_f_i_l_e (or, by  default,
     from  the standard input) and attempts to find a non-minimal
     perfect hashing function that recognizes a member of the key
     set  in  constant,  i.e., O(1), time.  If such a function is
     found the program generates a pair of _C source code routines
     that  perform  the  hashing and table lookup.  All generated
     code is directed to the standard output.
