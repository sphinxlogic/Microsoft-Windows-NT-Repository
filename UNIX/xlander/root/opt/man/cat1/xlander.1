     XLander is a lunar landing simulation for X.  It features an
     "out-the-window" scrolling 3-d display.

     As you play the game, you will see the landing craft on  the
     screen.   The  3-d  view  follows  the craft around, lagging
     behind slightly, which gives a good illusion of motion.

     The lander is equipped with five thrusters; four directional
     thrusters  which control lateral motion, and one retroactive
     thruster which fires downwards to produce  upward  momentum.
     Each thruster is activated by pressing and holding a partic-
     ular key.  By default, the space bar fires  the  retroactive
     thruster,  and the 8, 2, 4 and 6 keypad keys fire the front,
     rear, left and right  directional  thrusters,  respectively.
     The  control keys can be re-mapped using the ----ccccoooonnnnttttrrrroooollll option
     described below.  You can also use the keyboard  arrow  keys
     to fire directional thrusters if you like.

     Each thruster uses up a  particular  amount  of  fuel.   The
     retro  thruster  consumes  more  fuel  than  the directional
     thrusters, since it produces more thrust to combat the force
     of  gravity.   Fuel is indicated on the control panel.  Once
     it's gone, you can no longer thrust.

     At the start of the game, your landing craft will  be  free-
     falling  toward  the surface.  The goal is to land the craft
     on the landing pad  with  as  little  vertical  and  lateral
     motion  as possible.  The landing pad is visible as a square
     on the ground with a flag planted at one corner.  The shadow
     of the craft is projected on the ground, allowing you to see
     how high it is and where it will land.

     In order to land, you must be going slowly  enough  in  both
     the  vertical and lateral directions.  Although you can land
     anywhere on the surface, you must land on the landing pad to
     get  points.   After  each  successful  landing, the program
     gives you a score based on your vertical and lateral speeds,
     refills  your  fuel  tank,  and restarts the simulation at a
     higher difficulty level (by increasing the  force  of  grav-
     ity).   After you crash, the game shows your final score and
     then allows you to either start over or quit.

     The lunar lander is equipped with a  number  of  gauges  and
     indicators  which  tell  you its status.  At the left of the
     gauge panel is a circular heading indicator which tells  you
     the lateral direction of the craft.  Next to this is a vert-
     ical velocity gauge, which tells you your rate of ascent  or
     descent;  after this comes a fuel gauge, followed by a radar
     screen which tells you your position relative to the landing
     pad.

          Configure the keyboard controls used by  xlander.   You
          should  pass a string of 5 characters.  The first char-
          acter is the key used to thrust  forward,  followed  in
          order  by  the  keys used to thrust backward, left, and
          right.  After this comes the  retro  thrust  key.   The
          default control string is "8246 ".

          If you are used to the vvvviiii editor, you might want to try
          using the control string "kjhl ".

          Simulate  gravity  of  a  particular  planet  or  other
          heavenly  body.   Valid  planets  are:  moon (default),
          earth, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter,  saturn,  uranus,
          neptune,  and  pluto.   This  option also automatically
          adjusts the amount of retro thrust to suit the  gravity
          of  the planet (unless you override it using the ----rrrreeeettttrrrroooo

          Do not turn off key repeat  for  the  duration  of  the
          game.

          Since thrust is activated by holding down keys, xlander
          turns  off  auto  key  repeat  during  the  game.  This
          prevents keypress events from getting backed up in  the
          queue.   When  the  game exits, the original key repeat
          mode is restored.  This option disables this behavior.

     Collision detection needs (a  lot  of)  work.   Suggestions,
     anyone?

     Since we're not physicists or mathematicians, we don't claim
     that this is a completely accurate simulation.  So, have fun
     with it but don't take it too seriously!
