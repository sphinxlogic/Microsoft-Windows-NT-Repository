     Reads a Photo-CD Image file or Overview  file,  and  outputs
     portable  pixmap.   Image files you can find on the Photo-CD
     in photo_cd/images, they are named as  "imgnnnn.pcd",  where
     nnnn   is   a   4-digit-number.  The  Overview  file  is  at
     photo_cd/overview.pcd . If there is no ppm-file-name  given,
     output  will  be  printed  to  stdout.  hpcdtoppm stands for
     "Hadmut's pcdtoppm" to make it distinguishable in case some-
     one else is building the same thing and calling it pcdtoppm.

     ----iiii   Give some information from the fileheader to stderr. It
          works   only  for  Image  files.  (It  is  not  working
          correctly, just printing some strings.)

     ----ssss   Apply simple sharpness-operator on the Luma-channel.

     ----dddd   Do  not  show  the  complete  image,   but   only   the
          decompressed  difference.   It  works only on the 4Base
          and the 16Base resolution. It does not have any  deeper
          sense, but it was simple to implement and it shows what
          causes different sizes of image files.

     ----rrrr   Rotate the picture clockwise for portraits.

     ----llll   Rotate the picture counter-clockwise for portraits.

     ----aaaa   Try to find out  the  image  orientation  byself.  This
          doesn't work for overview files yet. It is very experi-
          mental and depends on one byte. Please tell  me  if  it
          doesn't work.

     ----xxxx   Overskip Mode.  Works  on  Base/16,  Base/4,  Base  and
          4Base. In Photo-CD images the luma channel is stored in
          full resolution, the two chroma channels are stored  in
          half  resolution  only and have to be interpolated.  In
          the Overskip Mode  the  chroma  channels  of  the  next
          higher  resolution  are taken instead of interpolating.
          To see the difference, generate one ppm  with  and  one
          ppm  without  this  flag.  Use pnmarith to generate the
          difference image of these two images. Call ppmhist  for
          this  difference  or  show  it with xv (push the HistEq
          button in the color editor).

          Extract  all  pictures  from  an   Overview   file.   A
          ppmfilename  must be given. If the given name is "foo",
          the files are named "foonnnn", where nnnn is a  4-digit
          number.   Since they are stored in Base/16 format, they
          are extracted in this format.

     ----yyyycccccccc Suppress the ycc to rgb conversion. This is  experimen-
          tal  only.  You can use this and apply ppmtorgb3 on the
          file. Then you will get three pgm-files, one  Luma  and
          two Chroma files.

     I still don't have enough information about the Photo-CD  to
     take  care  of  all data structures. The informations i have
     are quite vague and this program was developed  by  starring
     at  the hex-dumps and the famous trial-and-error-method. :-)
     If anything doesn't  work,  please  send  me  a  report  and
     perhaps you could try to find out, why it doesn't work.
