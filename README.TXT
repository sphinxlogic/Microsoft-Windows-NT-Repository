This disc contains the Microsoft Windows Archive from CICA (The Center for
Innovative Computing Applications).
==========================================================================

To use this disc you need to copy the programs to your hard disk.
You can find which files you want to use with the VIEW program in the
root directory of the disc.  This program lets you page through the
index files and then copy the program you want to your hard disk.
You can run the VIEW program in a DOS window or with the File
Manager.  If you use File Manager, simply type e:VIEW at the run
option bar.  (Substitute your CDROM's drive letter for the example
drive letter e:.)  You can then either run the program using the File
Manager or Program Manager.  Just select the disk, directory and
program where you had VIEW copy the program and click on Run.

To install the program so it displays an icon in your applications
group you need to run the windows Setup program found in the Main
group.  
	First select Windows Setup in the Main Group. 
	Then select Options in the menu bar.  
	Select Set Up Applications.
	Select Ask You to Specify An Application.
	Type the path and name of the program you'd like to install.
Windows setup will copy the program's icon into the Application Group
and set up the program to run from the icon.

	For example, to make an permanent icon for boxworld after
copying it with VIEW you would type:
	c:\cica\win3\games\boxworld\boxworld.exe
into the "Specify An Application" box.

Although you may own this disk, you do not own the programs recorded on
it.  Many of the programs on this disc are shareware, and they may require
separate payment to the author of the program for continued use.  You are
free to try shareware programs for a limited amount of time.  If you are
satisfied, and want to continue to use the program, you are expected to
register the program by sending a specified amount of money directly to
the author of the program.  In many cases the author will send you the
most up to date version of the program and a printed manual.  Please check
individual files for conditions.
