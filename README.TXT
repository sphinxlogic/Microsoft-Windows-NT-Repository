Welcome to the Walnut Creek Source Code CDROM, March 1994 edition!

This CDROM contains several source code archives, including the
Simtel20 Unix-C archive, the latest Usenet source archives, the most
up-to-date GNU source code, and a large collection of MS-DOS and
Windows source code.

Please check individual files for copyrights and distribution restrictions.

===========================================================================

This disk conforms to the level 1, ISO-9660 format.  All the filenames
are limited to eight single-case characters, with an extension of up
to three characters.  We have included two files (gnu/00_files.txt,
unix_c/00_files.txt) to help you to restore the original filenames
from the filenames on this disc.  Most directories have an index file
named 00_index.txt that contains a description of each file in the
directory.

===========================================================================
			USING THE VIEW PROGRAM

To use this disc, merely change drives to your CD-ROM drive, then
type "VIEW" in the root directory of the CD-ROM drive, then press
enter.  The VIEW program will then display a listing of the
subdirectories and their description on the disc.  Use the cursor
keys to move the highlight bar up and down the screen, then press
ENTER to change into any of the subdirectories.  The VIEW program
will then display a list of files within that particular
subdirectory.  (To return back to the subdirectory listing, press the
ESCAPE key.)

While in the list of files, the VIEW program can let you read a text
file, uncompress a zipped file, or copy a file onto another drive.  

To read a text file, merely position the highlight bar onto the line
with the filename you wish to read, then press ENTER.  While reading
the document, if you wish to search for a string, press either the
"S" key, CONTROL-S (type "S" while holding down the Control key), or
F9 then enter the string for which you wish to search.  For further
occurrences of the string, merely press the S key, CONTROL-S, or F9
key.  You may do reverse searches by pressing R, CONTROL-R, or F10 in
the same manner.  

To uncompress a file, position the highlight bar onto the line with
the filename you wish to uncompress, then press ENTER.  The screen
will change to ask you to where you wish to uncompress the file, the
default being a directory on your C: drive.  If you wish, you may
edit this destination box.  Press ENTER to begin uncompressing the
file, or press ESCAPE to abort.  After uncompressing, you will have
the option to either exit out to the directory to which the VIEW
program uncompressed the file, or to return to the menu; if you
decide to return the menu, be sure to remember to where the file was
uncompressed!

To copy a file, position the highlight bar onto the line with the
wish to copy, then press ENTER.  The screen will change to ask you to
where you wish to copy the file, the default being a directory on
your C: drive.  If you wish, you may edit this destination box.
Press ENTER to copy the file, or press ESCAPE to abort.  After
copying, you will have the option to either exit out to the directory
to which the VIEW program copied the file, or to return to the menu;
if you decide to return the menu, be sure to remember to where the
file was copied!

===========================================================================

Most of the files in the msdos/ and win3/ directories are compressed
using the ZIP format.  To unzip these files ending in ".zip", we have
included the following unzip utilities:

utils/msdos/unz50p1.exe      Info-ZIP's free portable UNZIPv5.0p1, EXE/docs
utils/unix/unz50p1           Info-ZIP's free portable UNZIPv5.0p1, SRC

Most of the files in the unix_c/ directory end in ".tgz", specifying
that these files are in tar (tape archive) format as well as
compressed using the GNU GZIP program.  

Most Unix systems already have a tar program.  There are a few tar
programs located on this cdrom to untar these files ending in ".tar":

utils/msdos/detar11.zip      Process a TAR file on PC
utils/msdos/tar.zip          Unix-compatible TAR archive maker/extractor
utils/msdos/tar4dos.zip      Unix-compatible TAR archive create/extract
utils/unix/pdtar             Public domain tar extractor

Most Unix systems already have the GNU GZIP program which can
compress and uncompress files ending in .z/.Z/.gz.  We have included
it on the disc for your convenience, should your system not have it
as:

utils/unix/gzip_124.tar

Most of the files in the usenet/ directory are in shar (shell archive) format.
There are a couple of unshar programs on this cdrom:

utils/msdos/toadshr1.arc     DOS Unix-compatible shar/unshar, w/TP 5.0 src
utils/msdos/unshar.zip       Program to Decode Files Created by UNIX Shar Prg

===========================================================================

The MSDOS source code in the msdos/ directory was compiled from the
Simtel20 MSDOS archive.  The Simtel20 archives can be accessed at our
Internet site ftp.cdrom.com (192.153.46.2).

The MS-Windows source code in the win3/ directory was compiled from
the CICA (Center for Innovative Computing Applications) archive.  The
CICA site can be accessed via Internet at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
(129.79.20.27).

The Unix-C source code in the unix_c/ directory was compiled from the
Simtel20 Unix-C archive, also accessible at ftp.cdrom.com
(192.153.46.2)

The Usenet source code in the usenet/ directory was compiled from the
internet site ftp.uu.net (192.48.96.9).

The GNU source code in the gnu/ directory was compiled from the
Internet site prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38).

Although you may own this disc, you do not own the programs recorded
on it.  Many of the programs on this disc are shareware.  You are
free to try each program for a limited amount of time.  If you are
satisfied, and want to continue to use the program, you are required
to register the program by sending a specified amount of money
directly to the author of the program.  In many cases the author will
send you the most up to date version of the program and a printed
manual.  Please check the individual files for specific information.
Please help support shareware by contributing to these authors.  They
make discs like this possible.
