The latest version of the runtime libraries for Symantec C++ 6.00 are available
in the following files. These self-extracting archives have been uploaded by
Symantec Corporation for registered users of their Symantec C++ 6.00 product.

RTLALL.EXE - contains all new libraries and include files. If you download this
	     file you will not need any other files to get the latest RTL.

RTLINC.EXE - contains the latest header files. Must be used in conjunction with
	     one or more of the following files.

RTLDOS.EXE - contains the latest versions of the DOS libraries (SD?.LIB) and
	     related *.OBJ files. Also includes DOSX libraries. You must also
	     download RTLINC.EXE to use this file.

RTLWIN.EXE - contains the latest versions of the Windows libraries (SW?.LIB) and
	     related *.OBJ files. You must also download RTLINC.EXE to use this
	     file. If you want Win32 libraries, you must also download
	     RTLSNN.EXE.

RTLSNN.EXE - contains the latest versions of the Win32 libraries (SNN.LIB).
	     You must also download RTLINC.EXE to use this file.

We recommend that you download rtlall.exe instead of mixing and matching with
the other files. That will ensure that all your libraries are up to date. We do
realize that this is quite a large file to download, which is why we are
providing you with the option of downloading smaller files with specific
libraries.
