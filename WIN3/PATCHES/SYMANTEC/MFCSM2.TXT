The file MFCSIM.EXE contains the Symantec C++ MFC SIM update, which
includes the C++ code generator and associated files for use with
Visual Programmer. This self-extracting archive has been uploaded by 
Symantec Corporation for registered users of their Symantec C++ 6.00 product.


This is a self-extracting archive that contains several patch files
and a batch file to perform the update.
