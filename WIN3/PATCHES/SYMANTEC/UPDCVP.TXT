Using CVPACK environment variable
-------------------------------------------------------
The Symantec C++ Standard Edition includes the CVPACK
utility.  CVPACK is a functional replacement for
Microsoft's CVPACK.  It "packs" the CodeView 4 format
debugging information in an executable image by
removing duplicate records and updating cross-references
from among the object modules involved.

The linker runs CVPACK automatically.  You can control
CVPACK's operation by passing arguments to it via the
CVPACK environment variable, which you place in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  For example:

	SET CVPACK=-q -c

runs CVPACK in quiet and maximum compression mode.

CVPACK accepts the following options:

-b	Display logo and statistical information

-c	Force CVPACK to use maximum compression (the
	default is minimal compression).  This option
	is useful for working with DLL or EXE files
	with large symbol tables.

-k	Remove all CodeView 4 information

-q	Display only error messages (quiet mode)

-s	Run CVPACK in a mode that minimizes memory use

-v	Display statistics on number of modules,
	timing, and type information
