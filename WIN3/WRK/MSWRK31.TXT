Several people asked for it, so here we go again a second time:

The famous Microsoft Windows 3.1 Resource Kit after a big round trip :-)

Downloaded from Microsoft's BBS by J. Moore and placed on his PC
for anonymous FTP, downloaded from me for our archive ftp.uni-koeln.de and
now uploaded back again to the cica archive.

In my persomal unimportant opinion the only interesting part are the doc
files which had already their permanent place on cica, but judge yourself.

Instructions for creating Windows Resource Kit:

1.	Download the files:
	
	WRK_DOC.ZIP
	DISKROOT.ZIP
	DISK_WRK.ZIP
	DISK_IPX.ZIP
	DISK_DRV.ZIP

2.	Use PKUNZIP to expand the *.ZIP files.  WRK_DOC.ZIP
	contains the Microsoft Word for Windows version 2.0 
	documentation files.  The other ZIPs contain the software.
	In order to create the disk, you need to create a disk with the
	following structure:

	\
	\WRK
	\IPX
	\DRIVERS

3.	Copy the expanded files from DISK*.ZIP to the appropriate
	directory on the disk as shown below:

	DISKROOT.ZIP => \
	DISK_WRK.ZIP => \WRK
	DISK_IPX.ZIP => \IPX
	DISK_DRV.ZIP => \DRIVERS
