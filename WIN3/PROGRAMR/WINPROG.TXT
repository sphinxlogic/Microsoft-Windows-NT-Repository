I might not be the only one who sometimes would like to have some more
information when running into real tricky problems with 'programming
windows'.
  We have developed a huge package of code for ground support of 
scientific space systems and really had to go into the heart of 
WINDOW's. We had to learn how to code interrupt routines under 
Windows, how to protect segments against being discarded etc.
  I think that many other program development teams might run into
the same and similar problems and that it is time to have a forum 
on internet to discuss these problems and to learn from each other.

  Therefore I propose a kind of 'Windows Programming News' magazine
which could be published here at CICA on a monthly basis or so. It should 
contain questions and solutions to problems or hints were specific
solutions can be found.

Anybody who is interested in contributing to such a magazine should
send his questions, solutions to problems he had etc. to me via email.
If I receive response, I would collect the incoming things and 
place it on CICA in files as 'WPNEWSXX.TXT' where XX would be the 
actual week of the year.
Since not many people seem to have access to the INTERNET news system,
I guess that CICA is the best place to discuss Windows programming
matters.
