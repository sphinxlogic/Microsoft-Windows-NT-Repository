TABLE OF CONTENTS:
	1)  Introduction
	2)  New combined list of traditonal acronyms
	3)  List of ATT related acronyms
	4)  List of slightly non-traditional acronyms

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  INTRODUCTION

A while back I posted a list of acronyms(first edition) with
expansion/definitions along with a request that I wanted more.
Below is a compilation of what I had, and what people sent me.

I would like to thank the following people for contributing:
	Roger R. Gowland	hvmga!rgowland
	Carl Deitrick		iham1!cbd
	Dave Curry		pur-ee!davy
	Rick Heli		ucdavis!groucho:ccrrick
	Lynn Ihlenfeldt		mmm!lynn 
	??????			elsie!sck
	Kevin Koch		dec-elgar!koch
	Greg Noel		ncr-tp!greg
	Maurice			trwrba!suhre
	Lum Johnson		osu-eddie!lum
	??????			lsuc!msb
	Marty Olevitch		wuphys!marty
	Mike D. Jones		wuphys!mike
	Jack Applin		hpfclg!jack
	Craig Werner		aecom!werner

Here are some random comments in no particular order:

Several people suggested some books of precompiled acronym listngs.
As I was to repost the second edition of the list to the net, I turned
down the offers to avoid copyright entanglements.

One person(lsuc!msb) sent me about 120 corrections (typos and spelling)
to the first edition (I doubt that I will ever know how to spell missile).

For a machine readable list of acronyms, it was unconscionable to
forget to include CS.

A couple of people mentioned that some of the entries are really
abriviations or word (laser, etc).  Maybe I should ammend the
subject line to include abbreviations.  And since I have seen AAAAAA
in several places now, whether it was real or fake  originally, it is
now real.

I added another 100+ to the list.

If people wish to send me more acronyms (please not a bounce-back of
the first edition list), I may(?) get around to doing a third edition
(if there are plenty of responses).

I hope people don't flame about this in net.sources.  I take sources
to mean general knowlege listings (which in a CS environ means programs).
It is also in net.misc to followup on the original posting/request.
If this really does offend people's sensibilities, send mail.

Much thanks to everyone,
Scott Barthelmy		ihnp4!wuphys!scott	"I am a child of the unixverse."
