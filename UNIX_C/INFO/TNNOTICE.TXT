SYNOPSIS OF tn3270

Tn3270 permits a full-screen, full-duplex connection from a UNIX machine to an
IBM (or compatible) machine when the two are connected via TCP/IP.  Tn3270
gives the appearance of being logged in to the remote machine from an
IBM 3270 terminal.  Of course, you must have an account on the machine
to which you connect in order to log in.  Tn3270 looks to the user in many
respects like the Yale ASCII Terminal Communications System II. Tn3270 is
actually a modification of the ARPANET TELENET user interface (see telnet(1))
which will, in certain circumstances, interpret and generate raw 3270
control streams.
