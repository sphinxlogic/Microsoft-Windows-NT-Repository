sftwrtls.tar
        An implementation of the routines from "Software Tools in
        Pascal", by Kernighan & Plaugher.  Should run under Berkeley
        Pascal; the text indicates it should run under VS/PASCAL
        on VM/CMS and MVS, also.
        Contributor: James Potter <jp@lanl.gov>
turbotls.tar
        Another implementation of K&P's "Software Tools in Pascal",
        this one for Turbo Pascal 3.0 under CP/M-86.  The comments
        imply it should run under MS/DOS as well.
