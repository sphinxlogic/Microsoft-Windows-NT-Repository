vms.get - Instructions for getting Icon for VMS via FTP



The file icon/vms.bin, available via anonymous FTP from Arizona.EDU, is a BACKUP
save set of the VMS distribution of Icon.  This includes source files, object
files, executable files, command files, sample programs, and documentation.


Before starting FTP, set your default directory to a parent directory that can
contain the Icon hierarchy.  (A maximum of about 11000 blocks of disk space will
be needed by the steps below.)  Run FTP and copy icon/vms.bin from Arizona;  be
sure to use binary (image) mode.


The save set has a block size of 8192.  Because FTP writes a binary file with a
block size of 512, some initial repairs are needed before BACKUP will read it.
First, run BACKUP to create a dummy save set with the correct file attributes
(using this file, or any other handy file, for input):

	$ BACKUP/BLOCK=8192 VMS.GET V7.BCK/SAVE

Copy the FTP file onto this save set:

	$ COPY/OVERLAY VMS.BIN V7.BCK

Verify that BACKUP accepts the new save set:

	$ BACKUP/LIST V7.BCK/SAVE

If BACKUP reports no errors, you can delete the FTP file to reclaim disk space:

	$ DELETE VMS.BIN;


Begin the installation by unpacking the save set:

	$ BACKUP V7.BCK/SAVE [...]

This creates a subdirectory [.V7] containing the Icon hierarchy.
Print the installation and use documents:

	$ PRINT/NOFEED [.V7.DOCS]INSTALL.DOC,USE.DOC

Now complete the installation as directed by INSTALL.DOC.


If you pick up a copy of Icon via FTP, please let us know by mail to
icon-project@Arizona.EDU and include a postal mailing address.  We will
add you to our Icon Newsletter mailing list if you are not already on it.
On request, we'll send you typeset copies of the installation and use
documents for VMS.
