F2C.TAR  A Fortran to C translator developed by folks from Bell Labs, Bellcore, and CMU.  Derived from the original UNIX f77(1). Converts ANSI standard Fortran 77 to C without manual intervention.  Can generate ANSI C or C++ compatible code as well.  Runs on Sun, Vax, IBM RT, Apollo, SGI, MIPS, and Crays. Has been verified on the NBS tests, several large math libraries, floating point tests, etc. Contributor: Mark Maimone <mwm@cs.cmu.edu>
FLOPPY.TAR  A Fortran coding convention checker and code tidier.  Understands F77, supports 44 different coding conventions.  Runs under VMS, VM/CMS, and UNIX.  Written in Fortran. Contributor: Julian Bunn <julian@cernvax.cern.ch>
FXREF.TAR  A linkage map generator and a cross reference generator for FORTRAN-77 programs. Contributor: Bill Silvert <silvert@dalcs.uucp>
PREP.TAR  A preprocessor which supports macros, flow control extensions, vector statement shorthand, and automatic loop unrolling for certain classes of loops. Contributor: Roger Ove <ove@newton.uucp>
PSDRAW.TAR  Library routines to generate PostScript drawings from FORTRAN. Contributor: B. Narasimhan <naras@stat.fsu.edu>
RATFOR.TAR  A public domain implementation of RATFOR (RATional FORtran). Generates FORTRAN-77, unlike UNIX "ratfor" which generates FORTRAN-66. Contributor: Ozan Yigit <oz@yetti.uucp>
