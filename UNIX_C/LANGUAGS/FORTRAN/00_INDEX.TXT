f2c.tar
        A Fortran to C translator developed by folks from Bell Labs,
        Bellcore, and CMU.  Derived from the original UNIX f77(1).
        Converts ANSI standard Fortran 77 to C without manual
        intervention.  Can generate ANSI C or C++ compatible code as
        well.  Runs on Sun, Vax, IBM RT, Apollo, SGI, MIPS, and Crays.
        Has been verified on the NBS tests, several large math libraries,
        floating point tests, etc.

floppy.tar
        A Fortran coding convention checker and code tidier.  Understands
        F77, supports 44 different coding conventions.  Runs under VMS,
        VM/CMS, and UNIX.  Written in Fortran.

fxref.tar
        A linkage map generator and a cross reference generator for
        FORTRAN-77 programs.

prep.tar
        A preprocessor which supports macros, flow control extensions,
        vector statement shorthand, and automatic loop unrolling for
        certain classes of loops.

ratfor.tar
        A public domain implementation of RATFOR (RATional FORtran).
        Generates FORTRAN-77, unlike UNIX "ratfor" which generates
        FORTRAN-66.
