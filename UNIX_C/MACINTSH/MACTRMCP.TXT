Subject: New Macintosh/MacTerminal termcap

From: Steven B. Munson <sbm@Purdue.ARPA>

     I have modified the termcap entry posted to info-mac earlier by
Chris Kent@Purdue.  I added a little more padding to the add line and
insert character capabilities, and removed the padding from the delete
character capability.  Delete character works fine now on mine at 1200
baud; I never get a chance to test it at higher rates (some day I will
buy a carrying case and bring it into school).  I would be interested
in hearing how it does at 9600 baud.

     There are still little glitches in extreme cases, though.  If I am
in vi at the beginning of a line half full of text and type "30ix<ESC>"
to insert 30 x's rapidly, it works pretty well, but if I type
"50ix<ESC>", there are errors when the line wraps around.  I am not
sure where to start to fix that problem; if anyone fixes it or has
expert advice on how to go about it, I would like to hear about it.
This termcap entry works very well for my purposes, though (I don't use
vi anyway), and here it is.
