You are looking at PD6:<UNIX-C>000-MASTER-INDEX.TXT, last updated 23-APR-92.

This file is the master index to the UNIX-SW repository.  It lists each
directory in the repository, and gives a brief description of the types of
files that directory contains.  Underneath each directory, a list of the
files in that directory is given, with a brief description of what that file
contains and who contributed it.

Also see the files 000-INDEX.TXT in each subdirectory, which contain the
identical information, but just for that directory.

The obligatory cover-our-behinds statement:
-------------------------------------------
All the software in the UNIX-SW repository is provided AS IS with NO
WARRANTY.  We cannot guarantee that it is good for any particular purpose, or
even that it works.

I make an attempt to examine the software submitted to me to at least make
sure it doesn't contain Trojan horses and what-have-you, and the moderator of
comp.sources.unix, where a lot of this stuff comes from, also does this.
But, as with all free software written by strangers, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE INSTALLING BEFORE YOU INSTALL IT!

Blech, now that's out of the way.
-------------------------------------------

The directories in the UNIX-SW repository are:

File Formats
------------
Everything stored in this repository is stored either as a single text file
(in the case of short C programs, etc.) or as a compressed "tar" file.  A
compressed "tar" file will have ".TAR-Z" as its file type.  Compressed files
should be copied to your system using "tenex" mode with FTP, and placed in a
file whose name ends with ".Z".  If you do not have "compress", you can find
it in PD6:<UNIX-C.FILE-MGMT>COMPRESS.TAR.  It is also distributed in
/usr/src/new on the 4.3BSD tape.

Some extremely large files have been split into pieces of about 750 kbytes
each.  These files have names like SOMETHING.TAR-Z1, SOMETHING.TAR-Z2, etc.
To get these files, get all the pieces, concatenate them together, and then
run uncompress.

The rest of the files, ".TXT", ".C", ".BUG", ".PATCH", etc. are all stored
as plain old files with no particular format imposed on them.  Transfer
these files in "ascii" mode with FTP.

Files whose names begin with "000-" (to sort to the top of a directory
listing) are things placed there by me for your information, not part of the
repository.  Most of these are in the top-level PD6:<UNIX-C> directory, but
you may find a few scattered around in other directories (such as
000-INDEX.TXT) as they are needed.

Other Notes
-----------
When transferring compressed files, you MUST tell FTP to "type l 8" or "type
tenex".  DO NOT use "type image" or "type binary", you will get garbage.
All other files may be transferred using "type ascii", the default.  For
more information on FTPing files, see the file 000-INTRO-UNIX-SW.TXT in
the top-level directory.

The "Contributor" fields are somewhat misleading.  This is the name of the
person who *sent* the contribution, not necessarily the author of the
software.  In many cases, the version stored here is an improvement on what
the original author submitted, although improvements are not taken "just for
the sake of having them", they have to do something worthwhile.  The theory
is that the author knows his code better than others, so his is probably the
best version to have if just trivial changes are being made.

If you find mistakes in this listing, or if you don't see something that you
feel should be in the repository, please contact me.  Even if you don't have
the source for something you think should be here, send me some mail, I may
know where to get it if it's something that's distributed or in another
repository.

If you find bugs in one of the programs here, by all means send me the fixes
("diff -c" is best, since you can feed it to "patch") and I will make them
available to the rest of the folks.

Finally, suggestions and comments are always welcome.

PD6:<UNIX-C.ARC-PROGS>
    ARC is an archive/library utility developed by System Enhancement
    Associates which maintains compressed archives of files and
    directories.  It uses various methods of compressing files,

    file.  This directory contains source code for programs that
    implement ARC.

    ARC.TAR-Z
        A version of ARC which runs under Berkeley UNIX, SunOS, Apollo
        Domain/IX, and IBM MVS.  Contains patches to make it run under
        System V.  I'm not sure if this is a derivative of one of the
        other ARC's in this directory or not, but it's newer...

        Contributor: Paul Vixie <vixie@vixie.sf.ca.us>
    DBGREP.TAR-Z
        A disk block-based grep-like utility.  This program reads the raw file
        system device and examines all the disk blocks searching for a pattern.
        Regular expressions are not supported, although case may be ignored.
        The names of the files whose disk blocks contain the pattern, along
        with the names of their owners, etc. are printed.  This is faster than
        doing a find/grep combination, since the program does not do all the
        opens, plus it stops searching a file after the first match is found.
        This program works under 4.3BSD and SunOS 3.4.

    FINO.TAR-Z
        Find files and inode numbers.  This program reads the raw disk and
        prints out all in-use inodes and their file names.  The real reason
        it exists is to find large files being written but that have been
        unlinked and can't be found with conventional methods.  It's sort
        of a reinvention of what you can do with "icheck" and "ncheck",
        but it's sort of different too.  For 4.xBSD.
        Contributor: Dave Curry <davy@erg.sri.com>

    PREEN.TAR-Z
        A program to run "fsck" in parallel keeping all spindles busy.

    PRINTACCT.TAR-Z
        Prints the accounting file (/usr/adm/acct) in a human-readable
        format so "awk" and "perl" and things can use it.  Does not do
