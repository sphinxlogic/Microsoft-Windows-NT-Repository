iocall.c
        A benchmark which fills the deficiencies in Dhrystone.  This
        one benchmarks I/O performance (disk and buffer cache independent)
        and benchmarks O/S performance.
        Contributor: Jan Stubbs <stubbs@ncr-sd.uucp>
miscbnch.tar
        Assorted benchmarks.  Inclues Dhrystone, Iofile, and others.
        Contributor: David Kirschbaum <kirsch@usasoc.soc.mil>
musbus.tar
        The Monash University Benchmark, V5.0.  Attempts to benchmark UNIX
        systems by providing simulated general or application-specific
        workloads to evaluate multi-user performance.
        Contributor: Ken McDonell <kenj@moncsbruce.oz.au>
nfsstone.tar
        The "nfsstone" benchmark for benchmarking the performance of NFS
        servers.  This is the one described by Barry Shein at the 1989
        Summer USENIX conference in Baltimore.
        Contributor: Barry Shein <bzs@world.uucp>
nhfstone.tar
        The Nhfsstone (yes, there's an "h" in it) benchmark for benchamrking
        the performance of NFS servers.  This is NOT the benchmark described
        by Barry Shein at the 1989 Summer USENIX conference in Baltimore.

plum.tar
        A set of benchmarks to provide information about common C
        operations.  From Plum-Hall.
        Contributor: Eric S. Raymond <eric@snark.uu.net>
tbench.tar
        A set of benchmarks for testing the performance of UNIX tty
        subsystems under load.
        Contributor: Gene H. Olson <gene@digibd.uucp>
ttcp.tar
        A TCP benchmark which is more accurate than the typical "blast"
        becnhmarks.  Utilizes a sender and receiver, and transfers data.
        Works under 4.1c, 4.2, 4.3BSD, and System V systems with BSD
        socket libraries.
