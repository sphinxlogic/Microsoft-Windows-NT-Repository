loadabld.tar
        A system to allow loadable device drivers on the Sun workstation.
        Allows the development and debugging of device drivers without
        the constant relink-the-kernel reboot-the-system hassles.
        Should be portable to any 4.xBSD environment.

nlist1.tar
        A program which reads kernel variables and displays them.  It can be
        used to monitor variables, display arrays of data structures, or
        linked lists.  Also a full report generator, with a built-in
        calculator.  It's configurable as to how to read variables, etc.
        Comes with configuration files for SunOS, 4.3BSD, System V,
        and Mach.
        Contributor: Chris Bertin <chris@cetia.uucp>
nlist2.tar
        A command-level interface to nlist(3).  Can also dump kernel memory,
        if you have permission.  Should work on any UNIX system with nlist.

        Contributor: Jon Zeeff <zeeff@b-tech.ann-arbor.mi.us>
subnetrp.tar
        The mods necessary to 4.3BSD to add a subnet ARP hack.  They allow
        a subnet gateway machine to act as a bridge so that only it need
        know of the existence of subnets.  This is quite useful if many
        machines on the local network do not have RFC 950 subnet code.
        Contributor: John Quarterman <jsq@sally.utexas.edu>
syscltrc.tar
        A system call trace facility for 4.2BSD UNIX.
