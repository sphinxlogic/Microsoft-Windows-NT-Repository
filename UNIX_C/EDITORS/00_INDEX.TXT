jove.tar
        The JOVE (Jonathan's Own Version of EMACS) text editor, version 4.9.
        This is an EMACS editor without the Lisp interpreter.  It is very
        close to ITS and TOPS-20 EMACS.  It runs on PDP-11's under V7 and
        2.xBSD; almost anything under 4.xBSD, System V, and MS-DOS.  There
        is also code to make it run on a Macintosh with menus and the whole
        deal.  This version is *newer* than the one on the 4.3BSD distribution.
