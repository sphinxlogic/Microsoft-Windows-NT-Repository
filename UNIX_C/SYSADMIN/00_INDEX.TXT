        A program to do automatic baud rate detection under 4.3BSD.  This
        is done by using the carriage return character.  The code in 4.3BSD
        "getty" to do this has never worked right.  This program can function
        as a replacement for "getty".

        Contributor: Paul Vixie <vixie@vixie.sf.ca.us>
dbgrep.tar
        A disk block-based grep-like utility.  This program reads the raw file
        system device and examines all the disk blocks searching for a pattern.
        Regular expressions are not supported, although case may be ignored.
        The names of the files whose disk blocks contain the pattern, along
        with the names of their owners, etc. are printed.  This is faster than
        doing a find/grep combination, since the program does not do all the
        opens, plus it stops searching a file after the first match is found.
        This program works under 4.3BSD and SunOS 3.4.
        Contributor: Dave Curry <davy@erg.sri.com>
dusage.tar

fino.tar
        Find files and inode numbers.  This program reads the raw disk and
        prints out all in-use inodes and their file names.  The real reason
        it exists is to find large files being written but that have been
        unlinked and can't be found with conventional methods.  It's sort
        of a reinvention of what you can do with "icheck" and "ncheck",
        but it's sort of different too.  For 4.xBSD.
        Contributor: Dave Curry <davy@erg.sri.com>
force.c
        Another program to allow running a command as the super-user; this
        one requires the password first.

preen.tar
        A program to run "fsck" in parallel keeping all spindles busy.

        Contributor: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>
printact.tar
        Prints the accounting file (/usr/adm/acct) in a human-readable
        format so "awk" and "perl" and things can use it.  Does not do
        all the intermediate processing that "sa" does.  Works on 4.xBSD;
        will probably take work for System V.
