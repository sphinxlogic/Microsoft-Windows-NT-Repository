NOTE 1: At present, the European TRICKLE servers *will* supply UNIX-C
        service to people in the USA.  However, they would prefer to
        have some help from sites in the USA.  If you are running a
        BITNET site and are interested in helping out, please contact
        the UNIX-SW moderator.

NOTE 2: Please be kind to the TRICKLE if you are a U.S. site.  Don't
	go requesting everything under the sun.  Remember that those
	trans-Atlantic links cost somebody some serious dollars.

                        RED - Listserv Redirector
                (C)1988 Turgut Kalfaoglu <TURGUT@TREARN>

What is RED?
------------
RED provides  the SIMTEL-20   files, and directory listings, with its own
cache, where  it keeps  its most recently requested files. It reduces the
network load  by providing the cache, and by providing directory listings
locally, instead  of through   a  distant list  server.. It  is a machine
(process) that runs disconnected from a terminal.

  Currently, the seven sites that run this  software are called:

In Denmark:   TRICKLE@DKTC11
In Turkey:    TRICKLE@TREARN
In Italy:     TRICKLE@IMIPOLI
In Belgium:   TRICKLE@BANUFS11
In Austria:   TRICKLE@AWIWUW11
In Germany:   TRICKLE@DB0FUB11
In Spain:     TRICKLE@EB0UB011

You are urged  to use the one that is  closer to your location.

In this  tutorial, we will  be using 'TELL TRICKLE  AT TREARN', but  this
can   be   replaced   with   'TELL   TRICKLE    AT    <your  location  of
preference>'

We also  will use  the 'TELL'  command to send a single line message.  It
should be  replaced with  whatever is appropriate for your system.  (Like
XMIT ,  SEND, etc.)  If you  are on  a node  that cannot  reach a TRICKLE
directly, for example, a JANET node, then you must send MAIL files to the
server. Simply  put the  commands, one per line, into the text portion of
your mail.

What Does it Provide?
---------------------
A Milnet node, WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL at White Sands Missile Range,  New
Mexico  contains a  large  selection  of  public  domain and  'shareware'
software.  This  DECsystem-20  machine,  running  the  Tops-20 operating
system  provides  many  files  of interest, especially to CP/M and MSDOS
users.

The collection is open to public, anyone may obtain copies of this of the
files using  the Internet  file transfer  protocol,  FTP.  However,  this
protocol is  not available to Bitnet, or EARN sites. For this reason, two
servers in The United States, who have a connection both to Milnet and to
Bitnet, provide us with these files. However, since both of these servers
are in  The US,  the requests  of these  files puts a burdon on these two
servers. The  solution was  to create  a server here in Europe that could
provide the  files requested,  send the directory listings, and also keep
the recently  requested files,  in case  someone else  wishes to have the
same file.

We,  the  server  operators,  would  like  to  stress  that  we  have  no
affiliation with  the US  Army, nor with White Sands Missile Range. These
servers are  made available  in the  true spirit of volunteerism, without
any outside sponsorship for the service.

The Trickle, and The US servers support the following directories:

CPM  Software and information for CP/M users. Contributions are gathered
   from a variety of sources, including the members of the Info-CPM
   electronic mail discussion group. This archive is updated very
   frequently.
MSDOS  Software and information for PC-DOS and MS-DOS system users. This
   archive is updated very frequently.
PC-BLUE  Software and information for PC-DOS and MS-DOS system users. The
   archive contains files distributed by the PC-Blue Users Group. New
   files are added as they become available.
SIGM  Software and information for CP/M users. The archive contains the
   files distributed by the SIG/M Users Group. New files are added as
   they become available.
MISC  Software and information for miscellaneous systems (mostly large
   systems like IBM/370 and DEC VAX). Contributions are gathered from a
   variety of sources.

The Trickle also supports the following directory:

UNIX-SW	Software collected from comp.sources.*, the GNU project, and
   elsewhere for use with UNIX systems.

How does it work?
-----------------
   It provides  faster file  delivery than  LISTSERV@RPIECS because  it
holds the  most recently  requested files, and it also asks its peers, to
find out if any of them has the file.

  It has two major commands.  /PDDIR and /PDGET..  As the names indicate,
/PDDIR provides the names of the files, and /PDGET delivers files.

How to use /PDDIR:
------------------
  On IBM/VM systems, you can get a list of the 'major directory' names by
simply typing this command:

                      TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR

RED should  now send  you a  list of the major directory names.  Now, you
can obtain a list of the sub-directories of any of the displayed names by
putting the  name between  less-than  and  greater-than  symbols..    For
example,

                  TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS>

RED will  mail you  a file  containing the  names of the sub-directories.
Once you  choose a  subdirectory to  examine, type  in the main directory
name, a  period, then the name of the subdirectory name.  For example, if
you chose SYSUTL sub-directory of MSDOS, then you may type this:

              TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.SYSUTL>

RED will  first notify  you of  the number  of files  found, then will go
ahead and  mail you  this list..   Once you choose your file(s) to order,
then read on..

How to use the /PDGET command:
------------------------------
   Once you  have a filename in hand, then tell RED to send you this file
by providing  it with the full directory name, and the filename..  If you
wish to  order a game called MADMAX.ARC that resides in the <MSDOS.GAMES>
directory, then you may type in this command:

          TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDGET <MSDOS.GAMES>MADMAX.ARC

naturally, the  above is  only an example, and the file may or may not be
present if you send the above command.

Receiving your file in a different format:
Normally, SIMTEL  files are sent AS-IS, meaning, ASCII. If you would like
to receive your file in a different format, you may want to append any of
the below to the end of any of your your commands:

(EBC80 Converts the file to 80-Column EBCDIC format
(EBC32 Converts the file to 132-Column EBCDIC format
(UUE uuencodes the file
(OLD Sends the file using DISK DUMP or PUNCH format
(SF Supresses BITSEND, and forces SENDFILE to be used for the transfer.
(MAIL Forces results to be sent via MAILER.  (This option is
   automatically added for MAIL command files)
(XXE  XXDECODES the file that is to be sent to you.
(HEX  Turns the file to HEX format - use it if even (XXE doesn't work for
   you.
(BTOA BTOA-Encrypts the file. Useful for Unix systems.

You may  also wish  to combine several options together.  For example, to
receive a directory listing in PUNCH format, and UUEncoded,

            TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.C> (OLD UUE

To receive a file in in EBCDIC format, you may enter a command that looks
like this:

      TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDGET <MSDOS.GAMES>MADMAX.ARC (EBC80

However, it  is not  useful at  all to  receive an  .ARC file  in  EBCDIC
format. The above is not a terribly good example.

Other commands:
---------------
/NEWS  sends you our 2-page newsletter.
/STAT  provides you the statistics of usage.
/HELP  sends you this file.
/IMDAT  sends   the  Turkish  version  of   this  help  file.  Note that
   this command is only valid for the TREARN server.
/CAC Sends  you a list  of the files  that are stored  on its disk right
   now. These files  can be sent  faster than the other files.
/OPS   displays the RED operators
/QUO Shows  you the RED's quota,  and how much of  that quotait has
   used.  Once  RED  exceeds its  quota,  it  cannot order files,  until
   it receives some  of the requested files.
/SUB <dirnam> Allows  you  to  subscribe to  a  directory.  Whenever a
   new listing  comes in,  RED  will send  you a  file containing the
   names of the new files.
/UNSUB <dirnam> is to stop RED from sending you the new files listings.
   Please issue this command  if you will not use the server anymore.
/NEW <dirnam> nnn This command, displays the files that have arrived
   within 'nnn' days, in the 'dirnam' directory.  If 'nnn' is omitted, it
   defaults to the last time you issued this command, for that directory.
   If you are issuing this command for the first time, then it simply
   looks for files that are at most a month old.
/POLL forces RED to check its peer servers

Delay Periods:
--------------
   If the  file that you requested already exists in the cache directory,
then you  may expect  to receive  your file within a few hours.  However,
the system  that RED  is running  is  often  slowed  down  by  the  other
processes that are running.  This negatively affects the response time of
RED.   If the  file requested  does not existin the cache directory, then
RED will  have to  order this file from its list server..  If this is the
case, the  response time  of RED  is dependent upon the list server.  RED
will give  up waiting  for a  file after  five to  twelve days  after its
request.

Sending files to RED:
---------------------
   RED now accepts command files in either MAIL or NOTE format.  Use NOTE
or MAIL  utilities to  prepare your  command file.  The files may contain
any number  of instructions,  one per  line.   Note that  RED will  abort
processing a  file if  it detects an invalid command within the file. The
server has  a 'likewise'  habit, and will MAIL back your files, using the
default UUENCODING,  unless you  tell it  otherwise, if  you request your
file via  mail. This  is done for those of us, who are not on Bitnet, and
keep forgetting to put the (MAIL at the end of the command.

How to DONATE files to Simtel Archives:
---------------------------------------
   Files that  you receive from here are sent from another network called
ArpaNet.   The person-in-charge  for  the  programs  is:  Keith  Petersen
<W8SDZ@SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>. Since  it's another  network, you will need to
use MAIL  to send  the message.  He urges that you talk to him before you
send in  the file,  so that  he can  check where  it should be put, if it
already exists,  etc.   After getting  his approval, you need to UUENCODE
your file (perhaps using PDUTIL), then MAIL it to him.

Format of the files that comes with /PDGET command:
---------------------------------------------------

For the  below chart,  we shall  assume that  you  have  not  placed  any
conversion options at the end of your command.

If you have used:        You can expect the file to arrive:
-----------------------------------------------------------
'tell' style message:    BITSEND, NETDATA format.
-----------------------------------------------------------

MAIL command file:       UUENCODED, in numbered pieces.
-----------------------------------------------------------
A regular file, or       Just like 'tell' messages,
IBM's NOTE command:      replies in BITSEND, NETDATA.
-----------------------------------------------------------

RED will  send the files in  a NETDATA format, -unless  you use the  (OLD
option-.  On IBM systems, these files can be LOOKed and RECEIVEd, but the
PEEK command cannot handle NETDATA format properly.  However, since  most
files  are ASCII, it  is of little use to LOOK at them.

The files  will mostly be either in Binary format, in ASCII format, or in
EBCDIC format.   The  binary files  are recognized  by the '.BIN','.EXE',
'.COM ',  '.ARC', '.LBR' suffix in their names.  These files are machine-
specific.The files  that are  in ASCII  format can be converted to EBCDIC
(so that  they can  be used  on an  IBM system)  by running  a conversion
program called  PDUTIL.   If your  installation does  not have  either of
these files,  Either I,  or the LISTSERV@RPIECS can provide it.  Simply
say: TELL LISTSERV AT RPIECS GET PDUTIL PACKAGE
The .ARC format:

  ARC is a special compression method that provides substential reduction
on file  size.   There are  one or  more files  contained within  an .ARC
archive.   In order to extract the files from an archive, you will need a
utility called  ARC or  PKXARC.These are  available from  <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>
directory.   The actual  file names of these files vary, but you may try:
TELL TRICKLE   AT   TREARN  /PDGET   <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>PK361.EXE or:    TELL
TRICKLE   AT   TREARN /PDGET  <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>ARC512.EXE If these attempts
fail, it will probably mean that the file version has changed, and so has
the file name.  You may wish to try

              TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDDIR <MSDOS.ARC-LBR>

and guess the new name of these files.

Once you  receive either ARC or PKXARC and an .ARC file, transmit them to
your personal computer and issue the following command:
                          ARC X <filename.arc>
                                   or
                           PKUNPAK <filename>

There is  also a  second utility  called ARCUTIL,  which runs  on the  VM
systems, and extracts files.  It also provides ASCII to EBCDIC conversion
of the extracted files.  To request ARCUTIL, enter:

      TELL  TRICKLE  AT   TREARN  /PDGET  <MISC.IBM-VM>ARCUTIL.LBR

  The directories of SIMTEL change often.  So, the above files may or may
not be  in the  same directories as I have indicated.  So you may have to
do some  searching to  find them..   A  good place  to check would be the
<MSDOS.STARTER> directory,  where  additional  help,  and  the  mentioned
archive managers can be found.

How to use the BITSEND/BITRCV:
------------------------------
From now  on, RED is sending its files in a special format called BITSEND
- Unless you include the (SF option while issuing your command.
  In this format, the files that are sent are broken into smaller pieces,
if the  entire file  is too  big to  be sent.  If the file you request is
over the  size limit,  then the  server will first send you a file called
<fn> BITCTRL  - this  is the  control file, where BITSEND has written the
protocol used, the number of pieces that make up that file, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------
Important:
You   should NOT  'RECEIVE' any  files that  have BITCTRL or just numbers
as filetype!

-------------------------------------------------------
If you  wait a  little longer,  the rest  of the  file will  arrive,  the
filename will be the same as the <fn> BITCTRL file, but the filetype will
consist of  just numbers.  Once you have all the pieces that make up that
file, you  can then  issue the BITRCV command.  You must also specify the
'spool ID'  of the  file that has BITCTRL as filetype.  From RDRList, you
can simply type BITRCV in front of the file that has BITCTRL as filetype.
If you  get back  an error  message, saying  "UNKNOWN CP/CMS  COMMAND" it
simply states  that your  installation does  not have the BITRCV program.
Contact your network manager/system operator.
Note: BITRCV  EXEC can  be obtained  from your  country NETSERV  as well.
Simply send "GET BITRCV EXEC" to your NETSERV.

-----------------------------------------------------------
VAX users:
There is  also an  identical file  for your  installation, however, it is
called 'BITRCV  COM', and  can be  obtained from a NETSERV by issuing GET
BITRCV COM to your country NETSERV.
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you  get back  an error  saying that  not all  of the  file is  in the
reader, it  simply means  that you  have to  wait a little longer for the
rest of the file to arrive.

How to receive the file that arrives:
-------------------------------------
Once the file you requested arrives, and is stored on your disk, you will
most likely wish to 'download' this file to your personal computer. There
are many  types of mainframe computers, many kinds of personal computers,
so it  is impossible  for me  to give you direct, and precise directions.
However, here are some clues:
  * If you have a PC with a 3270 Emulation program, and an IBM mainframe,
   you should request your files from the server without options, or with
   (SF option, and use the built-in transfer protocol of the emulation
   program, without any options again.
* If you have KERMIT at your installation, request your file without
   options, or with (SF option, then set the KERMIT's FILE-TYPE to BINARY
   before transferring your file.
* Remember that if you send a MAIL command file to the server to request
   your file, the file will arrive in UUENCODE format, since the mailer
   cannot process binary files - unless you specify (XXE or (HEX in the
   command line.

How Does the Cache Work?
------------------------
    Imagine that you ask for a file, and the server brings this file from
United States for you. Thinking that others may wish to have this file as
well, the  server keeps this file in an area called 'cache.' When someone
else requests  this file,  the server  simply uses the stored copy of the
file, instead of asking for the file again from overseas. All the servers
that you  see on  top of  this document  have different  files  in  their
caches. So,  if you wish to see the files they are holding right now, you
will have  to issue '/CAC' to each one of them. Note that a file does not
stay in cache forever. As new files arrive, the older ones are deleted to
make room.

The Amazing Life of a /PDGET request:
-------------------------------------
     Once you order your file via /PDGET, the server will first check its
local cache  listings. If  the file  is not there, then it will check the
SIMTEL20 listings  to ensure  that a such file indeed exists. After this,
the server  sends the  request to  all other servers, asking them if they
have your file in cache. If a server replies 'YES!', then that server has
to send  you the  file.   Everything fails: none of the servers have your
file, or  even some  servers don't  respond. Your  server  will  give  up
waiting for a reply in a day, and order your file from the United States.
Once the  file requested  arrives from there, it will be sent to you, and
put into the cache directory. Quite a trip for one /PDGET command.

Quotas, and Other Ugly Limitations
----------------------------------
You may be surprised that even though most TRICKLE servers have some kind
of quota, we still get several hundred requests daily. Without them, this
number may  easily rise to thousands.  The impact of a such usage rate on
the local  computer can be very 'tiring.' So, the following quota schemes
have been implemented:
1) Total outstanding bytes quota: This quota is not really put by the
   server's operators. It is the amount that a TRICKLE server can order
   from The United States. This is currently set at 10 megabytes for most
   servers.
2) Prime times: Some of the servers, do not function during the day, they
   record the commands received, and process these commands later, when
   the load on the computer is low.
3) User request limitations: Most TRICKLE servers have a limit on how
   many requests a user can make on the server per day. The request can
   be a simple /OPS command, or a file order via /PDGET. It still counts
   as one. The server will warn you that you are approaching the limit,
   once you have 3 more commands left.
4) Outstanding files per user: This scheme is also employed by some
   servers, and it limits the number of files a user can order from The
   United States.
5) Delayed Sendfile: This last scheme is simple: it delays sending your
   file until a specified time comes. Usually at night, when the network
   load is low. If a site uses delayed sendfile, you will see a '* Your
   file will be mailed' notice, instead of '* Your file is being mailed.'

A Last Word on Options:
-----------------------
Some of  the options are not compatible, such as (MAIL SF, and should not
be used together - the behavior of the server may be unpredictable. Also,
the (SF  option may  result in  a file that is too large for shipment. If
that is  the case, a network control program may detect it, and delete it
before it reaches you. Use (SF carefully.
Also, (SF  and (OLD options would be ignored if you send in your commands
in a  MAIL file.  If you  wish to  receive your files AS-IS, and still be
able to  put your  commands in  a file, you can either send a NOTE to the
server, or  simply create  a file  using your editor, then send this file
directly to the server, without first going through the mailer.

VAX/VMS Users:
--------------
If your  host is  a DEC  VAX system  running  VMS  with  Jnet  networking
software, you  can avoid  the need  for uuencoding. You can tell the Jnet
software to bypass the usual EBCDIC/ASCII conversion, but there are a few
additional steps needed before downloading a file.
* Receive the file with the Jnet command RECEIVE/BINARY. The BINARY
   modifier suppresses the normal EBCDIC/ASCII conversion. Let's assume
   that the file is called MYFILE.ARC. This file, as received, is almost
   correct; there may be an error is how VMS interprets the records.
* Generate an FDL file for MYFILE.ARC using:

   ANALYZE/RMS/FDL MYFILE.ARC

* Edit the FDL file with the command

   EDIT/FDL MYFILE

   Examine the CARIIAGE_CONTROL setting. Change it to NONE. Exit the
   editor.

* Use the edited FDL to correct carriage control interpretation errors in
   the original MYFILE.ARC:

   CONVERT/FDL=MYFILE.FDL  MYFILE.ARC  FIXED_MYFILE.ARC

* Download the FIXED_MYFILE.ARC as a binary file using any reliable
   means. (For VAX Kermit, use SET FILE TYPE BINARY command before
   starting the download.)


Puzzled?
--------
     We now  have an  online discussion list that gives assistance on the
server. To  join this  list, simply  send the following command to either
LISTSERV AT TREARN, or LISTSERV AT DB0FUB11:

                    SUB RED-UG Myfirstname Mylastname

Also, you  may get in touch with your local TRICKLE operator. You can get
his network address by using the /OPS command.

We wish you great benefits from using TRICKLE - we know that the software
it provides can accomplish that.
