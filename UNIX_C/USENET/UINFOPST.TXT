Many newsgroups contain articles which are posted on a periodic basis.
These articles tend to be useful for both novice and experienced
users, as they usually fall into one of these categories:

    1. How-to articles explaining some of the basics and fine
    points of network usage, etiquette, standards, etc.

    2. Introductory notes about one or more newsgroups, covering
    policies (if any) for submissions to that group, usage, etc.
    Common questions and answers pertinent to a newsgroup(s).

    3. Indexes of archives, or pointers to archives for various
    groups.  Periodic newsletters, calendars, pointers to
    publications.

    4. Statistical information and reports about Usenet; tables of
    Usenet hosts, links, etc.

    5. Miscellany, including small useful sources, "fun" lists, and so
    on.

This is a list of the periodic postings known at this time; each
posting is listed in an entry that includes who posts the article,
which newsgroup(s) it appears in, what "Subject" line is used, and how
often the article is posted.  The list is sorted by the "Newsgroups"
line.  The character 'X' is used as a wildcard, e.g. "vXXINF1" matches
"v01INF1", "v02INF1", etc.

Corrections and additions (via MAIL) are most welcome.
