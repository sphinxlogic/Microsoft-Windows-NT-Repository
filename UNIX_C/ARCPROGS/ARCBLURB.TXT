ARC is used to create and maintain file archives.  An archive is a
group of files collected together into one file in such a way that the
individual files may be recovered intact.

ARC is different from other archive and library utilities in that it
automatically compresses the files being archived, so that the
resulting archive takes up a minimum amount of space.

When ARC is used to add a file to an archive it analyzes the file to
determine which of four storage methods will result in the greatest
savings.  Since one of the four methods involves no compression at
all, the resulting archive entry will never be larger than the
original file.

ARC provides commands to perform the following functions:

    add files to archive
    move files to archive
    update files in archive
    refresh archive entries from disk
    delete files from archive
    extract files from archive
    run files from archive
    copy files from archive to standard output
    list files in archive
    verbose listing of files in archive
    test archive integrity
    convert entries to newer or different packing methods

ARC also provides options for the following:

    retain backup copy of archive
    suppress warning messages
    suppress notes and comments
    suppress compression
    archive encryption
