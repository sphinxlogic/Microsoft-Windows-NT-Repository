arch.tar
        A set of programs to let users archive and unarchive files to tape
        in a batch-like environment.  Runs under 4.xBSD, System V, Xenix.
        Contributor: Al Gaspar <garpar@almsa-1.arpa>
backup.tar
        A program to handle running backups.  It reads a configuration
        file to see what needs to be dumped, and then runs dump(8) to
        do it.  Handles multiple tapes, multiple dumps on one tape,
        labeling tapes to be sure the right tape is used, and multiple
        sets of dump tapes.  Understands how to use remote tape drives.
        It currently runs on 4.3BSD, Gould UTX/2.0, and SunOS 3.4.  It
        would take a LOT of work to make it run under System V unless
        your System V has Berkeley pseudo-ttys.

        first (see PD6:<UNIX-C.FILE-MGMT>COMPRESS.TAR), and supports
