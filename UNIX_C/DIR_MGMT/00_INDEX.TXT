access.tar
        A program which interprets file permissions.  It interprets them
        through the whole path and tells you in the end just exactly who
        can read, write, and execute the named file.  Described in Winter
        '85 USENIX Proceedings.

cls.tar
        A "compressed ls" which prints long file names differently so that
        they don't alter the columnar format as they do with Berkeley "ls".

dir.tar
        A two-column directory listing program.  Runs under Berkeley UNIX

lc.tar

        Contributor: Guy Middleton <gamiddleton@orchid.waterloo.edu>
lsarchiv.tar
        Produces a recursive listing of a directory tree, similar to
        "ls -lR" but with differences.  This one shows complete file name
        (full directory path), mode of file, number of links, and owner.
        The date is presented in the format yy/mm/dd hh:mm and is at the
        beginning of each line.  Extremely useful for archive (UUCP) sites.
        Needs ANSI compiler.

nmkdir.c
        A program like "mkdir", except given the path "a/b/c", it will
        create any missing directories in the path.  A recursive mkdir
        in other words.

sls.tar
        Sls is a program designed to overcome the limitations of the
        standard UNIX ls(1) program, providing a more consistent
        interface to file inode information.  It is particularly
        designed for use by shell scripts to make obtaining
        information about files easier.  It uses printf(3)-style format
        strings to control the sorting and output of file information.

vdd.tar
        Yet another visual directory tree browser.  Version 1.0.
