This message announces the availability of Scheme release scm4d3.

New in scm4d3 are:

	* scm.1 scm.doc (FEATURES): improved and updated manual page.
	* repl.c (BRACKETS_AS_PARENS): controls whether [ and ] are read
	as ( and ) in forms.
	* dynl.c (dld_stub): removed since dld is working better on Linux.
	* scm.h (SNAME): explicit cast added to get rid of compiler
	warnings.

	From: bh@anarres.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Brian Harvey)
	* repl.c (repl) output newlines when more than one form on a line
	for Borland C.

	From: rshouman@chpc.utexas.edu (Radey Shouman)
	* unif.c: More array fixes, functions, and documentation.
