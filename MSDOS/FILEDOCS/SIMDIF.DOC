Re:   SIMDIF.FOR

SIMDIF.FOR reads an old and a new SIMIBM.IDX and creates several
reports.  I tweaked my old Turbo PASCAL version and converted it to
FORTRAN (since my mainframe PASCAL doesn't have "strings").  It could
easily be converted to C, but I've got FORTRAN on more machines than I
do C.

The "SIMDIF" program creates five reports (one per file):

	add -- list of additions to the new index file
	chg -- list of changes (to such things as version, size, date
	       and description) between the old and new index files
	del -- list of deletions from the new index file
	ftp -- an "autoftp" reformating of the "add" report
	lst -- a short summary of the run

Note that I've allowed for 3-digit version numbers (you've reached 96,
I think) and 9,999,999 byte files.  If the format of the IDX file
changes, only parameter statements in each routine would need to be
changed -- no code would need to be modified.

[Well, almost no code....  If you change from "7" to some other
character to indicate the ASCII file type, you'll have to alter the
block data routine.  If you change from a 1-character flag, you'll
need to attack the code.]

On some systems, the line "subroutine blckda" may need to be changed
to "block data".  It appears that different FORTRANs want block data
defined in different ways.
