Re:   asmobj.zip on thumper

In response to several requests, I have created a ZIP archive of the .OBJ
files assembled from the .asm source files in NOS. Since the only use
I make of the Turbo C Professional package vs the regular version
is the assembler, this should allow those with only the regular Turbo C
compiler to rebuild NOS.

These files don't change very often, but if they do I'll try to remember
to update this archive. The file name is /pub/ka9q/nos/asmobj.zip on
thumper.bellcore.com.
