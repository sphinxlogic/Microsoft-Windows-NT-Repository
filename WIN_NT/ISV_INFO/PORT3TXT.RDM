paper which helps developers working with Windows 3.1 today, make
their code more ready for the first pre-release MicrosoftR WindowsTM
32-bit Software Development Kit, which will be available soon. This
paper is not a call to start creating 32-bit source code, but
rather a highlight of the changes that will benefit updating

later.
