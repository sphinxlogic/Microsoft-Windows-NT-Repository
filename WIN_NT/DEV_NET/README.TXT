Using the Microsoft Developer Network Technical Library


FILE FORMAT: All of the technical articles are in Windows 
Help file format and compressed using PKZIP.  Each sample 
code example is provided with all related file zipped 
together into a single packet.


FILE DESCRIPTIONS: To simplify our automated process of creating these 
files, each file is assigned a unique name, using a 
1, 2, 3, etc. numbering convention.  There files were created
for uploading to Compuserve and also have a Compuserve library
number prefix.  So in each directory the files are titled n-1.ZIP, 
n-2.ZIP, and so on (where n represents the Compuserve library section).
Each directory of the library has its own n-IDX.ZIP file.  Each directory's 
n-IDX.ZIP contains the complete abstracts for all the files along 
with the appropriate file name information to help you 
locate files to download.

NOTE - The index files were created for uploading to Compuserve.  They
reference a "library section number".  The contents of each Compuserve
library section have been placed in a seperate directory.  There is a
cross reference at the end of this readme file to convert library
section numbers to directory names.


HOW TO USE THE LIBRARY: 
1) Select the areas you are interested in and download the 
appropriate n-IDX.ZIP file from those directories.
2) Read the abstracts in the index file to determine which 
articles or sample code examples you would like to download.  The 
index file will contain the library section number and file name of 
all the files to help you locate items of interest.
