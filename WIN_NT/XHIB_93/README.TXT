The files on these two disks are in Microsoft Powerpoint 3.0 
format, zipped, and represent the presentations given 
during the Conference for Windows NT developers at Xhibition '93.

These files can be "unzip'd" using the commonly available 
MS-DOS based "pkunzip" program.  Unix or other system users can 
use the "info-zip" unzip program available most recently from 
comp.sources.misc (volume 31), archived on ftp.uu.net, to extract 
these files.

These files are also placed on ftp.uu.net in the 
vendor/microsoft/xhibition-slides subdirectory.

To view these slides, use PowerPoint or pptview.exe, also included in
slides2.zip.
