  The following files are preliminary versions of the
  Win32(tm) Application Programing Interface.  Microsoft
  is providing these files in preliminary form to give
  Windows developers a chance to review and understand
  the changes between the Windows 3.x API and the Win32
  API.  These files may be redistributed without fee
  in unmodified form subject to the copyright statement,
  which is the last topic in the help overview.
  
  The help files are provided in WinHelp form: Because 
  this file is almost 6MB, it is available here in pieces, 
  API32W.001 through .010. Download the files in pieces, 
  and also download COMBIN.BAT which will combine 
  the pieces to recreate the original file.
  
  If you are not a Windows 3.1 site and you wish to use
  the api32wh.hlp file, you will need  to download the 
  wh307c.zip file, and unpack it to re-create a version 
  of winhelp.exe which will read it. The Windows 3.1 
  WinHelp.exe programs should also read api32wh.hlp, and 
  the wh307c.zip version should read Windows 3.0 help files.

Here's the file listing:
  
WinHelp sections:    api32w.001, api32w.002, api32w.003, api32w.004,
                     api32w.005, api32w.006, api32w.007, api32w.008,
                     api32w.009, api32w.010
Batch file:          combin.bat
Replacement Winhelp: wh307c.zip
