You need to pkunzip -d basics.zip to get include files and libraries
plus other necessary code.  Build CLASSLIB and copy the resulting
LIBs to a LIB path before compiling any other chapters.

Be sure to use -d when decompressing other ZIPs, and you must have
MDI and SDI directories made for Patron, Schmoo, and CoSchmoo (and
a few others) to build.
