For those of your who can't wait...

This OLE2 beta will be included in the final Win32 SDK for Windows
NT 3.1, due with the final release of Windows NT. The final OLE2 SDK
for Windows NT made available after that, due Q3 93. This beta 
release requires the March '93 Win32 SDK.

You should read the relnotes.wri file first, being the release notes. 
These notes include the license, which you must concur with before 
proceeding further, the installation instructions, support 
details, bug reporting and other instructions.

We have split the approx 10Mb file into 9 pieces, to save some 
problems with less reliable communications lines.

The 9 files, nt-b1.1 , *.2, ... nt-b1.9 should be downloaded,
and concatenated, in order, to produce ntole2b1.zip. 
  e.g. copy /b nt-b1.? ntole2b1.zip
