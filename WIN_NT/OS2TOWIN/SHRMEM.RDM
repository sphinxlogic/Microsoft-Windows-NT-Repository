Shared memory dll and test/initialization routines.

This system manages shared memory on Windows NT, including provisions
for having the same virtual address space in different processes.

Services supported include: ShrAlloc, ShrFree, ShrLock, ShrUnlock,
    ShrName, and ShrGet.  The last two associate a string with a
    handle or get a handle based on a string.

This is intended to aid OS/2 programmers porting to Windows NT,
or anyone else using shared memory.
