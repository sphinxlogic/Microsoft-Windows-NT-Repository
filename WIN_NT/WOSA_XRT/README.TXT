This file describes the files available regarding the WOSA/XRT standard. 

July 8, 1993
WOSA/XRT stands for Windows Open Market Architecture/eXtensions for Real Time market data.  The WOSA/XRT standard is being designed by the Open Market Data Council for Windows and is intended to help standardize access real time stock market data and news using the Windows platform.

Note that at this time, the amount of information available regarding the WOSA/XRT effort is minimal.  Over the next 60 days we plan to rectify this.

If you have further questions regarding WOSA/XRT you can email 'wosaxrt@microsoft.com'.
