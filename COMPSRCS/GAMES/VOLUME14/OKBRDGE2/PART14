X  - The install option now uses 'strip' to reduce the size of the executable.
X  - The name of the install program is now a make variable.
X  - Entering practice mode when no one has a seat does not cause a crash.
X  - All players are removed from the spectator list when the last play is made.
X  - The convention card is not repeated twice when using /setcc.
X  - /opp messages are not repeated twice.
X  - OKtally can now compute total score by player.

X  - The /results display now highlights the record of the local player.
X  - Added a /scoreboard command for displaying the OKbridge scoreboard.
X  - The players who are credited for the play of a hand are those who were
X    sitting at the table when the bidding ended.
X  - Compiles without errors on the NeXT, 4.3 BSD Reno and some others.
X  - Altered the IMP scoring so that for each board it averages the IMPs.
X  - Displays the opening lead incorrectly in the log.
X  - Displays the names of the players in the play correctly in the log.
X  - "CLAIM OFFER DECLINED MESSAGE" is now displayed to declarer.
X  - Using the /DUP command when the GPS is not available will not cause

X  - The GPS is now always informed when a player leaves duplicate mode.
X  - Eliminated a bug which could allow a player to play the same card twice.
X  - Eliminated a bug in the GPS which caused a core dump if the player tries
X    to upload results of play at the wrong time.
X  - Corrected a bug in the supplied version of bcopy.
X  - Modified terminal.c to compile on systems which do not have TIOCGWINSZ.
X  - If a spectator redraws the screen during bidding, the player's cards are
X    displayed correctly.
X  - Does not allow doubles when a contract bid has not yet been made.
X  - Name changes are now recorded in the GPS.

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Okshuffle
Xcreates a set of unplayed shuffled boards for use with
X.IR okbridge (6).
XThe
X.I nboards  
Xparameter is the number of boards to shuffle.  If this is omitted,
Xthen 4 is assumed. Output is to stdout.
X.PP
X.I Oktally
Xmerges a number of boards that have already been played.
XIt reads each of the given files; if one of the file names is
X"-", then standard input is read instead.  It then merges the boards
Xfrom these files and totals the match points for each pair.  It writes
Xthe merged set of boards to standard output.  By default, the output
Xformat displays only the results of play for each board.
X.SH "OKSHUFFLE OPTIONS"
X.IP "\fB-dimr\fP"
XSpecifies a scoring mode respectively of duplicate, IMP, match point
Xor rubber scoring.
X.IP "\fB-n\fP \fIname\fP"
XSpecifies a brief (10 character) name which will be used for identifying
