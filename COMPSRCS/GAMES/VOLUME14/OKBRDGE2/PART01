[From the author:
The okbridge program is an interactive computer-mediated bridge game.
It allows four players at (not necessarily) different locations on the
internet to participate in a game of rubber or Chicago (duplicate)
bridge.  The program handles the dealing, scoring and communication of
bids and plays.  It is screen oriented, although the screen display is
rather simplistic.]

XMaking the okbridge program
X------ --- -------- -------
X
XThe okbridge program is distributed in a compressed tar file called
Xokbridge.tar.Z.  The following two commands can be used to uncompress
Xand untar the okbridge program:
X
X     uncompress okbridge.tar.Z
X     tar -xf okbridge.tar
X
XBefore compiling the program, you may want to edit the file Makefile.
XYou will have to decide where you would like the okbridge executable
Xto reside and you will also have to decide where you would like the
Xokbridge help file to reside.  The location of the executable is
Xspecified with the variable OKBRIDGE_DIR.  The location where the
Xhelp file will be stored is specified with the variable OKBRIDGE_HELPFILE.
X
XTo compile okbridge, you would then simply type 'make'.  To then
Xinstall the program, you should type 'make install'.  If you do not
Xplan to install the program in a public directory, then there is no
Xneed to type 'make install'.

XOPTIONS
X     position
X          A position-dependent parameter which specifies the seat
X          (north,  south,  east  or  west) which the local player
X          wishes to occupy.  The position should be specified  as
X          the  first  letter  of the name of the seat (n, s, e or
X          w).
X
X     name A position-dependent parameter which specifies the name
X          by  which  the local player would like to be identified
X          to other bridge players.  This name may be up to  eight
X          characters long.  If it is omitted, then the login name
X          is used.
X
X     server
X          A  position-dependent  parameter  which  specifies  the
X          Internet  name  or number where the server will be run-
X          ning.  If the local player wishes  to  be  the  server,
X          then the word "me" may be used as the server name.
X
X     -d, -i, -m, -R
X          Indicate  that  the  playing  and  scoring  conventions
X          respectively  for Duplicate, IMP, Match point or Rubber
X          bridge  should  be  used.  These  parameters  are  only
X          relevant  for  the  player who is the server.  In other
X          words, the server makes the decision for everyone about
X          the  scoring  convention  that  will  be used.  If this
X          parameter is omitted, then the playing and scoring con-
X          ventions  will  default to those of rubber bridge.  The
X          -R parameter is suppplied for the  sake  of  overriding
X          any default which may appear in the .okbridgerc file.
X
X     -p portno
X          Specifies the port number which will be used for estab-
X          lishing the network connections.  It is only in unusual
X          circumstances that this parameter need be specified.
X
X     -G   Specifies that the Global Player Service  (GPS)  should
X          not  be  contacted.  See below for a description of the
X          Global Player Service.

X          of  duplicate  deals  which  should be played.  This is
X          equivalent to the LOAD command in the .okbridgerc file.
X          See the description of email duplicate bridge below.
X
X     -L logfile
X          Specifies the name of the file to which the results  of
X          play  will  be  written.  This is equivalent to the LOG
X          command in the .okbridgerc file.
X
X     -z# [zhang-logfile]
X          Specifes an alternate log file which will  be  recorded
X          in the format developed by Shangyou Zhang.  The charac-
X          ter '#' should be replaced by a table number.   If  the
X          name  of the file is omitted, then the name "okb_#_rec"
X          will be used.
X
X     -pn, -pe, -ps, -pw
X          A position-independent  parameter  for  specifying  the
X          player's position.
X
X     -n player-name
X          A position-independent  parameter  for  specifying  the
X          player's name.
X
X     -s server-name
X          A position-independent  parameter  for  specifying  the
X          location of the server.  If the server-name is given as
X          "me", then the local player will be the server.
X
XPLAYING
XThe Okbridge Milieu
X     Okbridge allows people to play  bridge  together  using  the
X     Internet.   It  is  a  distributed program, which means that
X     each player runs a separate instance  of  the  program,  and
X     these  instances  communicate  with  each  other through the
X     Internet to cooperatively provide the illusion of  a  bridge
X     game.
X
X     At any  given  moment,  there  may  be  many  bridge  tables
X     currently  open, with players at these tables playing bridge
X     together.  Each table allows  four  people  to  play  bridge
X     together.   There  may be a number of additional people at a
X     table who are observing the play.  Each table  has  a  host,
X     who  is  called the server.  While the server is hosting the
X     table, the table is said to be  open.   The  server  can  be
X     either  observing  or playing.  A player who is not a server
X     is said to be a client.
X
X     A list of currently open bridge tables is  maintained  in  a
X     worldwide  database  called the Global Player Service (GPS).
X     When a new player starts the okbridge program,  the  GPS  is
X     contacted  and  the  list of currently open bridge tables is

X
X     displayed.  The player then has a choice of  either  joining
X     one of the currently open tables or hosting a new table.
X
X     When four players have joined  a  table,  they  must  choose
X     seats  before  they  can  begin play.  The seats are labeled
X     north, south, east and west, and a player chooses a seat  by
X     using  one  of  the commands: /NORTH, /SOUTH, /EAST or /WEST
X     (see the list of commands  below).   Also,  the  server  may
X     choose  one  of several scoring modes (see below).  Play can
X     begin once the seats are all occupied.
X
X     In addition to playing bridge together,  the  players  at  a
X     table may talk with each other and find out a limited amount
X     of information about each other (see  the  /WHO  and  /WHOIS
X     commands below).  There are a number of options for control-
X     ling the format of the display  and  input,  see  e.g.,  the
X     /BELL,  /DEFAULT,  /FORMAL,  /PROMPT,  and  /SPEC  commands.
X     Okbridge provides for very elementary convention cards  (see
X     the  /CC  and  /CCDEF  commands below), and it provides some
X     support for duplicate play (also discussed below).
X
X
XInvoking the okbridge Program
X     Usually, it is sufficient to start okbridge simply by typing
X     one of the following two commands:
X
X     okbridge
X
X     okbridge -n your-name
X
X     This will contact the Global Player Service for  a  list  of
X     the  currently playing tables.  The /JOIN (or /CONNECT) com-
X     mand can the be used to join an open table,  or  the  /SERVE
X     command can be used to begin serving a new table.
X
X     However, if a game has been arranged in advance, then it  is
X     possible  to  specify  explicitly the name of the server and
X     the seat arrangement.  Suppose that the names of the players
X     are  Alex,  Bob,  Cathy and Dot.  Alex and Cathy will be one
X     team, while Bob and Dot will be the other.  They decide that
X     Alex  will  be  north,  and Bob will be east.  Further, they
X     decide that Bob will be the server.  Here is a list  of  the
X     commands  that each might use to invoke the okbridge program
X     on their respective (hypothetical) machines:
X
X      Name    Position  Machine         Command to invoke okbridge
X      ----    --------  -------         --------------------------
X      Alex    north     a.alaska.edu    okbridge n Alex b.berkeley.edu
X      Bob     east      b.berkeley.edu  okbridge e Bob me
X      Cathy   south     c.florida.edu   okbridge s Cathy b.berkeley.edu
X      Dot     west      d.maine.edu     okbridge w Dot b.berkeley.edu

X
X
X
X     The server (in this case, Bob) should initiate his  copy  of
X     the  program  first.   When  a client starts her copy of the
X     program, an initial display will be presented and  the  pro-
X     gram  will  attempt to establish a connection to the server.
X     During this time, the keyboard will be unresponsive.  If the
X     client  is  unable  to establish the connection within 15-30
X     seconds, then it will give up and display an error  message.
X     After  the connection is established, the program will enter
X     a talk mode where messages can be exchanged with  the  other
X     players.
X
X     When the server deals the first hand, each  player's  screen
X     will  be  redrawn,  showing  his  or her cards.  The program
X     prompts each player for bids and broadcasts the bids to  the
X     other  players.  After the bidding is complete, playing mode
X     is entered.  The screen is redrawn in preparation for  play.
X     Again,  the program prompts each player for plays and broad-
X     casts the plays to the others.  After the  playing  is  com-
X     plete,  a  review  of  the  hand  is presented to all of the
X     players and the scores are updated.  During this  time,  the
X     players  may freely discuss the hand.  Pressing RETURN twice
X     in succession proceeds to the next hand.  The  program  con-
X     tinues  in  this cycle indefinitely until a player leaves or
X     until the server gives instructions which alter the behavior
X     of the program.
X
X     Other clients may join the table at any time.  A client  who
X     joins  while  a  hand is in progress will be able to observe
X     the play and so the client is said to be an  observer.   The
X     observer  may  choose  to  see  the  cards of the players by
X     becoming a spectator (see the /SPEC command below).  Specta-
X     tors are not allowed to talk to the players, though.  If one
X     of the players vacates his or her position, then an observer
X     may take the position.
X
X
XThe Display and Entering Input
X     Here we give an example of the screen  display  during  bid-
X     ding.  The numbers in the left column do not actually appear
X     on the screen -- they are given for reference purposes only.

X     In the upper right corner of the  screen  (lines  1-6),  the
X     scores  are  displayed.   The number of tricks taken by each
X     side is displayed on line 3.  The points above and below the
X     line  for  each side are displayed on lines 5 and 6, respec-
X     tively.  And an indication of which sides are vulnerable  is
X     displayed  on  line  4.   It has been pointed out to me that
X     during ordinary bridge play, the scores are  only  available
X     to  the players between hands and not during the bidding and
X     playing.  I apologize  that  the  okbridge  program  is  not
X     faithful to the real game in this respect.
X
X     At the beginning of line 2, we can  see  that  this  is  the
X     first  hand  being  played  at  that  so far 42 seconds have
X     elapsed in the play of the hand.  On line 3, we can see that
X     it is now Cathy's turn to bid.  On lines 5-9, we can see the
X     bids that have been made up  to  this  point.   The  display
X     shows  that  Alex  has  bid  1  spade, while Bob has passed.
X     Cathy's cards are displayed to the right of  this  table  of
X     bids.
X
X     Line 16 is the place where the local player's input  to  the
X     program  is  entered.  The word `BID' at the lefthand margin
X     is printed by the program and indicates that the program  is
X     expecting  Cathy  to type her bid.  The characters `2s' were
X     entered by Cathy, and they indicate that she intends to  bid
X     2  Spades.   At  the time this screen was copied, the cursor
X     was located just to the right of the letter `s' in `2s'.  If
X     Cathy now presses the return key, then the bid 2 Spades will
X     be transmitted to the other players.
X
X     Line 17 is the line where the local player may type messages
X     which  will  be  transmitted to the other players.  When the
X     cursor is on line 17, any input that the user types will  be
X     transmitted  to  the  other players as a conversational mes-
X     sage.  The user may switch between playing  and  talking  by
X     pressing the tab key.

X
X
X     Lines 20 through 24 display messages from  the  program  and
X     from  other  players.   Each message is of the form `source:
X     text', where `source' is either MODERATOR or the name of one
X     of  the  players.  Messages from the MODERATOR give informa-
X     tion about the internal state of the program.
X
X     When entering input, the  backspace  and  delete  keys  will
X     erase  the  last character typed.  The escape key erases the
X     entire input line.  And pressing control-R causes the entire
X     screen  to  be redrawn from scratch.  Always press return to
X     have your input transmitted to the other players.
X
X     There is a `default' input option embedded in the input pro-
X     cessor.   When  the  input  line  is  empty, pressing return
X     results in the display of a `default' input.  When  in  bid-
X     ding  mode,  the  default  input  is always `pass'.  When in
X     playing mode, the default input is the  lowest  ranked  card
X     which  follows  suit.   If  there are two or more suits from
X     which a card may be played, then no default is  made  avail-
X     able.   Pressing  return  a  second  time  (i.e.,  after the
X     default input has been displayed) causes the  default  input
X     to  be transmitted to the other players.  Sometimes in play-
X     ing mode there is only one legal input.  In this case,  this
X     input  is  displayed  automatically  --  you need only press
X     return to transmit it to the other players.
X
X     In addition, there are a number of control keys  which  have
X     been programmed to provide abbreviations for commands:
X
X      ^A   Alerts partner's last bid.
X      ^B   When used during the play of a hand, the bidding is displayed
X           for review.
X      ^C   Quits the program.  (Confirmation is first requested.)
X      ^D   Toggles the default input mode.  See the /DEFAULT command.
X      ^G   Toggles the bell.  See the /BELL command.
X      ^P   Toggles the prompt.  See the /PROMPT command.
X      ^R   Refreshes the screen.
X      ^T   Switches between talking and playing.
X      ^U   Erases the current input.
X      ^W   Sends a wakeup signal to your partner.
X      ^X   Exits the program immediately (only if compiled in debug mode).
X
X      TAB  Switches between talking and playing (same as ^T).

XBidding
X     A contract bid is specified by  giving  the  level  and  the
X     trump  suit.   The level is given as an integer in the range
X     1-7, while the trump suits are of  course  clubs,  diamonds,
X     hearts,  spades and no trump. However, the name of the trump
X     suit is abbreviated to its initial letter.  Thus,  here  are
X     some examples of legal contract bids:

X
X     A redoubling bid is given by entering `redouble' or `XX'.
X
X     A bidder may alert his or her bid by typing  an  exclamation
X     point after the bid (e.g., 1c!).  This alert is broadcast to
X     the opponents but not to the partner of the alerting bidder.
X     Alternatively,  the  partner of the bidder may alert the bid
X     by using the /ALERT command or the control-A key.   See  the
X     /ALERT command below.
X
X
XPlaying
X     The name of a card is specified by giving its suit and  then
X     its  rank.   The  honor cards `ten', `jack', `queen', `king'
X     and `ace' are abbreviated respectively to T, J, Q, K and  A.
X     Thus, the cards in the deck are enumerated as
X
X         C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, CT, CJ, CQ, CK, CA
X         D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, DT, DJ, DQ, DK, DA
X         H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, HT, HJ, HQ, HK, HA
X         S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, ST, SJ, SQ, SK, SA
X
X     It is allowable to write the rank first and then  the  suit,
X     e.g., TC instead of CT.
X
X
XCommands
X     There are a number of special commands that are available in
X     the okbridge program.  These special commands are invoked by
X     entering at the beginning of a line a slash `/', the name of
X     the  command,  and perhaps some parameters.  Here is a brief
X     list of the available commands:
X
X
X     /ALERT
X          Alerts your partner's last bid.  If you are playing  in
X          FORMAL  mode,  the alert is displayed to your opponents
X          only.  Otherwise, the alert will be displayed to every-
X          one.  Same as ^A.
X
X
X     /AUTOPASS [ON|OFF]
X          During Practice mode, this command controls whether  or
X          not PASS bids are automatically supplied by the modera-
X          tor for absent players.  See the description  of  Prac-
X          tice mode below.

X     /BELL [ON|OFF]
X          By default, the okbridge program rings  the  terminal's
X          bell  whenever  it  requests  input from you.  However,
X          this can be disabled by typing /BELL OFF.  The state of

X     /CC [NS|EW|MY|BOTH]
X          Displays the convention card of the specified  team(s).
X          By   default,  displays  the  convention  card  of  the
X          opponents.
X
X
X     /CCDEF [<Convention Card Name>] [<Convention-Card>]
X          Stores or displays  a  named  convention  card  in  the
X          internal  database.   If  both  parameters are omitted,
X          then displays all of the named  convention  cards.   If
X          only the name of the convention card is specified, then
X          displays that convention card.  Otherwise, enters a new
X          definition for a named convention card.
X
X
X     /CLAIM [n]
X          This  command  claims  n  additional  tricks  for   the
X          declarer.   If  n is omitted, then all remaining tricks
X          are claimed.  If n  is  negative,  then  this  many  -n
X          tricks  are  conceded.   All  hands are revealed to the
X          defenders, and they are asked whether or not they agree
X          to  the  declarer's  request.   If both agree, then the
X          hand is ended early.  This command can be used only  by
X          the declarer.
X
X
X     /CLS Clears all of the messages from the talk  area  of  the

X
X
X     /DISCONNECT <player-name>
X          Closes the connection to  the  named  player.  <player-
X          name>  can  either be the name of a player (e.g., Worf)
X          or the name of a position (e.g., SOUTH).
X
X
X     /FORMAL [OFF|ON]
X          Specifies whether formal playing rules will be used  or
X          queries which playing rules are currently use.  In for-
X          mal play, talk  messages  are  displayed  only  to  the
X          opponents,  alerts  are not displayed to the partner of
X          the alerter, and the dummy is not  revealed  to  anyone
X          until the opening lead has been made.
X
X
X     /RESET
X          Resets the program to its initial state.
X
X
X     /SCORE RUBBER|DUPLICATE|MP|IMP|CLEAR
X          Selects a scoring mode.  If the selected  scoring  mode
X          is  different from the current scoring mode, then skips
X          the current hand.  Using '/SCORE CLEAR' will clear  the
X          scoreboard.
X
X
X     /SKIP [n]
X          Ends the current hand immediately, without recording  a
X          score for it.  If we are the server, then the parameter
X          n specifies the number of hands to skip (including  the
X          current  one).  This command is useful in case the con-
X          nection to one of the players is lost.

XThe Global Player Service
X     The  Global  Player  Service  is  a  worldwide  database  of
X     currently  playing bridge tables.  Using the GPS, it is pos-
X     sible to quickly locate other people wishing to play bridge.
X     The following commands are for accessing the GPS:
X
X
X     /TABLES
X          Lists the currently playing tables.
X
X
X     /JOIN [<name>]
X          Joins the table being served by <name>.  If  <name>  is
X          omitted,  then  the first table in the list provided by
X          the /TABLES command is joined.
X
X
X     /SERVE [<port-number>]
X          Begins serving a table.  The table will  be  advertised
X          to  the  GPS  automatically,  so that other players may
X          join.  If <port-number> is omitted, then 1729  will  be
X          chosen by default.
X
X
X     The Global Player Service also supports a form of  duplicate
X     play.   It  maintains  a  database of boards which have been
X     played by other foursomes.  These boards can  be  downloaded
X     and  played  again, and match point scores will then be com-
X     puted.  The following commands are relevant  to  GPS  dupli-
X     cate:
X
X
X     /DUP [MP|IMP|END]
X          Used by the server to initiate (or end)  GPS  duplicate
X          play.   The  MP  parameter  is  specified to play match
X          point boards, while the IMP parameter is given to  play
X          IMP boards.  The default is IMP play.  After each board
X          is downloaded and played, you will be able to  see  the
X          results of play by other foursomes.
X
X
X     /RESULTS [<results-file>]
X          Downloads all of the GPS duplicate  boards  which  have
X          been  played  by the local player.  The results of play
X          for each board are then displayed.   If  <results-file>
X          is  specified,  then the results are saved to the given
X          file in email duplicate format.  A more verbose  record
X          of  the play can then be produced with the oktally com-
X          mand.  WARNING:  If you play  often,  then  you  should
X          specify   the   <results-file>  and  examine  it  using
X          oktally.

X          players in match point play and in IMP play are listed.
X
X
X     In addition, there are the following GPS-related commands:
X
X
X     /PLAYERS [<name>]
X          Lists the names of all of the players currently at  the
X          table  served  by  <name>.   If <name> is omitted, then
X          lists all of the players at all tables.
X
X
X     /CONNECT <host_name> [<port_number>]
X          Connects to the table being served at <host_name>  with
X          port  <port_number>.  If <port_number> is omitted, then
X          1729 is assumed.
X
X
X     /PERISH
X          Disconnects from the GPS.  If we are serving  a  table,
X          this table is deleted from the GPS database.
X
X
X     /PUBLISH
X          Reconnects to the GPS.  If we are serving a table, this
X          table is re-advertised to the GPS.
X
X
XPartnership Practice Mode
X     The Practice mode is based on a suggestion of Alan Truscott.
X     In  this mode, two (or more) players may practice their bid-
X     ding.  The  moderator  (OKbridge)  supplies  PASS  bids  for
X     players  which  are absent.  After the hand has been bid, it
X     is revealed to all of the players.   The  players  may  then
X     discuss and play it.
X
X     To enter Practice mode, the server uses the command  '/PRAC-
X     TICE  ON'.   This will deal a new hand and allow the players
X     to bid it.  During the bidding, OKbridge will supply  "PASS"
X     bids for absent players.  Thus, if North-South is practicing
X     and East-West are absent, then a "PASS" will be supplied  by
X     OKbridge  automatically  each time it is East or West's turn
X     to bid.
X
X     This  is  usually  the  preferred  behavior.   However,  for
X     three-player  practice,  it  may  be preferable to allow the
X     third player to bid both hands for one side, say  East-West.
X     In this case, the server should use the '/AUTOPASS OFF' com-
X     mand.  This command will disable PASS bids from  being  sup-
X     plied  by  the moderator.  The third player can then bid for

X     revealed  to  each of the players.  The players will be able
X     to discuss the bidding together.  They can also play out the

X     early.   During Practice mode, any player may use the /CLAIM
X     command to specify the number of tricks to  be  claimed  for

XScoring
X     The following tables give a basic outline  of  how  okbridge
X     computes the scores.  It is partially derived from the docu-
X     mentation supplied with the bridge program written  by  Yuan
X     and Chu.
X
X     Trick Score (below the line)
X          If the contracting team succeeds in making  their  con-
X          tract,  then  the  base  score for the hand is computed
X          according to the following chart.
X
X            Spades or Hearts     30 per trick | If doubled:
X            Diamonds or Clubs    20 per trick |    multiply by 2
X            Notrump        40 for first trick | If redoubled:
X                 30 for each additional trick |    multiply by 4
X
X
X          For rubber bridge, the score is computed  according  to
X          the  number  of tricks bid.  For other scoring methods,
X          the score is computed according to how many tricks were
X          actually made.
X
X
X          In a doubled contract in rubber bridge, overtricks  are
X          scored  at  100  points  each if not vulnerable and 200
X          points each if vulnerable.  In a redoubled contract  in
X          rubber  bridge,  overtricks  are  scored at 200 and 400
X          respectively.
X
X
X          In rubber bridge, a game is scored  if  100  points  or
X          more  are accumulated below the line.  The scoring side
X          then becomes vulnerable and wins the rubber if they win

X     IMP scoring
X          The IMP (International Match Point) scoring  system  is
X          based  on comparing the results of play for exactly two
X          tables.  In this system,  the  difference  between  the
X          score  of  your  team and the other team who played the
X          same cards as you is computed and then converted  to  a
X          number of IMPs according to a table.

X          If more than two tables have played a board,  then  the
X          IMP score assigned to a team for the play of a board is
X          the average of all of the pairwise IMP scores.  If only
X          one  table  has  played  a  board,  then  the IMP score
X          assigned for the play of the board is determined  using
X          the  Mono  IMP  system  described by Gary Greene in the
X          May/June 1990 issue of Bridge Today.  Greene  describes
X          the Mono IMP system as follows:
X
X          "Mono-IMP scoring is based on an average expected score
X          for  each  side's  high-card-point  holding.  The table
X          below shows the average score that a  given  number  of
X          high-card  points will produce in the long run.  I have
X          compiled statistics from over 10000 hands from a lunch-
X          time  game  played  over  the last five years, and they
X          indicate that these values are  a  realistic  long-term
X          average."

X
X
X          The number of Mono-IMPs awarded is determined by taking
X          the  difference between the score actually made and the
X          predicted score as given in the above  table.   If  the
X          difference is less than 600 (in either direction), then
X          the number of Mono-IMPs awarded is equal to the differ-
X          ence  divided  by  50  and  rounded to the nearest half
X          point.  If the difference is greater than 600, then the
X          number of Mono_IMPs awarded is equal to 12 plus 1 point
X          for each 100 beyond 600, again rounded to  the  nearest
X          half point.
X
X
X     Match Point Scoring
X          The Match Point scoring system compares the results  of
X          many  tables of play.  A partnership receives one match
X          point for each pair who played the same hands  and  did
X          worse  than  them  and  a  half point for each pair who
X          scored exactly the  same.   In  OKbridge,  match  point
X          scores  are  normalized  to  lie  between 0 and 1.  The
X          number of match points which a team receives is divided
X          by  the  total  number of match points which could have
X          been won.  Thus, normalized match  points  represent  a
X          per  cent  ranking among the other teams who played the
X          board.  If a board has been played by only  one  table,
X          then  a  simulated  match point score is assigned.  The
X          simulated match point score is 1 if the Mono-IMP  score
X          is 1 or greater, 0 if the Mono-IMP score is -1 or less,
X          and 0.5 otherwise.
X
X
XPlaying Duplicate Bridge
X     In addition to  the  GPS  duplicate  mode  described  above,
X     okbridge allows boards to be read from and written to files.
X     These files can be  mailed  to  other  foursomes  for  play,
X     allowing for 'email duplicate' matches.
X
X     To begin email duplicate play, the server at the first table
X     uses  the  /SAVE  command to save a set of boards after they
X     have been played.  The /SAVE command creates a record of the
X     boards along with a complete record of how they were played.
X     This file can then be mailed to others for play.
X
X     To replay a set of boards which have been saved, the  server
X     uses  the  /LOAD command to load the boards.  This loads the
X     boards from the file  into  memory  and  immediately  begins
X     playing them.  After the boards have been played, the server
X     can /SAVE the boards back to a file.   This  will  save  the
X     previous results of play along with the new results.
X
X     Alternatively, a sequence of boards can be replayed by using
X     the  /REPLAY  command.   This  first causes the boards to be
X     read into the  program  for  play.   After  they  have  been

X
X     To create a unplayed set of shuffled boards, use the okshuf-
X     fle(6) program.  Also, to merge a number of boards that have
X     already been played, you can use the oktally(6) program. See
X     their man pages for more details.
X
X
XThe .okbridgerc initialization file
X     It is possible to store a number of default settings into  a
X     file which will be read at initialization.  When the program
X     starts, the current working directory is first searched  for
X     a  file  named ".okbridgerc".  If no file is found, then the
X     home directory is searched for the same file.  For an  exam-
X     ple  of  an .okbridgerc file, see the file in this distribu-
X     tion named "okbridgerc".  (Note that it is incorrectly named
X     --  to  be  read by the okbridge program, it should be named
X     ".okbridgerc").
X
X     After the ".okbridgerc"  file  is  read,  the  program  then
X     searches  for  a  file named ".okdefaults".  This file is of
X     the same format as the ".okbridgerc", and any settings  file
X     override  those  found  in  the  ".okbridgerc"  file.   When
X     okbridge terminates, it may rewrite the ".okdefaults"  file,
X     saving  any  settings which may have been changed during the
X     play of the program.
X
X
X     Each line in the ".okbridgerc" file is either a comment line
X     or  a  (field,  value)  pair.   Comment lines begin with the
X     pound sign '#' character.  Field, value  pairs  are  of  the
X     format:
X
X               <Field-name>  <value>
X
X     The fields which are currently recognized are as follows:
X
X
X     AUTOSAVE
X          This field specifies that the ".okdefaults" file should
X          be  rewritten  when okbridge terminates.  If this field
X          is not present, then the ".okdefaults" file will not be
X          changed.

X     BELL ON | OFF
X          When requesting input (a bid or a play), the terminal's
X          bell is rung by default.  However, this can be disabled

X          the '/BELL OFF' command.

X          each  trick.   This  allows  the dummy to see the cards
X          that are  played  as  they  are  played.   However,  if
X          'PROMPT  NO'  is  specified, then the dummy will not be

X     SCORING RUBBER | CHICAGO | DUPLICATE | EMAIL | IMP
X          This field is only relevant  if  the  local  player  is
X          north.   In this case, the SCORING field determines the
X          type of scoring that will be used  by  default  in  the
X          game.

X
X     SEAT NORTH | EAST | SOUTH | WEST
X          This field specifies the local player's  position.   If
X          both  the NAME field and the POSITION field are present
X          in the .okbridgerc startup file, then the corresponding
X          parameters  can  be  omitted  from the okbridge command

X     SERVER ME | internet-name-or-number
X          If the value of this field  is  'ME',  then  the  local
X          player will assume the role of server.  If the value of
X          this field is anything else, then it is interpreted  as
X          an  internet  name  or  number of the machine where the
X          server is running.

X
X     ZLOG filename
X          This command is similar to the LOG command, in that  it
X          opens  a file for recording play, but the format of the
X          file is more concise.
