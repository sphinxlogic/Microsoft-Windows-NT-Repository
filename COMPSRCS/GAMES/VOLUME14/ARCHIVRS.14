Additional:   PUCC does not itself archive the games, but it does run a
	mail server with which people who can not ftp are able to
	access the archives on ftp only sites.

	BITFTP provides a mail interface to the FTP portion
	of the IBM TCP/IP product ("FAL") running on the
	Princeton VM system, to allow BITNET/NetNorth/EARN users
	to ftp files from sites on the Internet.

	BITFTP currently accepts requests only via RFC822-format
	mail, IBM NOTE-format mail, PROFS-format messages, or
	files with no headers at all.  BITFTP currently returns
	the requested files as NETDATA-format files or as mail files
	containing UUENCODED data.  If you specify "UUENCODE" or
	"NETDATA" on your "FTP" command, BITFTP will attempt to
	use that format.  If you do not specify the format, BITFTP
	will attempt to select the appropriate format for your node.
	BITFTP attempts to send NETDATA-format files through the gateway
	from EARN into Janet via the NIFTP facility at Rutherford Lab.

	To use BITFTP, send mail containing your ftp commands to
	"BITFTP@PUCC".  The first command to BITFTP must be "FTP"
	or "HELP".

	The recommended syntax for ftp requests is:

	FTP hostname NETDATA    --or--    FTP hostname UUENCODE
	USER username password
	<other ftp subcommands>
	QUIT

	For more info, send a request with the word "HELP" as the
	first word of the mail message to the mail server.

     Suggested places to get additional information:
         /u3/archive/sources/LISTING
     LISTING contains the names of all the programs stored in the 
     archives, and the sizes.  Note: all archives have probably been 
     stored in compressed form, with 12 bit compression (for machines 
     that can't handle 16 bit).  All multiple file programs have been 
     stored in seperate directories, then compressed.
     
     More information about the files stored in a particular volume are 
     kept in files called LOGFILE. Such as:
         /u3/archive/sources/games/vol1/LOGFILE
     would be the one to get to examine the exact contents of volume 1
     of the games section.  Additional information from files:  sample command 
     to recover files:
         uucp aeras!/u3/archive/sources/games/vol1/LOGFILE /tmp/.
     Special note:  wild cards have been proven to not be reliable, so 
                    to assure success they are not recommened tools.
