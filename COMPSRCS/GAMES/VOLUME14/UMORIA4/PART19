XFirst, a general guideline for posters; when you post any question
Xrelated to playing or debugging the game, please give the version
Xnumber, which you can get during the game by pressing "v".
X
XThese are the questions in the Moria Frequently Asked Questions list.
XQuick answers to some questions are given in parentheses; more detailed
Xanswers are in the list which follows.
X
XThe answers below are separated by form feeds, so that in most news
Xreaders, you can get the answer you want without looking at the rest of
Xthe spoilers.  Each question is repeated before its answer, so you can
Xsearch for the questions.
X
XMany of the answers are only correct for Umoria versions (4.87 and 5.x);
XI don't know much about the other versions of Moria.
X
XPlease send any corrections or other suggested questions to me at
Xgrabiner@math.harvard.edu.
X
XThe most common questions, asked by both beginners and others:
X
XHow do I get the Moria sources/executables/documentation? 
X(FTP from ftp.cis.ksu.edu, or from kukulcan.berkeley.edu.)
X
XWhat does this item do?  (Answer is below with the spoilers.)
X
XWhy do most winning characters carry several copies of spell books?
X(In case one gets stolen or burned.)
X
XWhat does the (-2) in Chain Mail (-2) [14,+2] mean?  (It's a penalty to
Xhit, caused by the heavy armor.)
X
XHow do I use wizard mode, and what can I do in it?  (In 5.x, just type
Xcontrol-W.)
X
XNon-spoiler questions:
X
XHow does resistance work?  Are two items of resistance cumulative?  (Not
Xif both are worn items.)
X
XHow does speed work?  Do you get faster if you are already Very Fast and
Xget another speed item?  (Yes.)
X
XI'm playing Moria version V; how does that compare to the current version?
XIs it compatible?
X
XI think I've found a bug; what should I do?  (Report it with the version
Xnumber and system.)
X
XCommon spoiler requests:
X
XWhat are the special abilities of ego weapons?  Crowns?  Amulet of the
XMagi?  Cloak of Protection?
X
XHow much damage do spells and wands do?
X
XWhat does spell Y do?
X
XOn what level do you find X?  (Level 25 is best for gain stat potions.)
X
XHow do you kill an ancient multi-hued dragon?  (Usually, you don't.)
X
XHow do you kill an emperor lich?  (With speed and spells.)
X
XWhat is the grape jelly trick?  Does it work in Umoria 5.x?  (No.)
X
XQuestions related to the source code:
X
XI don't like haggling; can I change the source code to turn it off?
X
XHow do you create objects in wizard mode?
X
XHow do I get the Moria sources/executables/documentation? 
X
XThe following Umoria files are available by anonymous FTP from
Xkukulcan.berkeley.edu (IP address 128.32.121.190), or from
Xftp.cis.ksu.edu (IP address 129.130.10.80).  The kukulcan archive is no
Xlonger supported, but it is still listed here because it has some files
Xwhich are not available on KSU.
X
XKukulcan: /pub/wilson/umoria_5/[machine name]
XKSU: /pub/Games/Moria/[machine name]
XExecutables for the Amiga, Atari ST, IBM PC, and Mac; look at the README
Xfiles in these directories for more information.  Some of these files
Xmay need to be transferred in binary mode; type "binary" before
Xtransferring the files.  KSU has both color and monochrome executables
Xfor the IBM PC.
X
XKukulcan: /pub/wilson/umoria_5/um5.5.tar.Z
XKSU: /pub/Games/Moria/source/um5.5.tar.Z
XA compressed tar file containing the entire source, for use on any
Xsystem; if you have tar on your system, this is probably the file that
Xyou want.  (If you don't have compress, you can ftp it as well; it is
X/pub/wilson/compress.tar.)  This file must be transferred in binary
Xmode; type "binary" before getting the file.  Once you have the tar.Z
Xfile, type "zcat um5.5.tar.Z | tar xf -" to extract the files, and
Xread the README files for help in installing.
X
XKukulcan only: /pub/wilson/umoria_5/um5.5.shar
XA shar file containing the source.
X
XKukulcan only: /pub/wilson/umoria_5/umoria
XThe source distribution in plain text.  If you need just the
Xdocumentation, copy the files in the directory /pub/wilson/umoria_5/doc;
Xif you need the auxilliary files (help files, high scores), copy the
Xfiles in /pub/wilson/umoria_5/files.
X
XKSU only: /pub/Games/Moria/doc
XThe documentation for Moria 5.4, including the official documentation,
Xthe FAQ file, and a complete monster list.
X
XKSU only: /pub/Games/Moria/pc/color and /pc/mono
XThe auxilliary files are in these directories; you may need them if you
Xhave an executable without them.
X
XKukulcan: /pub/wilson/vms_moria (tar files and plain text)
XKSU: /pub/wilson/vms (tar files only)
XThe source distribution, in Pascal, for BOSS, and for VMS Moria 4.8 and
X5.0.  Umoria 5.x will also work on VMS machines.
X
XHow do I use wizard mode, and what can I do in it?  
X
XIn Umoria 5.x, anyone can use wizard mode by typing ^W.  However,
Xcharacters who play in wizard mode are permanently barred from the
Xscoreboard; wizard mode should be used only for debugging and
Xexperimenting.
X
XIn 4.87 on Unix systems, only the person who installed the game can use
Xwizard mode; if you are the installer, the passwords are in the source
Xfile constant.h.
X
XIn PC-Moria 4.8x, you need to know the passwords to use wizard mode, and
Xthe password will depend on who compiled your game.
X
X4.87 has both wizard and god modes; 5.x's wizard mode is equivalent to
Xthe old god mode.  The 4.87 wizard mode allows you to do only things
Xrelated to the game (cure all problems, teleport, identify).  The 5.x
Xwizard mode and 4.87 god mode allow you to test the program by editing
Xyour character, creating objects, deleting monsters, and similar things.
X
XIn wizard mode, ^H or DELETE will give you a list of the available
Xcommands.
X
XHow does resistance work?  Are two items of resistance cumulative?  
X
XResist heat/cold potions and spells give temporary resistance to heat or
Xcold.  All other resistance items give permanent resistance.  Two
Xpermanent resistances are not cumulative, and two temporary resistances
Xare cumulative only in duration.
X
XFire and cold do 1/3 damage if you have single resistance, 1/9 if you
Xhave double.
XAcid does 1/2 damage if you have any armor to corrode, 1/3 if you have
Xresistance but no armor, and 1/4 if you have resistance and armor.
XLightning does 1/3 damage if you have resistance.
XThere is no resistance against poison gas.
X
XHow does speed work?  Do you get faster if you are already Very Fast and
Xget another speed item?  
X
XVery Fast is the highest speed that can be displayed, but if you are
Xfortunate enough to find several speed items, you can get still faster.
XPermanent speed items (rings and boots) are cumulative, and temporary
Xspeed (potions, spells, and staffs) can add one more point to your
Xspeed.  Multiple uses of temporary speed are cumulative only in
Xduration.
X
XI'm playing Moria version V; how does that compare to the current version?
XIs it compatible?
X
XMoria versions:
X
XUmoria 5.5.0: This is the current version of Umoria.  It will accept
Xcharacters from all Umoria 5.x versions.
X
XUmoria 5.3.1/5.4.0: These are essentially identical to 5.5.0, and
Xcompatible with it, although 5.5.0 fixes a few bugs, and there have been
Xa few minor changes.
X
XUmoria 5.2.2/5.3.0: These are in good condition, and compatible with the
Xcurrent version.  One bug: don't rest more than 10,000 turns in place,
Xand leave the level if you start seeing lots of "Compacting monsters..."
Xmessages, or the game may lock up.
X
XUmoria 5.2.1: This is playable, but has no high scores file; you
Xprobably want to upgrade if possible.
X
XUmoria 5.1.0-5.2.0: These versions can be played, but are somewhat
Xbuggy.  If you run into an invisible, invincible monster which doesn't
Xmove or attack, get off the level.  If you can FTP the sources or
Xexecutables, you should upgrade.
X
XThe U is often omitted from the names of the following Umoria versions.
X
XUmoria 4.87/PC-Moria 4.87x: This version is based on the old VMS Moria.
XIt is relatively bug-free, but it doesn't have the features of the 5.x
Xversions, such as monster memory.  The save file format is incompatible
Xwith 5.x, and several people have failed in attempts to write a
Xconversion program.
X
XUmoria 4.85: A moderately buggy version, also based on VMS Moria.
X
XUmoria/PC-Moria 4.83: An extremely buggy version, based on VMS Moria.
XThis version is essentially unplayable (see invisible doesn't work,
Xstores all close after 32768 turns, etc.)
X
XThe following versions are not compatible with Umoria, and Umoria
Xspoiler files may not apply to them.  I don't know much about these
Xversions.
X
XUB Moria 5.0: Also known as VMS Moria 5.0, this is the current version
Xof VMS Moria.  It has more monsters, a Black Market, and other features.
X
XImoria 4.9: This is apparently a very good game, with new character
Xclasses and other features, but it hasn't been released outside of UW.
X
XAmiga Moria 3.0: Although this version was originally based on 4.85, it
Xhas many added monsters, features, and bugs (including items which make
Xyou virtually invincible).
X
XBOSS: This game changes the setting of Moria, but keeps many of the
Xitems.  It is based on VMS Moria 5.0.
X
XI think I've found a bug; what should I do?  
X
XWhen you are reporting a suspected bug, make sure to give the version
Xnumber and the system.  The bug report can be posted here or sent to me.
XIf you report a bug by Email, you may want to send a copy of the bug
Xreport to the author of Moria, wilson@toad.com.
X
XI'm not the official maintainer of the source code, but I am reasonably
Xfamiliar with it.  If you report a bug which has been fixed in the
Xcurrent version, I may be able to send you a patch, or at least tell you
Xthat you can fix the bug by upgrading.  If the bug hasn't been fixed, a
Xgood bug report may make it easy to fix.
X

XWand of Drain Life      50              75 [in 5.1.4 and later]
X
XIn 5.x only, a wand of wall building will do 4d8 damage to any creature
Xburied in the wall (except one that moves through walls), and will kill
Xany immobile creature.  On the creature's next turn, it will attempt to
Xmove out of the wall, and if it is unable to do so, it will take 10d8
Xdamage and dig its way out.
X
XEverything below is the same in all versions.
XWand of Light/Staff of  2d8 (if sensitive)
XStarlight               
XStone to Mud		100 (if sensitive)
XOrb of Draining         3d6 + caster's level, double to evil creatures
XDispel Undead/Evil      1-60 from scroll or staff; 1 up to triple
X                        caster's level from spell
XHoly Word               Dispel evil for 1 up to quadruple caster's level

Xfrom a wand, and 1 point more if cast by a mage.
XAll ball spells do full damage for a direct hit, half damage one space
Xaway, and 1/3 damage two spaces away.
X
XWhat does spell Y do?
X
XNon-obvious spell effects:
X
XMage spells:
X
XPhase Door: short-range teleport.
XFind Hidden Traps/Doors: also detects stairs.
XSleep I: sleep one monster in a given direction.
XRecharge Item I: fewer charges than Recharge Item II, and more likely to
X		 fail. 
XSleep II: sleep all monsters adjacent to player.
XSleep III: sleep all monsters with a line of sight to player (including
X	   invisible ones). 
XWord of Destruction: obliterates everything within 15 spaces of the
X		     player; Balrog will teleport to another level.
X
XPriest spells:
X
XBless: +2 to AC, and +5 to chance to hit (equivalent to +1-2/3 bonus on
X       weapon) for a short time.
XBlind Creature: blinded creatures wander around confused until they recover.
XPortal: medium-range teleport.
XChant: double duration Bless.
XSanctuary: sleep creatures adjacent to player.
XProtection from Evil: prevents any evil creature of the player's level
X		      or lower from attacking the player.
XEarthquake: causes random walls and ceilings in the area to collapse,
X	    possibly injuring anything nearby.
XTurn Undead: all undead of the player's level or lower, and some of
X	     higher level, will be temporarily confused.
XPrayer: quadruple duration Bless.
XDispel Undead/Evil: affects all undead/evil within line of sight (even
X		    invisble ones in 5.x versions), damage is from 1
X		    up to 3x player's level, 1-60 from scroll or staff.
XGlyph of Warding: creates a glyph which monsters cannot enter, but have 
X		  a small chance of breaking.
XHoly Word: heals player completely, cures poison and fear, and dispels
X	   evil for 1 to 4x player's level. 
X
XOn what level do you find X?  
X
XWhere important objects are found:
X
XIn 4.87, 1/20 of items are chosen as if you were on level 50.  In 5.1
Xand all later versions, 1/12 of items are chosen as if you were on a
Xdeeper level, which has (current level/50) chance of being level 50, and
Xis always level 1 in the town.
X
XItems become somewhat less common as you go deeper than the indicated
Xlevels; however, if you can survive down there, this is compensated for
Xby the fact that there are more treasures on deeper levels.
X
XItem type			Level
XEgo weapons, special armor,	Progressively more common as you get
Xboots, gloves, helmets		deeper, all the way to level 55

X
XHow do you kill an ancient multi-hued dragon?  
X
XUsually, you don't want to try; one gas breath from a full-strength AMHD
Xdoes 693 damage, with no resistance.
X
XIf you can get to speed 3 (one permanent speed item, and either another
Xpermanent speed item or a haste self spell or staff), you can try this
Xtechnique.  First, create (or find in a maze room) a wall with one open
Xspace on all four sides.
X
X   .
X  .#.
X   .
X
XStand on one side, with the dragon on the other side.  When the dragon
Xmoves adjacent to you, attack it once, and then hide behind the pillar.
XThe dragon can't see you, so it won't breathe, and will instead chase
Xyou to another side.  Now attack once, and hide again, and so on until
Xthe dragon is finished.
X
XHow do you kill an emperor lich?  
X
XYou can kill an emperor lich if you can get to speed 2, which is its
Xspeed.  A mage or ranger can do this with the spell of haste self;
Xanyone else needs a staff of speed, potion of haste self, or permanent
Xspeed item.  You will also need about 10 cure critical wounds or cure
Xserious wounds potions, and some item giving you free action.
X
XYou also need some ranged spell attack.  Liches take double damage from
Xlightning in 5.x versions, so the spell of lightning bolt or wand of
Xlightning balls is a good choice.  Rogues and warriors will need several
Xwands, with a total of about 30 charges to guarantee that they can kill
Xthe lich with them.  A priest or paladin has Orb of Draining, which is
Xeven better.
X
XNow, try to line up with the lich while you are not adjacent to it,
Xeither in a room or a corridor.  This gives you a chance to cast your
Xspell.  The lich will get one action.  If it cast a spell and you
Xresisted, or the spell didn't do anything harmful, you have another
Xchance.  If you were confused or blinded, drink a cure wounds potion;
Xthe lich isn't adjacent to you, so it can't hurt you.  If the lich moved
Xand is now adjacent to you, move back.  Try to avoid getting cornered,
Xand phase door or portal away if you are.  A priest can make this easier
Xby putting down a glyph of warding, but this must be done *before* the
Xlich chases you across the glyph.  (Don't stand on the glyph; it isn't
Xfoolproof.)
X
XIf you run low on mana and don't have a wand, teleport out and come back
Xlater to finish the job.
X
XA priest with glyph of warding can also set up the following
Xconfiguration (the exact length doesn't matter as long as you are within
Xspell range):
X
X#L#####
X#^^...@
X#######
X
XThe lich cannot cast spells from this position, because it cannot see
Xyou.  As long as it doesn't break the glyphs, you are safe, and can fire
XOrb of Draining down the corridor; the lich will take some damage each
Xtime.  If the lich breaks either glyph, run or teleport out, and
Xcontinue the battle elsewhere.
X
XI do not advise trying this technique against an AMHD; it will probably
Xbreak a glyph before the battle is over, and if your teleport spell
Xfails, or if you haven't hasted yourself, the AMHD gets a chance to
Xbreathe.
X
XAn emperor lich has 1520 hit points, plus anything additional that it
Xgains by draining mana (6 points per mana point drained) and charges (40
Xpoints per charge).  Never let it attack you in melee, because it can
Xdestroy your wands, healing itself in the process, as well as draining
Xyour experience and dexterity.
X
XIf you can get to speed 3, faster than the lich, it is easy to kill;
Xjust fight, move back, fight, move back, and so on.  You will still need
Xa lot of cure wounds potions, unless you let it chase you around a
Xpillar, as in the AMHD technique.
X
XWhat is the grape jelly trick?  Does it work in Umoria 5.x?  
X
XThe Grape Jelly trick is a spoiler/workaround/trick which is no longer
Xnecessary in 5.1 and later versions.  
X
XIn 4.87, when your intelligence and constitution changed, your mana and
Xhit points did not change.  Thus, in order to get the benefit of the
Xincreased values, you have to let a grape jelly (or other creature, but
Xgrape jellies are otherwise harmless) drain you to a low level, and then
Xdrink restore life levels potions to go back up with the increased
Xstats.
X
XI don't like haggling; can I change the source code to turn it off?
X
XIf you have the source code for any 5.x version, you can turn off
Xhaggling with a simple change.  Here is the change you would need to make.
X(Note: This is *not* an official patch.)
X
XIn the source file store1.c, this is the routine for determining whether
Xyou need to haggle.  You can change the function, or simply change the
Xreturn(flagnoneed) to return(TRUE) to eliminate all haggling.
X
Xint noneedtobargain(store_num, minprice)
Xint store_num;
Xint32 minprice;
X{
X  register int flagnoneed;
X  register store_type *s_ptr;
X
X  s_ptr = &store[store_num];
X  flagnoneed = ((s_ptr->good_buy == MAX_SHORT)
X		|| ((s_ptr->good_buy > 3 * s_ptr->bad_buy + 20) &&
X		    (minprice < 1000)));
X
X  return (flagnoneed);
X}
X
XHow do you create objects in wizard mode?
X
XYou will need the source; if you have only executables, get the source
Xfiles constant.h and treasure.c from kukulcan.berkeley.edu, which
Xcontain the necessary definitions.  This is an explanation of some of
Xthe parameters.
X
XTval: This is defined in constant.h; it is the value for the item type.
XFor example, TV_WAND is 65.
X
XTchar: The character used to represent this object; it should usually be
Xproper for the item type.
X
XSubval: This identifies the specific item.  If you are duplicating an
Xitem from the item list, use the same subval (and tval) as that item;
Xotherwise, don't.  Use subvals 0-63 for items that shouldn't stack,
X64-127 for items that should always stack (potions and scrolls), 193 or
Xmore for items that are generated in a group, and should stack as that
Xgroup (arrows).
X
XWeight: In tenths of a pound.
X
XP1: Used for all special bonuses which don't appear elsewhere:
Xbonus to stats/searching/stealth/speed, which stat to sustain (warning:
Xconstitution is 4 and dexterity 5), tunneling value, food value, light
Xvalue of a lamp, torch, or flask of oil.  For missiles, different values
Xof P1 distinguish different groups of missiles; use small negative
Xnumbers if you create groups as a wizard.
X
XFlags: A hexadecimal number which contains:
Xfor wearable items, all special effects (bits beginning with TR_ in
Xconstant.h).
Xfor chests, trap flags (CH_ bits in constant.h) and treasure flags (CM_
Xbits in constant.h).  The CM_WIN flag is cleared when you open a chest,
Xso you can't create a chest with that bit set in order to get an instant
Xwin.
Xfor potions/scrolls/staffs/wands, the effects of using the item (see the
Xitems in treasure.c).  Many potions have multiple effects (cure light
Xwounds also cures blindness). 
Xfor books, which spells are in the book (spell 1 is the units bit).
X
XLevel: Level on which the item would be found.  This affects the
Xdifficulty of using wands and staffs.
X
XThe object will have no name, except for the inscription {wizard item},
Xand possibly a type name, such as "Potion of"; you can change the
Xinscription.

X               hard, therefore hard to dig through, and contains  no  valu-
X               able  metals.   Magma  and Quartz veins are softer and some-
X               times bear valuable metals and gems, shown as a `$' or a `*'
X               character.   You  can tell if the metal or gems are embedded
X               into the wall by trying to move onto  them.   If  you  can't
X               move  over  them,  you'll have to dig them out.  There is an
X               option which causes magma and quartz to  be  displayed  dif-
X               ferently than other rock types.
X
X               Tunneling can be VERY difficult by hand, so when you dig  be
X               sure  to  wield  either a shovel or a pick.  Magical shovels
X               and picks can be found which allow the wielder to  dig  much
X               faster than normal, and a good strength also helps.
X
X               Tunneling can have a count.
X
X          V  - View scoreboard.
X               This command will display the contents of the score board on
X               the  screen.   On  a multiuser system, typing `V' again will
X               show only those scores from the score board that are yours.
X
X          a <Dir> - Aim a wand. {z - zap}
X               Wands must be aimed in a direction to be  used.   Wands  are
X               magical  devices and therefore use the Magical Devices abil-
X               ity of the  player.   They  will  either  affect  the  first
X               object/creature  encountered,  or affect anything in a given
X               direction, depending upon the wand.  An obstruction such  as
X               door  or wall will generally stop the effects of a wand from
X               traveling further.
X
X          b  - Browse a book. {P - peruse}
X               You can only read a book if you are of its realm.  Therefore
X               a  magic  user could read a magic book, but not a holy book.
X               Warriors will not be able to read either kind of book.  When
X               the  browse  command  is  used, all of the spells or prayers
X               contained therein are displayed, along with information such
X               as  their level, the amount of mana used up in casting them,
X               and whether or not you know the spell or prayer.  There  are
X               a total of 31 different magical spells in four books, and 31
X               different prayers in four books.
X
X          c <Dir> - Close a door.
X               Nonintelligent and certain other creatures will not be  able
X               to  open  a  door.   Therefore  shutting doors can be a life
X               saver.  You must be adjacent to an open door, and you cannot
X               close broken doors.  Bashing a door open will break it.
X
X          d  - Drop an object from your inventory.
X               You can drop an object onto the floor beneath  you  if  that
X               floor  spot  does  not already contain an object.  Doors and
X               traps are considered objects in this  sense.   If  you  have
X               several  objects  of the same kind, you will be prompted for
X               dropping one or all of them.  It  is  possible  to  directly
X               drop things which you are wielding or wearing.

X
X          e  - Display a list of equipment being used.
X               Use the Equipment command  to  display  a  list  of  objects
X               currently  being  used by your character.  Each object has a
X               specific place where it is placed, and that only one  object
X               of each type may be used at any one time, excepting rings of
X               which two can be worn, one on each hand.
X
X          f <Dir> - Fire/Throw an object/use a missile weapon. {t - throw}
X               You may throw any object carried by your character.  Depend-
X               ing  upon  the  weight  of an object, it may travel across a
X               room or drop down beside you.  If you throw an  object  such
X               as an arrow, only one will be used at a time.
X
X               If you throw at a  creature,  your  chance  of  hitting  the
X               creature  is  determined by your pluses to hit, your ability
X               at throwing, and the  object's  pluses  to  hit.   Once  the
X               creature  is  hit,  the  object may or may not do any actual
X               damage to it.  Certain objects in the dungeon can  do  great
X               amounts  of  damage  when thrown, but it's for you to figure
X               out the obscure ones.  Oil flasks are considered to  be  lit
X               before  thrown,  therefore  they  will  do  fire damage to a
X               creature if they hit it.
X
X               To use a bow with arrows, simply wield the bow and throw the
X               arrows.   Extra  pluses  to damage and hitting are gained by
X               wielding the proper weapon and  throwing  the  corresponding
X               ammo.   A  heavy  crossbow  with  bolts  for  example,  is a
X               killer...
X
X          i  - Display a list of objects being carried.
X               This command displays a list of all objects  being  carried,
X               but  not currently in use.  You may carry up to 22 different
X               kinds of objects, not  including  those  in  your  equipment
X               list.   Depending upon your strength, you will be able carry
X               many identical objects before hitting your weight limit.
X
X          j <Dir> - Jam a door with an iron spike. {S - spike}
X               Most humanoid and many intelligent creatures can simply open
X               a closed door, and can eventually get through a locked door.
X               Therefore you may spike a door in order  to  jam  it.   Each
X               spike  used  on  a door will increase its strength, although
X               the more spikes you add, the  less  effect  each  additional
X               spike has.  It is very easy to jam a door so much as to make
X               it impossible for your character to bash it down,  so  spike
X               doors  wisely.   The bigger a creature is, the easier it can
X               bash a door down.  Therefore twenty or more spikes might  be
X               necessary  to slow down a dragon, where one spike would slow
X               down a kobold.  This command can be counted.
X
X          l <Dir> - Look in a direction. {x - examine}
X               The Look command is useful in identifying the exact type  of
X               object or creature shown on the screen.  Also, if a creature
X               is on top of an object, the look command will describe both.
X               You  can  see  creatures and objects up to 200 feet away (20

X               spaces).  You may freely use the Look  command  without  the
X               creatures getting a move on you.
X
X               Looking in a particular direction sees everything  within  a
X               cone  of  vision  which  just  overlaps the cones of the two
X               adjacent directions.  Looking with the  null  direction  `5'
X               (or `.') sees everything which there is to be seen.
X
X               You are also able to access your monster memories  with this
X               command.   If you see a creature, you are prompted to ask if
X               you wish to see a short paragraph of information about  your
X               experiences  with  that  creature.   See also the section on
X               being attacked.
X
X          m  - Cast a magic spell.
X               To cast a spell, a character must  have  previously  learned
X               it,  and must also have in the inventory a magical book from
X               which the spell may be read.  Each spell  has  a  chance  of
X               failure  which  starts  out  fairly large but decreases as a
X               character gains levels.  If a character does not have enough
X               mana,  the  chance  of  failure is greatly increased, and he
X               gambles on losing a point  of  constitution.   You  will  be
X               prompted for confirmation before trying to cast a spell when
X               you don't have enough mana.  Since a character must read the
X               spell from a book, he cannot be blind or confused when cast-
X               ing a spell, and there must be some light present.
X
X          o <Dir> - Open a door, chest, or lock.
X               To open an object such as a door or chest you must  use  the
X               Open  command.   If  the  object is locked, the Open command
X               will attempt to pick the lock,  based  on  your  ability  at
X               disarming.   If  an  object  is trapped and you open it, the
X               trap will be set off.  This command can be counted, you  may
X               need several tries to get it open.
X
X          p  - Read a prayer.
X               To pay  effectively,  a  character  must  have  learned  the
X               prayer, and must also have in the inventory a holy book from
X               which the prayer may be read.  Each prayer has a  chance  of
X               being ignored which starts out fairly large but decreases as
X               a character gains levels.  If  a  character  does  not  have
X               enough mana, the chance of failure is greatly increased, and
X               he gambles on losing a point of constitution.  You  will  be
X               prompted  for  confirmation  before  trying to pray when you
X               don't have enough mana.  Since a  character  must  read  the
X               prayer  from  a  book,  he  cannot be blind or confused when
X               praying, and there must be some light present.
X
X          q  - Quaff a potion.
X               To drink a potion use the Quaff command.  A  potion  affects
X               the player in some manner.  The effects of the potion may be
X               immediately noticed, or they may be subtle and unnoticed.
X
X          r  - Read a scroll.

X
X
X               To read a scroll use the Read command.  A scroll  spell  has
X               an  area  affect,  except  in  a  few cases such as identify
X               scrolls which act on other objects.  Two scrolls, the  iden-
X               tify  scroll  and the recharge scroll, have titles which can
X               be read without setting them off, and by pressing ESCAPE can
X               be saved for future use.
X
X          s  - Search general area one turn.
X               The Search command can be used to locate  hidden  traps  and
X               secret  doors  about the player.  More than a single turn of
X               searching will be required in most cases.  You should always
X               search  a  chest  before  trying to open it because they are
X               generally trapped.  This command can be  counted,  which  is
X               useful  if  you are really sure of finding something eventu-
X               ally.  A counted search ends as soon as anything is found.
X
X          t  - Take off a piece of equipment. {T}
X               Use the Take Off command to remove an object from  use,  and
X               return it to your inventory.  Occasionally you will run into
X               a cursed item which cannot be  removed.   Cursed  items  are
X               always  bad,  and  can  only be taken off after removing the
X               curse.
X
X          u  - Use a staff. {Z - Zap}
X               The Use command will activate a staff.  Like  scrolls,  most
X               staffs  have  an  area affect.  Because staffs are generally
X               more powerful than most other items, they are also harder to
X               use correctly.
X
X          v  - Display current version of game.
X               The Version command displays the  credits  for  the  current
X               version of moria.
X
X          w  - Wear or wield an item being carried.
X               To wear or wield  an  object  in  your  inventory,  use  the
X               Wear/Wield  command.  If an object is already in use for the
X               same  function,  it  is  automatically  removed  first.   An
X               object's  bonuses  cannot  be  gained  until  it  is worn or
X               wielded.
X
X          x  - Exchange primary and secondary weapons. {X}
X               A secondary weapon is any weapon which may be needed  often.
X               Instead of searching through your inventory, you may use the
X               exchange command to keep the weapon ready.  For instance, if
X               you  wanted  to  use your bow most of the time, but needed a
X               sword for close combat, you could wield your sword, use  the
X               exchange command to make it the secondary weapon, then wield
X               your bow.  If the sword was suddenly needed, simply use  the
X               exchange command to switch between the bow and the sword.
X
X          /  - Identify a character shown on screen.
X               Use the identify  command  to  find  out  what  a  character
X               displayed on the screen stands for.  For instance, by press-
X               ing `/.', you can find out that the `.' stands for  a  floor

X
X               spot.   When used with a creature, the identify command will
X               tell you only what class of creature the symbol stands  for,
X               not  the  specific  creature, therefore use the look command
X               for this information.
X
X               If you identify the character for a creature in your monster
X               memory,  you  are  also prompted to ask if you wish to see a
X               paragraph of information on those  creatures  identified  by
X               the given character.  Several creatures may be identified in
X               this  way.   Typing  ESCAPE  after  the  paragraph  for  any
X               creature  will  abort  back  to command level.  See also the
X               section on being attacked.
X
X          ?  - Display a list of commands.
X               The ? command displays a quick reference help  page  on  the
X               screen.
X
X          -  - Move without pickup.
X               This is followed by a move command, and causes you  to  move
X               over  any object without picking it up.  You can associate a
X               count with this command.
X
X          =  - Set options.
X               This is a free move, to  set  various  moria  options.   The
X               available options are:
X
X           (1) Cut known corners when running.  This is on by default,  and
X               the only reason for switching it off would be if you had the
X               search flag on and wished to look for doors in the extremity
X               of every corner.
X
X           (2) Examine potential corners  when  running.   This  is  on  by
X               default, and allows you to run along an unknown curving cor-
X               ridor.  If, however, you are running from  a  creature,  and
X               wish to stop at an unknown corner to make a considered deci-
X               sion, then you may wish to switch this option off.
X
X           (3) Print self during a run.  This  is  off  by  default,  which
X               gives faster screen updating.
X
X           (4) Stop when map sector changes.  This is off by  default,  but
X               can  be  switched  on if you wish to stop running whenever a
X               new part of the dungeon appears in view.
X
X           (5) Treat open doors as empty space while running.  This is  off
X               by  default,  in which case you stop when ever you run up to
X               an open door.
X
X           (6) Prompt to pick up objects.  This is off by default, in which
X               case  stepping  over  an  object automatically causes you to
X               pick it up.  With the option on, you  get  prompted  in  all
X               such  cases  with  a description of the object to see if you
X               really want to take it.

X               include the weight of all objects.  This may  be  useful  to
X               know if your pack is getting too heavy.
X
X           (9) Highlight mineral seams.  This is off by default.  Switching
X               it on causes quartz and magma to be displayed as `%' instead
X               of `#'.  This is handy when  mining.   Setting  this  option
X               does  not immediately highlight all minerals, but only those
X               which are subsequently displayed.  To display all  minerals,
X               just  move  the  map  around  a  bit  with  the  `Where' (or
X               `Locate') command.
X
X           (10)Beep for invalid character.  This is on  by  default.   When
X               on,  the program will beep for most invalid characters, such
X               as trying to choose a spell that you  haven't  learned  yet.
X               When off, there are no such beeps.
X
X           (11)Display rest/repeat counts.  This is on  by  default.   When
X               on,  the  program  will  progessively  display the remaining
X               turns left while resting, and for  repeated  commands.   For
X               those  trying to play over a 2400 bps or less connection, or
X               for those playing on very slow microcomputers, turning  this
X               off  will  make resting and repeated commands work much fas-
X               ter.
X
X               The setting of all these options persist in  your  savefile,
X               even after you die.
X
X          ^P  - Previous message.
X               The  Control-P  command  will  redisplay  the  last  message
X               printed  on  the  message line at the top of your screen.  A
X               second such command will display all of the saved  messages.
X               You may also give this command a count to specify the number
X               of previous messages to display.  At present, only  22  mes-
X               sages are saved.
X
X          ^K  - Quit the game without saving. {Q}
X               To exit the game without saving your  character  (i.e.  kill
X               him/her)  use  the  Control-K  command.  Once exited in this
X               manner, your character is nonrecoverable.
X
X          ^X  - Save your character and exit the game.
X               To save your game so that it can be restarted later, use the
X               Control-X command.  Save files will also be generated if the
X               game crashes due to a system error.  When you die, a reduced
X               save  file  is produced containing only your monster memory,
X               and your option settings.
X
X          {  - Inscribe an object.
X               This command can be used to inscribe any short string on  an

X
X
X               object.  Inscriptions are limited to twelve characters.  The
X               inscription applies only to the particular object, it is not
X               automatically  transferred  to  all  similar objects.  Under
X               certain circumstances, moria will itself  inscribe  objects:
X               if  they  have been discovered to be cursed or enchanted, or
X               if they have been sampled without being identified.  In this
X               last  case, moria does in fact carefully inscribe every such
X               item.
X
X          !  - Shell out of game.
X               Use the Shell command `!' to temporarily exit  the  game  to
X               execute UNIX or MSDOS commands.  You may reenter the game by
X               typing exit to end the spawned process.  This is not  imple-
X               mented in the Macintosh version.
X
X          <  - Go up an up staircase.
X               If you move onto an up staircase you may use the `<' command
X               to  go up one level.  There is always one staircase going up
X               on every level except for the town level (this does not mean
X               it's  easy  to find).  Going up a staircase will always take
X               you to a new dungeon area except for the town  level,  which
X               remains the same for the duration of your character.
X
X          >  - Go down a down staircase.
X               If you are on top of a down staircase you may  use  the  `>'
X               command to go down one level.  There are always two or three
X               staircases going down on each level, except the  town  level
X               which  has  only  one.  Going down will always take you to a
X               new dungeon area.
X
X          . <Dir> - Move in direction. {shift<Dir>}
X               The Run command will move you  in  the  indicated  direction
X               until either you have to make a choice as between two direc-
X               tions, or something interesting happens.  There are  options
X               which  determine  behaviour  at corners, and at screen boun-
X               daries.  More precisely, the conditions which stop a run are
X               as follows:
X
X          (1)  A creature appears on the screen, one already on the  screen
X               moves, or a creature attacks you or casts a spell at you.
X
X          (2)  You move next to an object, or a feature such as a  door  or
X               trap.
X
X          (3)  You come to the end of open space, or the end of a  passage,
X               or a junction of passages, or a hole in a wall.
X
X          (4)  Corners are more complex.  A corner allows a choice  between
X               adjacent  rectangular  and  diagonal directions.  If you can
X               see walls which ensure that  the  diagonal  gives  a  faster
X               traversal,  then  action  is determined by the "cut corners"
X               options.  If it is set, then you move diagonally through the
X               corner.  This gives you maximum speed (as is nice if you are
X               fleeing a hidden creature).  On the other hand, this  option

X
X
X               should not be set if you want more careful coverage (as when
X               you are searching) so that you take two  moves  through  the
X               corner.
X
X          (5)  At a potential corner, where walls are not yet visible ahead
X               of  the  rectangular direction, the "examine corners" option
X               is considered.  If set, you  will  move  straight  into  the
X               corner,  which will light up all the corner and so determine
X               where you can go from there.   This  allows  you  to  follow
X               corners  in  new  passages.   If  the option is not set, you
X               stop.  This allows highly cautious running where you want to
X               stop at all potential choice points.
X
X          (6)  If you move off the screen while running, then a new section
X               of  the  dungeon is display and the run continues.  However,
X               if the "stop when map changes" option is set, you will stop.
X               Again,  this  is  an  option for nervous players, after all,
X               there may be a dragon on the new screen.
X
X          (7)  Anything typed during a run causes the  run  to  stop.   The
X               character  causing  this to occur is ignored.  It is best to
X               use a space, which is ignored as a command, just in case the
X               run stops just before you type the character.
X
X          (8)  Various changes of state, such as recovery from fear or loss
X               of heroism, will stop a run.
X
X          6.  The Town Level
X
X          The town level is where you will begin your adventure.  The  town
X          consists  of six buildings each with an entrance, some towns peo-
X          ple, and a wall which surrounds the town.  The first time you are
X          in town it will be daytime, but you may return to find that dark-
X          ness has fallen.  (Note that some spells may act  differently  in
X          the town level.)
X
X
X          6.1.  Townspeople
X
X          The town contains many different kinds of people.  There are  the
X          street  urchins,  young  children  who will mob an adventurer for
X          money, and seem  to  come  out  of  the  woodwork  when  excited.
X          Blubbering  Idiots  are  a  constant  annoyance, but not harmful.
X          Public drunks wander about the town singing, and are of no threat
X          to anyone.  Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a likely victim
X          to mug.  And finally, what town would be complete without a swarm
X          of  half  drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just
X          for the fun of it.
X
X          Most of the towns people should be avoided by the largest  possi-
X          ble  distance  when  you wander from store to store.  Fights will
X          break out though, so be prepared.  Since your character  grew  up
X          in  this  world of intrigue, no experience is awarded for killing
X          on the town level.

X
X
X          6.2.  Supplies
X
X          Your character  will  begin  his  adventure  with  some  supplies
X          already  on  him.   Use  the  Inventory `i' command to check what
X          these supplies are.  It will be necessary to buy  other  supplies
X          before  continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to enter
X          each of the stores.
X
X
X          6.3.  Town Buildings
X
X          You may enter any of the stores, if they  are  open,  and  barter
X          with  the  owner  for  items you can afford.  When bartering, you
X          enter prices you will pay (or accept) for some object.   You  can
X          either enter the absolute amount, or precede a number with a plus
X          or minus sign to give a positive or negative  increment  on  your
X          previous  offer.   If  you  have previously given an increment or
X          decrement amount, you can just type RETURN, and the program  will
X          use the last increment amount that you typed.  But be warned that
X          the owners can easily be insulted, and may even throw you out for
X          a  while  if you insult them too often.  To enter a store, simply
X          move onto the entrance represented by the numbers 1 through 6.
X
X          If you consistently bargain well in a store, that is,  you  reach
X          the  final  offer  much more often than not, then the store owner
X          will eventually recognize that you are a superb haggler, and will
X          go  directly  to  the  final  offer instead of haggling with you.
X          Items which cost less than 10 gold pieces do not count,  as  hag-
X          gling well with these items is usually either very easy or almost
X          impossible.  Also, the store owner will always haggle  for  items
X          costing  more  than  1000  gold  pieces, because of the amount of
X          money involved.
X
X          Once inside a store, the  store  inventory  will  appear  on  the
X          screen  along  with a set of options for your character.  You may
X          browse the store's inventory if it takes more than  one  page  to
X          display,  and you may sell to, or purchase items from, his inven-
X          tory.  You can execute your inventory and equipment  commands  to
X          see  what  you  are carrying.  Not shown with the options are the
X          wear, take off, and exchange commands which will also  work,  but
X          were excluded to keep the options simple.
X
X          Stores do not always have  everything  in  stock.   As  the  game
X          progresses,  they  may  get new items so check from time to time.
X          Also, if you sell them an item, it may get  sold  to  a  customer
X          while  you  are adventuring, so don't always expect to be able to
X          get back everything you have sold.
X
X          Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items.  If an object
X          is  unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it.  Once
X          they have bought it they will immediately  identify  the  object.
X          If  it is a good object, they will add it to their inventory.  If
X          it was a bad bargain, they simply throw the item  away.   In  any
X          case,  you  may  receive some knowledge of the item if another is

X          encountered.
X
X          The General Store
X               The  General  Store  sells  foods,  drinks,  some  clothing,
X               torches,  lamps,  oil,  shovels,  picks, and spikes.  All of
X               these items, and some others, can be sold back to  the  Gen-
X               eral  store for money.  The entrance to the General Store is
X               a `1'.
X
X          The Armory
X               The Armory is where the  town's  armor  is  fashioned.   All
X               sorts  of  protective gear may be bought and sold here.  The
X               entrance to the Armory is a `2'.
X
X          The Weaponsmith's Shop
X               The Weaponsmith's Shop  is  where  the  town's  weapons  are
X               fashioned.   Hand  and  missile weapons may be purchased and
X               sold  here,  along  with  arrows,  bolts,  and  shots.   The
X               entrance to the Weaponsmith's is a `3'.
X
X          The Temple
X               The Temple deals in healing and restoration potions, as well
X               as bless scrolls, word of recall scrolls, some approved pri-
X               estly weapons, etc.  The entrance to the Temple is a `4'.
X
X          The Alchemy shop
X               The Alchemy Shop deals in all manner of potions and scrolls.
X               The entrance to the Alchemy Shop is a `5'.
X
X          The Magic User's Shop
X               The Magic User's Shop is  the  most  expensive  of  all  the
X               stores.  It deals in all sorts of rings, wands, amulets, and
X               staves.  The entrance to the Magic Shop is a `6'.
X
X
X          7.  Within The Dungeon
X
X          Once your character is  adequately  supplied  with  food,  light,
X          armor,  and  weapons,  he is ready to enter the dungeon.  Move on
X          top of the `>' symbol and use the down `>' command.  Your charac-
X          ter  enters  a  maze  of  interconnecting  staircases and finally
X          passes through a one-way door.  He is now on the first  level  of
X          the  dungeon  (50 feet), and must survive many horrible and chal-
X          lenging encounters to find the treasure lying about.
X
X          There are two sources for light once inside  the  dungeon.   Per-
X          manent  light which has been magically placed within rooms, and a
X          light source carried by the player.  If neither is  present,  the
X          character  will  be  unable to map or see any attackers.  Lack of
X          light will also affect searching, picking locks, and disarming.
