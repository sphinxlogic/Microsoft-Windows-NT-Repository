All of the individual parts of NetHack 3.1 have been posted now. They should
be available at most standard comp.sources.games archive sites. This is the
final list of ftp'able archive sites for a .tar.Z file of the entire
source tree. Thankyou to everyone who volunteered to put this up for ftp.

	[Note the change in ftp site for The Netherlands from "dnap" to "dnpap".]

		------

A compressed tar file of the entire NetHack 3.1 tree has been archived at
the following locations:

	### USA ###

(Illinois)	uxc.cso.uiuc.edu	pub/nethack-3.1.0.tar.Z
(Kentucky)	s.ecc.engr.uky.edu	/pub/uploads/nethack3.1/*
	* The archive on uky is organized by system architecture as a set of split
	tar files, so you don't have to get the architecture specific files for
	systems you don't want or need. This is also a temorary archive site for
	the initial flood of requests and will be deleting the nethack stuff
	around 2 Apr.
(Oregon)	ftp.world.net		~ftp/pub/games/nethack31.tar.Z
(Oregon) 	saab.cna.tek.com	/usr1/ftp/games-archive/nethack31.tar.Z
	* NOTE: For non-Tektronix hosts, there is uucp access only. Send email
	if you need specifics (phone number, login, etc.) or consult the
	periodic posting of the standard list of archivers of c.s.g.
(Virginia)	ftp.uu.net		~ftp/usenet/comp.sources.games/nethack31.tar.Z

	### AUSTRALIA ###

(Australia)	brolga.cc.uq.oz.au	~ftp/pub/games/nethack31.tar.Z
(Australia)	brolga.cc.uq.oz.au	~ftp/pub/games/nethack31.zoo
	* Please limit your access to the above site to between 6pm and 8am.
	* The .zoo file is about 20% smaller than the .tar.Z file (<2M).

	### EUROPE ###

(France)	ftp.inria.fr		~ftp/games/nethack31.tar.Z
	* Normal location, time of day and ftp etiquette rules apply.
(France)	irisa.irisa.fr		~ftp/pub/games/nethack31.tar.Z
(Germany) 	ftp.uni-erlangen.de	/pub/games/nethack31.tar.Z
(Germany)	ftp.uni-kl.de		/pub/unix/games/nethack31.tar.Z
(The Netherlands)	dnpap.et.tudelft.nl	/pub/Unix/Games/nethack31.tar.Z


* In about a week, linc.cis.upenn.edu will update their archives with split
tar files of 3.1 like the uky archive and binaries for selected architectures.

As always, the regular comp.sources.games archive sites will have copies
of what is posted (i.e. the 108 individual shar files).
