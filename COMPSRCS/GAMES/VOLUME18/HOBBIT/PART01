[From the author...]
[[This is a small shareware adventure game, as far as I know the first one to be
written entirely in MS-DOS, using BAT-files. If the game is started from
AUTOEXEC.BAT, it can be played at any time while in DOS. It has no memory-resident parts.]]

X
X                by Fredrik Ramsberg and Johan Berntsson
X
X
XThis is a small interactive adventure game for PC's using MS-DOS 5.0. The
Xgame is in fact, in its entirety, written in MS-DOS. After unpacking the 
Xgame in a directory of its own, this is what you have to do to be able to
Xplay it:
X
X               * Include the name of the directory in the PATH variable
X                 declaration in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.
X
X               * Type RESTART at a DOS prompt, or better yet, put it on the 
X                 last line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.
X
XAfter having done this, reboot the machine and the game will be available at
Xall times. Please note: You can interrupt gameplay at any time, to do
Xsomething else in DOS. As long as you don't turn off or reset the computer,
Xthe game will always be ready for continuation. If you have trouble running
Xthe game, make sure that you have DOS version 5.0 and that you have enough
Xmemory space reserved for environment variables. The space reserved can be
Xextended using the MS-DOS command "command /e:nnnnn".
X
X
X
X                                Story
X
XThis game is about what really happened to Bilbo Baggins on his famous
Xadventure. The story, in somewhat corrupt versions, has been told in a book -
XThe Hobbit by JRR Tolkien, and several computer games, among them Hobbit.
XYou play the part of Bilbo, and your goal is to journey to Smaug, the great
Xred dragon in the land beyond the river, and return with treasures. For an
Xassistant you have Thorin the dwarf and Gandalf the powerful wizard. They
Xwill do everything within their power to guide you and to help you. Well,
Xalmost everything, as long as they don't have to get into any trouble
Xthemselves. Or get wet, for that matter. Or cold.
X
XSample sentences that the parser will recognize:
X(Note that everything must be typed in lower case.)
X
X>take chest
X>show gandalf chest
X>show the chest to gandalf
X>drop the chest
X>inventory
X>i  (Short for inventory)
X>get the chest
X>ask gandalf about the spell
X>talk to thorin about chest
X>examine chest
X>x chest (Short for examine chest)
X>hint
X>clue
X>look
X>l (Short for look)
X>go east
X>e (Short for go east)
X>enter the chest
X>wait
X>restart
X>quit
X

X
XThis game is a shareware product. You are absolutely free to distribute it
Xto anyone, as long as you don't take a profit from it. However, anyone who
Xenjoys it and decides to keep it should pay a small fee to the authors. This
Xfee will encourage them to write more shareware programs in the future.
XAlso, paying the fee is helping to establish this form of distribution, as
Xother programmers may start using it if it works properly.
X
XThe shareware fee for this program is set to US $10. This may be sent in any
Xway you like to the address below. Thank you!
