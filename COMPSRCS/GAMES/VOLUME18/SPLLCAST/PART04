X.SH NAME
Xspellcast  \-  a game of duelling wizards
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B spellcast
X.I remotedisplay
X[
X.I remotedisplay ...
X]
X.PP
XOne game window will appear on the default display (determined
Xby the contents of the DISPLAY environment variable.) The second
Xwill appear on
X.I remotedisplay,
Xwhich should be either an internet host name or
Xa complete X display identifier (host:0.0, for example.) (If
Xjust a host name is given, display 0 and screen 0 are assumed.)
XIf more 
X.I remotedisplay
Xarguments are supplied, additional windows will appear on those
Xscreens, and you will have a game with three or more players.
X.PP
XAll other machines must add your machine to their X access lists,
Xusing
X.B xhost +.
X.PP
XThere is a maximum of seven
X.I remotedisplay
Xarguments -- ie, an eight-player game.
X.SH RESOURCES
XThe game makes use of two X resources:
X.PP
X.B spellcast*name: 
X.I namestring
X.br
XSets the name used for your wizard. If you do not set this resource,
Xthe game assigns the names "White", "Black", "Red", and so forth.
X.br
XBy default, each character is male. You can specify a gender by 
Xgiving a 
X.I namestring
Xof the form
X.br
X.in+4
X.I name:f
Xfor a female character,
X.br
X.I name:m 
Xfor a male,
X.br
X.I name:n
Xfor a character whose gender is ambiguous or not well-defined in
Xhuman terms, and
X.br
X.I name:x
Xfor a genderless character.
X.PP
X.B spellcast*font: 
X.I fontname
X.br
XThe font used for all text and labels in the game window. This should
Xnot be larger than about 12-point, or things will start to overflow their
Xboundaries.
X.SH INTRODUCTION
XThis is a game concerning the imaginary conflict between two or more
Xpowerful wizards in a duel of sorcery. The opponents perform magical
Xgestures with their hands to create their supernatural weapons --
Xspells. Some are so potent as to be able to blind a man, call forth
Xterrifying creatures, or even kill the unfortunate victim instantly.
XConsequently each wizard must rely on his own cunning to be able to
Xtime enough defensive spells to avoid the brunt of his adversary's
Xattack, yet force in sufficient offensive spells of his own to crack
Xthe magical armour of his opponent, and kill the wizard outright. The
Xinventor wishes to state that he has never been involved in a magical
Xduel but would be interested to discover how realistic the game is for
Xthose who have...
X.SH THE TURN
XIn a turn, each wizard can either gesture with his hands for part of a spell,
Xstab with his knife, or do nothing. They use both hands, and the hands
Xcan act either independently or in concert. Monsters
Xcannot make magical gestures but will obey their masters' commands
Xexactly -- although the identity of the master could change as a result
Xof enchantment. Since wizards are trained intelligent humans, they are
Xable to gesture and attack, using both hands independently or in
Xconjunction. Each monster, being an untrained, unintelligent biped,
Xattacks the same way every time and picks whichever victim its master
Xdecides. As a result, only wizards can gesture and cast spells.
XPlayers personally acquainted with monsters who wish to vouch for
Xtheir ability to cast spells are requested to keep quiet.
X.PP
XAfter choosing his or her gestures, each wizard must make a certain
Xnumber of decisions -- choosing targets for his spells, ordering his
Xmonsters to attack particular targets, deciding the effects of certain
Xspells, and so forth. After all players have chosen their gestures and 
Xmade any necessary decisions, the effects of all spells and attacks are 
Xresolved 
X.I simultaneously.
XThe next turn then begins.
X.SH THE GAME WINDOW
XThe 
X.I spellcast
Xwindow is divided into seven sections.
X.PP
X.B The text window
X.br
XThis is a large rectangle in the upper left side of the window.
XIt describes what happens in the duel, blow by blow. There is
Xa scroll bar on the left side of the text window. 
X.PP
X.B The gesture history list
X.br
XThis is several columns of small squares in the upper right side
Xof the window -- one pair of columns for each player. The player's
Xnames are listed at the tops of the columns.
X.PP
XEach column lists the recent gestures made by each player's
Xleft and right hands. The most recent gestures are at the bottom;
Xas more turns pass, the columns scroll upwards. Each square may
Xshow a spell-gesture, a knife stab, or no gesture (an empty square).
XThere may also be a 'disruption' icon, indicating that an 'anti-spell'
Xhas interrupted that wizard's gestures at that point, 
Xor a 'fog' icon, indicating
Xthat you could not see that gesture (because 
Xof blindness, for example.)
X.PP
XNote that everyone's columns in the history list do not necessarily
Xscroll at the same rate. If one player makes extra gestures (because
Xof a 'time-stop' or 'haste'), his column will scroll up extra spaces.
XDo not assume that gestures that appear to be lined up actually were
Xperformed at the same time.
X.PP
XYou also use the gesture history list to enter your gestures. At the
Xbeginning of each turn, the bottom (most recent) gestures in your
Xcolumn will be empty. (The bottom gestures in your opponent's
Xcolumn will be fogged, since you cannot see his gestures until you
Xboth finish choosing.) If you move the mouse into one of your 
Xbottom gesture squares, and hold down the left mouse button,
Xa pop-up menu will appear, listing the possible gestures with that
Xhand. When you have chosen gestures for both hands, press 
Xthe "End Move" button.
X.PP
X.B The status window
X.br
XThis is the small window just below the gesture columns. It lists
Xthe name and status of every living being in the arena. Your name is
Xat the top; your opponent's names are on successive lines. Names of 
Xmonsters are indented, and listed below the wizards who 
Xcontrol them. (Monsters who are uncontrolled are indented and 
Xlisted at the top of the status window -- this occurs mostly in 
Xthree-player game where a wizard has summoned a monster and
Xthen died.) There is a scroll bar on the window, in case you manage
Xto have more beings than will fit.
X.PP
XAfter each name is the number of hit points that being has left. 
XAfter that, there may be some letters indicating that certain spells
Xare in effect:
X.br
X.in+8
XI: invisible
X.br
XH: resistant to heat
X.br
XC: resistant to cold
X.br
XP: protection from evil
X.br
Xb: blind
X.br
Xd: diseased
X.br
Xp: poisoned
X.in-8
X.PP
X.B Speech window
X.br
XThis is a narrow window, one line tall, below the status window.
XAnything you type will appear here (the cursor need not be in the 
Xspeech window.) When you hit 
X.I Return,
Xthe message you have typed will appear in each player's text
Xwindow. 
X.PP
XThe common Emacs editing keys will work: 
X.I ctrl-F, ctrl-B, Delete, ctrl-A, ctrl-E, ctrl-K.
X.PP
X.B Spell List button
X.br
XThis is a button labelled "Spell List", underneath the text window.
XIf you press and hold the mouse button on this button, a pop-up
Xwindow will appear, listing all the spells and the gestures that
Xproduce them.
X.PP
XIf you use the left mouse button, the spell list will be sorted by
Xgesture. If you use the middle mouse button, the list will be sorted
Xalphabetically by spell name. If you use the right mouse button, the
Xlist will be sorted by the 
X.I reversed
Xgesture sequence -- all the spells that 
X.I end 
Xwith a clap, then all the spells that end with a digit, and so forth.
XThis is useful for looking up your opponent's gestures to see what
Xhe might be producing.
X.PP
X.B End Move / End Answers button
X.br
XThis is a button labelled "End Move", underneath the text window.
XYou should click it when you are finished entering your gestures at
Xthe start of the turn. If the button changes to read "Move ENDED",
Xthen you should wait for your opponent to finish entering his gestures.
X.PP
XWhen the last player presses the "End Move" button, the game will
Xdetermine which players need to make decisions (about spell targets
Xor other matters.) The decisions you need to make will be listed in
Xthe questions window below, and the "End Move" button will
Xchange to read "End Answers". When you are finished answering,
Xpress the button, and it will change to "Answers ENDED".
X.PP
XIf at any time the button reads "please wait...", then you have nothing
Xto do but wait. (This may be because there are no decisions you have
Xto make this turn, or because your opponent is taking an extra turn 
Xbecause of a 'time stop' or something similar.) When your opponent
Xis finished, he will click his "End" button and the game will proceed.
X.PP
XWhen the duel is over, this button will change to say "Quit". When all
Xplayers have pressed it, the windows will be removed and the program
Xwill exit.
X.PP
X.B Question window
X.br
XThis is the wide rectangle at the bottom of the screen. Whenever the
Xgame has decisions for you to make, it will put them in this window,
Xone per line. (There is a scroll bar, in case there are more questions
Xthan lines.) Move the cursor onto a question and hold down the mouse
Xbutton to get a pop-up menu listing the possible answers.
X.PP
XYou must have answers to all the questions before you click the "End
XAnswers" button. 
XIn some cases, there will be default answers already listed. You may
Xchange the answer or leave it alone. 
X.SH GAME TRANSCRIPTS
XAt the end of the game, in addition to his "Quit" button, 
Xthe player who started the game will see the question "Do
Xyou want to save a transcript of this game?" If he
Xanswers "yes" before hitting "Quit", the program will store
Xa text transcript of the game in a temporary directory (usually 
X.I /tmp,
Xunless your environment is configured otherwise.) This 
Xtranscript will show all gestures made by each player, as
Xwell as all the text of the game, as seen by an outside
Xobserver. Everything said by any of the players will also
Xbe in the transcript, including comments made after the
Xend of the game. The filename of the transcript will be
Xprinted on the standard output when all players have quit.
X.SH GESTURES
XSpells are created by sequences of gestures made with the hands.
XThere are five single-handed gestures: the fingers spread "F",
Xthe palm facing forward, "P", the snap "S", the wave "W" and the 
Xpointing digit
X"D". Some spells use two-handed gestures, which must be done
Xsimultaneously with both hands to be valid. The most common
Xtwo-handed gesture is the clap "(c", but the double digit "(d", double
Xwave "(w", and double snap "(s" are also used.
XThe other things which can be done with the hand are
Xthe non-gestures: the knife stab "k" and nothing " ". 
X.br
X(In the game, the gestures are represented by images of the hands in
Xthe various positions. The single-letter and parenthesis-letter 
Xabbreviations are used only to make this man page readable.)
X.PP
XTo cast a spell,
Xgestures are put in an order characteristic of a spell. A list of
Xspells (including the gestures needed for them) is given later.
XFor example, 3 finger gestures on consecutive turns (F-F-F)
Xinitiates a 'paralysis' spell. The uniqueness of the game, however, is
Xthat gestures can be made to operate in more than one spell, provided
Xthat:
X.br
X.in+4
Xa) the gestures have been made in the correct sequence without
Xinterruption;
X.br
Xb) not more than one spell is created per gesture;
X.br.
Xc) all gestures for one spell are made with the same hand. 
X.in-4
X.PP
XFor instance,
Xthe left hand could cast the F-F-F above and could be followed by
XS-S-D-D in the next 4 turns to finish off a 'fireball' spell
X(F-S-S-D-D) as the last 5 gestures are those associated with that
Xspell. Another alternative is to simply perform another F for a second
Xparalysis spell, as the last 3 gestures are still F-F-F. Thus, it is
Xapparent that if spells are used in a wise manner and overlap a lot,
Xthe overall number of gestures needed to cast them can be cut quite
Xdramatically.
X.PP
XIf a gesture can be construed to create two or more spells then
Xthe caster must choose which one he wants to use. For example, 
Xthe last two
Xgestures of a 'finger of death' are the same as 'missile', yet only on
Xodd occasions would the latter be used. Another example of the
Xone-spell-per-gesture concept is the following:
X.PP
XRight hand:     P P W S    Last 4 gestures form 'invisibility'
X.br
XLeft hand:      W W W S    Last 3 gestures form 'counter-spell'
X.PP
XThe trouble here is the 'invisibility' spell needs both hands
Xto perform certain gestures. However, since the final S of the left
Xhand cannot complete two spells it is clear that a choice must be made
Xbetween the W-W-S of the 'counter-spell' and the P-P-(w-(s of the
Xinvisibility. 
XThe caster must choose one spell if the gestures are completed in the
Xcorrect sequence. Most spells can be shot off to nowhere if not
Xrequired, but some cannot be; for example, 'fire storm', which gets you
Xno matter where it is released. Some of the larger spells have smaller
Xones incorporated within.
X.PP
XSpells can be aborted any way along their development simply
Xby performing a gesture with the hand doing the spell which is not one
Xneeded for that spell. There is no penalty, save having wasted some
Xtime. Note that no spells contain "stab", "nothing", or "C" (half of a 
Xclap) and consequently after pursuing one of
Xthese alternatives, any spell must start from scratch. Note also that
Xwizards only have one dagger each, so they cannot stab
Xwith both hands at the 
Xsame time (although they can change hands for stabbing without wasting
Xtime.) Such are the disadvantages of physical violence...
X.PP
XCertain spells cancel each other if they take effect
Xsimultaneously. An obvious example is 'finger of death' and 'raise
Xdead'. Cancellation occurs when the subject for the spells concerned
Xis the same person, although there are some of the heat versus cold
Xvariety which don't care who is the subject. Other spells which cancel
Xharmlessly are mostly the enchantments, which direct that something be
Xdone which may be impossible to obey due to some contradiction (e.g.
Xyou cannot both repeat last turn's gestures and give a random gesture
Xwith one hand, as you would if the subject of the spells 'amnesia' 
Xand 'confusion' at once). 
X.PP
XSince spells detonate simultaneously, there is occasionally
Xconfusion over spells which don't cancel, yet which seem to depend on
Xwhich happened first. The best example is when a monster is created
Xand, on the same turn, hit by a 'fireball', or something else
Xsufficient to kill it. Since both are simultaneous, the monster will
Xattack that turn whilst being destroyed. (There are some exceptions
Xexplicitly mentioned, for example ice elementals in 'ice storm', 
Xor 'counter-spell' / 'dispel magic' against all other spells.)
X.PP
XAnother example of a seeming
Xconflict is when someone who is resistant to fire is the subject of
Xboth a 'remove enchantment' and 'fireball'; the enchantment is removed
Xas the fireball explodes (since they are simultaneous) hence the poor
Xvictim is fried. If, instead, he were not resistant to fire and was hit
Xby a 'resist fire' and 'fireball' at once, then he would start to
Xresist fire as the fireball exploded and thus be saved.
X.PP
XBefore the battle commences, the referee casts a 'dispel
Xmagic' followed by an 'anti-spell' at each of the wizards. This is so
Xthat they cannot commence gesturing prematurely. Thus being 
Xresistant to
Xfire in your last battle doesn't do you any good in the next.
X.SH WINNING
XEach wizard can sustain 14 points of damage, but on the 15th or
Xabove he dies and the surviving wizard is declared the winner.
XSimultaneous death is a posthumous draw. Damage given to wizards and
Xmonsters is cumulative (so you don't have to do it all in one go!)
XDead monsters take no further part in the game. 
X.PP
XThere is another
Xalternative to being killed, namely the 'surrender'. This is not a
Xspell, but a pair of P gestures made by both hands at the same time.
XIf any wizard does this (accidentally or deliberately), he has
Xsurrendered, and will be eliminated from the game at the end
Xof that turn.
XSee the end of the spell list for details.
X.SH SPELLS
XThere now follows, in four sections, a list of the spells which may be cast.
X.PP
X.B Protection spells
X.PP
X.I 'Shield':
X.B P
X.PP
XThis spell protects the subject from all attacks from monsters (that
Xis, creatures created by a summoning spell), from 'missile' spells,
Xand from stabs by wizards. The shield lasts for that turn only, but
Xone shield will cover all such attacks made against the subject that
Xturn.
X.PP
X.I 'Remove enchantment':
X.B P-D-W-P
X.PP
XIf the subject of this spell is currently being affected by any of the
Xspells in the  "enchantments" section, or if spells
Xfrom that section are cast at him at the same time as the remove
Xenchantment, then all such spells terminate immediately (although their
Xeffect for that turn might already have passed.) For example, the
Xvictim of a 'blindness' spell would not be able to see what his
Xopponent's gestures were on the turn that his sight is restored by
Xa 'remove enchantment'. Note that the 'remove enchantment' affects 
Xall enchantments whether the caster wants them to
Xall go or not. A second effect of the spell is to destroy any monster
Xupon which it is cast, although the monster can attack in that turn.
X.PP
X.I 'Magic mirror':
X.B (c-(w
X.PP
XAny spell cast at the subject of this spell is reflected back at the
Xcaster of that spell for that turn only. This includes spells 
Xlike 'missile' and 'lightning bolt' but does not include attacks by
Xmonsters already in existence, or stabs from wizards. Note that
Xcertain spells are cast by wizards usually upon themselves (e.g.
Xspells from this section and the "Summons" section); the mirror
Xhas no effect on these spells.
XIt is countered totally, with no effect
Xwhatsoever, if the subject is the simultaneous subject of either 
Xa 'counter-spell' or 'dispel magic'. It has no effect on spells which
Xaffect more than one person, such as 'fire storm'. Two mirrors cast
Xat someone simultaneously combine to form a single mirror. 
XIf a spell is reflected from a mirror back at a wizard who
X.I also
Xhas a mirror, the spell bounces back and forth until it falls apart.
X.PP
X.I 'Counter-spell':
X.B W-P-P 
X.I or
X.B W-W-S
X.PP
XAny other spell cast upon the subject in the same turn has no effect
Xwhatever. In the case of blanket-type spells, which affect more than one
Xperson, the subject of the 'counter-spell' alone is protected. For
Xexample, a 'fire storm' spell would not affect a wizard if that wizard
Xwas simultaneously the subject of a 'counter-spell', but everyone
Xelse would be affected as usual (unless they had their own protection.)
XThe 'counter-spell' will cancel all the spells cast at the subject for
Xthat turn, including 'remove enchantment' and 'magic mirror', but 
Xnot 'dispel magic' or 'finger of death'. It will combine with another
Xspell of its own type for the same effect as if it were alone. 
XThe 'counter-spell' will also act as a 'shield' on its subject, 
Xin addition to its other properties.
XThe spell has two alternative gesture
Xsequences, either of which may be used at any time.
X.PP
X.I 'Dispel magic':
X.B (c-D-P-W
X.PP
XThis spell acts as a combination of 'counter-spell' and 'remove
Xenchantment', but its effects are universal rather than limited to the
Xsubject of the spell. It will stop any spell cast in the same turn
Xfrom working (apart from another 'dispel magic' spell which combines
Xwith it for the same result), and will remove all enchantments from
Xall beings before they have effect. In addition, all monsters are
Xdestroyed, although they can attack that turn. 'Counter-spells' 
Xand 'magic mirrors' have no effect. Like the 'counter-spell', it 
Xalso acts as a 'shield' for its subject. 'Dispel magic' will not dispel 
Xstabs or surrenders, since they are not spells (although 
Xthe 'shield' effect may block a stab.)
X.PP
X.I 'Raise dead': 
X.B D-W-W-F-W-(c
X.PP
XThe subject of this spell is usually a recently dead 
Xhuman or monster corpse (it will not work on elementals, which
Xdissipate when destroyed.)
XWhen the spell is cast, life is instilled back into the corpse and any
Xdamage which it has sustained is cured until the owner is back to his
Xusual state of health.  A 'remove enchantment' effect is also manifest
Xso any 'diseases' or 'poisons' will be neutralized (plus any other
Xenchantments). 
XThe subject will be able to act as normal immediately, so that next 
Xturn he can gesture, fight, etc. If the subject is a monster, it will
Xbe under the control of the wizard who raised it, and it will be able
Xto attack that turn.
X.br
XIf the spell is cast on a live individual,
Xthe effect is that of a 'cure wounds' recovering 5 points of
Xdamage, or as many as have been sustained if less than 5. In this
Xcase, 'diseases', 'poisons', and other enchantments are
X.I not
Xremoved. 
X.br
XThis is the
Xonly spell which affects corpses properly; therefore, it cannot be
Xstopped by a 'counter-spell', since 'counter-spell' can only be
Xcast on living beings. A 'dispel magic'
Xspell will stop it, since that affects all spells no matter what
Xtheir subject.  Once alive the subject is treated as normal.
X.PP
X.I 'Cure light wounds':
X.B D-F-W
X.PP
XIf the subject has received damage then he is cured by 1 point as if
Xthat point had not been inflicted. (Recall that all spells are resolved
Xsimultanously; if a wizard is suffers his 15th point of damage at the
Xsame time as he is affected by 'cure light wounds', he will remain
Xalive with 14 points of damage at the end of the turn.) The
Xeffect is not removed by a 'dispel magic' or 'remove enchantment'.
X.PP
X.I 'Cure heavy wounds':
X.B D-F-P-W
X.PP
XThis spell is the same as 'cure light wounds' for its effect, but 2
Xpoints of damage are cured instead of 1, or only 1 if only 1 had been
Xsustained. A side effect is that the spell will also cure a 
Xdisease. (Note that 'raise dead' on a live individual won't).
X.PP
X.B Summons spells
X.PP
X.I 'Summon Goblin': 
X.B S-F-W
X.PP
XThis spell creates a goblin under the control of the wizard upon whom
Xthe spell is cast. The goblin can attack
Ximmediately and its victim can be any any wizard or other monster the
Xcontroller desires.
XThe goblin does 1 point of damage to its victim per turn and is destroyed
Xafter 1 point of damage is inflicted upon it.
X.PP
X.I 'Summon Ogre': 
X.B P-S-F-W
X.PP
XThis spell is the same as 'summon goblin', but the ogre created
Xinflicts and is destroyed by 2 points of damage rather than 1.
X.PP
X.I 'Summon Troll': 
X.B F-P-S-F-W
X.PP
XThis spell is the same as 'summon goblin', but the troll created
Xinflicts and is destroyed by 3 points of damage rather than 1.
X.PP
X.I 'Summon Giant': 
X.B W-F-P-S-F-W
X.PP
XThis spell is the same as 'summon goblin', but the giant created
Xinflicts and is destroyed by 4 points of damage rather than 1.
X.PP
X.I 'Summon Elemental': 
X.B (c-S-W-W-S
X.PP
XThis spell creates either a fire elemental or an ice elemental, at the
Xdiscretion of the wizard upon whom the spell is cast (after he has seen
Xall the gestures made that turn.)
X.PP
XElementals must be cast at someone and cannot be "shot off"
Xharmlessly at some inanimate object. The elemental will, for that turn
Xand until destroyed, attack everyone (including its owner, and other
Xmonsters), causing 3 points of damage per turn. Only wizards and
Xmonsters who are resistant to the elemental's element (heat or cold),
Xor who have a 'shield' or a spell with a 'shield' effect, are safe.
XThe elemental
Xtakes 3 points of damage to be killed but may be destroyed by spells
Xof the opposite type (e.g. 'fire storm', 'resist cold' or 'fireball'
Xwill kill an ice elemental), and will also neutralize the cancelling
Xspell. Elementals will not attack on the turn they are destroyed by
Xsuch a spell. An elemental will also be engulfed and destroyed by a
Xstorm of its own type but, in such an event, the storm is not
Xneutralized although the elemental still does not attack in that turn.
XTwo elementals of the opposite type will also destroy each other before
Xattacking, and two of the same type will join together to form a single
Xelemental of normal strength. If there are two opposite storms and an
Xelemental, or two opposite elementals and one or two storms, all
Xstorms and elementals cancel each other out.
X.PP
X.B Damaging Spells
X.PP
X.I 'Missile': 
X.B S-D
X.PP
XThis spell creates a material object of hard substance which is hurled
Xtowards the subject of the spell and causes him 1 point of damage. The
Xspell is thwarted by a 'shield' in addition to the 
Xusual 'counter-spell', 'dispel magic' and 'magic mirror' (the latter 
Xcausing it to hit whoever cast it instead).
X.PP
X.I 'Finger of Death':  
X.B P-W-P-F-S-S-S-D
X.PP
XKills the subject stone dead. This spell is so powerful that it is
Xunaffected by a 'counter-spell', although a 'dispel magic' spell cast
Xupon the final gesture will stop it. The usual way to prevent being
Xharmed by this spell is to disrupt it during casting -- using
Xan 'anti-spell', for example.
X.PP
X.I 'Lightning Bolt':  
X.B D-F-F-D-D 
X.I or
X.B W-D-D-(c
X.PP
XThe subject of this spell is hit by a bolt of lightning and sustains 5
Xpoints of damage. Resistance to heat or cold is irrelevant. There are
Xtwo gesture combinations for the spell, but the shorter one may be used
Xonly once per battle by any wizard. The longer one may
Xbe used without restriction. A 'shield' spell offers no defence.
X.PP
X.I 'Cause Light Wounds':
X.B W-F-P
X.PP
XThe subject of this spell is inflicted with 2 points of damage.
XResistance to heat or cold offers no defence. A simultaneous 'cure
Xlight wounds' does not cancel the spell; it only heals one of the points
Xof damage. A 'shield' has no effect.
X.PP
X.I 'Cause Heavy Wounds':
X.B W-P-F-D
X.PP
XThis has the same effect as 'cause light wounds' but inflicts 3 points
Xof damage instead of 2.
X.PP
X.I 'Fireball':
X.B F-S-S-D-D
X.PP
XThe subject of this spell is hit by a ball of fire, and sustains 5
Xpoints of damage unless he is resistant to fire. If at the same time
Xan 'ice storm' prevails, the subject of the 'fireball' is instead not
Xharmed by either spell, although the storm will affect others as
Xnormal. If directed at an ice elemental, the fireball will destroy it
Xbefore it can attack.
X.PP
X.I 'Fire storm':
X.B S-W-W-(c
X.PP
XEverything not resistant to heat sustains 5 points of damage that
Xturn. The spell cancels wholly, causing no damage, with either an 'ice
Xstorm' or an ice elemental. It will destroy but not be destroyed by a
Xfire elemental. Two 'fire storms' act as one.
X.PP
X.I 'Ice storm':
X.B W-S-S-(c
X.PP
XEverything not resistant to cold sustains 5 points of damage that
Xturn. The spell cancels wholly, causing no damage, with either a 'fire
Xstorm' or a fire elemental; it will cancel locally with a 'fireball', sparing
Xthe subject of the 'fireball' but nobody else.
XIt will destroy but not be destroyed by an ice elemental. Two 'ice
Xstorms' act as one.
X.PP
X.B Enchantments
X.PP
X.I 'Amnesia':
X.B D-P-P
X.PP
XIf the subject of this spell is a wizard, next turn he must repeat
Xidentically the gestures he made in the current turn, 
Xincluding "nothing" and "stab" gestures.
XIf the subject is a monster it will attack whoever it attacked this
Xturn. If the subject is simultaneously the subject of any 
Xof 'confusion', 'charm person', 'charm monster', 'paralysis' or 'fear'
Xthen none of the spells work.
X.PP
X.I 'Confusion':
X.B D-S-F
X.PP
XIf the subject of this spell is a wizard, next turn one of his gestures will
Xbe changed randomly. Either his left or his right hand (50% chance of
Xeither) will perform a half-clap, palm, digit, fingers, snap, or wave 
X(chosen at random). (Recall that a one-handed clap is useless unless 
Xthe other hand also attempts to clap.)
XIf the subject of the spell is a monster, it attacks at
Xrandom that turn. If the subject is also the subject of any 
Xof 'amnesia', 'charm person', 'charm monster', 'paralysis' or 'fear',
Xnone of the spells work.
X.PP
X.I 'Charm Person':
X.B P-S-D-F
X.PP
XExcept for cancellation with other enchantments, this spell only
Xaffects wizards. When the spell is cast, the caster tells the subject
Xwhich of his hands will be controlled; in the following turn, the
Xcaster chooses the gesture he wants the subject's
Xchosen hand to perform. This could be a stab or nothing. 
XIf the 'charm person' spell reflects from a 'magic mirror' back
Xat its caster, the subject
Xof the mirror assumes the role of caster and controls down his
Xopponent's gesture. If the subject is also the subject of any 
Xof 'amnesia', 'confusion', 'charm monster', 'paralysis' or 'fear', none
Xof the spells work.
X.PP
X.I 'Charm Monster':
X.B P-S-D-D
X.PP
XExcept for cancellation with other enchantments, this spell only
Xaffects monsters (but not elementals). Control of the monster is
Xtransferred to the caster of the spell (or retained by him) as of this
Xturn; i.e., the monster will attack whosoever its new controller
Xdictates from that turn onwards including that turn. Further charms
Xare, of course, possible, transferring as before. If the subject of
Xthe charm is also the subject of any of: 'amnesia', 'confusion', 'charm
Xperson', 'fear' or 'paralysis', none of the spells work.
X.PP
X.I 'Paralysis':
X.B F-F-F
X.PP
XIf the subject of the spell is a wizard, then on the turn the spell is
Xcast, after gestures have been revealed, the caster selects one of the
Xwizard's hands; on the next turn that hand is paralyzed into the
Xposition it is in this turn. If the wizard already had a paralyzed
Xhand, it must be the same hand which is paralyzed again. Most
Xgestures remain the same (including "stab" and "nothing"),
Xbut if the hand being paralyzed is performing
Xa C, S, or W it is instead paralyzed into F, D, or P respectively.
XA favourite ploy is to continually paralyze a hand
X(F-F-F-F-F-F etc.) into a non-P gesture and then set a monster on the
Xsubject so that he has to use his other hand to protect himself, but
Xthen has no defence against other magical attacks. If the subject of
Xthe spell is a monster, it
Xsimply does not attack in the turn following the one in which the
Xspell was cast. Elementals are unaffected.
XIf the subject of the spell is also the subject of any
Xof 'amnesia', 'confusion', 'charm person', 'charm monster' or 'fear',
Xnone of the spells work.
X.PP
X.I 'Fear':
X.B S-W-D
X.PP
XIn the turn following the casting of this spell, the subject cannot
Xperform a C, D, F or S gesture with either hand. (He can stab,
Xhowever.) This obviously has no effect on
Xmonsters.  If the subject is also the subject 
Xof 'amnesia', 'confusion', 'charm person', 'charm monster' 
Xor 'paralysis', then none of the spells work.
X.PP
X.I 'Anti-spell':
X.B S-P-F
X.PP
XOn the turn following the casting of this spell, the subject cannot
Xinclude any gestures made on or before this turn in a spell sequence
Xand must restart a new spell from the beginning of that spell
Xsequence. (This is marked by a special 'disruption' icon interrupting
Xthe subject's gesture history.)
XThe spell does not affect spells which are cast on the same
Xturn; nor does it affect monsters.
X.PP
X.I 'Protection from Evil':
X.B W-W-P
X.PP
XFor this turn and the following three turns, the subject of this spell is
Xprotected as if using a 'shield' spell, thus leaving both hands free.
XConcurrent 'shield' spells offer no further protection, and 
Xcompound 'protection from evil' spells merely overlap 
Xoffering no extra cover.
X.PP
X.I 'Resist Heat':
X.B W-W-F-P
X.PP
XThe subject of this spell becomes permanently resistant to all forms of
Xheat attack ('fireball', 'fire storm' and fire elementals). Only 'dispel 
Xmagic' or 'remove enchantment' will terminate this resistance
Xonce started (although a 'counter-spell' will prevent it from working
Xif cast at the subject at the same time as this spell). A 'resist
Xheat' cast directly on a fire elemental will destroy it before it can
Xattack that turn, but there is no effect on ice elementals.
X.PP
X.I 'Resist Cold':
X.B S-S-F-P
X.PP
XThe effects of this spell are identical to 'resist heat' but
Xresistance is to cold ('ice storm' and ice elementals). It destroys
Xice elementals if they are the subject of the spell, but doesn't affect
Xfire elementals.
X.PP
X.I 'Disease':
X.B D-S-F-F-F-(c
X.PP
XThe subject of this spell immediately contracts a deadly
X(non-contagious) disease which will kill him at the end of 6 turns
Xcounting from the one upon which the spell is cast. The malady is
Xcured by 'remove enchantment', 'cure heavy wounds' or 'dispel magic'
Xin the meantime.
X.PP
X.I 'Poison':
X.B D-W-W-F-W-D
X.PP
XThis is similar to the 'disease' spell, except that 'cure heavy wounds'
Xdoes not stop its effects.
X.PP
X.I 'Blindness':
X.B D-W-F-F-(d
X.PP
XFor the next three turns (not including the one in which the spell was
Xcast), the subject is unable to see. If he is a wizard, he cannot tell
Xwhat his opponent's gestures are, although he will sense what
Xspells are cast. If he tries to cast spells (or stab) at other beings,
Xhe will miss. Blinded 
Xmonsters are instantly destroyed and cannot attack in that turn.
X.PP
X.I 'Invisibility':
X.B P-P-(w-(s
X.PP
XThis spell is similar to 'blindness'; the subject of the spell
Xbecomes invisible to his opponent and his monsters. His gestures
Xcannot be seen, although his spells can. No other being can attack
Xor cast spells at him, with the exception of elementals.
XAny monster made invisible is destroyed due to the unstable nature of
Xsuch magically created creatures.
X.PP
X.I 'Haste':
X.B P-W-P-W-W-(c
X.PP
XFor the next three turns, the subject is speeded up; wizards can make an
Xextra set of gestures, and monsters can make an extra attack.
XFor wizards, the effects of both sets of gestures are taken simultaneously
Xat the end of the turn.  Thus a single 'counter-spell' from his
Xadversary could cancel two spells cast by the hastened wizard on two
Xhalf-turns if the phasing is right. Non-hastened wizards and monsters
Xcan see everything the hastened individual is doing.  Hastened
Xmonsters can change target in the extra turns if desired.
X.PP
X.I 'Time stop':
X.B S-P-P-(c
X.PP
XThe subject of this spell immediately takes an extra turn, on which
Xno-one can see or know about unless they are harmed. All non-affected
Xbeings have no resistance to any form of attack, e.g. a wizard halfway
Xthrough the duration of a 'protection from evil' spell can be harmed
Xby a monster which has had its time stopped. Time-stopped monsters
Xattack whoever their controller instructs, and time-stopped elementals
Xaffect everyone, resistance to heat or cold being immaterial in that
Xturn.
X.PP
X.I 'Delayed effect':
X.B D-W-S-S-S-P
X.PP
XThis spell must be cast upon a wizard. The next spell the subject
Xcompletes, provided it is in one of the next three turns, is
X"banked" until needed -- i.e. it fails to work until its caster desires.
X(If you have a spell banked, you will be asked each turn if you
Xwant to release it.) Note that spells banked are those cast 
X.I by 
Xthe subject, not those cast 
X.I at 
Xhim. If
Xhe casts more than one spell at the same time, he chooses which is to
Xbe banked. Remember that P is a 'shield' spell, and surrender is not a
Xspell. A wizard may only have one spell banked at any one time.
X.PP
X.I 'Permanency':
X.B S-P-F-P-S-D-W
X.PP
XThis spell must be upon a wizard. The next spell he
Xcompletes, provided it is in the next three turns, and which
Xfalls into the category of "Enchantments" will have its effect made
Xpermanent. 
X(Exeptions: 'anti-spell', 'disease', 'poison', 'time-stop', 'delayed
Xeffect', and 'permanency' cannot be made permanent. Note that 'resist
Xheat' and 'resist cold' are inherently permanent enchantments.) 
XThis means that the effect of the extended spell on the
Xfirst turn of its duration is repeated eternally. For example, 
Xa 'confusion' spell will produce the same gesture on the same hand 
Xrather than changing randomly each turn; a 'charm person' will 
Xmean repetition of the chosen gesture,
Xetc. If the subject of the 'permanency' casts more than one spell at
Xthe same time eligible for permanency, he chooses which has its
Xduration extended. Note that the person who has his spell made
Xpermanent does not necessarily have to make himself the subject of the
Xspell. If both a 'permanency' and 'delayed effect' are eligible for 
Xthe same spell to be banked or extended, a choice must be made; 
Xwhichever is not chosen will affect the next eligible spell instead.
X.PP
X.B Non-spells
X.PP
X.I 'Surrender':
X.B (p
X.PP
XThis is not a spell; consequently, it cannot be cast at anyone, nor
Xcan it be dispelled, counter-spelled, reflected off a mirror, or banked.
XA wizard who makes two simultaneous P gestures, 
Xirrespective of whether they terminate
Xspells or not, surrenders and the contest is over. The surrendering
Xwizard is deemed to have lost unless his gestures complete spells
Xwhich kill his opponent. Two simultaneous surrenders count as a
Xdraw. It is a necessary skill for wizards to work their spells so that they
Xnever accidentally perform two P gestures simultaneously.  Wizards can
Xbe killed as they surrender (if hit with appropriate spells or attacks)
Xbut the "referees" will cure any diseases, poisons, etc.
Ximmediately after the surrender for them.
X.PP
X.I 'Stab':
X.B stab
X.PP
XThis is not a spell, but an attack which can be directed at any
Xindividual monster or wizard. Unless protected in that turn by 
Xa 'shield' spell or another spell with the same effect, the target
Xstabbed suffers 1 point of damage. The wizard only has one knife, so
Xcan only stab with one hand in any turn, although which hand doesn't
Xmatter. The stab cannot be reflected, counter-spelled, dispelled, or
Xbanked.
X.SH BUGS
XDoes not conform exactly to the original 
X.I Spellcaster 
Xrules. Tough. Some points of divergence:
X.PP
XThe choosing of targets for monsters is handled much too late
Xin the round, and monster attacks are not perfectly simultaneous
Xwith spell attacks. This results in a number of minor effects which
Xare inconsistent with the original rules. Since I don't plan to do
Xa major rewrite anytime soon, you just get to live with it.
X.PP
XIf 'remove enchantment' is cast on a wizard who is also the subject
Xof a summoning spell, the summoned monster should be destroyed
Xafter attacking. 
X.PP
XIf a mind-control spell (paralysis, confusion, amnesia) is cast on a
Xmonster by a time-stopped wizard, the spell should take effect
Xon the next turn, rather than (as currently happens) the turn after
Xnext.
X.PP
XThe 'delayed effect' and 'permanency' spells should be able to bank
Xor extend spells cast during the same turn, as well as those cast during the
Xnext three turns.
X.SH HISTORY
XThe original paper-and-pencil version of this game,
Xentitled 
X.I Spellbinder,
Xwas created by Richard Bartle; it was printed in his zine
X.I Sauce of the Nile.
XHe attempted to have it commercially
Xproduced, but apparently didn't get very far. 
X.br
XIt was reprinted (with some changes) as 
X.I Spellcaster
Xin the fanzine 
X.I Duel Purpose,
Xwritten by Mike Lean. From there, it was scanned and
Xposted to the Net by Andrew Buchanan 
X(buchanan@heron.enet.dec.com). I grabbed it and wrote
Xthis X version.
X.br
XUndoubtedly, some part of this chain violates somebody's
Xcopyright. However, Richard Bartle is alleged to have died
Xat some point, so the moral problems seem to be minimal.
