XXBoing Version 1.7 
X==================
X
XUpdated: 27th August 1993
X
X
XDescription
X-----------
X
XXBoing is a simple blockout type game where you have a paddle which you use to
Xbounce a ball around the game area blowing up blocks with the ball. You win by
Xobtaining points for each block destroyed and each level completed. The person
Xwith the highest score wins.
X
XXBoing was started like many other projects to learn Xlib better. I had the 
XXPM library and was already using it in a Motif application. I thought that it
Xwould be cool to have nice colour pictures/animations in an Xlib game. So I 
Xdid. Without the XPM library I would be still playing with the colours I think.
X
XPlease read the manual page as the manual has some important game play 
Xinformation. Now I have warned you so don't complain if something doesn't 
Xseem to be correct or that another breakout game did it like that or this. :-)
X
X
XRequirements
X------------
X
XThe XPM library. Version 2.3 upwards tested. 3.2g is fine. Not tested below 2.3
XSuggest you use 3.2g which is available everywhere now. 
X
XA COLOUR X display. I may fix it to use other visuals later. ie: grey. mono
X
XAn ansi or non-ansi compiler. Ansi is better, try gcc.
XA decent GRUNT box to run XBoing. No network travel if possible! :-)
X
XAlso note that if you are on a Sun machine the xnews server is not the
Xquickest and you may experience delays in the game due to its heavy use
Xof pixmaps etc. I suggest playing it with the MIT X Server - hassle I know
Xif you use other Sun software that requires news etc.
X
XNote: It will always be a bit slower on a network so playing on the host
X      machine will give the best results. I have tuned the game for my
X      SparcStation 2 and it runs very fast. I cannot test the game on
X      other machines other the some Xterms and SGI Indigo's.  Disclamier.
X
XThis program doesn't have an Xdefaults file and does not use Motif or Xt. It
Xis a plain XLib program. It runs VERY fast on my computer which is a sparc II.
XIf it is slow then check out the README.problems doco.
X
XPlease don't mail me and ask why it is slow unless you have read the -
XREADME.problems
X
X
XWhere do I get it from
X----------------------
X
XVia anonymous ftp from ftp.x.org  in the contrib directory. 
XThe most recent version is xboing1.7-tar.Z. It may appear on other mirrors
Xthat mirror ftp.x.org or whatever.
X
XPlease do not try to obtain it from my own machine. ftp.x.org is quicker.
XThe game is NOT kept in the ftp account on my machine so don't try please.
X
X
XInstallation/Building game
X--------------------------
X
XPlease read the file called INSTALL. It is important to read this file.
XDon't forget to get the XPM library and compile it up first!
X
X
XUsage
X-----
X
XThe game does have command line options so check them out. 'xboing -help'
X
XThe colourmap is taken over as I need all the colours. Sorry but thats the
Xproblem with only 256 colourmap entries. I cannot see a problem with this.
X
XThe colourmap is released afterwards and should return you to your lovely
Xcolour scheme. If it doesn't please let me know.
X
X
XDevelopement
X------------
X
XXboing was developed on a SparcStation 2 with 48meg memory and a 19" colour
Xdisplay using the MIT X11R5 X server, Motif Window Manager. I used x11ups
Xfor debugging - excellent tool - well done. Sunos 4.1.2 sun4c. Compiled using
Xgcc with warnings on and also tested using the Sun cc compiler (non ansi).
X
XReference books: All of O'Reilly Series, X & Motif Quick reference guide
XGraphics: Titles done on Amiga using Deluxe Paint IV, converted using pbmplus
X          tools and xpm image touch ups with "pixmap".
XSounds:   Mainly from sounds.sdus.edu and also from other places.
X
X
XSpecial Thanks
X--------------
X
XReally Special thanks to Arnaud Le Hors (lehors@sophia.inria.fr) for the
Xwonderful XPM library and for making it free :-).
X
XThanks for a some cool backgrounds found in Anthony's Icons V1.3 (new ones!)
X    Anthony Thyssen - anthony@cit.gu.edu.au
X
XThe comp.windows.x newsgroup netters for help over the past few years. See
Xthe README.changes doco for inline lisitings of the helpers.
X
XThankyou to all those who have contributed. Especially the beta testers here
Xat CATT. It's hard to do any work around here!

X    Craig McNaughton, Chris Fu, David Kershaw, Geoff Lambourne
X    Paul McGregor, my 3 cats ...
X
X
XPatches to XBoing
X-----------------
X
XPatches are great and welcomed. Please do as others have and either send them
Xto me or post them to news. Please do NOT place them on ftp.x.org and
Xmake it look like I put it there. I got heaps of mail saying a certain patch
Xdidn't work and I didn't even know it existed. I think it is common courtesy
Xto send me some email about what is going on etc.
X
XAlso - you can do whatever you like at your own site but don't send a patch
Xthat changes the flag on the presentation screen. :-)
X
X
XSuggestions/Bug fixes
X---------------------
X
XI have had many suggestions and bug fixes. I cannot list all the names of the
Xpeople who have helped as it would be a big list and I wouldn't want to
Xleave anyone out. Thankyou to all those who have mailed - you know. ;-)
X
XSee the README.changes doco for more info.
X
X
XGrovel Bit
X----------
X
XIf anyone is feeling really generous or kind they can send money, equipment,
Xcars, travel vouchers or anything for that matter to my humble self and I 
Xwill be very happy. ;-) If that's all a bit much then a friendly email will
Xdo fine. Hope you have fun bouncing your balls. Stay cool.

XXBoing Changes
X==============
X
XVersion 1.7 - 27th August 1993
X-----------------------------
X
X- Checked mail and response. Generally good :-)
X- Fixed Imakefile for the lack of any clue on the install sounds script :-)
X- in -help option -pointerGrab was incorrect. 
X- Cannot shoot your ball as it is being created. I think.
X- Made the copyright notice more complete.
X- Made the highscore file save the real user id and use that for the comparing
X  when updating the highscore file so all those cheats out there cannot chfn
X  and get in the global highscore file more than once :-)
X- Updated troubleshooting in INSTALL.
X- Added the network to long stuff to all the entries in highscore table that
X  are bigger than 1 char.
X- Added flock to the highscore file locking as a define. Thanks to :-
X  Joe Ilacqua <spike@world.std.com> for the idea.
X- Moved all header files to include/ directory and changed all .c to reflect.
X- Added a better way to handle audio source in Imakefile. LinkFile()
X- When more than 1 ball is active and level finishes you get your balls back!
X- Added audio for rplay - thanks to Joel J. Fleck II - <joel@cc.bellcore.com>
X- Removed tone1-9.snd
X- Added Normal/WarningMessage() and changed all calls over to use it if needed.
X- Changed all references to export to ftp.x.org new name for export.lcs.mit.edu
X- Added the trouble shooting doco.
X- Added a cool fading effect to the window.
X- Did a bit of a clean up on some older functions and removed old shit.
X- Border now glows when showing intros.
X- Added -usedefcmap to use default cmap if possible.
X- Removed the animations on the intro screen :-( This is because the new slide
X  effect didn't work with the animations - pity but no great loss.
X- Removed the copyright message from the Imakefile so it is not duplicated.
X- Added AudioFile sound support - Andrew Leahy <A.Leahy@st.nepean.uws.edu.au>
X- Made pointer grabbing default to ON. Suggested by a few people.
X- Made the parsing of the keys much more modular so that it will be easy to
X  add other modes.
X- Added a quit question mode to ask if the user really wants to quit? y/n
X- Added a blind wipe fade effect for highscore - really cool look.
X- Added a special debug macro for debugging.
X- Added a shattering effect.
X
X
XVersion 1.6 - 6th August 1993
X-----------------------------
X
X- Replied to mail argghhh.
X- Added version number to presents screen.
X- Fixed multiball bug where there may be 2 balls bouncing - i dies and you have
X  none spare so it ends - no longer the case.
X- Added some more doco to INSTALL and README
X- Added a new special effect where the specials flash around on the intros.
X- Changed the thankyou to thank you!! Requested too :-)
X- NULL terminated the string returned form strftime() function in highscore.c
X- Added some new backgrounds from Anthony's Icons Volume 1.3.
X- Killed of the spin.au file as it kills the audio for some reason - put
X  a new one in called intro.au that is a powerdown sound.
X- All buttons now shoot bullets in game mode. Also the button starts of the
X  ball instead of the space bar now.
X- Starting level code added. You can start at any level but the highscore
X  table will subtract the starting level from the level attained so the scores
X  are kept even. ie: start = 34  end = 67  level = 33
X- Answered mail - more patches.
X- Note that xnews slows the game down heaps. Bummer.
X- Lots of people getting bad drawable errors :-(
X- FAST_SPEED has been changed from 3L to 1L for gruntish speed.
X  thanks - billr@saab.cna.tek.com
X- Changed a few levels like 7 & 8 to make them a tad easier.
X- Changed the corner bouncing - idea pgh@computer-science.strathclyde.ac.uk
X- Now supports NCD audio format. Thanks to Dave Lemke <lemke@verbosa.ncd.com>
X- Fixed up SUNaudio.c to not have #ifdefs AUDIO.. everywhere - not needed now.
X- Fixed up Imakefile so it wont install sounds if not required.
X- Global highscore file only has one entry per person now. So god like beings
X  cannot completely take over the whole scoreboard!!
X- All level and score functions use u_long so that I can use htonl ntohl for
X  network independent conversion of the score and level. May now work over
X  networks where the machine has different byte ordering for score file only.
X- Added a killer mode where the ball turns red and the ball goes through all
X  blocks like butter. It is activated after 10 bonuses have been collected.
X- Only real errors now get written to stderr - all others to stdout.
X- Added some patches to Imakefile for audio on sparcs jra@hrcms.jazz.att.com
X  Also patched SUNaudio.c so that it opens the audio device without hanging.
X- Pointer grabbing is now an option with default OFF.
X- Fixed bug in options code.
X- You can now set the maximum value for the audio volume.
X- Fixed a bug in the bonus coin code where on some levels they never appeared.
X- Added heaps to the manual page especially on the options.
X- Fixed bug with ball being killed off - didn't work correctly.
X- No longer exits with errorcode 1 on normal exits.
X- Changed the func RenderShape() so it only creates one huge backing store
X  pixmap and reuses it so it reduces calls to server.
X- MAXPATHLEN not found on SYSV apparently and bug in highscore.c fixed. Thanks
X  to John M. Scott <jmscott@setex.august.com>
X- Now displays how many bonuses you have during level.
X- Plays sound when touching a block
X- Added 3 env variables for the highscore file, levels dir, and sounds dir so
X  that you can change them to point to your own cheat level files!!
X
X- Following changes provided by :-
X   - Jean Yves VIONDURY (viondury@mururoa.imag.fr) and
X     Olivier DUMAS (dumas@mururoa.imag.fr) from Bull-IMAG, France.
X
X    . The ball bounce on the paddle has been modified, so that the ball can
X      be oriented better than before.
X    . The autotilt-random function has been changed, to make the auto-tilt
X      function more reliable.
X    . Speed modifiers due to Warp values now propose a linear evolution.
X    . The global high score file is locked when updated, to avoid conflicts
X      and score losses when several people finish their game at the same time.
X      This feature hasn't been extensively tested, as these situations aren't
X      easy to provoke. But we rely on the system to make it work properly.
X
X- You will all notice the improved ball bouncing off the paddle thanks to the
X  above dudes. Thanks again.
X- Thanks to christos@deshaw.com for the patch on alt.sources regarding the
X  extra error cases in error.c and the ansi trigraphs bug.
X- Supports HP audio which I think is .au format as well on the device.
X- Discovered the UNOFFFICIAL patch on export. Hmm - don't like the flag change!
X- Sent a patch by soulard@corto.inria.fr that fixes the problem where the
X  teleport can have problems when it puts the ball in an enclosed area. Thanks.
X- Added a paddle shrink and expand block - removed paddlesize getting smaller
X  as you get higher in the levels as it is too hard.
X- Added README's in all subdirectories. Cleaned up code and directory.
X
X
XVersion 1.5 - 23rd July 1993
X----------------------------
X
X- Thanks for all the responses :-) I think I better post it to news!
X  Our machine is slowwwwwing down from all those ftpers! I asked for it!
X- After first posting I received quite a few mail messages about the
X  Imakefile and compiling on other machines. Well I never said it would
X  so I have now added the patches/suggestions.
X- The semicolin missing was unfortunate. I use gcc by default and that
X  of course didn't need that line of code. Sorry folks.
X- Colourmap problems - well I did warn that it only works for colour!
X  I'll try to get it to work for greyscale - XPM handles it but the
X  pixmaps look bad as they were designed for colour only. Sorry.
X- I forgot a manual page - Done. Please forgive me if it is pox as it is
X  my first go at nroff.
X- Updated the Imakefile more to include the directory installation.
X- A few lose ends in highscore.c fixed. Also took some useless stuff out of
X  the Imakefile.
X- Added a pirate block that will kill the ball when hit. You can shoot the
X  pirate 3 times and lose 1000 points, saves your ball though.
X- Fixed the bullet bug where sometimes on a new level you couldn't shoot
X  even if you had bags of ammo.
X- Displays level name when starting.
X- The way bonuses are added is much better now. Less time wasting.
X- Turned off the graphics exposures in the graphics contexts to speed the
X  while event loop up considerably. Wow, what a difference.
X- Added the timer and special bonus area after squashing the message area
X  smaller. This area will have a count down timer and special modes will be
X  indicated in the special area. The bonus screen now uses the timer bonus.
X- Added TrueColour to the colour test for all those SGI people.
X- Added tink code to clear off tinks.
X- Improvement for the bullet/ball collision.
X- Added an I key for quick Iconification if the boss walks passed.
X- Added a -scores option to print highscores to command line.
X- If the user has a '&' in their gecos it should be expanded to their user
X  name and then the first letter upper case. Patch by jeff@rd1.interlan.com
X- Better parsing of level data. Time bonus is now part of level data.
X- Fixed major ball debris bug. Easy - clear background before copying it for
X  the backing store. Also done for the paddle/bullet. However, I must fix the 
X  collision detection though. Sometimes a bit of a block is cut out. :-(
X- Added code so that when the ball get stuck in a loop, if the paddle is not
X  hit in n seconds then the board will auto tilt.
X- Put code in to time the game and show up in highscore table.
X  Updated both the X bit and commandline bit.
X- Fiddled with the timing routines. Still a bit dodgy.
X- Made some calls in highscore table better and to use misc routines.
X- The ball collision detection now uses regions that get created as the block
X  is created. This is better than a whole lot of if's if you ask me.
X- Also fixed the addbonus code and made a MakeBlockGeometry function to
X  make code more modular.
X- Added a personal highscore feature. Your highscores get saved to a highscore
X  file in your home directory.
X- Took out the beep if the key isn't recognisied. Started shitting me!!
X- Install procedure finally fixed. yeah.
X- Made the mouse move the paddle relative to it's position. Asked for a lot.
X- Also a new commandline option [-keys] will disable the mouse mode and only
X  allow keys to move the paddle. This is better than having both.
X- Added a reverse block - when hit the controls reverse for a time span.
X- The highscore file is now always fchmod()ed to make sure permissions are
X  correct for all players.
X- Added a hyperspace block that will turn off the side wall for the
X  ball and it will wrap around as such.
X- Fixed the text routine calls in intro.c to use calls in misc.c
X- Added SUN audio - yeah yeah yeah again.... -sound option for audio.
X- Fixed the Imakefile to use the audio settings and how to find sounds.
X- Added some sound effects. More later.
X- Added code to highlight the score you just obtained in a game in highscore.
X- Adjusted the code in bonus.c to allow the space to pressed to skip bonus
X  animations but still add the bonus score onto the score etc.
X- Add the specials display at bottom of the window indicating the current
X  specials mode.
X- Added another 10 levels to make a total of 40 levels. It is rather boring
X  creating levels :-)
X- Added a ball kill key <d>.
X- Highscores are saved when quitting with q key.
X- Redesigned the keys screen - added a = audio on/off g = game control
X  added 1-9 for speed control
X- Added an extra ball animation and block.
X- Changed the ball slightly so that it has a white circle around it so it will
X  stand out better on all backgrounds.
X- Cursor is now gone and grabbed to main window.
X- Added applause sound when level is finished.
X- Found a bad bug in FreeBlocks() or something. Cool. fixes -static bug.
X- The gun.c code is re-written so you can shoot more than 1 bullet at a time
X  making a machine gun effect. Really cool!!
X- Added the maching gun block. It now lasts for a whole level.
X- Removed the fore/background colours for gcand to init.c instead of being
X  in the misc.c code - reduces the rendershape routine down by 2 calls.
X- Took out the backgrounds that were complicated and guady. 4 of them
X- Added a walls off block
X- Added a teleport block and it works.
X- Audio can now be toggled on or off while playing game. a key
X- Added the -setup option so sysops can find out whats going on.
X- Removed the sideways level off on scrolling.
X- Took out a few shitty things.
X- Added the presenting screen and all its quirks. More sounds!
X- Added a random block that changes colour every now and then.
X- Fixed the event loops so that when it is iconified it uses hardly and cpu
X  and is much better on the system. Almost dissapears of top!
X- Added multi ball mode - what a change!! Anyway up to six balls can now
X  bounce around causing havoc!
X- Added sticky paddle block and mode - ball sticks to paddle and requires you
X  to shoot it off again.
X- Added some neat sound effects - sorry for the voice ones but I am no sound
X  expert! :-)
X- I think I have removed the flash before the window appears.
X- Fixed they way the blocks explode after a bomb block.
X- Pause is now more friendly to the system like iconify is.
X- added a x2 and x4 bonus as well as fixing the old bonus code.
X- Fixed the kill ball routine to work for multi balls - kill first in array.
X- Made the x2 x4 turn off for each dead ball.
X- You can now shoot some of the specials and get rid of them (3 times)
X- Changed the way the ball checks for collisions - works well now - no
X  left overs and few muck ups. Cool - at last.
X- Manual page update - install updated - readme updated - Imakefile updated
X- Fixed a few little bugs - cannot use escape in bonus mode 
X
XVersion 1.4/1.0 BETA

XXBoing Installation
X===================
X
XUpdated: 27th August 1993
X
XRequirements
X------------
X
X- You must be using X11R4 or X11R5. It may work on X11R3 but cannot test it!
X- You must have the XPM pixmap library. The XPM library can be obtained from
X  the following sites:-
X
X  avahi.inria.fr (138.96.24.30)     - Latest revision. (Europe)     V3.2g
X    - in /pub/xpm
X  ftp.x.org (18.24.0.12)            - Latest revision. (America)    V3.2g
X    - in /contrib
X  archie.au (139.130.4.6)           - Latest revision. (Australia)  V3.2g
X    - in /X11/contrib
X
X  The author of XPM is lehors@sophia.inria.fr - BULL Research FRANCE 
X  I suggest you use 3.2g as it has had the best reports. 3.2f may have some
X  problems but works for me!
X
X- v1.6 has now been compiled and I've be told  works on the following machines,
X
X    + SunOS 4.1.2 5 sun4c/sun4m
X    + SunOS Solaris 2.2 LX
X    + IRIX 4.0.5G 12171207 IP7
X    + SGI 310/GTX
X    + HP 9000/720 HP-UX 8.07
X    + DEC 2100
X    + Coherent on i486/386!
X    + NCR 3000
X    + DEC OSF/1 AXP
X    + DECstation 5000/133 ULTRIX 4.2/4.3 0 RISC
X    + AIX 3.2.3e rs6000/350
X    + NetBSD on i486
X    + Linux on i486.
X    + Intel 486 ESIX 4.0.4 X11R4
X
X- You must have a COLOUR display. Sorry to all those B&W dudes. I'll look 
X  into greyscale.
X
X- An ANSI compiler would be nicer however I spent ages changing code with
X  all those lovely #ifdefs so you can use a non-ansi compiler. :-)
X
X- This game DOES NOT need Motif or Xt or anything except pure XLib.
X
X- The xnews Sun X server is NOT the quickest with this game. Be warned.
X
X
XMakefiles
X---------
X
XIncluded in this package is an Imakefile which generates a Makefile that will
Xcompile XBoing using your system setup. For those people without imake, or
Xwho can't get it to compile, a Makefile.std is also included. 
X
X
XCompilation
X-----------
X
XEdit the Imakefile or the Makefile.std and change the default compiler to
Xyour compiler. Also change the compiler flags if necessary. 
X
XChange the $(XBOING_DIR) to point to the place where xboing is to be 
Xinstalled. In that directory xboing will create the highscore file and also
Xplace the level data and sound data.
X
XNOTE: The user can now specify the sounds, level and highscore file locations
X      as environment variables. They are :-
X
XXBOING_SCORE_FILE = the highscore file to be used.
XXBOING_LEVELS_DIR = the directory containing the levels.
XXBOING_SOUND_DIR  = the directory containing the sounds.
X
XAlso set the AUDIO_AVAILABLE flag to True or False to enable the audio in
Xthe game if possible. You may want to disable audio for everyone even if it
Xis available. ie: universities.
X
XCheck the audio directory and see if audio is supported by xboing. Then check
Xthe Imakefile and see if it will automatically use the correct audio source.
XIf not then change the default NOaudio.c to the one you want. For NCD & RPLAY
Xusers that's what you'll have to do. Don't forget to set the AUDIO_LIB and the
XAUDIO_INCLUDE variables.
X
X    LINUXaudio.c    - SoundBlaster support on Linux for PC.
X    RPLAYaudio.c    - Support for the rplay sound system.
X    SUNaudio.c      - Sun workstation audio 
X    NCDaudio.c      - NCD X terminal NCDaudio support. See below.
X    HPaudio.c       - HP audio which is .au format?
X    NOaudio.c       - Default - no audio support file.
X	AFaudio.c       - Audiofile sound server. See below.
X
XThe default will be no audio at all. ie: NOaudio.c
X
X
XAudiofile Sound Server
X----------------------
X
XAlso, the Imakefile needs an "-lAF -lAFUtil" added to it for AudioFile.
X-I<audiofileroot>/AF/AFlib.h -L<audiofileroot>/AF/lib
X
X
XNCD Audio Server or NetAudio
X----------------------------
X
XNeeds -laudio -L<ncdaudiolibdir> -I<ncdincludedir>
X
XRplay sound system
X------------------
X
X?
X
X
X
XPlease work on NOaudio.c if you have another machine that you want to post
Xthe sound too. Note that I am not going to support and other file format than
X.au as I'll have sound files everywhere. :-)
X
X**************************************************************************
XSee the troubleshooting bit near the end of the doco if you have problems.
X**************************************************************************
X
XIf you have imake, type:
X
X    xmkmf
X    make depend
X    make all
X
XX11R5 users can type 'xmkmf -a ; make all' if they like.
X
XIf you do not have imake, type:
X
X    cp Makefile.std Makefile
X    make depend
X    make all
X
X
XInstallation
X------------
X
XTry 'xboing -setup' and see if the compilation has gone as you planned.
XThis option will print out useful information about where xboing will look
Xfor its data files.
X
XPlease note that you must be root to install the game. If you are not root
Xthen you can just run XBoing from your own account.
X
XDon't forget to set the $(XBOING_DIR) in the Makefile/Imakefile and re-compile
Xif you don't like where it will be installed.
X
XFor imake users, type:
X
X    make install             - install XBoing binary.
X    make install.man         - install the manual page.
X
XIf you do not have imake then you must first edit the Makefile.std to check
Xthat where you want the program to be installed.
X
X    make install             - install XBoing binary.
X    make install.man         - install the manual page.
X    
XYou should now have XBoing installed and it's manual page. If not, then please
Xread README.problems.
X
X
XHighScore File
X--------------
X
XIt is automatically created and chmoded to 0666. There will also be a personal
Xhighscore file saved in each users account home directory. This keeps their
Xpersonal highscores. If you have problems then touch one and chmod it to
Xsomething that will work for you. ie: rw for all.
X
XGlobal file is different as it now only contains one entry per person. ie:
Xtheir highest score.
X
XNOTE: **** The highscore file format has changed since v1.6. Any old ones 
X           will barf! Global files have one entry now. Just erase them please.

XXBoing Trouble-Shooting
X=======================
X
XUpdated: 27th August 1993
X
XI was hoping you wouldn't be reading this but anyway ...
X
Xmake depend
X
X    Some header files in xboing were not found. Check the includes and see
X    if the Imakefile/Makefile.std includes in the correct directory. If all
X    else fails then xmkmf/cp Ma..std Makefile again and forget it.
X
Xxpm.h
X
X    You must have the Xpm library as explained in the requirements section.
X    XBoing uses the Xpm library extensively. If you have it then please check
X    that the XPMINCLUDE dir is set correctly in the Imakefile/Makefile.std
X
XHeader Files  
X
X    Maybe you have the X11 header files in another place. Please check the 
X    Imakefile or Makefile.std and change the -I directories to your site. 
X    If you are using imake then tell your sysop that imake didn't look
X    in the correct place for the X11 header files. 
X
XHighscore file is corrupt
X
X    I have changed the highscore file format since v1.6. Sorry but it is 
X    much better now and will save times etc. Just delete the old one and 
X    start again. The file locking will not work over NFS.
X
XHighscore file locking problem
X
X    I am currently locking the file with either lockf or flock. lockf() will
X    work over a NFS file system when the lockd deamon is running. Some people
X    with machines that have their bits backwards :-( may have some problems.
X    I may need to work on the highscore file format read and writing. :-(
X
XStrange libraries needed
X
X    Check the Imakefile or Makefile.std and make sure the sysop has installed
X    the Imake.rules correctly. If all else fails just remove them one by one
X    until it compiles.
X
XCrashes with bad drawable
X
X    Make sure that the program is not compiled with -ansi as ansi trigraphs
X    may have been found during compilation and that stuffs up the pixmap data.
X
X    Also check that the version of xpm is the latest ie: 3.2g as people have
X    mentioned that any version below can cause problems. :-(
X
X    Also try with K&R C compiler that is non-ansi and see if that makes any
X    difference.
X
XColourmap is all black
X
X    Don't use the -pointergrab option as some window managers barf when the
X    pointer is grabbed :-(
X
XSound not working & Levels not working
X
X    Check your sound directory and make sure that you don't have any ENV vars
X    set that will be used first.
X
XClicks in sound
X
X    This may be because the sound files have a small header and your audio
X    device may not support .au Sun Audio files so you will hear a small click
X    which is actually the sound header. If it becomes a problem edit the files
X    and remove the first bit of the file until it doesn't click!
X
XAnsi trigraphs
X
X    Try not to use -ansi as it can cause ANSI trigraphs in the data files and
X    that converts a few characters to one causing an XPM error. Bummer.
X
XIf you cannot get it working still and you have tried hard email at the
Xaddress supplied and send along 'xboing -setup' output, obviously if you have
Xgot it compiled!!
X
XPS: You can try xboing -debug to find out which function the program is barfing
X	in. If you can send me the function name with the email it will help.

XXBoing Version 1.7
X==================
X
XUpdated: 27th August 1993
X
X-------------------------------------
XThings that *may* be done in the future
X-------------------------------------
X
XBuiltin level editor. Next of the old block!
X
XHave blocks that drop onto paddle and give you different things. - very hard!
X
Xinvisible blocks that flash every now and then and also when hit. - maybe
X
XGreyscale version or b&w - ages or soonish. Depends. I would have to redisgn 
Xa lot of the game and take out a lot of features.
X
XGravity? Block - not likely.
X
Xput specials in level file that can appear randomly - next version.
X
Xunlimited ammo block - last for entire level - next version.
X
XBall to ball collisions to work. Someone could work on this using vectors to 
Xmake it realistic ie: like billiard balls but not too complicated or slow?
X
XMake multi-player with a paddle at each end of playfield. Long way off!
X
XBTW, the Imakefile claims that AUDIO_AVAILABLE is set to True for HP-UX and
Xyet I can't enable it during the game. One tip: you might like to do a:
Xmaybe way to go - system("cat sound.au >/dev/audio &");
X
Xheadphone jack idea - on non-headphone machines issue message.
Xsuggested by Carl Johnson <carlj@cyclone.bt.co.uk>
X
XWhen creating ball it can be popped. Argg.
X
XPlace all sounds in memory in array when used.
Xsuggested by Xyvind Yrke <oyvind@stavanger.sgp.slb.com>
X
XPeople want autotilt back in place. :-) Arggh.
X
XChange filenames so all sizes are less than 14 chars for shitty unix's. :-(
X
XAutomatically adjust paddle pos when reverse is turn on and off. Sort of done.
X
XMake sure that multiball does work correctly and give you back a ball if you
Xhave more than one on the screen when finishing a level.
X
X
X----------
XKnown Bugs
X----------
X
XSmall cut away on some bricks when bouncing off them.
X
XSometimes the ball zooms straight through the paddle - mostly vertical.
X
XWhen the shrink paddle block gets hit it may not refresh the paddle the
Xbest and leave a bit behind but will be erased if you move the paddle.
X
XMaybe still bugs in the multiball code when more than one ball is moving and
Xa ball dies.
X
XBall can still get stuck in an infinite loop on two solid walls and may 
Xsometimes zoom straight up one wall on the left or right.
X
XUses too much memory in the X Server for some people. he he
X
XI think on the SGI the paddle isn't refreshed between levels? Verify??
