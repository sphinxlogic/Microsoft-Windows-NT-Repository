X                                Revision 7.00
X                        Copyright 1991, Paul Waterman
X
XThis file contains revision 7.00 of the WCST Spoilers.  Revision 7.00
Xincorporates more changes than any previous release of the spoiler files.
XMany new sections have been added, and the entire file has been re-arranged
Xfor maximum usefulness.  In addition, extensive formatting changes have been
Xdone in order to make the tables and text as readable as possible.
XEssentially, the entire file has been revised.
X
XFor revision 7.00, we will be trying something unique.  We will be releasing
Xthe spoiler files in ASCII format on rec.games.hack and comp.sources.games
X(and we have an ongoing commitment to continue doing so in future releases).
XHowever, in addition, we will be offering a laser printed version of the
Xspoilers for sale.
X
XThe commercial version is beautifully formatted on a desktop publishing
Xsystem, and includes "extras" that the public release doesn't have such as
Xpage numbers, a table of contents, a complete index, and eye-pleasing
Xgraphics.  The entire 100+ pages is spiral bound with durable covers for
Xthose late night hacking sessions.  Additionally, the commercial version
Xincludes a useful command summary sheet and several "cheat sheets."  One of
Xthese cheat sheets has a complete summary of all objects available within the
Xgame, and there are also cheat sheets for each object type, which include
Xcomplete price lists, check-off lists, and identifying information.
X
XThis commercial version is available for $13, plus $2.00 postage and
Xhandling.  Also, quantity discounts are available with as few as five copies,
Xso get together with some fellow nethackers from your site and take advantage
Xof the lowest price you can get.

XIntroduction:
X
XOnce upon a time, there was a game called hack.  Hack was a pretty good game,
Xand a lot of people really enjoyed playing it.  Then a strange and wonderful
Xcreature called "The Dev Team" got hold of it, and hack was never the same
Xagain.  For starters, it suddenly got a name change, and was called nethack.
XBut the biggest change was in the game itself.  No longer was it a fun
Xafternoon show to watch in black and white on a nine inch set.  It suddenly
Xbecame a three dimensional color holovision show with dolby surround sound
Xand much, much more.  (Our thanks to the dev team for a job well done.)
X
XThe problem with this is that people started getting addicted to the action,
Xthe adventure, their character getting killed over and over again...  In
Xorder to prevent the untimely demise of characters whose rated lifespan was
Xabout double the actual lifespan, a bunch of people came together and began
Xgiving each other hints about how to dodge that nasty shopkeeper, and how to
Xget rid of that awful wizard, and this worked well... for a time.
X
XThere was still a problem with this, though, for once the suggestion was
Xgiven, unless carefully hoarded away, it was gone forever, and there were
Xalways new people who hadn't heard the suggestions.  Thus, the nethack
Xspoiler file was created.
X
XWithin this file is a large collection of lore about the game of nethack.
XSome of it may not be true, but we have made the best effort possible to
Xverify all of the information contained herein.  Much of it has been
Xverified, corrected, or added since the original posting of revision one on
Xthe net.
X
XAlso, we would like to request that any corrections, modifications,
Xsuggestions, etc. be e-mailed directly to nhspoil@wheaton.UUCP and not posted
Xto the net.  We will attempt to verify any information sent us and then we
Xwill both add it to the spoiler file (for the next release) and post an
Xofficial correction/addition to rec.games.hack.
X
XNote:  Please do not send e-mail to us asking for a copy of the spoilers or
Xfor a copy of nethack itself (or the source code, etc.).  We do not honor
Xthese requests, and often just ignore them.
X
XBe warned:  If you use the knowledge contained herein, your game will never
Xbe the same.  Your horizons will suddenly be expanded, but you may end up
Xthinking that the game is less than it once was.  That is the risk you must
Xtake if you choose to read this file.
X
XGood luck, and happy hacking!
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XRevision Numbers:
X
XIn order to keep a decent idea of how the spoiler file is progressing, we
Xhave set up an official policy on how Revision Numbers will change.  Any
Xminor revisions corrections or amplifications will advance the revision
Xnumber by .01. New sections added (such as this one), or complete re-writes
Xof existing sections will advance the revision number by .10.  Any complete
Xrewrite of the entire file (just in case - it might actually happen) will
Xadvance the revision number to the next integer.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XCredits:
X
XWell, this should actually be a very large list.  Among others, it should
Xinclude almost everyone who has posted any hints of value to the net within
Xabout the last year (or even longer in some cases).  Some people who have
Xmade contributions to the cause of these spoilers above and beyond the call
Xof duty, however, are listed here:

Xcause, but don't see your name listed here - don't get us wrong.  It's not
Xthat we're ungrateful!  We probably just nuked your name by mistake!
X
XNote:  All names are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and not by
Xorder of importance of contribution.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XUsing The Spoilers:
X
XThere's really not much to say on this subject, other than a few intuitive
Xpointers.  How you use the spoilers is simple:  You read them, and apply the
Xknowledge contained within to your game of nethack.
X
XThose of you who are using the commercial version of the spoilers will have a
Xcomplete index at your disposal, which should aid greatly in looking up just
Xabout anything you'd like to know about.  For those of you who are using the
Xpublic version, however, we do have one major hint for getting at what you
Xwant within the file quickly.
X
XThe section titles tend to be fairly unique, and are always followed by a
Xcolon.  This should make it very simple to get to whatever section you want
Xquickly.  Just load the file into your editor (or if you're on a unix system,
Xeven use 'more' for that matter), and use the search function to look for the
Xsection.  For instance, from within more or vi, use the slash key ("/") and
Xwhat you'd like to search for ("Armor:" for example).
X
XThis technique is also very useful for finding every reference to a
Xparticular topic.  If you'd like to know about wishing for instance, just
Xsearch for every occurance of the word "wish" in the file.

X          ----------------------------------------------------------
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XCommon Questions:
X
XQ: I've made it to the first level of hell (probably by falling through a
X     trap in the castle level), but I can't find any down staircases?  How
X     can I get down farther?
XA: You'll find that if you're confused and read a scroll of teleportation
X     you'll get teleported to a different level.  Cursed scrolls of
X     teleportation and level teleporters also do this.  If you have teleport
X     control (via a ring or intrinsic), you can choose what level to teleport
X     to.  Teleport down to about level fifty and then work your way up.
X
XQ: I've got the amulet, and I'm on my way up through the levels of Hell, but
X     I'm stuck.  I'm in a relatively small area in the middle of the level, I
X     can't find a way out, and there's no stairway up - only one going back
X     down.
XA: Sounds like you've found Vlad's Tower.  Try going back down two levels and
X     exiting from the base of the tower.  Then try looking in the upper left
X     hand corner of the maze for another stairway going up.  The tower levels
X     always have an up staircase placed there.  See the section on SPECIAL
X     LEVELS for more information.
X
XQ: I've got the amulet, and I'm on my way up, but the Wizard keeps popping in
X     and I'm tired of killing him.  Is there anything I can do to get him off
X     of my case?
XA: Most things you can do won't stop him from coming after you again.  I saw
X     a post once on rec.games.hack that had about thirty suggestions, but
X     none of them would work.  Basically, the only way to stop him from
X     coming after you is to exploit a "feature" of the game.  Wait near the
X     up staircase for him.  Then, throw a potion of paralysis at him.  During
X     the 1-15 turns that he will be paralyzed, go up the staircase.  He won't
X     come after you any more. The reason for this is that the game only
X     updates the paralysis counters for creatures on the same level as you -
X     thus, it realizes that the Wizard is still around, but paralyzed, and it
X     won't un-paralyze him unless you go back to that level.  (Incidentally,
X     don't count on this working in the next version of nethack.)
X
XQ: I'm in the endgame and I'm in a long hallway that runs north-south.  I
X     can't seem to find a secret door, though, and I can't teleport.  How do
X     I get to the other side of the level?
XA: Be patient and keep searching.  There's a secret door in the upper left
X     wall of the corridor.  However, there's a lot of nasty creatures in the
X     center of the endgame level, so if you're willing to sacrifice the
X     experience, and you can polymorph, it might be better to turn into a
X     xorn and go around the center area.
X
XQ: I've heard a lot about "named weapons," but I can't seem to get one.  How
X     can I get one?
XA: Well, there are five ways of getting named weapons, also known as
X     artifacts.  The first, and perhaps most obvious one, is to wish for it.
X     When you are asked what you want to wish for, type "a (blessed) (+n)
X     [weapon type] named [name]," where blessed and +n (be sure to substitute
X     a number for n!) are optional, and the weapon type is correct for that
X     named weapon (see the ARTIFACTS section and WISHING section for more
X     information).  Another way to get a named weapon is to have it given to
X     you by your deity.  If you sacrifice (#offer) enough, eventually you
X     will probably see an object appear at your feet.  This will be a named
X     weapon.  A third way to get a named weapon is to find it.  Some of them
X     will just be randomly generated (although very rare), so be on the
X     lookout.  You will know it's named when you pick it up - it's not
X     necessary to identify it.  You can also gain some of the named weapons
X     by simply finding the appropriate weapon type and using the #name
X     command.  Sting and Orcrist are notable in this regard.  Finally, you
X     can get Excalibur by #dipping a normal longsword in a fountain (see
X     FOUNTAIN EFFECTS for more details about this).
X
XQ: I was playing a character and he/she got polymorphed into a new human.  I
X     was asked to give the character a different name, and now I can't get
X     the character back.  What do I do?
XA: Nethack allows you to have multiple characters with different names, and
X     whenever nethack saves a character it always uses the character's name,
X     regardless of whether that character used to have a different name.  In
X     order to access a character of a particular name (or start one with a
X     different name), the easiest thing is to give nethack a -u flag and your
X     name.  For instance, type "nethack -u name" where "name" is your
X     character's name ("Endiel" in my case - and I'll send you updates to the
X     spoilers if you can figure out where it came from).
X
XQ: I was playing nethack when I hit the '!' key by mistake.  Now I'm sitting
X     at my prompt, and I don't know what's happened to my game.  What gives?
XA: In nethack, the '!' key will create a shell for you.  What this does is
X     allow you to quickly pop out of nethack in order to do stuff, without
X     messing up your nethack game.  On most systems, you can exit the shell
X     and get back to your nethack game by typing "exit."
X
XQ: I've found a hawaiian shirt lying around, and I've heard them mentioned in
X     the spoilers.  What use are they?
XA: Basically, Hawaiian shirts let you effectively drop your AC by several
X     more points, as they can be worn under a suit of armor (the more pieces
X     of armor, the better the possible AC).  When not enchanted, they don't
X     do much good (and actually can do harm, as shopkeepers will try to cheat
X     you if they see it).  But if it's enchanted and under a suit of armor or
X     cloak (where the shopkeeper can't see it), it can be quite useful.
X
XQ: I've been punished, and I can't stand lugging around this ball and chain.
X     What can I do to get rid of it?
XA: There are several ways to accomplish this.  In the meantime, though,
X     unless you have a pretty good weapon, pick up the iron ball and wield
X     it.  To get it off, try reading a scroll (or casting a spell) of remove

XQ: I've come up with some cool ideas for additions/modifications to nethack.
X     What should I do with them?
XA: You should send your ideas (also bugs) to nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.
X     Don't expect to receive back a confirmation that they received it - the
X     nethack-bugs account receives a lot of mail.
X
XQ: I'm interested in making some modifications to nethack (or already have
X     done so), and think they would make a cool addition to the game.  I'd
X     like to make these modifications/additions public.  What should I do?
XA: Once again, send some e-mail to nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.  Here's
X     some hints as to what all you should send:  1) If you have already made
X     the modifications, make sure it is well documented with comments, and
X     then send the changes (*not* the whole source code) to the Dev Team (at
X     nethack-bugs...).  2) Send a description of the planned (or finished)
X     code changes and how this affects other sections of the code.  3)
X     Include a description of how you think the idea will impact the game,
X     and why you think your idea is good or necessary.  4) Be prepared for a
X     rejection on grounds that appear totally arbitrary to you.  If you do,
X     consider the reasons given and think about re-working your ideas and
X     repeating the process.  5) If you really think your ideas are worthwhile
X     but the Dev Team refuses to agree (possible, but unlikely), consider
X     distributing them as optional add-ons through net newsgroups such as
X     rec.games.hack and comp.sources.games.
X
XQ: I have these spoilers, but where can I get a copy of nethack from?
XA: Please don't send e-mail to us!  We're not in the habit of sending out
X     copies of nethack, and rarely reply to messages asking where to get it
X     from.  Information is posted on a regular basis on rec.games.hack about
X     where to get the latest version of nethack.
X
XQ: I was playing nethack via modem from my personal computer when I lost the
X     connection.  I dialed back into the system immediately, and my login was
X     sitting there idle, still playing nethack.  What should I do to get it
X     to save out?
XA: This problem tends to happen only on unix systems.  If you're non-
X     technical, and don't know much about unix, you should contact the games
X     administrator, system administrator, or any person with superuser
X     priveleges and ask them to "please send a hangup signal to my nethack
X     process."  If you know a little more, you might want to try doing this
X     yourself.  First of all, find the process ID (PID) of the nethack
X     process.  This can be accomplished with the 'ps' command (see your
X     manual for more information about the ps command).  Next, use the 'kill'
X     command to send a 'HUP' (hangup) to the process (again, see your manual
X     for more information about the kill command).  Don't send a 'KILL'
X     signal, as this will cause the game to die instantly and not save.
X     Sending a 'HUP' should cause the program to exit, saving your game, and
X     you should then be able to load it in again normally.  If the computer
X     won't allow you to kill the process, your nethack game is probably
X     running with special priveleges, and you'll need to contact the games
X     administrator, system administrator, or a superuser in order to send it
X     a hangup signal.

XGeneral Hints:
X
XLizard corpses, like food rations, won't ever spoil.
XIt is a great idea to give like-aligned priests 400*your level in gold.
XIf you attack a rival priest in his temple, his god will fight for him, so
X     make it your temple first (i.e. convert the altar).
XA guaranteed way to change your alignment is to kill a unicorn of your
X     alignment and offer the fresh corpse at an altar of the god whose
X     alignment you wish to convert to.
XFriendly monsters may become tame if you give them the right food (try
X     tripe).
XZombie and mummy corpses are already old corpses, so can't be sacrificed
X     (however, they can be eaten before they spoil).
XThe bigger the sacrifice, the better the reward.
XEating a clove of garlic cures lycanthropy.  Prayer can too.
XA ring of warning warns:  white, pink, red, ruby, purple, and run at black.
XKicking is great for killing monsters at low levels (especially for Samurais
X     and Priests).
XDon't kick in shop doors that are closed for inventory.
XA wand of digging makes a quick way down (use '>' for the direction).
XFill trap doors with boulders.  You can also cross water this way.
XWhen dipping in holy water, amber means uncursed, light blue means blessed.
XDipping a corpse in holy water will make it take longer to rot.
XDipping a dart may identify a potion of sickness (it poisons the dart).
XTo make a scroll blank and or holy/unholy water normal, zap a wand of
X     cancellation at it.
XTo use a wand on yourself, use '.' for the direction.
XBlessed magic lamps always give wishes if they have a charge.
XWhen you run into a great number of statues, don't look out.
XZap monsters that engulf you with a wand of digging.
XTo find the mimics in a shop, walk in, then back out.
XTo create a scroll with a magic marker just write the name of the scroll on a
X     blank scroll (i.e. "magic mapping").
XIf you are wearing dragon scale mail and get polymorphed, you will polymorph
X     into the same type of dragon as your dragon scale mail.
XBeing magic resistant prevents teleport traps from working properly.
XYou cannot pick up items while levitating, therefore it is not always good to
X     be levitating.  However, vampire lords levitate but can pick up objects.
XIf you want to stop levitating, just fly over a sink, and you will.
XMirrors may be used to scare some monsters.  They also, of course, kill
X     Medusa.
XIf you cannot eat it now, tin it or freeze it.
XYou can wield a cockatrice corpse if you're wearing gloves, but don't go down
X     stairs while carrying one, especially if you are overloaded.  They are
X     wonderful for clearing out zoos, barracks, and throne rooms.
XTo determine whether an item is blessed, regular, or cursed, drop it on an
X     altar.  If the glow is amber, it's blessed.  Black means cursed.
XDropping water or unholy water at a lawful altar will turn it into holy
X     water.
XDropping water (holy or unholy) at a neutral altar will make it normal water.
XDropping water or holy water at a chaotic altar will make it unholy water.
XA ring of levitation will protect you from a xan (they're real short).
XIt is possible to lose telepathy if you are not chaotic and you kill a
X     peaceful human.
XGremlins can steal intrinsics from you.
XIt is possible to jump through an escaped trapdoor by hitting '>'.

X          |                     The Character                      |
X          ----------------------------------------------------------
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XAlignment:
X
XEvery character and monster in nethack has an alignment.  Even some objects
X(specifically artifacts, or named weapons) have alignments.  Describing
Xexactly what alignment is and what it entails is tricky, however.  Expressed
Xsimply, alignment is what side you've aligned yourself with - good, evil, or
Xneither.  What is considered "good" and "evil" in nethack is very much the
Xtraditional medieval picture of good and evil.  Thus, a brief description of
Xthe three alignments and the behavior expected from a character of that
Xalignment follows:
X
XChaotic:  A chaotic character has basically aligned him/herself with the side
Xof evil.  He/she likes doing things that would normally be considered "bad"
Xjust for the joy of it.  Chaotics tend to have the attitude of "looking out
Xfor number one."  A chaotic character will probably kill anything that walks,
Xjust for fun, and will tend to rob shops as a principle.
X
XNeutral:  Neutrality tends to be a refusal to take sides.  The attitude of a
Xneutral is basically "live and let live."  A character who is neutral
Xprobably won't kill creatures that aren't bothering it, but won't have any
Xqualms about killing those that do.  A neutral character won't really care
Xabout robbing from shops, as long as it will benefit him/her.
X
XLawful:  A lawful character has aligned him/herself with the side of good.
XHe/she will tend to follow societal rules, even if it won't benefit him/her.
XA lawful character will have the attitude that "there is a higher good."
XLawful characters usually will try to befriend other creatures, but may
Xattempt to hunt down and kill those creatures that are by their very nature
X"evil."  (Chaotic monsters especially would be considered to be "evil" by a
Xlawful type.)  A lawful character would never even think of robbing a shop.
X
XNow, here's how alignment works in nethack:  There is a number associated
Xwith your alignment, which will determine if you are "stridently aligned,"
Xetc.  This number is increased for every action you perform which is in
Xkeeping with your alignment, and decreased for every action you perform which
Xwould be against your alignment.  Thus, if a lawful character were to rob a
Xshop or kill a lawful creature, this alignment would be decreased.  If a
Xchaotic character, on the other hand, were to do the very same thing, the
Xnumber would be increased.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XCarrying Capacity:
X
XIn order to compute the carrying capacity of a character, you need to know
Xthree things:  the character's strength, level, and if either leg is wounded.
XStrength is divided into two parts, and is shown as str/nn.  Str ranges from
X1 to 18 (and can jump to 25 with gauntlets of power), and nn ranges from 01
Xto ** (** is used since 100 won't fit in the two digit space).
X
XThere are two different methods for computing your carrying capacity,
Xdepending on how your game of nethack was originally compiled.  On most
Xsystems, nethack is compiled with the HARD option set to on.  If that is the
Xcase on your system, use Method 1 for computing your carrying capacity.  If
Xyour system has HARD set to off, use Method 2 for computing your carrying
Xcapacity.
X
XIn either case, how strength affects carrying capacity varies depending upon
Xthe strength.  The character's level is always multiplied by five and added
Xinto the carrying capacity (although in Method 1, you only can count the
Xfirst 16 levels for this), and finally, for each wounded leg (either the
Xleft, right, or both can be wounded) you have to subtract ten from the
Xcarrying capacity.  Thus, the formulae for figuring out your carrying
Xcapacity are as follows:
X
XMethod 1:
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
X| Strength | Capacity                                                       |
X|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
X| 1-18     | 5*level + 5*str - 10*(wounded legs)                            |
X| 18/01-25 | 5*level(up to level 16) + 40 - 10*(wounded legs)               |
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
XMethod 2:
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
X| Strength     | Capacity                                                   |
X|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
X| 1-18         | 5*level + 5*str - 10*(wounded legs)                        |
X| 18/01-18/50  | 5*level + 90 + nn - 10*(wounded legs)                      |
X| 18/51-18/75  | 5*level + 140 + 2*(nn-50) - 10*(wounded legs)              |
X| 18/76-18/90  | 5*level + 190 + 3*(nn-75) - 10*(wounded legs)              |
X| 18/91-18/95  | 5*level + 235 + 5*(nn-90) - 10*(wounded legs)              |
X| 18/96-18/99  | 5*level + 260 + 10*(nn-95) - 10*(wounded legs)             |
X| 18/**        | 5*level + 410 - 10*(wounded legs)                          |
X| 25           | 5*level + 380 - 10*(wounded legs)                          |
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
XInterestingly enough, with Method 2, a strength of 25 doesn't allow as much
Xof a carrying capacity as 18/** does.
X
XIn either case, when you are levitating, your carrying capacity is
Xautomatically at maximum.
