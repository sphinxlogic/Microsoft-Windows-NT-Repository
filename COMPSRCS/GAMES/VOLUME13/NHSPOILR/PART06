XRing Effects:
X
XNote that all rings except +0 rings increase your food consumptions to
Xvarying degrees.
X
XAdornment - Will raise your charisma by the bonus on the ring.
XCold resistance - You become invulnerable to cold, including backblasts from
X     the wand and freezing spheres.
XConflict - Causes monsters to attack each other instead of you if they are
X     next to each other.
XFire resistance - You become invulnerable to fire, including backblasts from
X     the wand and (red) dragon's breath.
XGain strength - Increments (or decrements if cursed) your strength by the
X     appropriate amount.
XIncrease damage - Increases the damage you do to monsters when hitting them.
XPoison resistance - You are invulnerable to poison (including poisonous
X     corpses, but not rotted ones, and all poison stings, bites, and
X     potions).
XPolymorph - Will occasionally cause you to randomly polymorph into another
X     creature.
XPolymorph control - Allows you to choose what monster you turn into if you
X     get polymorphed.
XProtection - Increases your armor class and (probably) your saving throws by
X     the appropriate amount.  (Or decreases if cursed.)
XProtection from shape changers - Forces chameleons and other shape changers
X     to take on their true form.
XRegeneration - Replenishes HP at about 1 a move, but increases food
X     consumption a lot.
XSearching - Will automatically look for hidden traps/doors.
XShock resistance - Lightning/other electrical resistance.
XStealth - Monsters don't wake up when you enter a room.
XTeleportation - Teleports you randomly around every once in a while.
XTeleport control - Gives you control of teleport destination, no matter what
X     does the teleporting.  If you try to teleport into a wall or monster,
X     you get a random teleport.
XWarning - Will glow different colors when different monsters are near.

XIdentifying Rings:
X
XTo figure out what a ring is, again start by figuring out if the ring is
Xcursed or not.  If the ring is cursed, don't throw it away!  It's a prime
Xcandidate for identification through the first method:  chuck it down a sink,
Xand see what happens.  See the SINK EFFECTS section for more information
Xabout what happens when various ring types are thrown down a sink.  If the
Xring isn't cursed, it probably is somewhat beneficial.  Try it on.  If
Xsomething happens immediately, you'll know what it is (levitation, for
Xexample).  Some rings can only be identified after being worn for a while -
Xfor example, a ring of polymorph will only polymorph you every once in a
Xwhile, and a ring of teleport also only works now and then.  Other rings can
Xonly be guessed at -for instance, if you suddenly can find secret doors
Xeasier than you have been, it might be a ring of searching.  If you suddenly
Xare killing monsters more easily, it might be a ring of increase damage.

X
X* Determining your chances for successfully enchanting armor is fairly
Xsimple. Your chance for succeeding (and not causing the item to disintegrate
Xdue to over enchantment) is totally dependent upon the current bonus of the
Xitem.  If the current bonus is three or less (five or less for elven mithril
Xcoats), you will always succeed.  Otherwise, you have one chance out of
Xwhatever the current bonus of the item is.  In other words, if the bonus is
X+4, you have a 1/4 or 25% chance of being successful.  If the bonus is +8,
Xyou have a 1/8 or 12.5% chance of being successful.  Thus, it is
Xtheoretically possible to enchant armor up to +maxint, but the laws of
Xprobability would not favor it!
X
X** Chances for successfully enchanting weapons are far easier.  Basically,
Xyou will always succeed if the weapon is at +5 or less.  Once you're over
Xthat, you have a 2/3 chance of being successful each time, regardless of the
Xbonus.

X     of tricks, or a wand of cancellation into a bag of holding.  Both items
X     and contents will blow up.
XBag of tricks - will allow you to create a monster whenever you activate it.
XBlindfold - makes you blind.  Useful when you have telepathy.
XBugle - will awaken soldiers on level.  Useful for getting into castle.
XChest - holds things, but is very heavy.
XCredit card - can be used to open locked doors.
XCrystal ball - can be used to detect things on level.
XDrum - awakens monsters; may scare them away.
XDrum of earthquake - will initiate an earthquake whose intensity depends on
X     player level.  That is, it creates random pits.
XExpensive camera - can be flashed at monsters to blind them.  Can also blind
X     self (useful if you don't have a blindfold).
XFigurine - when activated will provide a tame pet of the same type as the
X     figurine.
XFire horn - when played will act as a wand of fire; a ray of flame shoots out
X     in desired direction.
XFlute - may calm snakes if player has enough dexterity.  Can also be used to
X     get into the castle.
XFrost horn - when played will act as a wand of cold; a ray of cold shoots out
X     in desired direction.
XHarp - may calm nymph if player has enough dexterity.  Can also be used to
XHorn - will awaken monsters; range depends on player level.  May also scare
X     monsters.
XIce box - will prevent monster corpses from spoiling if they are promptly
X     placed within the ice box.
XKey - differently shaped keys will open differently shaped locks.
XLamp - will light up a room when activated.
XLarge box - holds things, but is very heavy.
XLeash - will keep your pet with you, even if you fall through a trapdoor,
X     teleport, etc.  However, your pet tends to get in your way more.
XLock pick - used to open locked doors and chests.
XMagic flute - may put monsters to sleep; area of effect depends on player
X     level.
XMagic harp - charms monsters; area of effect depends on player level.
XMagic lamp - if rubbed, a djinni will appear.  Djinnis from blessed lamps
X     will always give wishes; from normal lamps may give a wish (random);
X     from cursed lamps they will never give a wish.  May be recharged once
X     with a blessed scroll of charging.
XMagic marker - useful for writing graffiti on dungeon floors.  Also can be
X     used to write spells on blank scrolls.
XMagic whistle - will teleport all of your pets on the level to the same room
X     as you.
XMirror - can scare some monsters.  Also useful for reflecting gaze attacks.
X     Can be used in conjunction with blindfold to determine relative position
X     of medusa or Wizard of Yendor.
XPick-axe - can be used to dig through walls.  Also useful as a weapon.
XSack - will hold items, freeing inventory space.
XSkeleton key - will open any locked door or chest.
XStethescope - will tell you stats on creature applied to (HP, level, AC,
X     gold, etc.).
XTinning kit - allows you to tin monster corpses to take with you.  Heavy.
XTin opener - allows you to open tins easier.
XWhistle - when blown, your pets will start heading in your direction.  Other
X     monsters may do likewise, though.

XIdentifying Tools:
X
XOnce again, make sure that the item is not cursed before playing around with
Xit.  Most tools are fairly obvious as to their function.  For instance, a
Xblindfold is always a blindfold, with no other magical properties.  Certain
Xitems (horns, for instance) will have more than one type that appear the same
Xthough.  Here's how you can figure out what they are:
X
XBags - first of all, drop the bag on the ground and #loot it.  If you feel
Xsomething furry, it's a bag of tricks.  Otherwise, load up until you can't
Xcarry anything more.  Then dump some stuff into the bag (by applying it).  If
Xyou can then pick up more, it's a bag of holding.
X
XDrums - activate the drum.  If it's a drum of earthquake, you'll know it
Ximmediately from the pits opening up around you.
X
XFlutes - try playing the flute when you have several monsters around you.  If
Xthey go to sleep, it's a magical flute.
X
XHarps - try playing the harp when you have several monsters around you.  If
Xthey become charmed (tame), you have a magic harp.
X
XHorns - activate the horn, tell it to improvise, and give it a direction (if
Xit asks).  You'll immediately notice the effect if it's magical.
X
XKeys - try a key on various locks.  If it appears to open all of them, it's
Xprobably a skeleton key.  (Note, however, that a credit card works just as
Xwell, and is lighter.)
X
XLamps - try activating the lamp.  If it has no oil, it's a magic lamp.
X
XWhistles - try blowing it.  If it produces a high whistle, it's normal.  A
Xwierd whistling will be a magic whistle.

X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XIdentifying Wands:
X
XWhen identifying a wand, I generally start by engraving anything (usually I
Xuse 'xxxxx') on a spot with my fingers (use the '-' key when asked what to
Xengrave with).  Next, I try to engrave with the wand.  The reason that I
Xengrave something else first is simple:  a wand of polymorph will change the
Xwriting to something else, thus identifying it.  Also, a wand of cancellation
Xor make invisible will make any writing already on the spot disappear.  A
Xwand of teleport will teleport the writing to another spot on the level.
XBarring these four wand types, many wands will be either be immediately
Xidentified upon trying to engrave (for instance, a wand of light will light
Xup the room or a wand wishing will give you a wish), and failing that, you
Xcan often figure out what the wand is based upon the message that you're
Xgiven (see WAND EFFECTS above for effects that occur when engraving).
X
XIf engraving doesn't identify the wand, find a handy monster to zap the wand
Xat (not your pet - they're not invincible).  Make sure you're standing on a
Xdiagonal from the monster, so the wand won't bounce back at you.  Now, zap
Xthe wand and see what happens.  You'll often be able to immediately figure
Xout what happened.  (A brief note here:  be careful not to mistake make
X
Xinvisible for teleport - just because the monster disappears doesn't mean
Xit's not still there!)
X
XIf you still can't figure out what it is, try zapping it when you're near
Xwhere you think a secret door is (to check for secret door detection) if it's
Xnon-directional, or zap it at a doorway (to check for opening or locking) if
Xit's directional.
X
XFailing all of these tests usually means it's a wand of nothing.

XArtifacts:
X
XArtifacts, also known as named weapons, are the most powerful weapons in the
Xgame.  They can be wished for, granted by your god, and some of them can
Xa longsword in a fountain (see FOUNTAIN EFFECTS), and Sting or Orcrist can be
Xobtained by naming the appropriate weapons.  Polymorphing a regular weapon
Xinto an artifact is no longer possible.
X
XArtifacts may also have special features.  These special features are
Xexplained below.  Finally, all artifacts have an alignment.  This affects
Xyour chances of getting a given weapon from your deity (i.e. a lawful god
Xwill not bestow a neutral weapon).
X
XCertain weapons will have a monster listed under the what column.  If so, the
Xartifact's bonuses are only gained against that type of monster.  Against
Xother creatures the artifact fights as a regular weapon of its type.
X
XFor more information on how to compute hit probabilities, how much damage an
Xartifact does, and what the relative hit and damage bonuses are, see the
Xsections on HIT PROBABILITY and DAMAGE.

X
XThese are the special abilities:
X
Xcold - The extra damage done is cold damage, and as a result will not affect
X     cold resistant creatures.
Xdefend - This will defend you against whatever special attack type the
X     artifact has.  Excalibur and Stormbringer defend against level draining
X     attacks (even though Excalibur can't drain levels itself), Frost brand
X     defends against cold cold based attacks (i.e. gives cold resistance),
X     and Fire brand defends against fire based attacks (i.e. gives fire
X     resistance).
Xdrain level - This will drain a level from the creature attacking,
X     effectively making it less powerful as well as removing eight hp from
X     it.
Xfire - The extra damage done is fire damage, and as a result will not affect
X     fire resistant creatures.
Xsearch - Will aid you in searching, much as a ring of searching.
Xseek - This should (eventually) "aid you in seeking objects." Currently, this
X     ability is unimplemented.
Xshock - The extra damage done is electrical damage, and as a result will not
X     affect shock resistant creatures.
Xwarn - Will warn you when more monsters more powerful than you are around,
X     much as a ring of warning.
X
XAlso, note that Excalibur, if gained via dipping in a fountain or via
Xbecoming the Hand of Elbereth, will be rust proof.  Stormbringer, if gained
Xvia becoming the Hand of Elbereth will also be rust proof.  Stormbringer and
XExcalibur, if gained via other means (including wishing), as well as all
Xother named weapons, are not rust proof unless they are rust proofed by a
Xplayer character (i.e. you rust proof it yourself or find it on a bones
Xlevel, and the previous owner had rust proofed it).

XNethack Abuse:
X
XThis section details several scenarios that most experienced players would
Xterm "Nethack Abuse."  They generally involve characters with specific items
Xand specific methods for quickly going up levels or gaining many items.  For
Xprevious versions of nethack this section would have been much larger, but
Xthe dev team has (quite intelligently) removed many of the more blatant
Xmethods of abuse (such as polypiling for wands of wishing).
X
XScenario 1:  Sinks can be a wonderful means to gain levels, items of all
Xsorts, and intrinsics.  This is all possible because a sink, when kicked,
Xwill often disgorge a black pudding, and black puddings divide when attacked.
XThis means that with just a few extra props you can quickly gain all the
Xaforementioned items.  First of all, you'll need some way of protecting
Xyourself from the puddings.  This is best accomplished by a scroll of scare
Xmonster or engraving Elbereth on the ground (either use something that will
Xmake a permanent inscription or have a means of levitating over the
Xengraving, because you'll scuff it out otherwise).  Do this on a spot
Xadjacent to the sink.
X
XNext, find a room with a sink in it.  You'll need to carefully prepare this
Xroom for your upcoming fun.  Shut (and lock if possible) all the doors into
Xthe room.  If any of the exits don't have doors, engrave Elbereth in the
Xdoorway to prevent other monsters from bothering you.  Also, make sure your
Xpet is out of the room, and stays out (it'll probably get killed otherwise).
XTry dropping something cursed in any open doorways.  That'll keep it out.
X
XNow, go back to the spot that you've prepared next to the sink and kick the
Xsink until it disgorges a black pudding.  When the black pudding gets close,
Xhit it.  It'll probably divide.  Keep hitting the black puddings - you'll
Xoften divide them, eventually kill them, and when you run out, kick the sink
Xa few more times until you get another one.  Eat the fresh black pudding
Xcorpses to gain intrinsics, pick up the stuff that they leave lying around,
Xand soak up those experience points for killing them.
X
XOf course, all of this is sweetened immensely if you happen to have an altar
Xnearby.  Keep sacrificing the black pudding corpses and you'll get all sorts
Xof wonderful things!
X
XScenario 2:  (This isn't really a major "abuse" type, as it does fall under
Xthe planned scope of the game, but nevertheless...)  Ever found a wand of
Xpolymorph and wondered what it's useful for?  Many people find one useful for
Xpolymorphing ;pets into something nasty, or for polymorphing themselves and
Xhoping to turn into something powerful, but one thing that a lot of people
Xdon't know is that you can aim a wand of polymorph at an item or pile of
Xitems, or even up to five piles of items lined up in a row, and it will
Xpolymorph every item in all the piles.  Thus, if you need a particular item,
Xthis can be a way to get it - just create it yourself via polymorphing!
X
XWhen polypiling (as the resident nethackers term it), it is important to
Xremember a few things.  First of all, all items will remain within the same
Xobject class when polymorphed.  Thus, a weapon become a different weapon
Xafter being polymorphed, a ring will become a ring, a scroll will become a
Xscroll, etc.  There are two exceptions to this rule.  The first is that a
Xunicorn horn or a worm tooth will become a weapon when polymorphed.  The
Xsecond is that a dragon corpse will become dragon scale mail of that type of
Xdragon when polymorphed.
X
XThe next thing to remember is that items will retain charges,
Xblessing/curses, bonuses, etc., when polymorphed.  Thus, a wand will still
Xhave the same number of charges after it's polymorphed, a sword will still
Xhave the same blessing/curse after being polymorphed, and will still be plus
Xor minus whatever it was before.  Thus, it's a good plan to remove all the
Xcurses on items (along with any minuses on weapons) before polypiling.  This
Xcan be accomplished by zapping a wand of cancellation at the item(s).  Just
Xbe careful, though, because this will also remove blessings and bonuses that
Xthe weapon might have, which you might want to keep.
X
XThe final rule to remember is that certain "polypile abuses" which used to be
Xquite common no longer work.  You can no longer polymorph a wand into a wand
Xof wishing, and you can no longer polymorph a tool into a magic lamp.  Thus,
Xyou can't gain (basically) infinite wishes.  Also, it is no longer possible
Xto gain named weapons (artifacts) via polypiling.
X
XOh, one of the nice things to remember about poly-piling is that corpses will
Xalways be turned into a regular type of food, that is not spoiled.  So, if
Xyou kill off a large room full of monsters, pile up the corpses and zap them
Xall with the wand of polymorph.  You'll end up with a pile of food rations,
Xmelons, candy bars, slime molds, and the like, which won't spoil, unlike the
Xcorpses.  This can also be a handy trick to get tins of spinach.
X
XScenario 3:  Another classical form of nethack abuse is known as the "Troll
XDance of Death."  It is named this because of the fact that trolls have the
Xuncanny ability to come back from the dead if the corpse is not disposed of.
XHowever, no matter how many times a troll dies, you always get experience
Xpoints for killing him, and there's always a chance that he'll be carrying
Xsomething when he dies, even if he wasn't the last time you killed him.
X
XThus, once you have a fairly powerful character, if you want to gain
Xexperience points and possibility quite a few good items, find a troll and
Xengage him in the dance of death.  Kill him, then pick up anything good you
Xmight find on the corpse.  Wait for a bit (whilst regaining hit points) until
Xhe raises from the dead, and then kill him again.  You can keep this up
Xbasically indefinitely, and the only precautions you might want to take are
Xto prevent other creatures from entering the room where you're having fun.
XThis can be easily accomplished by engraving Elbereth in the doorways.  Have
Xfun!

XExpected In Version 3.1:
X
XMany people have wondered about the fabled version 3.1 of Nethack.  This new
Xversion has been in the works by the nethack "Dev Team" for a period of more
Xthan a year now, and it is still hush-hush, with no release date(s) given or
Xprojected.  We have, however, managed to glean a few pieces of information
Xabout version 3.1 of nethack, and have included them here for you.
X
XSTOP DROOLING!
X
XAll right then...  On to the details:
X
XMessages will be more verbose when you are using artifacts.  For instance,
XStormbringer currently tells you "The black blade drains life from the
X(insert poor hapless creature's name here)."  Fire brand, for instance, might
Xsay "The fiery blade burns the (monster)," or, if the monster was immune,
X"The (monster) seems not to be affected by the flame of your blade."
X
XThe bug that has been running around for quite some time now which allows
Xbags of holding to hold basically limitless quantities of stuff (by playing
Xwith the blessed/cursed  status of the bag) will be fixed.  Thus, some of the
Xscores that were being obtained by dilithium crystaldiving will be much more
Xdifficult to get, because the amount of dilithium you can carry out of the
Xdungeon will be severely limited.
X
XThe entire vision and display system of nethack has been re-written.  Among
Xother things, this will fix the annoying problem of teleported stuff not
Xshowing up on your screen or creating blank spots randomly scattered around
Xthe screen.  Question:  Will this mean that nethack will now have an improved
Xline of sight algorithm, similar to the one currently being used in Moria?
X
XNew ranged effects have been added.  This will allow, for instance, fireballs
Xto go until they hit a monster and then explode in a radius around that
Xmonster, instead of just going in a line like they currently do.  It is also
Xrumored that various other cloud type effects will be included.
X
XThere will supposedly be several new special levels and/or rooms, although no
Xdetails as to what exactly these will be are available.  Also, nethack's
Xlevel handling capabilities have been re-written so that it will now be very
Xeasy for the Dev Team (and others!) to add in new special levels or new
Xspecial rooms.
X
XIt is rumored that some "Nethack Abuses" have been made impossible.
XSpecifically, paralyzing the Wizard of Yendor and taking advantage of kicking
Xsinks have supposedly been fixed or limited.
