XAlignment: Neutral
X
XWizards are considered by many to be a difficult character to play, because
Xthey are very poor fighters when they start.  However, with a little bit of
Xluck, a wizard can end up being one of the most powerful characters in the
Xgame.
X
X
X* There some are limitations on the generation of random magic items.  These
Xare delineated as follows:
X
X1. No "useless" items will be generated.  The following items are considered
X(by the game) to be useless items:
X     potion of hallucination
X     scroll of amnesia
X     scroll of fire
X     ring of aggravate monster
X     ring of hunger
X     wand of nothing
X
X2. No ring of levitation will be generated.
X
X3. It is impossible to begin the game with both polymorph and polymorph
Xcontrol.  In other words, if your character has a ring, wand, or spellbook of
Xpolymorph, he/she will not have a ring of polymorph control, and vice-versa.
X
X4. Two of the same ring will not be generated.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XCharacter Stats:
X
XThe following is information about each of the major character stats.  They
Xare listed in the order in which they appear on the status line - not in
Xalphabetical order.  All stats can be increased by quaffing potions of gain
Xability.
X
XSt (Strength):                                        ---------------------
XStrength affects various aspects of combat in nethack |St.        |Hit|Dam |
X(see the HIT PROBABILITY and DAMAGE sections for      |-------------------|
Xdetails on how these bonuses work).  Additionally,    |01-05      |-2 | -1 |
Xstrength affects your carrying capacity (see CARRYING |06-07      |-1 |  0 |
XCAPACITY section for more details).  Also, the        |08-15      | 0 |  0 |
Xdistance you can throw objects, your chances of       |16         | 0 | +1 |
Xbashing down a door or kicking open a lock, and your  |17         |+1 | +1 |
Xchances of opening a stuck door (among other things)  |18         |+1 | +2 |
Xare affected by your strength.  It is possible to     |18/01-18/50|+1 | +3 |
Xincrease strength by eating royal jelly, giant        |18/51-18/75|+2 | +3 |
Xcorpses, or wearing gauntlets of power.               |18/76-18/90|+2 | +4 |
X                                                      |18/91-18/99|+2 | +5 |
X                                                      |18/**-25   |+3 | +6 |
X                                                      ----------------------
X-------------------- Dx (Dexterity):
X|Dx.   | Mle | Msl | Your dexterity is your ability to dodge, your agility,
X|------------------| and your manual dexterity, all rolled into one.
X|01-03 |  -3 |  -3 | Dexterity affects how likely you are to hit (see HIT
X|04-05 |  -2 |  -2 | PROBABILITY for more information).  Note that on the
X|06-07 |  -1 |  -1 | table to the right, to hit bonuses are different for
X|08-14 |   0 |   0 | melee than they are for missile weapons.  In other
X|15    |  +1 |   0 | words, if you are fighting hand to hand, you receive a
X|16    |  +2 |  +1 | different bonus that if you are using a bow, sling,
X|17    |  +3 |  +2 | etc.)  Dexterity also affects how well you can use a
X|*     |   * |   * | harp.  To increase your dexterity, wear gauntlets of
X|25    | +11 | +10 | dexterity.
X--------------------
X* Each bonus continues to increase by one as the stat increases by one, up to
X25, which is the maximum the stat can reach.
X
XCo (Constitution):                                          ----------------
XConstitution is a measure of how healthy you are.           |Co.       |HP+|
XConstitution affects how quickly your character heals, but  |--------------|
Xthe major benefit of constitution is extra hit points as    |3         |-2 |
Xeach level is gained.  When a character gains a higher      |4-6       |-1 |
Xexperience level, the character's current and maximum hit   |7-14      | 0 |
Xpoints are raised by a random amount.  This random amount   |15-16     |+1 |
Xis modified by a bonus which is determined by the           |17        |+2 |
Xconstitution of the character (see the table to the right). |18        |+3 |
X                                                            ----------------
X
XIn (Intelligence)
XIntelligence plays an important part in determining if you will be able to
Xmemorize a spell by reading a spellbook.  It also is factored into your
Xchances of casting any given spell that you have memorized (see MAGIC for
Xmore details on both of these).  Finally, intelligence determines how often
Xyour power will recharge (wisdom determined how many points recharge each
Xtime).  Your intelligence can also be increased by wearing a helm of
Xbrilliance.
X
XWi (Wisdom)
XWisdom is taken into account when you pray to your god.  It also affects how
Xmany energy points you will gain when you go up an experience level, and how
Xmany power points you will recharge each time you recharge (intelligence
Xaffects how often they recharge).  Wisdom can be increased by wearing a helm
Xof brilliance.
X
XCh (Charisma):                                            ------------------
X"Beauty is only skin deep."  Well, in nethack beauty is   |Ch.     |  Mod  |
Xcharisma, and charisma affects a couple of key things in  |----------------|
Xthe game.  First of all, charisma affects the prices a    |3-5     | *2.00 |
Xshopkeeper will give you in a shop (see the table to the  |6-7     | *1.66 |
Xright for price modifiers).  The other major affect is    |8-10    | *1.33 |
Xthat charisma adds to your chances of having a beneficial |11-15   | *1.00 |
Xencounter when faced with a succubus/incubus.  It is      |16-17   | *0.75 |
Xpossible to increase charisma with a ring of adornment    |18      | *0.66 |
X(which nymphs happen to love).                            |19+     | *0.50 |
X                                                          ------------------
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XScore:
X
XThe following formula can be used to compute what any character's score is:
X
X       player gold            (see explanation)
X     + real experience        (see explanation)
X     + max dungeon level bonus     (see formula)
X     -------------------------------------------------------------------
X     * ascension bonus        (see explanation)
X     + gem values             (see explanation)
X     + amulet values          (see explanation)
X     + pet bonus              (see explanation)
X     -------------------------------------------------------------------
X       score
X
XPlayer gold:  Take the amount of gold the character has in his/her
X     possession, and subtract 10% if the character died or was killed (not if
X     the character ascended, escaped, or quit).
X
XReal experience:  This is the number of experience points that have actually
X     been gained from slaying monsters, not including experience points that
X     may have been gained via potions of gain level, eating wraith corpses,
X     etc.
X
XMax dungeon level bonus:  Compute this bonus as follows: (50 * maximum
X     dungeon level visited) + 1000 for each level between 21 and 30 attained
X     (a level is considered "attained" if the maximum dungeon level visited
X     is greater than that level)
X
XAscension bonus:  If the character has ascended to demigod(dess)hood,
X     multiply the score computed up to this point by 2.  Otherwise, just keep
X     it the way it is.
X
XGem values:  If you escaped or ascended, add the gold value of each gem
X     currently possessed by the character to the score (see GEMS section for
X     exact gold values).
X
XAmulet values:  If you escaped or ascended, add 2 points for each amulet
X     possessed with a negative value (i.e. a -2 amulet of protection), add
X     500 points for each non-negative amulet possessed (i.e. an amulet of
X     reflection), and add 5000 points if the Amulet of Yendor is in your
X     character's possession.
X
XPet bonus:  If you escaped or ascended, and you did so with pets, add the
X     maximum hit points of each pet.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XStatus Line:
X
X
XAt the bottom of the nethack screen appears a status line.  This status line
X(which is really two lines) will give you a lot of information about the
Xcharacter being played at a glance.  The following is a sample status line:
X
XEndiel the Evoker  St:9 Dx:16 Co:15 In:15 Wi:10 Ch:13  Neutral S:132
XDlvl:3  G:325  HP:21(35) Pw:8(11) AC:4  Xp:3/53 T:461
X
XNow, item by item we will describe what each part of the status line means:
X
X1. "Endiel the Evoker" is the name and rank of the character.  The name will
Xbe either your account name or a name that you have chosen (see COMMON
XQUESTIONS for more information about how to name your character).  The rank
Xis dependent upon your character class (i.e. wizard, samurai, barbarian,
Xetc.) and your experience level (see CLASS RANKS for a list of the ranks).
X
X2. "St: 9 Dx:16 Co:15 In:15 Wi:10 Ch:13" is a listing of what the character's
Xstats are.  Respectively, this line would mean that the character's strength
Xis 9, dexterity is 16, constitution is 15, intelligence is 15, wisdom is 10,
Xand charisma is 13 (see CHARACTER STATS for more information about what these
Xstats mean).
X
X3. "Neutral" is the character's alignment.  Alignment can be one of three
Xthings:  "Chaotic," "Neutral," or "Good."  Alignment is a tricky subject, but
Xin general it determines whether you tend to be on the side of "good" or
X"evil" or just sit the fence, and your character's actions are judged
Xaccordingly.  Alignment is initially determined by character class, but can
Xalso be changed during play via several different methods (see ALIGNMENT for
Xmore details).
X
X4. "S:132" is the character's score.  If the character were to quit the game
Xat this moment, the score listed would be the score received.  There is a
Xscore penalty for dying.  Some compilations of nethack will not show score.
X(For more information on how to compute score, see SCORE.)
X
X5. "Dlvl:3" means that this character is on dungeon level three, or the third
Xlevel down.  In nethack, dungeon levels are counted downwards, so the first
Xlevel you encounter is level one, and then you go down through levels two,
Xthree, four, and so on.  Level fifty is the lowest level in the dungeon.
X
X6. "G:325" is the amount of gold ($) the character has.  This character has
X325 gold pieces in his/her possession.
X
X7. "HP:21(35)" is two measurements:  the character's current and maximum hit
Xpoints (HP).  The current hit points are how many you have right now, and the
Xmaximum is what you can raise your current hit points to.  Basically, hit
Xpoints are a measure of how alive you are.  Your current hit points are
Xdecreased when you are hit by a monster, caught in a trap, or do many other
Xthings that damage you.  Hit points are healed naturally over time, or can be
Xincreased via potions of healing, praying, etc.  Maximum hit points is raised
Xautomatically whenever you go up an experience level, or may be increased via
Xpraying, quaffing healing potions while your current hit points are equal to
Xthe maximum, etc.
X
X8. "Pw:8(11)" is also two measurements:  your current and maximum power.
XCurrent power is used to cast spells that have been memorized from spell
Xbooks.  It is regenerated naturally over time, or can be increased via
Xpotions of gain energy.  Maximum power is increased whenever the character
Xincreases an experience level, or can be increased by quaffing potions of
Xgain energy while current energy is at maximum.
X
X9. "AC:4" is the character's armor class.  Armor class (AC) is a measure of
Xhow well protected the character is against blows from hostile monsters.
XArmor class starts at 10, and goes downwards as it gets better.  Thus, a
Xcharacter with an AC of -10 would be much better than a character with an AC
Xof 5.  AC can be improved by wearing more or better or more enchanted armor,
X
Xby wearing rings of protection, by having your deity grant you intrinsic
Xprotection, or by other methods.
X
X10. "Xp:3/53" is, once again, two measurements:  the character's experience
Xlevel and experience points.  Experience points (always the second and larger
Xfigure) are gained by killing monsters, quaffing potions of gain level, etc.,
Xand are the determining factor for what your experience level is.  Experience
Xpoints also affect your score.  A character's experience level (or just
X"level" for short) determines many other factors about the character, such as
Xmaximum hit points, power, some intrinsics, ability to convert altars, etc.
XIn general, the higher the character's experience level, the better the
Xcharacter is.
X
X11. "T:461" shows the "time," or the number of moves that the character has
Xmade.  Every time the character does anything, this counter is incremented by
Xone.  This timer is optional, and can be turned on or off by using the "O"
Xkey for the options command.  In most compilations of nethack it is set to
Xoff by default.

XMonster Attacks:
X
XThis section details the number and types of attacks each monster has, as
Xwell as how much damage they can do for each attack, and what type of damage
Xis done.  Each monster can have from one to five attacks (except the mail
Xdaemon, which doesn't attack).  These attacks are listed in the order in

X     Bite            The monster will attempt to bite you.
X     Breath          With this attack type, the monster will breathe at you,
X                     usually breathing a gas, liquid, fire, or the like.  The
X                     classical example of this is the fire breathing dragon
X                     (a red dragon in nethack and most fantasy role playing
X                     games).
X     Butt            The monster will head-butt you, much in the same way
X                     that a bull would, usually in order to bring a horn into
X                     play.
X     Claw            The monster attacks using its claws.
X     Defensive       This attack type will only occur if you successfully
X                     attack (i.e. hit) the monster in question.  I.E. this is
X                     a retributive strike.
X     Engulf          The monster will attempt to engulf you.  This can
X                     involve swallowing you whole, as a purple worm would do,
X                     or simply surrounding you, as a fog cloud would.
X     Explode         With this attack type, the monster will literally
X                     explode if you come within range of it, and the
X                     explosion does the damage.
X     Gaze            The monster will look at you in order attack.  Usually
X                     you have to meet the monster's gaze in order for the
X                     attack to be successful.
X     Hug             With this attack type, the monster will use a crushing
X                     bear- like hug in order to incapacitate you as well as
X                     prevent you from running away.
X     Kick            The monster will kick you.  For example, a horse (if it
X                     were a nethack monster) would probably kick you.  Temple
X                     priest(ess)s also use kicking attacks.
X     Magic           The monster will use a magic spell to attack.
X     Spit            The monster will spit at you, and if the liquid that is
X                     spat touches you, the attack is successful.  A prime
X                     example of this type of attack would be the spitting
X                     cobra.
X     Sting           The monster will attempt to sting you with a stinger.
X     Touch           In order to successfully attack with this attack type,
X                     the monster need only touch you.
X     Weapon          The monster in question will use a weapon of some type
X                     in order to do the damage listed.  Thus, monsters with
X                     this attack type will always be generated with weapons.
X
XDamage: Damage is listed in the format xdy.  In this format, x is the number
Xof dice rolled to determine the damage, and y is the number of faces on each
Xdie rolled.  Thus, if '1d6' were listed, it would mean that one six-sided die
Xwould be rolled to determine the damage, giving a possible range of 1-6.  If
X'3d8' were listed, it would mean that three eight-sided dice would be rolled
Xto determine the damage, giving a possible range of 3-24.
X
XNote: where "LEV" is listed (i.e. "LEVd4" or "(LEV+1)d4"), substitute the
Xmonster's level.
X
XNote that with some damage types, the damage indicated here will not be used
Xfor actual hit point damage to the character, but may be used (for example)
Xto determine the length of paralyzation or blindness, etc.
X
X
XDamage types:  The various damage types possible for an attack are listed
Xbelow, with a brief explanation for each.  The default damage type (i.e. if
Xno damage type is listed for the attack) is "Physical."
X
X     Damage Type     Description
X     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
X     Acid            The damage done in this case is via acid.  Thus, if you
X                     are acid resistant (only certain monsters are), you
X                     would take no damage.
X     Amulet          Monsters with this damage type (basically the Wizard of
X                     Yendor only) will attempt to steal the Amulet of Yendor
X                     (assuming you have it).
X     Blind           This damage type is used in conjuction with the engulf,
X                     explode, and spit attack types.  With the engulf attack
X                     type, normal damage is done, and you will be blinded
X                     until you manage to kill the creature or are expelled
X                     from it. With the explode attack type, you will be
X                     blinded for a number of rounds equal to the listed
X                     damage, but no damage will be taken.  For the spit
X                     attack type, you will take normal damage and be blinded
X                     for 1-25 rounds.
X     Cleric Spl      Monsters with this damage type will cast a random cleric
X                     spell, having random effects depending upon the spell
X                     cast.
X     Cold            The damage is done via cold or freezing.  Thus, if you
X                     are cold resistant, no damage will be done.  However,
X                     this type of damage also has a chance of destroying
X                     potions.
X     Con.            Damage of this type has the possibility of being
X                     poisoned. If the attack is poisoned, your character will
X                     lose 3 to 5 points of constitution in addition to the
X                     normal damage taken.
X     Confuse         An attack doing damage of this type will confuse you for
X                     the number of rounds that would normally be damage.
X                     (i.e. if 1d6 is listed for damage, you would be confused
X                     for 1d6 rounds).  No normal damage is received, however.
X     Curse           If an attack using this damage type succeeds, the
X                     attacking monster will "steal" one of your intrinsics.
X     Decay           This damage type, in addition to doing normal damage,
X                     has the capability of decaying organic material.  Thus,
X                     it can damage armor that is organic in nature (i.e.
X                     robes, leather armor, etc.).
X     Dex.            Damage of this type has the possibility of being
X                     poisoned. If the attack is poisoned, your character will
X                     lose 3 to 5 points of dexterity in addition to the
X                     normal damage taken.
X     Digest          This damage type occurs only in conjunction with the
X                     attack type "Engulf."  Basically, once the monster has
X                     swallowed you whole, any damage done if via digestion in
X                     the monster's stomach.
X     Disease         In addition to the normal damage done, you also have a
X                     chance of becoming sick and eventually dying of it.
X     Disint./Death   This type of attack will usually kill you outright.
X                     However, if the attack is a disintegration beam and you
X                     are wearing armor, your outermost layer of armor will be
X                     destroyed instead.
X     Drain Energy    Damage of this type is done by draining the amount of
X                     damage from your store of energy points instead of from
X                     hit points.
X     Drain Life      Monsters doing this kind of damage have a chance of
X                     draining an experience level from you in addition to the
X                     normal damage done.
X     Fire            The damage is done via fire or heat.  Thus, if you are
X                     fire resistant, no damage will be done.  This type of
X                     damage also has a chance of catching scrolls and
X                     spellbooks on fire, and causing potions to boil and
X                     burst.
X     Heal            This is probably the most unique of all the damage
X                     types, and is basically reserved for nurses.  If you are
X                     wearing any type of armor, or are wielding any weapon
X                     when this damage type is done to you, normal damage will
X                     occur (unless you are a healer, in which case you'll get
X                     a fun message).  If, however, you aren't wearing any
X                     armor, and are not wielding any weapon, you will
X                     actually be healed by the attack, and if already at
X                     maximum hit points, there is a chance that your maximum
X                     will be increased by one point.
X     Legs            Monsters doing this type of damage attack and do damage
X                     primarily to your legs.  Such damage can incapacitate
X                     you and prevent you from walking or fighting, especially
X                     if you're carrying a heavy load.
X     Lycanthropy     Monsters with this damage type have a chance of not only
X                     doing normal damage, but also conferring lycanthropy
X                     upon you.  If you catch lycanthropy (signified by the
X                     message, "You feel feverish."), you will periodically
X                     change form into a rat, jackal, or wolf, depending upon
X                     which type of lycanthrope you got the disease from.
X     Mag. Mis.       Attacks with this damage type are made via magic
X                     missiles. If you are magic resistant, no damage will be
X                     sustained.
X     Paralyze        For most attack types, this kind of damage includes not
X                     only the normal physical damage, but also the chance of
X                     being paralyzed for a random time period.  However, for
X                     "Defensive" attacks, no damage is done, and you will be
X                     paralyzed for the number of rounds listed as damage.
X     Petrify         Monsters doing this type of damage have a chance of
X                     turning you to stone.  Generally the stoning (as it's
X                     called) starts with the limbs, and then proceeds to the
X                     rest of the body.
X     Physical        The damage done is physical in nature (i.e. a cut to the
X                     torso, etc.).
X     Rust            Damage of this type has the capability of rusting metal.
X                     If the attack type is defensive in nature, the weapon
X                     you used to attack can rust.  Otherwise, any metal armor
X                     you might be wearing can rust.
X     Seduce          Monsters with this damage type will attempt to seduce
X                     you and will steal as many of your items as possible
X                     while they are seducing you.  Incubi/Succubi have
X                     slightly different effects with this damage type, and
X                     can have effects ranging from giving you experience to
X                     outright killing you.
X     Shock           Damage of this type is done via electrical shock.  Thus,
X                     if you are shock resistant, no damage will be done.
X                     However, this damage also has a chance of destroying
X                     wands and rings.
X     Sleep           If an attack doing sleep damage succeeds, there is a
X                     chance that you will be put to sleep for a random time
X                     period in addition to the normal damage.  Sleep
X                     resistance will prevent you from being put to sleep, but
X                     you will still sustain the normal damage.
X     Slow            Attacks doing damage of this type have the possibility
X                     of not only doing normal damage, but also of slowing you
X                     down to normal speed if you are moving at faster than
X                     normal speed.
X     Spell           Monsters with this damage type will cast a random magic-
X                     user spell, having varying effects depending upon the
X                     spell cast.
X     Steal           Monsters with this damage type will attempt to steal an
X                     item from your inventory.
