X3. If you have good relations with your god, your god will uncurse things you
X     are wearing, and occasionally will remove the curse from items in your
X     pack.  This will happen when you pray.
X
X4. Reading an uncursed scroll of enchant armor/weapon will remove the curse
X     from the armor/weapon that gets enchanted.  Similarly, reading a blessed
X     scroll of enchant armor/weapon will bless the armor/weapon that gets
X     enchanted.
X
X5. Dipping cursed items in holy water will uncurse them.
X
X6. A wand of cancellation will remove the curse from all items in your pack
X     if you zap yourself with it.  Note, however, that it will also remove
X     all enchantments and names (i.e. Stormbringer) on all items in your
X     pack.
X
X7. Try having a monster steal your cursed items.  Nymphs will steal cursed
X     armor and weapons.  Be sure that you have dropped everything else,
X     however, before trying this.  Succubi/incubi will also remove cursed
X     armor sometimes.
X
X8. An uncursed or blessed scroll of destroy armor can be used to destroy
X     cursed armor.  Be sure to take off all your other armor before reading
X     the scroll.
X
X9. Polymorphing yourself into a monster that can't wear armor or use a weapon
X     will cause you to fall out of your armor (or it may destroy your armor
X     altogether) and/or drop your weapon.
X

XRobbing Shops:
X
XHere we have outlined a few of the standard ways of robbing a shop.  Some of
Xthem let you get away with it scott-free.  Others will send the keystone kops
Xafter you.  Some will even allow you to keep robbing the shop and selling the
Xstuff back to the shopkeeper until you have all his money!  Experiment with
Xthese and have fun!
X
XFor reference, in all the diagrams:
X     @ = shopkeeper
X     X = you (for clarity)
X     f = cat (or whatever pet you may have)
X     P = pile of goodies (also for clarity)
X     K = Keystone Kops (after you robbed the shop)
X
XMethod One:  Pile everything in the shop up and teleport it out with a wand
Xof teleport.  This scatters the items on the level for you to find.
X
X     Enter the shop...   Make a pile...      Poof!
X     -------------       -------------       -------------

X     |+$%]**!$...|f###   |.X.........|####   |.X...f.....|####
X     -------------       -------------       -------------
X
XMethod Two:  Dig a hole in the wall with a wand of digging or any other handy
Xmethod of digging, and then kick the stuff out.  Two notes, here:  1) kicking
Xpotions, eggs, or other fragile items will destroy them.  2) You cannot just
Xkick an item out of the shop - if you do so, the shopkeeper will charge you
Xfor it.  You have to be outside the shop (i.e., in the wall) while you're
Xkicking it out of the shop.
X
X     Get positioned...   Dig...   #          Make a pile...

X     -------------       -------------
X
XMethod Three:  Dig a hole in the wall of the shop.  Then dig a hole just
Xoutside of the shop (by specifying '>' for the digging direction), falling
Xthrough to the next level.  Trek back up to the shop, grab everything you can
Xcarry, walk out of the shop, onto the hole, and hey presto!  You're on the
Xnext level with all the loot, and the Keystone Kops and shopkeeper are still
Xback on the previous level.  If you don't fall through the trapdoor, don't
Xworry - just hit '>' to go down through the hole you made.
X
X      X Dig out...        ^ Make a pit...     ^ Grab stuff...

X
XMethod Four:  Polymorph the shopkeeper into something easier to handle (with
Xa wand of polymorph) and then kill him/her.  Of course, once the shopkeeper's
Xgone, you can take what you like, including his or her gold!
X
X     Enter the shop...   Polymorph...        Kill shopkeeper!

X     -------------       -------------       -------------
X
XMethod Five:  If you do not happen to have any props (wands, etc), and have a
Xration (especially tripe) or two, then this method is for you.  It is also
Xthe most common:  train your pet.  Basically, if your pet drops an item right
Xin front of the door to the shop, you can pick it up for free.  Throw him
Xfood, and he'll keep on doing it!
X
X                                             Throw pet food and
X     Let pet in shop...  It brings item...   take item - it is free!

X     -------------       -------------       -------------
X
XMethod Six:  Teleport out.  Grab everything in the shop and then teleport the
Xheck out of there.  This is especially effective if you have teleport control
Xand know where the stairway is.  It's even better if you have your pet on a
Xleash, or a magic whistle, so you don't have to worry about leaving your pet
Xbehind.  But note - the Kops and the shopkeeper will be after you.
X
X     Enter the shop...   Grab everything...  Poof!

X     -------------       -------------       -------------
X
XMethod Seven:  Push a boulder into the shop, then use the boulder to block
Xthe door. Once the door is blocked, rip off everything in the shop and then
Xteleport out.  Although the Kops will be after you, you won't have to deal
Xwith a pissed off shopkeeper.
X
X     Push in a rock...   Keep on going...    Push it back...

XSink Effects:
X
XThere are basically three things that you can do with a sink.  You can kick
Xit (which is detailed under KICKING), you can quaff from it, or you can drop
Xa ring down it.

XSurvival:
X
XIf you are low on hit points, or are worried about the zoo that you just
Xstumbled across while blind and confused, there are two primary methods to
Xsurvive beyond running away:  engraving Elbereth and a scroll of scare
Xmonster.  As an interesting note, if you happen to get the message "This
Xwater gives you bad breath," you will scare monsters near you away (due to
Xyour awful halitosis).
X
XEngraving Elbereth
X
XIf you engrave "Elbereth" in the dust and keep standing on it, most monsters
Xwill not attack you.  Note that humans, elves, soldiers, shopkeeper, etc. (in
Xshort, all @'s) will not regard Elbereth, and other monsters may throw things
Xat you.  Dragons can also still use their breath weapons against you.  If you
Xswing at them or throw things at them you will scuff out the engraving,
Xallowing them to attack.  Also, in most cases the writing will eventually
Xfade out.  How long it takes to fade or scuff is dependent on what you used
Xto engrave.  Your fingers will do, but not for long.  A weapon is really
Xgood, but you tend to dull blades that way ( athames will not dull from
Xengraving). Some wands, magic markers, and other objects can also be used to
Xengrave, although it will take a charge to do so (wands of fire or digging
Xare excellent for engraving, for instance).  The trick here is to levitate,
Xwhich will prevent you from scuffing the writing.
X
XScare monster
X
XMonsters (this does not include humans) will not cross a scroll of scare
Xmonster.  Thus, you can stand on it, and they will not attack you (similar to
XElbereth), or you could drop it in a doorway, and the monsters would not come
Xthrough (good way to cork the bottleneck of a zoo).
X
XEvery time you drop/pick up a scroll of scare monster it moves toward a
Xcursed state.  Drop a blessed scroll, pick it up it is uncursed.  Drop that
Xuncursed scroll, pick it up it is cursed.  Drop that cursed scroll, pick it
Xup it turns to dust.  (Incidentally, placing a scroll of scare monster in a
Xchest and then picking it up later will not change its status.)  Thus, if you
Xpick up a scroll that turns to dust, it is a worn out scare monster scroll.
XOne neat trick is to keep blessing the scroll after you use it, so that you
Xcan use it over and over again.
X
XNote:  Minotaurs are the exception to the rule.  Standing on a scroll of
Xscare monster or engraved Elbereth does nothing to stop them from attacking
Xyou.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XThrone Effects:
X
XWhen you sit upon a throne, you have a one in six chance of having some
Xeffect take place (no effect = "You feel out of place...").  The effects
Xwhich can take place are as follows (equal chances):
X
X1. You lose 3-6 points from a random attribute, and lose 1-10 hp.
X2. One point is added to random attribute.
X3. You lose 1-6 hp if shock resistant.  Otherwise you lose 1-30 hp.
X     "A [massive] charge of electricity shoots through your body!"
X4. If your hit points are within 5 of max, add 4 to your max.  Your hit
X     points are raised to max, and blindness, sickness, and bad legs will all
X     be healed.
X     "You feel much, much better!"
X5. You will lose all of your gold.
X     "You notice you have no gold."
X     "You feel a strange sensation."  (if you have no gold)
X6. If your luck + random of [0-4] is less than 0, your luck will increase by
X     one.  Otherise, you can wish for an item.
X     "You feel your luck is changing."
X7. This one's rather obvious:  lots of nasties will get summoned.
X     "You hear a voice echo:  'Thy audience has been summoned, Sire!'"
X8. You will be given the boon of genociding one creature.
X     "You hear a voice echo:  'By thy imperious order, Sire!'"
X9. If your luck is greater than zero, you will be blinded for 250-349 turns.
X     Otherwise a random item you possess will be cursed.
X     "You hear a voice echo:  'A curse upon thee for sitting upon this most
X     holy throne.'"
X10. If your luck is less than zero or you have the intrinsic see invisible,
X     the level will be magically mapped for you.  Otherwise, you will gain
X     the intrinsic of see invisible.
X     "An image forms in your mind."
X     "Your vision clarifies."
X11. If your luck is less than zero, you will gain the intrinsic of aggravate
X     monsters.  Otherwise, you will be randomly teleported on the level.
X     "You feel threatened."
X     "You feel a wrenching sensation."
X12. One or more items in your pack will be identified.
X     "You are granted a gift of insight."
X13. You will become confused for 16 to 22 turns.
X     "Your mind turns into a pretzel."
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XUnicorn Horns:
X
XWhen a)pplied, an uncursed or blessed unicorn horn can do any or all of the
Xfollowing:  cure blindness, stop confusion, stop hallucination, cure
Xsickness, stop stunning, or restore ability.  Note that if the unicorn horn
Xis cursed, these effects will be reversed.
X
XYou can #d)ip a unicorn horn in a potion, and if the potion is a potion of
Xconfusion, hallucination, or sickness, the potion will become a potion of
Xwater.  If it says, "Interesting," the potion is of another type.
X
XUnicorn horns will not rust, and they enchant well, so they make ideal
Xweapons, especially against rust monsters, acid blobs, etc.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XWishes:
X
XThere are five ways to get wishes.  These are:
X
X1. A wand of wishing  (Note for poly-pilers here:  It is no longer possible
X     to polymorph another wand into a wand of wishing.)
X2. A magic lamp - djinni appears and is grateful for his release (Also no
X     longer possible to create via a polymorph.)
X3. A fountain - water demon appears and is sometimes grateful for his release
X     (see FOUNTAIN EFFECTS for more information).
X4. Occasionally, a glowing potion will have a djinni in it who is grateful
X     for his release.
X5. Sitting on a throne can occasionally give you a wish.  (See THRONE
X     EFFECTS)
X
XTo wish effectively, you should wish for an item (or items) that can
X(literally) be placed in your inventory.  You could wish for a "wide sword"
Xand get one.  Better yet, you could wish for a "+3 wide sword" and you would
Xat least get a wide sword.  Whether you get the asked for enchantments
Xdepends on a random factor.  You may wish for an enchantment as high as you
Xwant, but your chances of getting it go exponentially downwards after +3, and
Xto zero after +5.  Thus, you're better off wishing for "+2 gray dragon scale
Xmail" than let's say "blessed +4 gray dragon scale mail."  In either case you
Xwould get at least +0 gray dragon scale mail (although it might be cursed).
XIf the item is one that often comes in multiples (scrolls or potions, for
Xexample) instead of having an enchantment, you can wish for several (i.e. 3
Xscrolls) and have a good chance of getting them.  The exceptions to this rule
Xare gold, which you can wish for a lot of, and rocks, which you can wish for
Xas many as you like.
X
XThe general modifiers to use when wishing are, of course, "blessed,"
X"uncursed," and "cursed."  A specific modifier for small missile weapons is
X"poisoned" (as it appears in your inventory).  Also there are named weapons
X(artifacts), as in a "blessed +3 wide sword named Stormbringer."
X
XHere's a few useful items and the exact wording you need to use to get them:
X
X     "blessed +3 war hammer named Mjollnir"
X     "blessed +3 broadsword named Stormbringer"
X     "blessed +3 katana named Snickersnee"
X     "blessed +3 long sword named Excalibur"
X     "blessed +3 gray dragon scale mail"
X     "blessed +3 helm of telepathy"
X     "blessed +3 pair of speed boots"
X     "blessed +3 gauntlets of power"
X     "blessed +3 shield of reflection"
X     "blessed +3 cloak of displacement"
X     "blessed +3 Hawaiian shirt"
X     "blessed amulet of life saving"
X     "3 blessed potions of gain ability"
X     "3 blessed scrolls of genocide"
X     "3 cursed scrolls of genocide" (caution is advised)
X     "blessed spellbook of identify" (you never get more than one spellbook)
X     "blessed ring of levitation"
X     "wand of polymorph"
X     "blessed tinning kit" (makes blessed tins)
X     "figurine of a gray dragon" (for that pet gray dragon you always wanted)

X
XAmulet of esp - gives intrinsic telepathy.
XAmulet of life saving - will save your life once.  After you die it brings
X     you back up to max hp.  Note that if you choke on something while
X     wearing one of these, you're liable to keep right on eating and choke
X     again.  Also, this won't save you if you genocide whatever you are.
XAmulet of Yendor - no effect from wearing.  When in your possession prevents
X     level teleport, often prevents normal teleports, randomly maps out
X     blocks of level around you, and causes spell casting to take more
X     energy.
XAmulet of restful sleep - waits many turns, and then causes you to go to
X     sleep (against your will).
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XIdentifying Amulets:
X
XIdentifying amulets is a process of elimination, starting with determining
Xwhether or not the amulet is cursed.  Determining whether it's cursed is easy
Xenough if you're a priest or have a pet on hand.  If the amulet is cursed,
Xdon't wear it - there are too many nasty things cursed amulets can do.  If
Xthe amulet isn't cursed, it's probably either an amulet of esp, life saving,
Xreflection, or versus poison.  However, watch out - amulets of change often
Xaren't cursed.  So, if you don't mind risking the possibility of changing
Xsexes (and character name), try it on and see what it does.  To see if it's
Xan amulet of esp, get blinded (put on a blindfold, quaff a potion of
Xblindness, etc.).  If you can suddenly see all the monsters on the level,
Xthat's what it is.  Next, find a room away from all the monsters, and zap a
Xwand at the wall so that it bounces at you (do this with a wand that you're
Ximmune to, or something non-harmful like a sleep ray).  If your medallion
Xreflects the ray, it's an amulet of reflection.  Finally, try eating
Xsomething poisonous.  If it doesn't do you any harm, it's vs. poison.  If
Xnone of these are the case, you know it's an amulet of life saving - one of
Xthe most valuable items in the game.

XArmor Effects:
X
XCloak of displacement - displaces you, causing first hit against you by a
X     monster to miss and other hits to be at a severe disadvantage.
XCloak of invisibility - makes you invisible.
XCloak of magic resistance - gives you resistance against magic, such that
X     certain spells won't work against you and magic based traps like
X     teleport and polymorph traps won't have any effect on you.
XCloak of protection - makes your AC better.
XDragon scale mail - depending upon the type of dragon scale mail (red, gray,
X     etc.) it will give you a different immunity.  See FOOD - CORPSES for
X     information about what immunity each dragon type provides.
XElven boots - gives you stealth (i.e. if you walk into a room, a monster that
XElven cloak - gives you stealth.
XFumble boots - makes you drop your weapon, stumble and fall occasionally,
X     etc.  Tends to be cursed.
XGauntlets of dexterity - increases your dexterity by the defense bonus.
XGauntlets of fumbling - makes you drop your weapon, stumble and fall
X     occasionally, etc.  Tends to be cursed.
XGauntlets of power - increases your strength to 25.
XHelm of brilliance - adds bonus to your intelligence and wisdom (i.e. a +1
X     helm will add one point to each).
XHelm of opposite alignment - changes your alignment to opposite, or if
X     neutral to random alignment. It can be removed to return to the original
X     alignment.
XHelm of telepathy - gives you telepathy, as the intrinsic, but you don't have
X     to be blind to use it.  When not blind, only gives telepathy in
X     vicinity, not for the entire screen.
XJumping boots - allows you to jump up to two squares away.
XLevitation boots - causes you to levitate.  (Nasty if cursed)
XShield of reflection - ray attacks (like lightning, fire, gas) are reflected,
X     and also prevents gaze attacks where the monster gazes at you.  Note
X     that this will not help if you look at the monster (i.e. the medusa).
X     Especially useful against dragons and floating eyes.
XSpeed boots - doubles your speed.  Allows you to have more attacks and be
X     able to run away better.
XWater walking boots - allows you to safely walk on water.

XIdentifying Armor:
X
XIdentifying armor is usually pretty simple.  First, make sure the armor isn't
Xcursed (again, simple enough if you're a priest of have a pet on hand).
XThen, simply try it on.  Any bonuses will immediately be identified for you.
XCertain items will also do other things, as listed above, and these effects
Xwill show up immediately.  The only two types of armor that are somewhat
Xdifficult to identify are water walking boots and jumping boots.  Jumping
Xboots can be identified by trying to #jump once you've put them on.  If you
Xcan jump, that's what they are.  Water walking boots are only positively
Xidentifiable (short of a scroll of identify or equivalent) by taking a step
Xof faith and trying to tread on the wet stuff.

XFood - Corpses:
X
XEating certain dead monsters (monster corpses) can confer intrinsics or have
Xother effects.  Generally intrinsics are conferred by eating a monster with
Xthat intrinsic, although certain individual monsters or monster types can
Xalso confer intrinsics or have other effects.
X
XIf you eat a monster with one of the following intrinsics, you will have a
Xchance of gaining that intrinsic yourself.  The major exception in all cases
Xare baby dragon corpses, which can never confer intrinsics (so as to prevent
Xpolymorph abuse via laying of eggs).  Note also that each monster corpse may
Xonly confer one of these intrinsics, and they are tested for in the order in
Xwhich they are listed.
X
XMonster
XIntrinsic        Chance of gaining
XTeleport       - monster level / 10
XTel. Cont.     - monster level / 15
XFire Res       - monster level / 15
XCold Res       - monster level / 15
XDisin Res      - monster level / 15
XPois Res       - monster level / 15 (killer bee and scorpion are 1/4)
XShock Res      - monster level / 15
XSleep Res      - monster level / 15 (undead cannot confer this)
X
XIn addition, eating the following monster corpses can also have effects as
Xnoted:

Xlarge mimic         - You mimic a pile of gold for 40 rounds.
Xlizard              - Cures stunning and confusion, and will stop you from
X                      turning to stone.
Xnurse               - Restores all lost hit points
Xquantum mechanic    - If you are currently fast, will bring your speed to
X                      normal. Otherwise, doubles your speed.
Xsmall mimic         - You mimic a pile of gold for 20 rounds.
Xstalker             - If you are already invisible, you will gain intrinsic
X                      invisibility and intrinsic see infisible.  Otherwise,
X                      you will become invisible for a random time period.
X                      Also, you will be stunned for 60 rounds in either case.

XIdentifying Potions:
X
XThere are several ways of identifying potions, mostly based upon the messages
Xlisted above.  If you quaff a potion, you should be able to tell what it was
Xfrom the info in the quaffing section.  Throwing a potion at a monster will
Xoften tell you what it was from the effects on that monster (especially if
Xyou have a stethescope to examine it with).  Finally, potions can often be
Xidentified by breaking them and observing the vapor effect.  Set the potion
Xdown and kick it until it smashes.  Then pay close attention to what happens.
XOh, and remember - when that red dragon breathes fire at you and your potion
Xboils and explodes, all is not lost.  You still get the vapor effect, so you
Xcan figure out what the next one like that will do.
