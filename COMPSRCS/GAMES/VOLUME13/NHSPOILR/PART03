XCastle Level:
X
XContrary to popular belief, the castle (or stronghold) level is not where the
Xwizard is.  The castle level is more of a proving ground - if you can get by
Xit, you can probably finish the game, and if you do finish it, there are
Xexcellent rewards (specifically, there is a wand of wishing in one of the
Xouter four rooms).  Beware, though.  Although this level is littered with
Xloot (four whole rooms full of stuff to start with), it's also littered with
Xmonsters.  Guards abound, as well as at least four dragons, several lichs,
Xsome nagas, and so on.  An example castle level is below:

X
XThe first hint that you are on the castle level is the fact that you will
Xappear in the upper-left corner of the map, and in a maze to boot.  You will
Xalso tend to hear 'courtly sounds'.  The maze you are in (see map above) is
Xnot large, but beware, for a minotaur lurks within, and they are more than a
Xlittle trouble.
X
XAfter you complete the maze, you will be on a large landing, with the castle
Xin front of you and the moat around it.  The moat will drown you in a second,
Xso beware.  Also, there are invisible giant eels in the water and they will
Xattack you.  The first question asked is:  How do I get in?  Well, there are
Xmany answers, so I will outline several ideas below:
X
XIf you have sacrificed enough, your god will have given you five musical
Xnotes when you pray.  Play these notes on an instrument, and the drawbridge
Xwill open.  If your god hasn't given you the five musical notes, try random
Xnotes. You'll get a series of sounds.  Use these sounds like the old Master
XMind game to determine the correct notes.  (One sound means correct note,
Xcorrect spot. The other means correct note, wrong spot.)  Keep trying until
Xthe drawbridge comes down.
X
XA wand of opening or a spellbook of knock will cause the drawbridge to come
Xdown - but watch out!  If you are standing directly in front of the
Xdrawbridge, it will fall on you and squash you.  A wand of striking will
Xdisintegrate the portcullis, but you still have to bridge the moat to get in.
XTry pushing in a boulder, zapping a wand of cold or fire at the moat, or
Xusing water walking, levitation, or jumping boots.
X
XAnother method of entering the castle is by polymorphing yourself into a
Xxorn. A xorn can walk through the walls of the castle straight into the
Xmiddle.  Be warned, though - xorns can't swim, so you'll still have to bridge
Xthe moat.
X
XA final method of getting in is using the back door.  Using boots of
Xlevitation or water walking (or equivalent items or spells), walk through the
Xmoat around to the back of the castle.  Pick the lock on the back door and
Xwalk in.  Be careful of the trapdoors, though!
X
XOnce you're into the castle, if you're not prepared to fight for your life
Xagainst ravenous hordes of monsters, there are two ways of getting rid of
Xmost of them (albeit forfeiting the experience for killing them).  Either use
Xa ring of conflict or walk back over the trapdoors, letting them all go
Xfalling down into the upper level of hell as they try to follow you.  Kill
Xoff the rest, grab the wand of wishing, try sitting on the throne for another
Xwish or two, and then go for the ultimate challenge - the Wizard himself, by
Xteleporting down to level fifty or so.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XSpecial Levels:
X
XNethack has several "special levels."  The actual level of each of these
Xvaries from game to game, so we can't tell you what level to look for each
Xon, but we can give you a description of each so that you recognize what
Xyou're running into.
X
XBig Level:  Basically, this level is exactly what the name implies.  The
Xentire level is one big room.  This is a bad level to have aggravate monster
Xon, and a ring of conflict is really handy here.  Here's an example of a big
Xlevel:

XCastle/Stronghold Level:  see section CASTLE LEVEL
X
XMedusa Level:  Of all the creatures of Greek mythology, the gorgons   -------
Xwere among the most powerful.  One of these was the medusa, whose     |.``..|
Xvisage was so terrible to behold that one look at her countenance     -...`.|
Xwould turn any living creature instantly to stone.  She was finally   |...`.|
Xslain by Perseus with the use of a reflective shield given him by     |.@..`|
XAthena.  It is rumored that the only two ways to kill a medusa are    -------
Xto fight her without gazing upon her, or to reflect her terrible gaze back
Xupon her, so that she, looking upon her own reflection, should turn to stone.
XThe medusa is raised back to life in nethack, so beware of the level upon
Xwhich she resides.  You will know you are there when you begin to see an
Xinordinately large number of statues, hear nothing but silence, etc. A sample
Xroom in which the medusa might reside is above at right.
X
XOracle of Delphi:  The Oracle of Delphi was reknowned in ancient      -|-@--
Xtimes for her ability to tell the future with admirable accuracy.     |.```|
XFor instance, a great king once came to the Oracle and asked if he    |....|
Xshould send his armies against the armies of another nation.  The     |..{.|
XOracle told him, "I tell you truly.  If you do so, you will destroy   ------
Xa mighty army."  Enheartened, he attacked, and sure enough, a mighty army was
Xdestroyed - his own!  The Oracle in nethack will give you minor or major
Xconsultations.  Minor ones are cheap, and are the same as a fortune cookie.
XMajor ones are expensive, but can give some good clues.  The oracle room will
Xhave the oracle sitting in a niche in the wall, with statues of mountain,
Xplain, and forest centaurs in front of her, and a fountain in the room.  An
Xexample is shown above at right.
X
XRogue Level:  Rogue was one of the first of the hack and slash games.  Hack,
XNethack, UltraRogue, Moria, UMoria, Larn, Omega, and undoubtedly many more,
Xwere all based on the idea started by rogue.  Now, rogue, like early versions
Xof hack, had a very distinctive look.  There were always nine rooms on each
Xlevel, and each wall of each room never had more than one doorway.  In memory
Xof rogue, the nethack engineers have added a "rogue level," that looks very
Xmuch like the original rogue game, and the game will tell you that it seems
Xlike you've been on that level before.  Here's an example of one:

XTower Levels:  The three tower levels are the three levels that probably
Xgenerate more confusion that the entire rest of the game combined (a little
Xhyperbole, but not a lot).  Basically, the tower levels are three consecutive
Xmaze levels in hell.  In the center of each of these maze levels is the a
Xsection of the tower proper.  The tower can only be entered from the lowest
Xlevel, and there's no exit at the top.  Inside the tower are many riches, and
Xvampires galore.  On the top level of the tower, you'll find Vlad the
XImpaler, master of the tower. (Oh, did I forget to mention that he's also a
XVampire Lord?)  Below is an example of the three tower sections.  Put each of
Xthem in the center of a maze level, and you've got a tower level!

XAmulet of Yendor, though, so don't be fooled.  The best way to tell   }}---}}
Xwhere you are in relation to the Wizard is to put on a blindfold and  }}}}}}}
Xapply a mirror to yourself (use '.' for direction).  After a few tries, this
Xwill tell you whether the wizard is above you, below you, or very close.
XWhen you're on the same level, trek in towards the middle, get past the moat,
Xbreak into his home, and take the Amulet!  An example of the Wizard's room is
Xabove at right. Incidentally, the traps are squeaky boards which will
Xinstantly wake up the Wizard.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XSpecial Rooms:
X
XThere are many varied and interesting rooms to explore in nethack.  Besides
Xyour standard room with the possibility of randomly generated items, traps,
Xmonsters, etc., there are several special room types that can be found within
Xthe dungeon.  These are listed below:
X
XBeehives:  Beehives are (you guessed it) rooms completely filled      -------
Xwith killer bees.  There are usually one or more queen bees in one    |.aaaa|
Xas well.  Beehives can be quite nasty for the inexperienced           -.aaaa|
Xcharacter, but if you can manage to kill them off, run around         |.aaaa|
Xpicking up the royal jelly that will be left behind.  Eat it, and     |.aaaa|
Xhey presto -instant strength!                                         -------
X
XBarracks:  The barracks are a room type that will usually only show   -------
Xup on lower levels due to the fact that it will kill of all but the   |.@@@@|
Xmost  powerful characters.  Barracks are rooms filled with soldiers.  -.@@@@|
XBe careful not to blow a whistle or play a bugle on the level if you  |.@@@@|
Xdon't want to face them. Soldiers will always wake up for a whistle   |.@@@@|
Xor a bugle, and come to investigate what woke them!                   -------
X
XDavid's Treasure Zoo:  David's Treasure Zoo is a room totally filled  -------
Xwith random monsters of all types and sizes.  This room can be quite  |.DooQ|
Xdeadly, but each monster in the room will carry a sizeable sum of     -.aggh|
Xgold, so if you can kill off all of them, you'll probably end up      |.dCkq|
Xquite rich.  Wands and other ray type weapons, rings of conflict,     |.qoGc|
Xthe ability to teleport out if you have to can be quite handy here,   -------
Xas in any room filled with monsters.
X
XGraveyards:  If you have a character with a bad AC, you'd better      -------
Xpray that you don't run into one of these.  Graveyards are rooms      |W WZV|
Xfilled with nasty undead creatures - wraiths and vampires that will   -ZZSWS|
Xdrain your levels away, and zombies and skeletons and ghosts.  (Note  |VSW V|
Xthat ghosts in a graveyard are randomly generated, although they may  |WWZZ |
Xtake names from the high score file.  Thus, they won't leave ghost    -------
Xstacks.)  If you have a character with a good AC, these can be quite a boost:
XKill off all the wraiths and eat the corpses to go up many levels!
X
XShops:  Shops can be an adventurer's best friend.  Note that I said   -------
Xshops, not shopkeepers - shopkeepers can be an adventurer's worst     |@??!!|
Xnightmare!  Shops come in all sizes and types.  There are shops that  -.%[))|
Xsell everything, and shops that specialize in an item type (wands,    |.[!%(|
Xfor instance).  Shopkeepers always carry a key and a lot of gold,     |.!?/=|
Xand they guard their wares jealously.  Check out the section on       -------
XROBBING SHOPS for more information on how to rob shopkeepers blind.
X
XTemples:  A temple is a room that is dedicated to a particular        -------
Xdeity.  Temples invariably contain an altar to that deity in the      |.....|
Xcenter of the room, and a priest(ess) of that deity nearby.  You can  -..@..|
Xgive an offering to the deity by #chatting to the priest(ess), and    |.._..|
Xwill perhaps have a blessing bestowed upon you.  You'll know you're   |.....|
Xentering a temple when you get a message along the lines of           -------
X"Pilgrim, you enter a holy place."
X
XThrone Rooms:  A throne room is a room filled with monsters.  The     -------
Xmajor difference between this room and David's Treasure Zoo is that   |.kodk|
Xthrone rooms have a throne in them.  Sitting on this throne can       -.ooG\|
Xproduce all sort of interesting effects, and gold can be gotten (if   |.dkgh|
Xyou're lucky) by kicking the throne.  See the THRONE EFFECTS and      |.qCoc|
XKICKING sections for more information about thrones.                  -------
X
XVaults:  Vaults are scattered about the various levels, and can       ----
Xnever be entered except by digging, teleporting, or walking through   |$$|
Xwalls (they have no doors).  Most levels with one of these two by     |$$|
Xtwo rooms filled with gold will also have a closet with a single use  ----
Xteleport trap in it.  That teleport trap will teleport you into the vault
X(just be sure you have a way to get out).  Oh, and remember - Croesus was the
Xking who commissioned the vaults, and all of the vault guards know him.

XDamage:
X
XIf you would like to figure out how much damage you can do to a given monster
Xupon a successful hit, this section will tell you how.  Please note that all
Xcomputations will involve ranges, so you will end up with a minimum and
Xmaximum amount of damage you can do to a monster.
X
XThe following formula can be used to compute damage when attacking a monster:
X
X       weapon damage value    (see explanation)
X     + undead/demon bonus     (see explanation)
X     + weapon enchantment     (see explanation)
X     + relative damage bonus  (see explanation)
X     + special bonuses        (see chart)
X     + ring bonus             (see explanation)
X     + strength bonus         (see chart)
X     -------------------------------------------------------------------
X       total damage done
X
XWeapon damage value:  The weapon damage value will be listed in the WEAPONS
Xsection as a minimum and maximum value.  Just look up the weapon that you're
Xusing and take either the small or large monster value depending upon what
Xtype of monster you're fighting.  If the "weapon" you're using isn't really a
Xweapon, but is some other object, look at the chart at the end of this
Xsection for information on the damage values of other objects.  Undead/demon
Xbonus:  If the weapon you are fighting with is blessed, and the monster you
Xare fighting is undead or a demon, you will do an extra one to four points of
Xdamage.
X
XWeapon enchantment:  This is whatever the "plus" on the weapon is.  For
Xinstance, if it's a +3 crysknife, you can add another +3 here.
X
XRelative damage bonus:  The relative damage bonus is only figured in for
Xartifacts (named weapons).  See the section on ARTIFACTS to look up the
Xrelative damage bonus on a named weapon.  Also, please note that if "x2" is
Xlisted for the relative damage bonus, it means to total everything up to the
Xrelative damage bonus in the above equation and double it.  Then you can
Xcontinue adding the other bonuses.
X
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X|Special bonuses:                                                | Bonus |
X|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
X|weapon is boomerang, is thrown, and breaks                      | +1    |
X|weapon is silver arrow, and is used versus a lycanthrope,       |       |
X|   minor demon (except tengus) or major demon                   | +1-20 |
X|if the weapon drains life (also removes one level from monster) | +1-8  |
X|if the weapon is poisoned (or can kill monster outright)        | +1-6  |
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
XRing bonus:  The ring bonus is only figured in if you are wearing a ring of

XHit Probability:
X
XComputing your probability to hit a monster involves many variables, and is
Xquite a complicated procedure (which is why the computer does it so much
Xbetter).  However, here is an outline of how you can figure out your
Xprobability of hitting a given monster with a given weapon...
X
XFirst of all, compute your chance to hit by using the following formula:
X
X       character luck
X     + character level
X     + monster AC             (see MONSTER INFORMATION section)
X     + dexterity bonus        (see chart)
X     + strength bonus         (see chart)
X     + level bonus            (see chart)
X     + special bonuses        (see chart)
X     + to hit modifier        (see chart)
X     + weapon enchantment     (see explanation)
X     + relative hit bonus          (see explanation)
X     - weight modifier        (see formula)
X     -------------------------------------------------------------------
X       chance to hit
X
XThe chance to hit is out of twenty.  Thus, to determine your percentage
Xchance of hitting, use the following formula:
X
X     percent chance to hit = 100 * (chance to hit) / 20

XWeapon enchantment:  This is whatever the "plus" on the weapon is.  For
Xinstance, if it's a +3 crysknife, add +3 for the weapon enchantment.
X
XRelative hit bonus:  The relative hit bonus is only figured in for artifacts
X(named weapons).  See the section on ARTIFACTS to look up the relative hit
Xbonus on a named weapon.
X
XWeight modifier: the weight modifier is computed as follows (to determine
Xcarrying capacity, see the section on CARRYING CAPACITY, and to determine
Xweight you are carrying, total the weights of all items in your inventory):
X     (weight you are carrying - carrying capacity + 40) / 20
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XKicking:
X
XKicking is one of the more useful functions in nethack.  Basically, you can
Xkick any creature or object within the game.  You cannot, however kick
Xanything if you are polymorphed into a monster with no legs (a snake, for
Xinstance) or a monster that is too small, if your legs are wounded, if your
Xload is too heavy, or if you are stuck in a pit or bear trap.  The effects of
Xkicking certain things are listed below (although be careful - kicking things
Xcan make a lot of noise and wake up monsters on the level):
X
XAltars - kicking an altar is, in general, a bad idea.  Deities can do all
Xsorts of nasty things to you if you get them pissed off.
X
XDoors - if a door is locked and you don't have a lock-pick, one way to get
Xthrough the door is to kick it down.  Watch out for lost hit points and
Xwounded legs if you do this, though.  Similarly, it is possible to kick down
Xa secret door, even if you haven't found it.  So... if you're pretty sure
Xthere's a secret door there, and you haven't found it after the last five
Xsearches, you might want to try kicking it a bit.
X
XChests - it is possible to break the lock on a locked chest by kicking it. Of
Xcourse, it is also possible to lose hit points and damage your legs by doing
Xso, so be careful to keep on eye out when at lower experience levels.
X
XEmpty space - kicking at empty space isn't terribly smart.  Although you
Xprobably will get away with it, you do have a chance of straining a muscle,
Xwhich wounds your right leg.
X
XMonsters - in general, when you kick a monster you will damage it.  Kicking a
Xmonster is a good alternative if you have no weapon.  It is also a good
Xalternative if you are confused, as you will not then randomly wander around
Xif you miss the monster aimed at.  There are however a few exceptions to the
Xrule with kicking monsters...  notably, kicking dragons and other thick-
Xskinned creatures will do no damage.
X
XObjects - in general, when you kick an object, it will move in the direction
Xin which you kick it.  The distance it moves will depend on your strength and
Xthe weight of the object.  Fragile objects are not good to kick.  For
Xinstance, kicking an egg will cause it to go splat, and kicking a potion will
Xgenerally break it.  Of course, this can be a way of identifying potions, as
Xyou will then get the vapor effect if the potion has any.
X
XSinks - kicking a sink will produce various effects.  75% of the time, you
Xwill merely get the message "Klunk!  The pipes vibrate noisily." (or just
X"Klunk!" if you're blind).  Otherwise, there is a 1/3 chance of having a
Xblack pudding ooze up from the drain and attack you (assuming they haven't
Xbeen genocided yet).  If this doesn't happen, you have a 1/3 chance of "the
Xdish washer" returning.  It just so happens that the dish washer is a
Xsuccubus/incubus, however, so you might want to watch out for this.  Assuming
Xthat doesn't happen, you've got a 1/3 chance that a ring (only one per sink)
Xwill pop up from the drain in a bunch of muddy waste.
X
XThrones - kicking a throne can have several effects.  If your luck is
Xnegative, you will always end up destroying the throne and finding several
Xgold pieces in the rubble (probably after a few sore toes, however).  If your
Xluck is positive, you have a chance of kicking loose some ornamental coins
Xand gems instead.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XLuck:
X
XYour luck begins at 0, (+/-1 depending on the moon), and can range from -10
Xto +10.  When modified, it will decrease or increase (time-out) by 1 toward
Xits starting value every 600 moves (300 for angry gods) unless you're
Xcarrying a luckstone (see TOOLS for more information about luckstones).
XWhile carrying a luckstone it is still possible to change your luck.
X
XIncreasing Luck
X
X1. Throw a gem at a unicorn.
X     +5 luck if the jewel is identified and the unicorn is co-aligned.
X     +1 luck if the jewel is unidentified.
X     -3 to +3 luck if the jewel is identified and the unicorn is non-co-
X     aligned.
X2. Sacrifice on a co-aligned altar.
X     +0 to +5 luck if the sacrifice is accepted, depending on monster
X     difficulty factor.  Seeing a four-leaf clover is a sign that your luck
X     has improved.
X     =0 if your luck is negative luck your god is not angry.
X     +1 luck if your luck is negative and your god is angry.
X3. Sacrifice on a non-co-aligned altar.
X     +1 if your luck is negative, the sacrifice is accepted and your god is
X     not angry.  Chance of success is (3 + exp. level) / (8 + exp. level)
X4. Sacrificing a human corpse at a chaotic altar.
X     +2 luck if you are chaotic too.
X5. Sitting on a throne.
X     +1 luck if your luck is negative (sometimes).
X6. Prayer.
X     =0 if your luck is negative and your god is not angry (small chance)
X
XDecreasing Luck
X
X1. Killing a co-aligned unicorn.
X     -5 luck no matter what.
X2. Sacrificing a human.
X     -5 luck if you are non-chaotic.
X3. After converting to a new god, trying to sacrifice at the altar of your
X     original god.  Conversion is accomplished by sacrificing at a non-co-
X     aligned altar while your god is angry.
X     -5 luck no matter what.
X4. Converting to a new god.
X     -3 luck always.
X5. Praying before your between prayer time-out expires.
X     -3 luck.  Moral: don't pray too often.
X6. Breaking a mirror.
X     -2 luck. (It figures, doesn't it?)
X7. Killing a friendly human.
X     -2 luck always.
X8. Killing a pet (or other tame monster).
X     -1 luck each time.
X9. Desecrating (kicking or digging) a co-aligned altar.
X     -1 luck (Ouch!)
X10. Killing a peaceful monster.
X     -1 luck (50% chance).
X11. Sacrifice at a non-co-aligned altar.
X     -1 luck if you fail and your god is not angry.  Chance of success is (3
X     + exp. level) / (8 + exp. level).
X12. Hitting a blind monster.
X     -1 luck (0.2% chance).
X
XRobbing shops does not lower your luck.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XMagic:
X
XMany people have asked for a section which details information about how the
Xreading of spellbooks and casting of spells works.  Well, here it is!
X
XMemorizing spellbooks:  If the spellbook is cursed, it will be impossible to
Xmemorize under any conditions.  Otherwise, the following test must be passed
Xin order to successfully memorize a spellbook:
X
X       (your intelligence + 4)
X     + (your experience level / 2)
X     - (2 * the spell level of the spellbook)
X     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
X     Must be greater than a randomly generated number from 0 to 20.
X
XThe possible effects from failing to memorize a spellbook are as follows
X(chances of each effect are equal):
X
X1. Your character is teleported.
X     "You feel a wrenching sensation."
X2. Your character gains the aggravate monster intrinsic.
X     "You feel threatened."
X3. You are blinded for 250 to 349 turns.
X4. You lose all of your gold.
X     "You realize that you have no gold."
X5. You become confused for 16 to 22 turns.
X     "These runes were just to much to comprehend."
X6. Poison!  Gloves, if being worn, are corroded (assuming they're not
X     rustproof) by 1 (i.e. +2 gloves become +1, +0 gloves become -1.  -2 is
X     the worst your gloves will corrode to).  If you are poison resistant,
X     you will lose 2 points of strength and 1 to 6 hit points.  Otherwise,
X     you will lose 3 to 6 points of strength and 1 to 10 hit points.
X     "The book was coated with contact poison!"
X7. The book explodes, doing 7 to 25 points of damage.  If you are magic
X     resistant, no damage ensues.
X     "As you read the book, it explodes in your face."
X
XWhen a spellbook is successfully memorized, it is placed in the list of
Xspells that you know.  You will then be able to use that spell (i.e. cast or
Xattempt to cast it) from 2 to (10 - the spell level) times before you will
Xneed to "re-memorize" the spell by reading another spellbook of that type.
X
XCasting memorized spells:  Attempts to cast a spell while you are confused
Xwill always fail.  Otherwise, in order to successfully cast a spell, the
Xfollowing test must be passed:
X
X       your intelligence
X     + your luck
X     - (3 * the level of the spell)
X     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
X     Must be greater than or equal to 0.
X
XIf a spell is successfully cast, the appropriate effects take place and a
Xnumber of energy points equal to the level of the spell is removed from your
Xcurrent EP.
X
XIf the spell is failed, a number of energy points equal to the level of the
Xspell is still removed from your current EP, and the following message is
Xgiven:
X     "The air around you crackles as you goof up." or
X     "Far out... a light show!" (if you are hallucinating)
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XPets:
X
XPets are one of the most useful things in the dungeons and so should be
Xtreated as such.  Here are a few useful hints regarding pets:
X
XThey will eat only what they need in order to survive and will leave food
Xrations alone unless they are very hungry or you throw them one.
X
XPets will become violent if they are too hungry, or if you leave them on a
Xlevel, go down the stairs and them come back later.
X
XYou can actually chat with your pets to gain knowledge about how hungry they
Xare.
X
X"You feel worried about your [pet]" means that your pet is starving. "You
Xhave a sad feeling for a moment" means that your pet has snuffed it. "You
Xhear noises in the distance" means that your pet is in battle.
X
XKittens change into housecats and then large cats, whereas little dogs become
Xdogs, and then large dogs.
X
XWatch out when you are confused, blind, etc.  You do not want to accidentally
Xkill your pet.
X
XThe minute you eat a dog or cat, every non-tame, non-peaceful monster that is
Xon the level will head for you with blood in its eye(s).  That is, you gain
Xan intrinsic:  Aggravate monster
X
XWhat monsters your pets will attack is directly dependent on the level of the
Xpet and the level of the monster.  Pets will not attack monsters more
Xpowerful than them.  The one exception is if you have on a ring of conflict.
XIf so, your pets will attack anything.  (Ever seen a minotaur make doggie
Xpancake? Moral: keep your ring of conflict off if you're near a big nasty.)
X
XIf you think your pet is a bit wimpy, use a wand of polymorph on him.  If
Xthis makes him wimpier, don't blame us - try again!
X
XA scroll of taming can create more pets for you, but having devils as pets
Xcan be a minor problem (although not as much of a problem in current
Xversions).
X
XIf you meet a wild pet, the best bet is to throw food at it - anything you
Xcould eat.  Tripe is wonderful, but don't bother throwing rotted corpses.
X
XYou can even tame pets with names given by other people, i.e. bones levels.
X
XA leash will allow you to keep the animal with you at all times (even if you
Xget teleported or go through a trap door), but also tends to make him get in
Xyour way more often.
X
XA whistle will attract your pet to you when applied.  Even better, a magic
Xwhistle will teleport your pet to your side when applied.  Very useful when
Xgoing up or down levels with your pet.
X
XPets will not pick up cursed objects or even cross over them, which will help
Xyou to avoid these items.  However, keep in mind that you may have to clear
Xcursed items from halls if you want your pet to follow you, and that if you
Xthrow a food item (especially tripe) on a cursed item, your pet will be
Xtrained to step on cursed items in the future.  A warning: dead-end corridors
Xcan be very bad if there is a cursed item in the exit and the pet is between
Xyou and the cursed item (this can happen if your pet kills a creature that
Xwas carrying a cursed item).
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XPraying:
X
XPraying can get you out of a lot of jams in the game of nethack, if your god
Xis pleased with you.  On the other hand, if the gods are angry at you, you
Xcan get into an awful lot of trouble.
X
XIf your deity is pleased with you, chances are that your worst problem will
Xbe fixed, although all of your problems could be fixed, or none of them might
Xbe fixed (this is dependent on your luck).  The following are problems that
Xyour deity might fix, from worst (in the deity's eyes, not necessarily
Xyours!) to least:
X
X1. You are turning to stone.
X2. You are being strangled (by an amulet of strangulation).
X3. You are sick.
X4. You are starving.
X5. Your hp are below 5, or your hp are below 1/7 of max.
X6. You have lycanthropy.
X7. You are stuck in a wall.
X8. You are wearing a cursed item which levitates you.
X9. You are wearing a cursed blindfold.
X10. You are being punished.
X11. You have a cursed loadstone or cursed luckstone.
X12. You are wielding/wearing a cursed weapon/armor.
X13. You are blind.
X14. You are hungry.
X15. You are poisoned.
X16. You have wounded legs.
X17. You are stunned.
X18. You are confused.
X19. You are hallucinating.
X
X-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
XRemoving Curses:
X
XThere are several ways to uncurse cursed items - and several other ways to
Xget rid of cursed items:
X
X1. Dipping in fountains will eventually remove the curse from stuff - "The
X     water glows for a moment" indicates that your item has been uncursed.
X     You can dip items even if you are wearing them.
X
X2. Reading a scroll of remove curse will remove the curse from stuff you are
X     wearing.  If the scroll of remove curse is blessed, everything in your
X     pack will be uncursed.
