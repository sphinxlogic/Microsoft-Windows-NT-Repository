X.SH NAME
Xcmake5 \- the game of 5-in-a-row
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B cmake5
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Make5
Xis a game similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.
XIt is called Wu3-Zi3-Qi2 in Chinese and is 
Xvery popular in the Far East.
X5-in-a-row and Go-Moku are the other names
Xfor this game.
XYou may also find it called "Chess" 
Xon some Nitendo game cartridges.
XI call it Make5 because the goal of this game
Xis to make five continuous stones in a line.
X.LP
XThis game was originally played by two players
Xon a board of infinite size.  Each player puts
Xa stone at one empty cross-point at a time.  
XThe winner is the one who first puts five
Xcontinuous stones in a line, vertically, 
Xhorizontally, or diagonally.
X.LP
XHowever, this program plays the game on a finite
Xboard the same size as a GO game board, which has
X19 by 19 cross-points.
X.I The only tricky rule 
X.I is that you must make
X.I exactly five continuous 
X.I stones in a line to win.  
X.I Six or more stones in
X.I a line do not count.
X.LP
XSome people play this game with a rule which
Xprohibits the first player to make double-3 or 
Xdouble-4 attacking patterns.  But I do not
Xlike this rule and did not include it in this 
Xprogram.
X.LP
X.SH OPTIONS
XSince this program is designed for the situation
Xwhen an X terminal is not available, only a
Xlimited user interface and options are supported.
XWhenever X is available, you would use 
X.B xmake5 
Xinstead.
X.LP
XOnly three playing modes are supported in cmake5:
X(1) challenge (computer moves first), 
X(2) computer vs. human (computer moves first),
X(3) human vs. computer (human moves first).
XIn the challenge mode,
Xyou can not undo or get suggestions
Xfrom the computer.  If you beat the computer, your
Xname would be added into the list of winners.
X.LP
XHave fun!
X
X.SH BUGS
X.nf
XPlease send bugs to "hsiehch@cs.nyu.edu".
X.LP
XThis program does not have any learning ability.  
XYou could use the same strategy to beat it again and again.
