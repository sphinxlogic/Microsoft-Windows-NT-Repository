X! (Note: for those got x4war1.0, that one is not publically released to

X! 	./bitmaps/chinese_piece
X! 
X!     the other is a set of drawings to represent pieces with images, under
X! 	./bitmaps/image_piece
X! 
X! 2). A real two players version is implemented.
X! 
X! 3). Makefile.simple changed to provide compilation selections of bitmap set.
X! 
X! 4). x4war.c, war.c, and war.h modified.
X! 
X! 5). bgbitmap.c changed for some modification to the background of the board.
X! 
X! 6). README changed to explain how to modify Makefile.simple or x4war.c for
X!     selecting a bitmap set.
X! 
X! 7). x4war.man changed, rule of the game is explained in more detail.
X! 
X! 8). this file (Patchlevel) is added.
