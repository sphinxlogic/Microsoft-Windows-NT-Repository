X.TH DOMINION 6 "18 OCT 1991"
X.SH NAME
Xdominion \- a multi-user game of world simulation and conquest

X.SH WARNING
XThis man page is an extract of the documentation of Dominion and is
Xlimited to the overview and the meaning of the options.  It is updated
Xonly occasionally, because the GNU project does not use nroff.  For
Xcomplete, current documentation, refer to the Info file Dominion or
Xthe DVI file dominion.dvi which are made from the LaTeXinfo source
Xfile dominion.texinfo.
X.SH OVERVIEW
X\fBDominion\fP is an empire-style multi-player world simulation game.
XEach player is the leader of a nation, and makes decisions for that
Xnation. The decisions are political, military, diplomatic and economic
Xand all these are extremely important for the well-being of a nation.
XSome nations can be played by the computer.  These nations are called
XNPCs (Non Player Countries).  They play a challenging game, and are
Xquite useful if few human players are available.
X.PP
XDominion has features from both fantasy role-playing games, educational
Xgames, and war games: a user needs to develop a character as leader of
Xa nation, keep a healty economy, and can then develop a strong
Xmilitary force using magic or technology.
X.PP
XMost of the moves you make are not resolved until the end of a turn,
Xwhen the \fIupdate\fP is run.  This update will incorporate your
Xchanges into the world data base, then it will update your economy,
Xhandle migration of people, resolve battles and conquest of land,
Xfreshen up your armies (restore move points), and a few other things.
X.PP
XThe rhythm of the game is set by how much money you have spent, and
Xhow much you have moved your armies.  If you have spent all your
Xmoney, you will need to wait until your revenue comes in (after the
Xupdate) before you can spend more.  Similarly, if you have already
Xmoved all your armies, and they are overcome by fatigue, then you will
Xhave to wait until they have recovered.  This will happen in the
Xupdate.  The time elapsed between updates is called a \fIthon\fP.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.IP
X-n nation_name	play as nation_name instead of promping for the name
X.IP
X-d dir_path	play the game from the directory dir_path instead of the
Xdefault directory
X.IP
X-h		invoke the cinfo documentaion browser
X.IP
X-p		print a list of all participating nations
X.IP
X-c		print the last update time
X.SH BUGS
XDominion is an extremely large piece of software.  There are certainly
Xmany bugs.
X.SH AUTHORS
XThere are many authors.  Refer to the complete manual to see the
