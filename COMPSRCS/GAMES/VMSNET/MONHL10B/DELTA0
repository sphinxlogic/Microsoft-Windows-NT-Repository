                  -----------------------

    Monster, a multiplayer adventure game where the players create the
    world and make the rules.

    Derived from Rich Skrenta's Monster (from version 1).

    Includes programmable non-player characters (NPC) with own programming
    language - MDL (Monster Defination Language). Also rooms and objects
    can program with it (via so called hooks). NPCs are called to 'monster',
