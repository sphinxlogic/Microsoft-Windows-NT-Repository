X   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
Xfor rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
Xprinting of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
Xcommand restores long descriptions.
X   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
Xof what the game is about.
X   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
Xto continue playing.
X   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
X   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
X   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
X   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
X   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
X   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
X   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
X`0CCommand abbreviations:
X
X   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
X   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
X   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
X
XContainment:
X
X   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
Xbe opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
Xnot be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
Xwhich is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
Xto see such an object, the container must be either open or
Xtransparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
Xthe number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
Xsizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
Xin your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
Xwill attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
Xprocess may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
Xcan contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
Xone level down.
X
XFighting:
X
X   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
Xattacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
XUseful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
Xetc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
Xfighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
Xgetting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
XStrength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
Xfight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
Xshould become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
X
XCommand parser:
X
X   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
XFor reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
Xfirst six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
X'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
Xcreates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
Xtion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
X`5BAlso note that upper and lower case are equivalent.`5D
X
X   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
Xthe following types of things--
X
X   Actions:
X`09Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
X`09Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
X`09PUT DOWN, etc.
X
X   Directions:
X`09NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
X`09Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
X`09only certain situations.
X`0C   Objects:
X`09Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
X
X   Adjectives:
X`09Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
X`09two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
X`09DOORs, BUTTONs).
X
X   Prepositions:
X`09It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
X`09the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
X`09without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
X`09CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
X`09When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
X`09WITH DEMON' won't parse.
X
X   Sentences:
X`09The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
X`09tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
X`09can be placed on the same line.
X
X   Ambiguity:
X`09The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
X`09actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
X`09If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
X`09that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
X`09Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
X`0C8.  Source Notes
X
XA few notes for source hackers.
X
X- The initialization module (DINIT.FTN) includes an access protection
X  function PROTCT.  If PROTCT returns a value of .TRUE., the game is
X  permitted to start;  if PROTCT returns .FALSE., the game is
X  terminated with a suitably nasty message.  At present, PROTCT is a
X  dummy routine and always returns .TRUE.;  by tailoring PROTCT,
X  access to the game can be restricted to certain hours or users.
X
X- The data base OPEN and READ statements are in the initialization
X  module (DINIT.FTN).  The data base file names are simply "DINDX.DAT"
X  and "DTEXT.DAT".  These may be freely changed to include logical
X  device names, UIC's, etc.  Thus, it is possible to place the data
X  base files on different devices, in a fixed UIC, etc.
X
X- Converting the game to another processor is not a straightforward
X  procedure.  The game makes heavy use of extended and/or
X  idiosynchratic features of PDP-11 Fortran.  Particular nasties
X  include the following:
X
X  > The game vocabulary is stored in Radix-50 notation.
X  > `5BF77 version has converted these to ints.`5D
X
X  > The game uses the extended I/O commands OPEN and CLOSE.
X
X  > The game uses LOGICAL*1 variables for character strings.
X  > `5BF77 version uses CHARACTER.`5D
X
X  > The game uses logical operators on integers for bitwise binary
X    operations.
X  > `5BF77 version uses the functions and() and or() and not() where
X    necessary, as well as standard fortran .and., .or., etc.`5D
X
X  > The game treats certain arrays and variables as unsigned
X    16-bit integers (integer overflow may occur).
X  > `5BF77 vax version uses 32-bit ints except in the subroutine
X    that reads the text file, where they are declared as 16-bits.
X    The F77 pdp version uses the -I2 compile flag force 16-bit
X    ints and logicals.`5D
X
X  In general, the game was implemented to fit in memory, not to be
X  transported.  You're on your own, friend!

X`0D`0A
X        1.1   The Game`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X        Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it  you
V`0D`0A
X        will  explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
V`0D`0A
X        man.  Hardened adventurers  have  run  screaming  from  the  terrors
V`0D`0A
X        contained within.`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X        In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten  secrets
V`0D`0A
X        of  a  lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
V`0D`0A
X        vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes,  treasures  guarded  by
V`0D`0A
X        fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X        Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology  Division  of  the
V`0D`0A
X        MIT  Laboratory  for  Computer  Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank,
V`0D`0A
X        Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by  the  Adventure
V`0D`0A
X        game  of  Crowther  and  Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of
V`0D`0A
X        Gygax and Arneson.  The original version was written in  MDL  (alias
V`0D`0A
X        MUDDLE).   The  current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN
V`0D`0A
X        IV by a  somewhat  paranoid  DEC  engineer  who  prefers  to  remain
V`0D`0A
X        anonymous.`0D`0A

X`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X        You are near a large dungeon,  which  is  reputed  to  contain  vast
V`0D`0A
X        quantities  of treasure.  Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
V`0D`0A
X        In order to do so, you must of course remove it  from  the  dungeon.
V`0D`0A
X        To  receive  full  credit  for it, you must deposit it safely in the
V`0D`0A
X        trophy case in the living room of the house.`0D`0A

X`0D`0A
X        In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects which
V`0D`0A
X        may  or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may need
V`0D`0A
X        sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,  since
V`0D`0A
X        dungeons  often  have  unfriendly  things  wandering about.  Reading
V`0D`0A
X        material is scattered around the dungeon as  well;  some  of  it  is
V`0D`0A
X        rumored to be useful.`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X        To determine how successful you have been, a score  is  kept.   When
V`0D`0A
X        you  find  a  valuable  object and pick it up, you receive a certain
V`0D`0A
X        number of points, which depends on the  difficulty  of  finding  the
V`0D`0A
X        object.   You  receive  extra  points  for transporting the treasure
V`0D`0A
X        safely to the living room and placing it in  the  trophy  case.   In
V`0D`0A
X        addition,   some   particularly   interesting  rooms  have  a  value
V`0D`0A
X        associated with visiting them.  The  only  penalty  is  for  getting
V`0D`0A
X        yourself killed, which you may do only twice.`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X`0D`0A
X        Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag)  who  likes
V`0D`0A
X        to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the light
V`0D`0A
X        of day).  He likes to take things.  Since  he  steals  for  pleasure
V`0D`0A
X        rather  than  profit  and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things
V`0D`0A
X        which you have seen.  Although he prefers  valuables,  sometimes  in
V`0D`0A
X        his  haste  he  may take something which is worthless.  From time to
V`0D`0A
X        time, he examines his take and discards  objects  which  he  doesn't
V`0D`0A
X        like.  He may occasionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more
V`0D`0A
X        often he just wanders through and rips you  off  (he  is  a  skilled
V`0D`0A
X        pickpocket).`0D`0A

X.hl 2 The Game
X
X.p; Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
Xyou will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
Xman.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
Xwithin.
X
X.p;In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
Xof a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
Xvast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
Xfearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
X
X.p;Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
XLaboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
XDaniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
XCrowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
Xand Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
XThe current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
Xa somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.
X
X.p;On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.
X
X.hl 2 Info
XFollowing is the summary produced by the info command:
X.bl 2
XWelcome to Dungeon!
X.bl 2
X.p;You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
Xquantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
XIn order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
Xreceive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
Xcase in the living room of the house.
X
X.p;In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
Xwhich may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
Xneed sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
Xsince dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
Xmaterial is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
Xis rumored to be useful.
X
X.p;To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
XWhen you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
Xcertain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
Xthe object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
Xsafely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
Xaddition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
Xwith visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
Xwhich you may do only twice.
X
X.p;Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
Xlikes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
Xlight of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
Xrather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
Xyou have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
Xhe may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
Xhis take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occasionally`20
Xstop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
Xthrough and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
X
X.hl 2 COMMANDS
X
X.p; BRIEF - suppresses printing of long room descriptions
Xfor rooms which have been visited.
X
X.p; SUPERBRIEF - suppresses printing of long room descriptions for all rooms
V.
X
X.p; VERBOSE - restores long descriptions.
X
X.p; INFO - prints information which might give some idea
Xof what the game is about.
X
X.p; QUIT - prints your score and asks whether you wish
Xto continue playing.
X
X.p; SAVE - saves the state of the game for later continuation.
X
X.p; RESTORE - restores a saved game.
X
X.p; INVENTORY - lists the objects in your possession.
X
X.p; LOOK - prints a description of your surroundings.
X
X.p; SCORE - prints your current score and ranking.
X
X.p; TIME - tells you how long you have been playing.
X
X.p; DIAGNOSE - reports on your injuries, if any.
X
X.p; A command that begins with '!' as the first character is taken to
Xbe a VMS command and is passed unchanged to DCL.
X
X.hl 2 Containment
X
X.p; Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
Xbe opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
Xnot be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
Xwhich is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
Xto see such an object, the container must be either open or
Xtransparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
Xthe number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
Xsizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
Xin your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
Xwill attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
Xprocess may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
Xcan contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
Xone level down.
X
X.hl 2 Fighting
X
X.p; Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
Xattacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
XUseful verbs here are "ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>",
X"KILL", etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
Xfighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
Xgetting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
XStrength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
Xfight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
Xshould become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
X
X.hl 2 Command Parser`20
X
X.p; A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
XFor reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
Xfirst six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
X"disassemble the encyclopedia" is not only meaningless, it also
Xcreates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this truncation
Xmay produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
XAlso note that upper and lower case are equivalent.
X
X.p; You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
Xthe following types of things:
X
X.p; Actions: Among the more obvious of these, such as
Xtake, put, drop,etc.
X.bl;
XFairly general forms of these may be used, such as
Xpick up, put down,
Xetc.
X
X.p; Directions:
Xnorth, south, up, down,
Xetc. and their various abbreviations.
XOther more obscure directions, eg.`20
X"land", "cross" are appropriate in only certain situations.
X
X.p; Objects:
XMost objects have names and can be referenced by them.
X
X.p; Adjectives:
XSome adjectives are understood and required when there are
Xtwo objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
Xdoors,
Xbuttons ).
X
X.p; Prepositions:
XIt may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
Xthe parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
Xwithout.  Thus
X"GIVE CAR TO DEMON"
Xwill work, as will
X"GIVE DEMON CAR" .
X"GIVE CAR DEMON" probably won't do anything interesting.
XWhen a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;
X"GIVE CAR WITH DEMON"
Xwon't parse.
X
X.p; Sentences:
XThe parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic`20
Xconstructions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
Xcan be placed on the same line.
X
X.p; Ambiguity:
XThe parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
Xactions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
XIf there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
Xthat it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
XMost questions asked by the parser can be answered.

X`09History of the VMS Implementation of Dungeon
X`09=============================================
X
XThis version of Dungeon has been re-ported to VMS Fortran from
Xthe Unix `5BTM`5D version which was ported from the PDP-11 version
X(which also ran on VMS) which was ported from the original
XMDL version from MIT.

XSubj:`09Game Information
XDate:`098-OCT-80
X
X
XThis is the first (and last) source release of the PDP-11 version of`20
XDungeon.
X
XPlease note that Dungeon has been superceded by the game ZORK(tm).
XThe following is an extract from the new product announcement for
XZORK in the September, 1980 issue of the RT-11 SIG newsletter:
X
X  "'ZORK:  The Great Underground Empire - Part I' ...was developed
X   by the original authors based on their ZORK (Dungeon) game for
X   the PDP-10.  It features a greatly improved parser;  command
X   input and transcript output files;  SAVEs to any device and
X   file name;  and adaptation to different terminal types,
X   including a status line on VT100s.  Note:  this is not the
X   FORTRAN version that has been available through DECUS.  This
X   version has been completely rewritten to run efficiently on
X   small machines - up to 10 times as fast as the DECUS version.
X
X   ...ZORK runs under RT-ll, HT-ll, or RSTS/E and requires as
X   little as 20K words of memory and a single floppy disk drive.
X   The game package, consisting of an RX01-format diskette and
X   an instruction booklet, is available from Infocom, Inc.,
X   P.O. Box 120, Kendall Station, Cambridge, Ma. 02142."
X
XZORK(tm) is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.  It is available for several
Xpopular personal computers as well as for the PDP-ll.

XSUMMARY
X-------
X
X`09`09    Welcome to Dungeon!
X
X   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
Xyou will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
Xman.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
Xwithin.
X
X   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
Xof a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
Xvast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
Xfearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
X
X   No DECsystem should be without one!
X
X   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
XLaboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
XDaniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
XCrowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
Xand Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
XThe current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
Xa somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.
X
X   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.
X
XII. From the Unix Internet version...
X
XThis version of dungeon has been modified from the original source
Xso that it will compile and execute on Unix`5BTM`5D Systems using the
Xf77 FORTRAN Compiler.  The original was written in DEC FORTRAN,
