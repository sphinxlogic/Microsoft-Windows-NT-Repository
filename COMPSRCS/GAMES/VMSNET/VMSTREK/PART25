XArchive-Name: netrek/faq
XLast-Updated: 19 Jun 1992
XChanges: Added METASERVER.
X
X
X1) What is Netrek?
X
X Netrek is a 16-player graphical real-time battle simulation with a`032
XStar Trek theme.  The game is divided into two teams of 8 (or less), who
Xdogfight each other and attempt to conquer each other's planets.  There
Xare several different types of ships, from fast, fragile scouts up to
Xbig, slow battleships; this allows a great deal of variance in play
Xstyles.
X
X Netrek is set up as a client/server combination; if you want to play,
Xyou'll need the client binary for your machine (most are X-based).
X
X
X2) It sounds interesting; how do I get started?
X
X First, you need to get a client binary for your machine; read the`032
XNetrek FTP List (which is usually posted along with this FAQ
Xlist) to find an FTP site.  The client should run on anything that
Xruns X Windows, although the slower your machine is, the harder it's
Xgoing to be to play.  Slow networks are even harder to play with.
X
XIf you don't know how to use FTP, ask your local guru about it.
X
XIf you don't have access to FTP, you can use the mail server at
Xdecwrl.dec.com.  Mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with 'help' in the body
X(nothing else) and you'll get an automatic reply with instructions.
X
XOnce you have the binary, rename it to something logical like 'netrek'
Xand run it with 'netrek -h <hostname> -p <port>'.  Read the Netrek Server/
XFTP List to find a server near you; the nearer, the better.
X
X
X3) What's the difference between Xtrek and Netrek?
X
X Xtrek is a precursor to Netrek.  It has many of the same elements,
Xbut it doesn't work as well because it isn't set up as a client-server
Xcombination. `032
X
XUnfortunately, Netrek is often called Xtrek.  This causes much confusion.
XThis newsgroup really is dedicated to Netrek, but feel free to talk about
XXtrek if you want; many people here play both.
X
X
X4) I've seen a game called Nettrek for the Macintosh; is that the same
Xthing as Netrek?
X
X No.  Nettrek is in the same family as Netrek (it's unclear which was
Xcreated first), but it's not the same game.  It runs over Appletalk
Xand doesn't have a whole lot of complexity.  If you're interested in it,`032
Xthe original version can be found in most net archive sites that support
XMac games.  The most recent version is a commercial program called
X"Nettrek 3.0 - The Real Version," and is published by Premiere Technology,
XInc.
X
X
X5) Can I play Netrek on my Mac/IBM PC/Amiga?
X
X Probably not.  If you aren't connected directly to the net via
Xethernet card, you can't.  If you ARE connected via ethernet but
Xaren't running X windows, you have a chance--there are ports for`032
Xthe Mac and the Amiga in the works, but nothing has yet been released.
XIf you're running Unix and X windows, you should be able to compile
Xthe source and it should work, emphasis on the 'should.'
X
X
X6) I would like to start a new server; what kind of hardware will I need?
X
X The server should run on anything that has shared memory and a good`032
Xamount of CPU power.  Good net connections are essential if you want
Xlots of players.
X
XRead the Netrek FTP list to find out where you can get the server`032
Xsource.
X
XPlease get the permission of your sysadmins before setting up a server.
XNetrek doesn't need any additional bad publicity.
X
X
X7) I'm trying to start a new server, and I'm having problems.  Where can
XI get help?
X
X Very much so.  Read the Netrek FTP list to find out where`032
Xthe server-secrets files are stored (currently as gs69.sp.cs.cmu.edu).
X
X There is also a server maintainer's mailing list, netrek@iastate.edu.
XIf you want to be put on the list, mail a short message to`032
Xnetrek-request@iastate.edu and include the amount of C experience
Xyou have, how much you know about netrek code, and anything else
Xthat might be interesting.
X
X
X8) I compiled the client source, but every time I try to connect to a server
X   it kicks me out or tells me to get a 'blessed' binary.  What gives?
X
X It's possible to modify the client source to do lots of tedious tasks
X(like aiming, dodging, that sort of thing) for you.  Since this gives
Xyou a big advantage over a mere human, netrek has a way of knowing whether
Xyou have a client that was compiled by the netrek Gods or by you.  If
Xyou compiled it, netrek will assume it's a cyborg, and will kick you out
Xif it's not cyborg hours.  Check the Netrek Server List for cyborg
Xhours of the servers; sometimes they're legal, sometimes they aren't. `032
X
X  If you're not interested in playing a modified binary, get one of the`032
Xpre-compiled 'blessed' binaries available at any of the FTP sites.  If`032
Xthere isn't a blessed binary for your particular machine, get in touch`032
Xwith one of the server Gods (sfd@miro.Berkeley.EDU,`032
Xterence@bronco.ece.cmu.edu, scott@sting.Berkeley.EDU) and they'll try`032
Xto help you out.
X
X   If you *are* interested in playing a modified binary, get the source
Xfrom one of the FTP sites and start hacking, or download one of the
Xpublic cyborgs.  It's probably not a good idea for new players to
Xuse cyborgs; cyborg players get called lots of nasty names, and
Xthey tend not to learn how to play the game (since their client is
Xdoing most of the work).
X
X
X9) I'm running under OpenWindows, and the game runs fine, but when the
X   Xtrek window comes up, I can't type anything into it.  How can I fix this
V?
X
XAdd the line "OpenWindows.FocusLenience: True" to your .Xdefaults file.
XLog out and log back in and it should work.
X
X
X10) OK, the game runs fine and I found a server and logged in, but there
X    doesn't seem to be anyone else around.  How can I find a game with
X    people in it?
X
XEric Mehlhaff has written a nifty little hack called METASERVER.
XDo 'telnet sickdog.cs.berkeley.edu 2520' and it will dump out a list
Xof servers with the number of people currently on each one.
X
X
X11) OK, now I'm in a game with other people.  What do I do?
X
XThe first thing you should do is bring up your message window (by
Xhitting '?') and your player list (by hitting 'L').  Pressing a number
Xkey chooses your warp speed.  The left mouse button fires torpedos at
Xyour cursor, the middle mouse button fires phasers at your cursor, and`032
Xthe right mouse button turns your ship towards your cursor.  Hitting
X'h' will bring up a help window with a list of basic commands.
X
X
X12) When I'm playing the game, people keep sending messages to me.  How do
X    I talk back to them?
X
XOn the bottom right-hand side of your main window you'll see two`032
Xlong boxes.  The top one is where messages like "Not enough fuel for
Xphaser" come up just before you die.  The bottom one is the one you
Xuse to talk to people.  Move your cursor down there and type a character
Xto choose who to send the message to: 'A' for ALL, the capitalized`032
Xteam letter for the team (i.e., 'F' for Federation), or the player
Xnumber for a message to a single player (i.e., 'c' to send to Rc).
XType your message and hit enter when you're done.  Don't do this in
Xcombat.
X
X
X13) I would like to change what some of the keys do; for example, I'd
X    like 't' instead of 'T' to activate my tractor beam.  Is there a way
X    to change this?
X
XThere are two ways: first, do a shift-O.  This brings up the options
Xwindow.  Near the bottom there is a box for 'New keymap entries'. `032
XMove your cursor to this box and type your new keymap entries.  The
Xformat is <newchar><oldchar>, so 'tT' will remap tractor beam to 't'.
X
XNetrek also recognizes a .xtrekrc file; a 'keymap:' line in there`032
Xwill allow you to map as many as you want.  Format is the same
Xas above.
X
X
X14) How does the rating/promotion system work?
X
X Do a shift-I on yourself; you'll see four ratings there, one for planets,
Xone for bombing, one for offense, and one for defense.  The planet,`032
Xbombing, and offense ratings are measured in DI/hour; for each planet
Xyou take, army you bomb, and player you kill you get a certain amount
Xof DI (which varies depending on the server)--the average amount per
Xhour is your rating.  Your rating is equal to (your DI/your hours)/
X(total DI/total hours); therefore, if you have a bombing rating of
X2.0, you bomb twice as many armies as the average person on the server.
XThis is true for all ratings.  All ratings are updated only in t-mode.
X
X Now do a shift-U.  Listed there are the thresholds for each rank. `032
XYour overall rating is your planets+bombing+offense.  To make a rank,
Xyou need to have the DI required for that rank, and your ratings need
Xto be above the rating required for that rank (i.e., to make Admiral,
Xyou need 320 DI and your ratings need to be above 8.0).  You can also
Xmake a ranking by having ratings good enough for a level and *twice*
Xthe DI you would need for the next level (So you can make Admiral`032
Xwith ratings of 7.0 and 640 DI).  This equation is recursive once, so you
Xcan also make it with 6.0 ratings and 1280 DI (which would take about`032
X200 hours!).  You can't make it with 5.0 ratings and 2560 DI; not
Xonly would you flunk out first, the server wouldn't promote you anyway.
X
X On most servers, your defense also needs to be above .8 to advance
Xpast Lt. Commander. `032
X
X
X15) I keep dying.  How can I get better at the game?
X
X The best way is probably to talk with someone who knows how to play.
XThere is also an archive of hints and suggestions on how to play`032
Xbetter; read the Netrek FTP List to find out where it is
Xlocated.
X
X
X16) What is 't-mode'?
X
X T-mode is short for 'tournament mode.'  To keep some integrity in the
Xdatabase, ratings are calculated only when there are a certain number
Xof people in the game (actually, when there are a certain number of
Xpeople on two separate teams.  On many servers, you need 4 players
Xon 2 different teams; 4 teams of 2 players won't do it).  When`032
Xthe game goes into t-mode, there will be a 't' flag in your list
Xof flags, and there will be a message like "Dan Quayle declares self
Xas Galactic Emperor and chaos breaks out!"  When the game drops out
Xof t-mode (because someone quit), the 't' flag will disappear and
Xthere'll be a "Dan Quayle is locked up and order returns to the galaxy"
Xmessage. `032
X
X It's generally considered rude to bomb or take planets out of t-mode.
XSome servers punish people for trying.
X
X
X17) What does DI stand for, anyway?
X
XDestruction Inflicted.
X
X
X18) Some of the servers and binaries are called 'UDP'; what does that mean?
X
XUDP is a network protocol that is much more lenient than TCP (which is`032
Xwhat netrek was originally based on).  If you don't have a local server
Xserver, using a UDP client on a UDP server could reduce your lag
Xconsiderably.  Read the Netrek FTP List to find out where you can get
Xa UDP client.
X
X
X19) I keep reading about the INL; what is it?
X
XThe INL is the Intercollegiate Netrek League, a collection of teams from
Xdifferent schools around the country who periodically beat up on each
Xother.  The league is full for the summer season, but will be open
Xin the fall.  Mail tom@ocf.berkeley.edu if you have any questions about it.
X
X
X20) Where can I get the most recent copy of this FAQ list?
X
X You can either look in the back messages of rec.games.netrek, or
Xftp it from one of the archive sites; read the Netrek Server/FTP
Xlist to find out where it is stored.  It's also in the Usenet archive
Xat pit-manager.mit.edu.
X
X
X21) My GPA has fallen 25% since I started playing Netrek last semester.
X    How do you find time to do your homework and still make Admiral?
X
XSorry, nobody's found an answer to this one yet.  Just remember that
X(GPA+kill ratio) is constant.
