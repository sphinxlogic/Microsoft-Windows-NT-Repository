X
X AND IT WILL BE DONE.  IN AUTOMATIC MODE, EITHER TWO OR FOUR NUMBERS
X MUST BE SUPPLIED.
X
X     AUTOMATIC MODE UTILIZES THE SHIP'S "BATTLE COMPUTER".  IF
X THE COMPUTER IS DAMAGED, MANUAL MOVEMENT MUST BE USED.
X`0C
X                                                                        10
X     IT USES TIME AND ENERGY TO MOVE.  HOW MUCH TIME AND HOW MUCH
X ENERGY DEPENDS ON YOUR CURRENT WARP FACTOR, THE DISTANCE YOU MOVE,
X AND WHETHER YOUR SHIELDS ARE UP.  THE HIGHER THE WARP FACTOR, THE
X FASTER YOU MOVE, BUT HIGHER WARP FACTORS REQUIRE MORE ENERGY.
X YOU MAY MOVE WITH YOUR SHIELDS UP, BUT THIS DOUBLES THE ENERGY
X REQUIRED.
X
X     EACH TIME YOU MOVE IN A QUADRANT CONTAINING KLINGONS, THEY
X HAVE A CHANCE TO ATTACK YOU.  IN THIS CASE, THE "ENERGY LEFT"
X MESSAGE YOU GET REFERS TO YOUR ENERGY AFTER THE ATTACK BUT BEFORE
X THE MOVE.  AS YOU MOVE, THE AMOUNT THAT THE KLINGONS HIT YOU WITH
X IS DEPENDENT ON YOUR AVERAGE DISTANCE FROM THEM.
X
X ***************
X * WARP FACTOR *
X ***************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  WARP
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  W
X     FULL COMMAND:  WARP <NUMBER>
X
X     YOUR WARP FACTOR CONTROLS THE SPEED OF YOUR STARSHIP.  THE
X LARGER THE WARP FACTOR, THE FASTER YOU GO AND THE MORE ENERGY
X YOU USE.
X
X     YOUR MINIMUM WARP FACTOR IS 1.0 AND YOUR MAXIMUM WARP FACTOR
X IS 10.0 (WHICH IS 100 TIMES AS FAST AND USES 1000 TIMES AS MUCH
X ENERGY).  AT SPEEDS ABOVE WARP 6 THERE IS SOME DANGER OF CAUSING
X DAMAGE TO YOUR WARP ENGINES; THIS DAMAGE IS LARGER AT HIGHER
X WARP FACTORS AND ALSO DEPENDS ON HOW FAR YOU GO AT THAT WARP
X FACTOR.
X
X     AT EXACTLY WARP 10 THERE IS SOME PROBABILITY OF ENTERING A
X SO-CALLED "TIME WARP" AND BEING THROWN FORWARD OR BACKWARD IN
X TIME.  THE FARTHER YOU GO AT WARP 10, THE GREATER IS THE PROBABILITY
X OF ENTERING THE TIME WARP.
X
X *******************
X * IMPULSE ENGINES *
X *******************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  IMPULSE
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  I
X     FULL COMMAND:  IMPULSE <MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC> <DISPLACEMENT OR DESTINATI
VON>
X
X     THE IMPULSE ENGINES GIVE YOU A WAY TO MOVE WHEN YOUR WARP
X ENGINES ARE DAMAGED.  THEY MOVE YOU AT A SPEED OF 0.95 SECTORS
X PER STARDATE, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A WARP FACTOR OF ABOUT
X 0.975, SO THEY ARE MUCH TOO SLOW TO USE EXCEPT IN EMERGENCIES.
X
X     MOVEMENT COMMANDS ARE INDICATED JUST AS IN THE "MOVE" COMMAND.
X
X     THE IMPULSE ENGINES REQUIRE 20 UNITS OF ENERGY TO ENGAGE,
X PLUS 10 UNITS PER SECTOR (100 UNITS PER QUADRANT) TRAVELLED.
X IT DOES NOT COST EXTRA TO MOVE WITH THE SHIELDS UP.
X`0C
X                                                                        11
X *********************
X * DEFLECTOR SHIELDS *
X *********************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  SHIELDS
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  SH
X     FULL COMMANDS:  SHIELDS UP
X                     SHIELDS DOWN
X                     SHIELDS TRANSFER <AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO TRANSFER>
X
X     YOUR DEFLECTOR SHIELDS ARE A DEFENSIVE DEVICE TO PROTECT YOU
X FROM KLINGON ATTACKS (AND NEARBY NOVAS).  AS THE SHIELDS PROTECT
X YOU, THEY GRADUALLY WEAKEN.  A SHIELD STRENGTH OF 75 PERCENT, FOR
X EXAMPLE, MEANS THAT THE NEXT TIME A KLINGON HITS YOU, YOUR SHIELDS
X WILL DEFLECT 75 PERCENT OF THE HIT, AND LET 25 PERCENT GET THROUGH
X TO HURT YOU.
X
X     IT COSTS 50 UNITS OF ENERGY TO RAISE SHIELDS, NOTHING TO LOWER
X THEM.  YOU MAY MOVE WITH YOUR SHIELDS UP; THIS COSTS NOTHING EXTRA
X UNDER IMPULSE POWER, BUT DOUBLES THE ENERGY REQUIRED FOR WARP DRIVE.
X
X     EACH TIME YOU RAISE OR LOWER YOUR SHIELDS, THE KLINGONS HAVE
X ANOTHER CHANCE TO ATTACK.  SINCE SHIELDS DO NOT RAISE AND LOWER
X INSTANTANEOUSLY, THE HITS YOU RECEIVE WILL BE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN
X WHAT THEY WOULD BE IF THE SHIELDS WERE COMPLETELY UP OR COMPLETELY DOWN.
X
X     YOU MAY NOT FIRE PHASERS THROUGH YOUR SHIELDS.  HOWEVER,
X YOU MAY USE THE "HIGH-SPEED SHIELD CONTROL" TO LOWER SHIELDS,
X FIRE PHASERS, AND RAISE THE SHIELDS AGAIN BEFORE THE KLINGONS CAN
X REACT.  SINCE RAPID LOWERING AND RAISING OF THE SHIELDS REQUIRES
X MORE ENERGY THAN NORMAL SPEED OPERATION, IT COSTS YOU 200 UNITS OF
X ENERGY TO ACTIVATE THIS CONTROL.  IT IS AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED WHEN
X YOU FIRE PHASERS WHILE SHIELDS ARE UP.  YOU MAY FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES,
X BUT THEY MAY BE DEFLECTED CONSIDERABLY FROM THEIR INTENDED COURSE
X AS THEY PASS THROUGH THE SHIELDS (DEPENDING ON SHIELD STRENGTH).
X
X     YOU MAY TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN THE SHIP'S ENERGY (GIVEN AS
X <ENERGY> IN STATUS) AND THE SHIELDS.  <TRANSFER> MAY BE ABBREVIATED
X <T>.  <AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO TRANSFER> IS THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF
X ENERGY YOU WISH TO TAKE FROM THE SHIP'S ENERGY AND PUT INTO THE
X SHIELDS.  IF YOU SPECIFY A NEGATIVE NUMBER, ENERGY IS DRAINED
X FROM THE SHIELDS TO THE SHIP.  TRANSFERRING ENERGY CONSTITUTES A
X TURN.  IF YOU TRANSFER ENERGY TO THE SHIELDS WHILE UNDER ATTACK,
X THEY WILL BE AT THE NEW ENERGY LEVEL WHEN YOU ARE NEXT HIT.
X`0C
X                                                                        12
X ***********
X * PHASERS *
X ***********
X
X     MNEMONIC:  PHASERS
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:   P
X     FULL COMMANDS:   PHASERS AUTOMATIC <AMOUNT TO FIRE> <NO>
X                      PHASERS <AMOUNT TO FIRE> <NO>
X                      PHASERS MANUAL <NO> <AMOUNT 1> <AMOUNT 2> ... <AMOUNT
V N>
X
X     PHASERS ARE ENERGY WEAPONS.  AS YOU FIRE PHASERS AT KLINGONS,
X YOU SPECIFY AN <AMOUNT TO FIRE> WHICH IS DRAWN FROM YOUR ENERGY
X RESERVES.  THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL HIT REQUIRED TO KILL AN ENEMY IS
X PARTLY RANDOM, BUT ALSO DEPENDS ON SKILL LEVEL.
X
X     THE AVERAGE HIT REQUIRED TO KILL AN ORDINARY KLINGON VARIES
X FROM 200 UNITS IN THE NOVICE GAME TO 250 UNITS IN THE EMERITUS
X GAME.  COMMANDERS NORMALLY REQUIRE FROM 600 (NOVICE) TO 700
X (EMERITUS).  THE "SUPER-COMMANDER" REQUIRES FROM 875 (GOOD)
X TO 1000 (EMERITUS).  ROMULANS REQUIRE AN AVERAGE OF 350 (NOVICE)
X TO 450 (EMERITUS).
X
X     HITS ON ENEMIES ARE CUMULATIVE, AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT LEAVE
X THE QUADRANT.
X
X     IN GENERAL, NOT ALL THAT YOU FIRE WILL REACH THE KLINGONS.
X THE FARTHER AWAY THEY ARE, THE LESS PHASER ENERGY WILL REACH THEM.
X IF A KLINGON IS ADJACENT TO YOU, HE WILL RECEIVE ABOUT 90 PERCENT
X OF THE PHASER ENERGY DIRECTED AT HIM; A KLINGON 5 SECTORS AWAY
X WILL RECEIVE ABOUT 60 PERCENT, AND A KLINGON 10 SECTORS AWAY WILL
X RECEIVE ABOUT 35 PERCENT.  THERE IS SOME RANDOMNESS INVOLVED, SO
X THESE FIGURES ARE NOT EXACT.  PHASERS HAVE NO EFFECT BEYOND THE
X BOUNDARIES OF THE QUADRANT YOU ARE IN.
X
X     PHASERS MAY OVERHEAT (AND BE DAMAGED) IF YOU FIRE TOO LARGE
X A BURST AT ONCE.  FIRING UP TO 1500 UNITS IS SAFE.  FROM 1500
X ON UP, THE PROBABILITY OF OVERHEAT INCREASES WITH THE AMOUNT FIRED.
X
X     IF PHASER FIRING IS AUTOMATIC, THE COMPUTER DECIDES HOW TO
X DIVIDE UP YOUR <AMOUNT TO FIRE> AMONG THE KLINGONS PRESENT.  IF
X PHASER FIRING IS MANUAL, YOU SPECIFY HOW MUCH ENERGY TO FIRE AT
X EACH KLINGON PRESENT (NEAREST FIRST), RATHER THAN JUST SPECIFYING
X A TOTAL AMOUNT.  YOU CAN ABBREVIATE "MANUAL" AND "AUTOMATIC" TO
X ONE OR MORE LETTERS; IF YOU MENTION NEITHER, AUTOMATIC FIRING IS
X USUALLY ASSUMED.
X
X     A SAFETY INTERLOCK PREVENTS PHASERS FROM BEING FIRED THROUGH
X THE SHIELDS.  IF THIS WERE NOT SO, THE SHIELDS WOULD CONTAIN
X YOUR FIRE AND YOU WOULD FRY YOURSELF.  HOWEVER, YOU MAY UTILIZE
X THE "HIGH-SPEED SHIELD CONTROL" TO DROP SHIELDS, FIRE PHASERS,
X AND RAISE SHIELDS BEFORE THE ENEMY CAN REACT.  SINCE IT TAKES
X MORE ENERGY TO RAISE THE SHIELDS RAPIDLY AFTER A SHOT, IT COSTS
X YOU 200 UNITS OF ENERGY EACH TIME YOU ACTIVATE THIS CONTROL.  IT
X IS AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED WHEN YOU FIRE PHASERS WHILE SHIELDS ARE UP.
X BY SPECIFYING THE <NO> OPTION, SHIELDS ARE NOT RAISED AFTER FIRING.
X
X     PHASERS HAVE NO EFFECT ON STARBASES (WHICH ARE SHIELDED) OR
X ON STARS.
X`0C
X                                                                        13
X ********************
X * PHOTON TORPEDOES *
X ********************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  PHOTONS
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  PHO
X     FULL COMMANDS:  PHOTONS <NUMBER> <TARG1> <TARG2> <TARG3>
X
X     PHOTON TORPEDOES ARE PROJECTILE WEAPONS--YOU EITHER HIT WHAT
X YOU AIM AT, OR YOU DON'T.  THERE ARE NO "PARTIAL HITS".
X
X     ONE PHOTON TORPEDO WILL USUALLY KILL ONE ORDINARY KLINGON,
X BUT IT USUALLY TAKES ABOUT TWO FOR A KLINGON COMMANDER.  PHOTON
X TORPEDOES CAN ALSO BLOW UP STARS AND STARBASES, IF YOU AREN'T
X CAREFUL.
X
X     YOU MAY FIRE PHOTON TORPEDOES SINGLY, OR IN BURSTS OF TWO
X OR THREE.  EACH TORPEDO IS INDIVIDUALLY TARGETABLE.  THE COMPUTER
X WILL PROMPT YOU, ASKING FOR THE TARGET SECTOR FOR EACH TORPEDO.
X ALTERNATELY, YOU MAY SPECIFY EACH TARGET IN THE COMMAND LINE.
X
X     PHOTON TORPEDOES CANNOT BE AIMED PRECISELY--THERE IS ALWAYS
X SOME RANDOMNESS INVOLVED IN THE DIRECTION THEY GO.  PHOTON
X TORPEDOES MAY BE FIRED WITH YOUR SHIELDS UP, BUT AS THEY PASS
X THROUGH THE SHIELDS THEY ARE RANDOMLY DEFLECTED FROM THEIR
X INTENDED COURSE EVEN MORE.
X
X     PHOTON TORPEDOES ARE PROXIMITY-FUSED.  THE CLOSER THEY
X EXPLODE TO THE ENEMY, THE MORE DAMAGE THEY DO.  THERE IS A HIT
X "WINDOW" ABOUT 1 SECTOR WIDE.  IF THE TORPEDO MISSES THE HIT
X WINDOW, IT DOES NOT EXPLODE AND THE ENEMY IS UNAFFECTED.
X PHOTON TORPEDOES ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE QUADRANT.  THEY
X HAVE NO EFFECT ON THINGS IN ADJACENT QUADRANTS.
X
X     IF MORE THAN ONE TORPEDO IS FIRED AND ONLY ONE TARGET
X SECTOR IS SPECIFIED, ALL TORPEDOES ARE FIRED AT THAT SECTOR.
X FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIRE TWO TORPEDOES AT SECTOR 3 - 4, YOU TYPE
X
X     PHO 2 3 4           (OR)           PHO 2 3 4 3 4
X
X TO FIRE TORPEDOES AT, CONSECUTIVELY, SECTORS 2 - 6, 1 - 10,
X AND 4 - 7, TYPE
X
X     PHO 3 2 6 1 10 4 7
X
X THERE IS NO RESTRICTION TO FIRE DIRECTLY AT A SECTOR.  FOR
X EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ENTER
X
X       PHO 1 3 2.5
X
X TO AIM BETWEEN TWO SECTORS.  HOWEVER, SECTOR NUMBERS MUST BE
X 1 TO 10 INCLUSIVE.
X`0C
X                                                                        14
X ********************
X * DOCK AT STARBASE *
X ********************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  DOCK
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  D
X
X     YOU MAY DOCK YOUR STARSHIP WHENEVER YOU ARE IN ONE OF THE
X EIGHT SECTOR POSITIONS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO A STARBASE.  WHEN
X YOU DOCK, YOUR STARSHIP IS RESUPPLIED WITH ENERGY, SHIELD ENERGY
X PHOTON TORPEDOES, AND LIFE SUPPORT RESERVES.  REPAIRS ALSO PROCEED
X FASTER AT STARBASE, SO IF SOME OF YOUR DEVICES ARE DAMAGED,
X YOU MAY WISH TO STAY AT BASE (BY USING THE "REST" COMMAND)
X UNTIL THEY ARE FIXED.  IF YOUR SHIP HAS MORE THAN ITS NORMAL
X MAXIMUM ENERGY (WHICH CAN HAPPEN IF YOU'VE LOADED CRYSTALS)
X THE SHIP'S ENERGY IS NOT CHANGED.
X
X     YOU MAY NOT DOCK WHILE IN STANDARD ORBIT AROUND A PLANET.
X
X     STARBASES HAVE THEIR OWN DEFLECTOR SHIELDS, SO YOU ARE
X COMPLETELY SAFE FROM ATTACK WHILE DOCKED.  YOU ARE ALSO SAFE
X FROM LONG-RANGE TRACTOR BEAMS.
X
X ********
X * REST *
X ********
X
X     MNEMONIC:  REST
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  R
X     FULL COMMAND:  REST <NUMBER OF STARDATES>
X
X     THIS COMMAND SIMPLY ALLOWS THE SPECIFIED NUMBER OF STARDATES
X TO GO BY.  THIS IS USEFUL IF YOU HAVE SUFFERED DAMAGES AND WISH
X TO WAIT UNTIL REPAIRS ARE MADE BEFORE YOU GO BACK INTO BATTLE.
X
X     IT IS NOT GENERALLY ADVISABLE TO REST WHILE YOU ARE UNDER
X ATTACK BY KLINGONS.

X **************************
X * CALL STARBASE FOR HELP *
X **************************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  HELP
X     (NO ABBREVIATION)
X
X     WHEN YOU GET INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE, YOU MAY CALL STARBASE FOR
X HELP.  STARBASES HAVE A DEVICE CALLED A "LONG-RANGE TRANSPORTER
X BEAM" WHICH THEY CAN USE TO TELEPORT YOU TO BASE.  THIS WORKS BY
X DEMATERIALIZING YOUR STARSHIP AT ITS CURRENT POSITION AND (HOPEFULLY)
X RE-MATERIALIZING IT ADJACENT TO THE NEAREST STARBASE.  TELEPORTATION
X IS INSTANTANEOUS, AND STARBASE SUPPLIES THE REQUIRED ENERGY--ALL YOU
X HAVE TO DO IS LET THEM KNOW (VIA SUBSPACE RADIO) THAT YOU NEED HELP.
X`0C
X                                                                        15
X     THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE EMPLOYED ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
X IN THE FIRST PLACE, CALLING FOR HELP IS AN ADMISSION ON YOUR PART
X THAT YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO SOMETHING YOU CANNOT GET YOURSELF OUT
X OF, AND YOU ARE HEAVILY PENALIZED FOR THIS IN THE FINAL SCORING.
X SECONDLY, THE LONG-RANGE TRANSPORTER BEAM IS NOT RELIABLE--STARBASE
X CAN ALWAYS MANAGE TO DEMATERIALIZE YOUR STARSHIP, BUT (DEPENDING
X ON DISTANCE) MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RE-MATERIALIZE YOU AGAIN.
X THE LONG-RANGE TRANSPORTER BEAM HAS NO ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RANGE;
X IF YOU ARE IN THE SAME QUADRANT AS A STARBASE, YOU HAVE A GOOD
X CHANCE (ABOUT 90 PERCENT) OF RE-MATERIALIZING SUCCESSFULLY.
X YOUR CHANCES DROP TO ROUGHLY 50-50 AT JUST OVER 3 QUADRANTS.

X ****************
X * ABANDON SHIP *
X ****************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  ABANDON
X     (NO ABBREVIATION)
X
X     YOU MAY ABANDON THE ENTERPRISE IF NECESSARY.  IF THERE IS
X STILL A STARBASE IN THE GALAXY, YOU WILL BE SENT THERE AND PUT
X IN CHARGE OF A WEAKER SHIP, THE FAERIE QUEENE.
X
X     THE FAERIE QUEENE CANNOT BE ABANDONED.
X
X *****************
X * SELF-DESTRUCT *
X *****************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  DESTRUCT
X     (NO ABBREVIATION)
X
X     YOU MAY SELF-DESTRUCT, THUS KILLING YOURSELF AND ENDING THE
X GAME.  IF THERE ARE NEARBY KLINGONS, YOU MAY TAKE A FEW OF THEM
X WITH YOU (THE MORE ENERGY YOU HAVE LEFT, THE BIGGER THE BANG).
X
X     IN ORDER TO SELF-DESTRUCT YOU MUST REMEMBER THE PASSWORD YOU
X TYPED IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.

X ******************************
X * TERMINATE THE CURRENT GAME *
X ******************************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  TERMINATE
X     (NO ABBREVIATION)

X     IMMEDIATELY CANCEL THE CURRENT GAME; NO CONCLUSION IS REACHED.
X YOU WILL BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO START A NEW GAME OR TO LEAVE
X THE STAR TREK PROGRAM.
