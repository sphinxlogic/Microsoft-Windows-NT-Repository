X A CERTIFICATE OF MERIT PRINTED WITH YOUR NAME, DATE, AND
X KLINGON KILL RATE, PROVIDED YOU ARE PROMOTED FROM EITHER THE
X "EXPERT" OR "EMERITUS" LEVELS.
X
X     YOU SHOULD PROBABLY START OUT AT THE NOVICE LEVEL, EVEN IF YOU
X ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH ONE OF THE OTHER VERSIONS OF THE STAR TREK
X GAME--BUT, OF COURSE, THE LEVEL OF GAME YOU PLAY IS UP TO YOU.  IF
X YOU WANT TO START AT THE EXPERT LEVEL, GO AHEAD.  IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.
X THE EMERITUS GAME IS STRICTLY FOR MASOCHISTS.

X COURSES ARE GIVEN IN MANUAL MODE IN X - Y DISPLACEMENTS; IN AUTOMATIC
X     MODE AS DESTINATION QUADRANT AND/OR SECTOR.  MANUAL MODE IS DEFAULT.
X DISTANCES ARE GIVEN IN QUADRANTS.  A DISTANCE OF ONE SECTOR IS 0.1 QUADRANT
V.
X ORDINARY KLINGONS HAVE ABOUT 400 UNITS OF ENERGY, COMMANDERS ABOUT
X     1200.  ROMULANS NORMALLY HAVE ABOUT 800 UNITS OF ENERGY, AND THE
X     (GULP) "SUPER-COMMANDER" HAS ABOUT 1800.
X PHASER FIRE DIMINISHES TO ABOUT 60 PERCENT AT 5 SECTORS.  UP TO 1500
X     UNITS MAY BE FIRED IN A SINGLE BURST WITHOUT DANGER OF OVERHEAT.
X WARP 6 IS THE FASTEST SAFE SPEED.  AT HIGHER SPEEDS, ENGINE DAMAGE
X     MAY OCCUR.  AT WARP 10 YOU MAY ENTER A TIME WARP.
X SHIELDS COST 50 UNITS OF ENERGY TO RAISE, AND DOUBLE THE POWER
X     REQUIREMENTS OF MOVING UNDER WARP DRIVE.  ENGAGING THE HIGH-SPEED
X     SHIELD CONTROL REQUIRES 200 UNITS OF ENERGY.
X WARP DRIVE REQUIRES (DISTANCE)*(WARP FACTOR CUBED) UNITS OF ENERGY
X     TO TRAVEL AT A SPEED OF (WARP FACTOR SQUARED)/10 QUADRANTS PER STARDATE
V.
X IMPULSE ENGINES REQUIRE 20 UNITS TO WARM UP, PLUS 100 UNITS PER
X     QUADRANT.  SPEED IS JUST UNDER ONE SECTOR PER STARDATE.

X
X
X     THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK PROFESSOR MICHAEL DUGGAN FOR
X HIS ENCOURAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT
X OF THE STAR TREK GAME, WITHOUT WHICH IT MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN
X COMPLETED.
X
X     MUCH CREDIT IS DUE TO PATRICK MCGEHEARTY AND RICH COHEN, WHO
X ASSISTED WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE GAME AND CONTRIBUTED
X GREATLY TO ITS CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT.
X
X     THANKS ARE ALSO DUE TO CARL STRANGE, HARDY TICHENOR AND STEVEN
X BRUELL FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE WITH CERTAIN CODING PROBLEMS.
X
X     THIS GAME WAS INSPIRED BY AND RATHER LOOSELY BASED ON AN EARLIER
X GAME, PROGRAMMED IN THE BASIC LANGUAGE, BY JIM KORP AND GRADY HICKS.
X IT IS THE AUTHORS' UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BASIC GAME WAS IN TURN
X DERIVED FROM A STILL EARLIER VERSION IN USE AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY.
