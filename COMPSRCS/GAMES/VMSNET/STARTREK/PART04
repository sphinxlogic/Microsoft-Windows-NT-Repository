-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ START OF PART 4 -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
X     TO LAND ON A PLANET YOU MUST FIRST BE IN STANDARD ORBIT.
X YOU ACHIEVE THIS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO DOCKING AT STARBASE.
X MOVING TO ONE OF THE EIGHT SECTOR POSITIONS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT
X TO THE PLANET, YOU GIVE THE ORBIT COMMAND WHICH PUTS YOUR SHIP
X INTO STANDARD ORBIT ABOUT THE PLANET.  SINCE THIS IS A MANEUVER,
X A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME IS USED; NEGLIGIBLE ENERGY IS REQUIRED.
X IF ENEMIES ARE PRESENT, THEY WILL ATTACK.

X **********************
X * TRANSPORTER-TRAVEL *
X **********************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  TRANSPORT
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  T
X
X     THE TRANSPORTER IS A DEVICE WHICH CAN CONVERT ANY PHYSICAL
X OBJECT INTO ENERGY, BEAM THE ENERGY THROUGH SPACE, AND RECONSTRUCT
X THE PHYSICAL OBJECT AT SOME DESTINATION.  TRANSPORTING IS ONE
X WAY TO LAND ON A PLANET.  SINCE THE TRANSPORTER HAS A LIMITED
X RANGE, YOU MUST BE IN STANDARD ORBIT TO BEAM DOWN TO A PLANET.
X SHIELDS MUST BE DOWN WHILE TRANSPORTING.
X
X     THE TRANSPORT COMMAND IS USED TO BEAM A LANDING PARTY ONTO
X A PLANET TO MINE "DILITHIUM CRYSTALS".  EACH TIME THE COMMAND
X IS GIVEN THE LANDING PARTY (WHICH YOU LEAD) MOVES FROM THE SHIP
X TO THE PLANET, OR VICE-VERSA.
X
X     YOU ARE ADVISED AGAINST NEEDLESS TRANSPORTING, SINCE LIKE
X ALL DEVICES, THE TRANSPORTER WILL SOMETIMES MALFUNCTION.
X
X     THE TRANSPORTER CONSUMES NEGLIGIBLE TIME AND ENERGY.  ITS
X USE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A "TURN".
X`0C
X                                                                        17
X *****************
X * SHUTTLE CRAFT *
X *****************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  SHUTTLE
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  SHU
X
X     AN ALTERNATE WAY TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM PLANETS.  BECAUSE
X OF LIMITED RANGE, YOU MUST BE IN STANDARD ORBIT TO USE THE
X SHUTTLE CRAFT, NAMED "GALILEO".  SHIELDS MUST BE DOWN.
X
X     UNLIKE TRANSPORTING, USE OF THE SHUTTLE CRAFT DOES CONSTITUTE
X A "TURN" SINCE TIME IS CONSUMED.  THE TIME NATURALLY DEPENDS
X ON ORBIT ALTITUDE, BUT WILL USUALLY BE LESS THAN 0.2 STARDATES.
X SHUTTLING USES NO SHIP ENERGY.
X
X ***************************
X * MINE DILITHIUM CRYSTALS *
X ***************************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  MINE
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  MI
X
X     ONCE YOU AND YOUR MINING PARTY ARE ON THE SURFACE OF A
X PLANET WHICH HAS DILITHIUM CRYSTALS, THIS COMMAND WILL DIG THEM
X FOR YOU.
X
X     MINING REQUIRES TIME AND CONSTITUTES A "TURN".  NO ENERGY
X IS USED.  CLASS M PLANETS REQUIRE 0.1 TO 0.3 STARDATES TO MINE.
X CLASS N PLANETS TAKE TWICE AS LONG, AND CLASS O PLANETS TAKE
X THREE TIMES AS LONG.
X
X     DILITHIUM CRYSTALS CONTAIN ENORMOUS ENERGY IN A FORM
X THAT IS READILY RELEASED IN THE SHIP'S POWER SYSTEM.  IT
X IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO MINE THEM WHENEVER POSSIBLE, FOR USE
X IN EMERGENCIES.  ONCE YOU HAVE MINED CRYSTALS, AND HAVE THEM
X SAFELY ABOARD SHIP, YOU HAVE A SUPPLY THAT WILL LAST THE ENTIRE
X GAME.  THERE IS NO NEED TO GO BACK FOR MORE (UNLESS YOU ABANDON
X SHIP).
X
X ***************************
X * LOAD DILITHIUM CRYSTALS *
X ***************************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  CRYSTALS
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  CR
X
X     THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL COMMAND WHICH SHOULD BE USED WITH
X CAUTION.  ONCE YOU HAVE DILITHIUM CRYSTALS ABOARD SHIP, THIS
X COMMAND WILL INSTRUCT ENGINEERING OFFICER SCOTT AND MR. SPOCK
X TO PLACE A RAW DILITHIUM CRYSTAL INTO THE POWER CHANNEL OF THE
X SHIP'S MATTER-ANTIMATTER CONVERTER.  WHEN IT WORKS, THIS COMMAND
X WILL GREATLY BOOST THE SHIP'S ENERGY.
X`0C
X                                                                        18
X     BECAUSE THE CRYSTALS ARE RAW AND IMPURE, INSTABILITIES
X CAN OCCUR IN THE POWER CHANNEL.  USUALLY SCOTTY CAN CONTROL
X THESE.  WHEN HE CANNOT, THE RESULTS ARE DISASTROUS.
X
X     EVEN IF THE CRYSTALS ARE LOADED SUCCESSFULLY, SOME DAMAGE
X IS INEVITABLY DONE TO THE POWER CHANNEL.  THIS DAMAGE HAS NO
X EFFECT ON THE OPERATION OF THE POWER PLANT, BUT WILL MAKE IT MORE
X DIFFICULT TO CONTROL INSTABILITIES THE NEXT TIME CRYSTALS ARE
X LOADED.
X
X     SINCE USING RAW DILITHIUM CRYSTALS FOR THIS PURPOSE ENTAILS
X CONSIDERABLE RISK, STARFLEET REGULATIONS ALLOW ITS USE ONLY DURING
X "CONDITION YELLOW".  NO TIME OR ENERGY IS USED.

X * PLANET REPORT *
X *****************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  PLANETS
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  PL
X
X     MR. SPOCK PRESENTS YOU A LIST OF THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION
X ON PLANETS IN THE GALAXY.  SINCE PLANETS DO NOT SHOW UP ON
X LONG-RANGE SCANS, THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION IS
X WITH THE "SENSORS" COMMAND.

X * FREEZE *
X **********
X
X     MNEMONIC:  FREEZE
X     (NO ABBREVIATION)
X     FULL COMMAND:  FREEZE <FILE NAME>
X
X     THE PURPOSE OF THE <FREEZE> COMMAND IS TO ALLOW A PLAYER
X TO SAVE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME, SO THAT IT CAN BE FINISHED
X LATER.  A FILE WITH THE SPECIFIED <FILE NAME> AND TYPE '.TRK' IS
X CREATED (IF NECESSARY) IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY, AND ALL PERTINENT
X INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME IS WRITTEN TO THAT FILE.  THE GAME
X IS THEN TERMINATED, AND YOU ARE GIVEN THE CHOICE OF STARTING A NEW
X GAME OR LEAVING THE PROGRAM.  YOU MAY CONTINUE THE CURRENT GAME
X USING THE PROCEDURE DESCRIBED NEXT.
X
X     TO RESTART A GAME CREATED BY THE "FREEZE" COMMAND, THE USER
X NEED ONLY TYPE "FROZEN" IN RESPONSE TO THE INITIAL QUESTION
X ABOUT THE TYPE OF GAME DESIRED, FOLLOWED BY THE <FILE NAME>.
X
X     NOTE:  A "TOURNAMENT" GAME IS LIKE A FROZEN GAME, WITH THE
X FOLLOWING DIFFERENCES.  (1)  TOURNAMENT GAMES ALWAYS START FROM
X THE BEGINNING, WHILE A FROZEN GAME CAN START AT ANY POINT.
X (2)  TOURNAMENT GAMES REQUIRE ONLY THAT THE PLAYER REMEMBER THE
X NAME OR NUMBER OF THE TOURNAMENT, WHILE THE INFORMATION ABOUT A
X FROZEN GAME MUST BE KEPT ON A FILE.
X
X     A POINT WORTH NOTING IS THAT 'FREEZE' DOES NOT SAVE THE SEED
X FOR THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR, SO THAT IDENTICAL ACTIONS AFTER
X RESTARTING THE SAME FROZEN GAME CAN LEAD TO DIFFERENT RESULTS.
X HOWEVER, IDENTICAL ACTIONS AFTER STARTING A GIVEN TOURNAMENT
X GAME ALWAYS LEAD TO THE SAME RESULTS.

X * EXPERIMENTAL DEATH RAY *
X **************************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  DEATHRAY
X     (NO ABBREVIATION)
X
X     THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE USED ONLY IN THOSE DESPERATE CASES
X WHERE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ALTERNATIVE.  THE DEATH RAY USES
X ENERGY TO REARRANGE MATTER.  UNFORTUNATELY, ITS WORKING PRINCIPLES
X ARE NOT YET THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD, AND THE RESULTS ARE HIGHLY
X UNPREDICTABLE.
X
X      THE DEATH RAY IS A VERY DELICATE DEVICE AND IS USUALLY DAMAGED
X AFTER ITS FIRST USE.  THE FIRST TIME ONE USES THE DEATH RAY, THERE
X IS A SEVENTY PERCENT CHANCE OF ITS FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY.  WHEN IT
X WORKS, THE DEATH RAY ELIMINATES ALL THE ENEMIES IN THE QUADRANT.
X WHEN IT DOES NOT.....................
X
X      IF THE DEATH RAY IS DAMAGED IN ITS USE, IT MUST BE TOTALLY
X REPLACED.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE AT STARBASE.  BECAUSE IT IS A VERY
X COMPLEX DEVICE, IT TAKES 9.99 STARDATES AT BASE TO REPLACE THE
X DEATH RAY.
X
X      THE DEATH RAY CANNOT BE REPAIRED IN FLIGHT.

X
X     MNEMONIC:  EMEXIT
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  E
X
X     THIS COMMAND PROVIDES A QUICK WAY TO EXIT FROM THE GAME WHEN
X YOU OBSERVE A KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER APPROACHING YOUR TERMINAL.
X ITS EFFECT IS TO FREEZE THE GAME ON THE FILE 'EMSAVE.TRK' IN YOUR
X CURRENT DIRECTORY, ERASE THE SCREEN (IF YOU ARE PLAYING AT A VT52),
X AND EXIT.
X
X     A SHORT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:  THE SCREEN ERASURE IS DONE BY THE
X MODULE 'GETOUT', WHICH CAN EASILY BE MODIFIED TO HANDLE TERMINALS
X THAT USE DIFFERENT CONTROL OR ESCAPE SEQUENCES TO EFFECT SCREEN
X ERASURE.

X
X     MNEMONIC:  GAME
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  G
X
X     THIS COMMAND SUPPLIES YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE OF THE
X CURRENT GAME.  ITS PURPOSE IS TO REMIND YOU OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE
X LEARNED DURING PLAY, BUT MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN, AND CANNOT OTHERWISE
X RETRIEVE IF YOU ARE NOT PLAYING AT A HARD-COPY TERMINAL.
X
X     YOU ARE TOLD THE FOLLOWING THINGS:
X
X       . THE LENGTH AND SKILL LEVEL OF THE GAME YOU ARE PLAYING
X       . THE ORIGINAL NUMBER OF KLINGONS
X       . HOW MANY KLINGONS YOU HAVE DESTROYED
X       . WHETHER THE SUPER-COMMANDER HAS BEEN DESTROYED
X       . HOW MANY BASES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED
X       . HOW MANY BASES ARE LEFT
X       . WHAT BASES (IF ANY) ARE UNDER ATTACK; YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
X         INFORMED OF THE ATTACK VIA SUBSPACE RADIO
X       . HOW MANY CASUALTIES YOU HAVE SUFFERED
X       . HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE CALLED FOR HELP.
X
X YOU ARE ALSO WARNED IF THE SUBSPACE RADIO HAS BEEN DAMAGED, WHICH
X MAY RENDER YOUR INFORMATION INCOMPLETE.
X
X     THIS SAME INFORMATION IS AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN TO YOU WHEN YOU
X START TO PLAY A FROZEN GAME.

X               ----------MISCELLANEOUS NOTES----------
X
X     STARBASES CAN BE ATTACKED BY EITHER COMMANDERS OR BY THE
X "SUPER-COMMANDER".  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED
X BY SUBSPACE RADIO, PROVIDED IT IS WORKING.  THE MESSAGE WILL
X INFORM YOU HOW LONG THE BASE UNDER ATTACK CAN LAST.  SINCE THE
X "SUPER-COMMANDER" IS MORE POWERFUL THAN AN ORDINARY COMMANDER,
X HE CAN DESTROY A BASE MORE QUICKLY.
X
X     THE "SUPER-COMMANDER" TRAVELS AROUND THE GALAXY AT A SPEED
X OF ABOUT WARP 6 OR 7.  HIS MOVEMENT IS STRICTLY TIME BASED; THE
X MORE TIME PASSES, THE FURTHER HE CAN GO.
X
X     SCATTERED THROUGH THE GALAXY ARE CERTAIN ZONES OF CONTROL,
X COLLECTIVELY DESIGNATED THE "ROMULAN NEUTRAL ZONE".  ANY
X QUADRANT WHICH CONTAINS ROMULANS WITHOUT KLINGONS IS PART OF THE
X NEUTRAL ZONE, EXCEPT IF A BASE IS PRESENT.  SINCE ROMULANS DO NOT
X SHOW ON EITHER THE LONG-RANGE SCAN OR THE STAR CHART, IT IS EASY
X FOR YOU TO STUMBLE INTO THIS ZONE.  WHEN YOU DO, IF YOUR SUBSPACE
X RADIO IS WORKING, YOU WILL RECEIVE A WARNING MESSAGE FROM THE
X ROMULAN, POLITELY ASKING YOU TO LEAVE.
X
X     IN GENERAL, ROMULANS ARE A GALACTIC NUISANCE.
X
X     THE HIGH-SPEED SHIELD CONTROL IS FAIRLY RELIABLE, BUT IT HAS
X BEEN KNOWN TO MALFUNCTION.
X
X     YOU CAN OBSERVE THE GALACTIC MOVEMENTS OF THE "SUPER-COMMANDER"
X ON THE STAR CHART, PROVIDED HE IS IN TERRITORY YOU HAVE SCANNED.
X
X     PERIODICALLY, YOU WILL RECEIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM
X STARFLEET COMMAND, INDICATING THE CURRENT QUADRANT OF THE
X "SUPER-COMMANDER".  YOUR SUBSPACE RADIO MUST BE WORKING, OF
X COURSE.
X
X     EACH QUADRANT WILL CONTAIN FROM 0 TO 3 BLACK HOLES.
X TORPEDOES ENTERING A BLACK HOLE DISAPPEAR.  IN FACT, ANYTHING
X ENTERING A BLACK HOLE DISAPPEARS, PERMANENTLY.  IF YOU CAN DISPLACE
X AN ENEMY INTO ONE, HE IS A GONER.  BLACK HOLES DO NOT NECESSARILY
X REMAIN IN A QUADRANT.  THEY ARE TRANSIENT PHENOMENA.
X
X     BATTLE COMPUTER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE BY FIRING PHASERS
X MANUALLY, AND ALLOWING THE COMPUTER TO PROMPT YOU.  IF YOU ENTER
X ZERO FOR THE AMOUNT TO FIRE AT EACH ENEMY, YOU WILL GET A
X COMPLETE REPORT, WITHOUT COST.  THE BATTLE COMPUTER WILL TELL YOU HOW
X MUCH PHASER ENERGY TO FIRE AT EACH ENEMY FOR A SURE KILL.  THIS
X INFO APPEARS IN PARENTHESES PRIOR TO THE PROMPT FOR EACH ENEMY.
X SINCE THE AMOUNT IS COMPUTED FROM SENSOR DATA, IF EITHER THE COMPUTER
X OR S.R. SENSORS ARE DAMAGED, THIS INFO WILL BE UNAVAILABLE, AND
X PHASERS MUST BE FIRED MANUALLY.  BATTLE COMPUTER INFORMATION CAN BE
X OBTAINED EVEN IF THE PHASERS ARE DAMAGED (OR OTHERWISE UNUSABLE),
X PROVIDED THE COMPUTER AND SHORT-RANGE SENSORS ARE BOTH WORKING.
X
X     IF WARP ENGINES ARE DAMAGED LESS THAN 10 STARDATES (UNDOCKED)
X YOU CAN STILL GO WARP 4.

X
X                     ----------SCORING----------
X
X
X     SCORING IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.  YOU GET POINTS FOR GOOD THINGS, AND
X YOU LOSE POINTS FOR BAD THINGS.
X
X YOU GAIN--
X
X     (1)   10 POINTS FOR EACH ORDINARY KLINGON YOU KILL,
X     (2)   50 POINTS FOR EACH COMMANDER YOU KILL,
X     (3)  200 POINTS FOR KILLING THE "SUPER-COMMANDER",
X     (4)   20 POINTS FOR EACH ROMULAN KILLED,
X     (5)    1 POINT FOR EACH ROMULAN CAPTURED.
X     (6)  500 TIMES YOUR AVERAGE KLINGON/STARDATE KILL RATE.  IF YOU
X               LOSE THE GAME, YOUR KILL RATE IS BASED ON A MINIMUM OF
X               5 STARDATES.
X     (7)  YOU GET A BONUS IF YOU WIN THE GAME, BASED ON YOUR RATING:
X               NOVICE=100, FAIR=200, GOOD=300, EXPERT=400, EMERITUS=500.
X
X YOU LOSE--
X
X     (8)  200 POINTS IF YOU GET YOURSELF KILLED,
X     (9)  100 POINTS FOR EACH STARBASE YOU DESTROY,
X    (10)  100 POINTS FOR EACH STARSHIP YOU LOSE,
X    (11)   45 POINTS FOR EACH TIME YOU HAD TO CALL FOR HELP,
X    (12)   10 POINTS FOR EACH PLANET YOU DESTROYED,
X    (13)    5 POINTS FOR EACH STAR YOU DESTROYED, AND
X    (14)    1 POINT FOR EACH CASUALTY YOU INCURRED.
X
X     IN ADDITION TO YOUR SCORE, YOU MAY ALSO BE PROMOTED ONE GRADE
X IN RANK IF YOU PLAY WELL ENOUGH.  PROMOTION IS BASED PRIMARILY ON
X YOUR KLINGON/STARDATE KILL RATE, SINCE THIS IS THE BEST INDICATOR
X OF WHETHER YOU ARE READY TO GO ON TO THE NEXT HIGHER RATING.
X HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE LOST 100 OR MORE POINTS IN PENALTIES, YOU
X WILL NOT RECEIVE A PROMOTION.
X
X     YOU CAN BE PROMOTED FROM ANY LEVEL.  THERE IS A SPECIAL PROMOTION
X AVAILABLE IF YOU GO BEYOND THE "EXPERT" RANGE.  YOU CAN ALSO HAVE
