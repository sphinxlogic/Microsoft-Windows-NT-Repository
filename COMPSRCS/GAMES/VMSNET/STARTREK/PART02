X
X     SUPERNOVAS MAY HAPPEN SPONTANEOUSLY, WITHOUT PROVOCATION.  IF
X A SUPERNOVA OCCURS IN THE SAME QUADRANT YOU ARE IN, YOUR STARSHIP
X HAS AN "EMERGENCY AUTOMATIC OVERRIDE" WHICH PICKS SOME RANDOM
X DIRECTION AND SOME RANDOM WARP FACTOR, AND TRIES TO THROW YOU
X CLEAR OF THE SUPERNOVA.  IF THE SUPERNOVA OCCURS IN SOME OTHER
X QUADRANT, YOU JUST GET A WARNING MESSAGE FROM STARFLEET ABOUT IT
X (PROVIDED, OF COURSE, THAT YOUR SUBSPACE RADIO IS WORKING).
X
X     ALSO A FEW PLANETS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE GALAXY.  THESE
X CAN SOMETIMES BE A GREAT HELP SINCE SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE
X "DILITHIUM CRYSTALS", WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF REPLENISHING THE
X SHIP'S ENERGY SUPPLY.  YOU CAN EITHER BEAM DOWN TO THE PLANET
X SURFACE USING THE TRANSPORTER, OR TAKE THE SHUTTLE CRAFT "GALILEO".`0D

X                                                                        3
X     STAR TREK IS A RICH GAME, FULL OF DETAIL.  THESE INSTRUCTIONS
X ARE WRITTEN AT A MODERATE LEVEL--NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE FULLY
X TO DESCRIBE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME, BUT THERE IS QUITE A BIT
X MORE HERE THAN YOU NEED TO GET STARTED.  IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE
X GAME, JUST GET A ROUGH IDEA OF THE KINDS OF COMMANDS AVAILABLE,
X AND START PLAYING.  AFTER A GAME OR TWO YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED
X EVERYTHING IMPORTANT, AND THE DETAILED COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS WHICH
X FOLLOW WILL BE A LOT MORE MEANINGFUL TO YOU.
X
X     YOU HAVE WEAPONS:  PHASERS AND PHOTON TORPEDOES.  YOU HAVE
X A DEFENSE:  DEFLECTOR SHIELDS.  YOU CAN LOOK AT THINGS:  LONG-
X RANGE SCANNERS, SHORT-RANGE SCANNERS, AND A STAR CHART.  YOU CAN
X MOVE ABOUT, UNDER WARP DRIVE OR IMPULSE POWER.  YOU CAN ALSO
X DOCK AT A STARBASE, REST WHILE REPAIRS ARE BEING MADE, ABANDON
X SHIP, SELF DESTRUCT, OR GIVE UP AND START A NEW GAME.
X
X     THE KLINGONS ARE WAITING.`0D
X`0C
X                                                                        4
X
X          ----------HOW TO ISSUE COMMANDS----------
X
X
X     WHEN THE GAME IS WAITING FOR YOU TO ENTER A COMMAND, IT WILL
X PRINT OUT
X          COMMAND:
X YOU MAY THEN TYPE IN YOUR COMMAND.  ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER FOR
X EACH COMMAND IS THE MNEMONIC.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO MOVE
X STRAIGHT UP FOR ONE QUADRANT, YOU CAN TYPE IN THE MNEMONIC
X          MOVE
X AND THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU WITH
X          MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC?
X SAY YOU TYPE IN "MANUAL".  THE COMPUTER THEN RESPONDS
X          X AND Y DISPLACEMENTS:
X NOW YOU TYPE IN 0 1 WHICH SPECIFIES AN X MOVEMENT OF ZERO AND
X A Y MOVEMENT OF 1.
X
X     WHEN YOU HAVE LEARNED THE COMMANDS, YOU CAN AVOID BEING
X PROMPTED BY SIMPLY TYPING IN THE INFORMATION WITHOUT WAITING
X TO BE ASKED FOR IT.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, YOU
X COULD SIMPLY TYPE IN
X          MOVE MANUAL 0 1
X AND IT WILL BE DONE.  OR YOU COULD TYPE IN
X          MOVE MANUAL
X AND WHEN THE COMPUTER RESPONDS WITH
X          X AND Y DISPLACEMENTS:
X YOU CAN TYPE IN
X          0 1
X AND IT WILL UNDERSTAND.
X
X     YOU CAN ABBREVIATE MOST MNEMONICS.  FOR "MOVE", YOU CAN USE
X ANY OF
X          MOVE     MOV     MO     M
X SUCCESSFULLY.  FOR YOUR SAFETY, CERTAIN CRITICAL COMMANDS (SUCH
X AS TO ABANDON SHIP) MUST BE WRITTEN OUT IN FULL.  ALSO, IN A
X FEW CASES TWO OR MORE COMMANDS BEGIN WITH THE SAME LETTER, AND
X IN THIS CASE THAT LETTER REFERS TO A PARTICULAR ONE OF THE
X COMMANDS; TO GET THE OTHER, YOUR ABBREVIATION MUST BE TWO OR
X MORE LETTERS LONG.  THIS SOUNDS COMPLICATED, BUT YOU WILL LEARN
X THE ABBREVIATIONS QUICKLY ENOUGH.
X
X     WHAT THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO IS:
X          (1)  YOU CAN ABBREVIATE PRACTICALLY ANYTHING,
X          (2)  IF YOU FORGET, THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU,
X          (3)  IF YOU REMEMBER, YOU CAN TYPE IT ALL ON ONE LINE.
X
X     IF YOU ARE PART WAY THROUGH ENTERING A COMMAND AND YOU CHANGE
X YOUR MIND, YOU CAN CANCEL THE COMMAND BY TYPING A -1 AS ONE OF THE
X PARAMETERS.
X
X     IF ANYTHING IS NOT CLEAR TO YOU, EXPERIMENT.  THE WORST YOU CAN
X DO IS LOSE A GAME OR TWO.`0D

X                                                                        5

X
X     THE SHORT-RANGE SCAN GIVES YOU A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
X INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUADRANT YOUR STARSHIP IS IN.  A SHORT-
X RANGE SCAN IS BEST DESCRIBED BY AN EXAMPLE.

X
X     THE LEFT PART IS A PICTURE OF THE QUADRANT.  THE E AT SECTOR
X 2 - 4 REPRESENTS THE ENTERPRISE; THE B AT SECTOR 3 - 8 IS A STARBASE.
X THERE ARE ORDINARY KLINGONS (K) AT SECTORS 5 - 8 AND 6 - 2, AND A
X KLINGON COMMANDER (C) AT 9 - 9.  THE (GULP) "SUPER-COMMANDER" (S)
X OCCUPIES SECTOR 4 - 4, AND A ROMULAN (R) IS AT 1 - 6.  A PLANET (P)
X IS AT SECTOR 7 - 6.  THERE ARE ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF STARS (*).
X THE PERIODS (.) ARE JUST EMPTY SPACE--THEY ARE PRINTED TO HELP
X YOU GET YOUR BEARINGS.  SECTOR 6 - 4 CONTAINS A BLACK HOLE (@).
X
X     THE INFORMATION ON THE RIGHT IS ASSORTED STATUS INFORMATION.
X THE STATUS INFORMATION WILL BE ABSENT IF YOU TYPE <NO> AFTER
X SRSCAN.  OTHERWISE, STATUS INFORMATION WILL BE PRESENTED.
X
X     SHORT-RANGE SCANS ARE FREE.  THAT IS, THEY USE UP NO ENERGY
X AND NO TIME.  IF YOU ARE IN BATTLE, DOING A SHORT-RANGE SCAN DOES
X NOT GIVE THE ENEMIES ANOTHER CHANCE TO HIT YOU.  YOU CAN SAFELY
X DO A SHORT-RANGE SCAN ANYTIME YOU LIKE.
X
X     STARBASES ALSO HAVE SHORT RANGE SENSORS.  IF YOU ARE DOCKED
X AT A STARBASE AND YOUR SHORT RANGE SENSORS ARE DAMAGED, YOU
X MAY USE THE ONES AT THE STARBASE BY USING THE <SRSCAN> COMMAND.

X *****************
X * STATUS REPORT *
X *****************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  STATUS
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  ST
X
X     THIS COMMAND GIVES YOU INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF
X YOUR STARSHIP, AS FOLLOWS:
X
X     STARDATE - THE CURRENT DATE.  A STARDATE IS THE SAME AS A DAY.
X
X     CONDITION - THERE ARE FOUR POSSIBLE CONDITIONS:
X          DOCKED - DOCKED AT STARBASE.
X          RED    - IN BATTLE.
X          YELLOW - LOW ON ENERGY ( < 1000 UNITS).
X          GREEN  - NONE OF THE ABOVE.
X
X     POSITION - QUADRANT IS GIVEN FIRST, THEN SECTOR.
X
X     LIFE SUPPORT - IF "ACTIVE", LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS ARE
X          FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.  IF ON "RESERVES", THE NUMBER
X          IS HOW MANY STARDATES YOUR RESERVE FOOD, AIR, ETC. WILL
X          LAST--YOU MUST GET REPAIRS MADE OR GET TO STARBASE
X          BEFORE YOUR RESERVES RUN OUT.
X
X     WARP FACTOR - WHAT YOUR WARP FACTOR IS CURRENTLY SET TO.
X
X     ENERGY - THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY YOU HAVE LEFT.  IF IT DROPS TO
X          ZERO, YOU DIE.
X
X     TORPEDOES - HOW MANY PHOTON TORPEDOES YOU HAVE LEFT.
X
X     SHIELDS - WHETHER YOUR SHIELDS ARE UP OR DOWN, HOW STRONG
X          THEY ARE (WHAT PERCENT OF A HIT THEY CAN DEFLECT), AND
X          SHIELD ENERGY.
X
X     KLINGONS LEFT - HOW MANY OF THE KLINGONS ARE STILL OUT THERE.
X
X     TIME LEFT - HOW LONG THE FEDERATION CAN HOLD OUT AGAINST THE
X          PRESENT NUMBER OF KLINGONS; THAT IS, HOW LONG UNTIL THE
X          END IF YOU DO NOTHING IN THE MEANTIME.  IF YOU KILL KLINGONS
X          QUICKLY, THIS NUMBER WILL GO UP--IF NOT, IT WILL GO DOWN.
X          IF IT REACHES ZERO, THE FEDERATION IS CONQUERED, AND YOU
X          LOSE.
X
X     STATUS INFORMATION IS FREE--IT USES NO TIME OR ENERGY, AND IF
X YOU ARE IN BATTLE, THE KLINGONS ARE NOT GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE TO HIT
X YOU.
X
X     STATUS INFORMATION CAN ALSO BE OBTAINED BY DOING A SHORT-RANGE
X SCAN.  SEE THE <SRSCAN> COMMAND FOR DETAILS.
X
X     EACH ITEM OF INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED SINGLY BY REQUESTING
X IT.  SEE <REQUEST> COMMAND FOR DETAILS.

X * LONG-RANGE SCAN *
X *******************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  LRSCAN
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  L
X
X     A LONG-RANGE SCAN GIVES YOU GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE YOU
X ARE AND WHAT IS AROUND YOU.  HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OUTPUT.
X
X          L. R. SCAN FOR QUADRANT 5 - 1
X             -1  107  103
X             -1  316    5
X             -1  105 1000
X
X THIS SCAN SAYS THAT YOU ARE IN ROW 5, COLUMN 1 OF THE 8 BY 8
X GALAXY.  THE NUMBERS IN THE SCAN INDICATE HOW MANY OF EACH
X KIND OF THING THERE IS IN YOUR QUADRANT AND ALL ADJACENT
X QUADRANTS.  THE DIGITS ARE INTERPRETED AS FOLLOWS.
X
X     THOUSANDS DIGIT:  1000 INDICATES A SUPERNOVA (ONLY)
X     HUNDREDS DIGIT:   NUMBER OF KLINGONS PRESENT
X     TENS DIGIT:       NUMBER OF STARBASES PRESENT
X     ONES DIGIT:       NUMBER OF STARS PRESENT
X
X FOR EXAMPLE, IN YOUR QUADRANT (5 - 1) THE NUMBER IS 316, WHICH
X INDICATES 3 KLINGONS, 1 STARBASE AND 6 STARS.  (THE LONG-RANGE
X SCANNER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ORDINARY KLINGONS AND
X KLINGON COMMAND SHIPS.)  IF THERE IS A SUPERNOVA, AS IN THE
X QUADRANT BELOW AND TO YOUR RIGHT (QUADRANT 6 - 2), THERE IS
X NOTHING ELSE IN THE QUADRANT.
X
X     ROMULANS POSSESS A "CLOAKING DEVICE" WHICH PREVENTS THEIR
X DETECTION BY LONG-RANGE SCAN.  BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, STARFLEET
X COMMAND IS NEVER SURE HOW MANY ROMULANS ARE "OUT THERE".
X WHEN YOU KILL THE LAST KLINGON, THE REMAINING ROMULANS SURRENDER
X TO THE FEDERATION.
X
X     PLANETS ARE ALSO UNDETECTABLE BY LONG-RANGE SCAN.  THE
X ONLY WAY TO DETECT A PLANET IS TO FIND IT IN YOUR CURRENT
X QUADRANT WITH SHORT-RANGE SENSORS.
X
X     SINCE YOU ARE IN COLUMN 1, THERE ARE NO QUADRANTS TO YOUR
X LEFT.  THE MINUS ONES INDICATE THE NEGATIVE ENERGY BARRIER AT
X THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY, WHICH YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CROSS.
X
X     LONG-RANGE SCANS ARE FREE.  THEY USE UP NO ENERGY OR TIME,
X AND CAN BE DONE SAFELY REGARDLESS OF BATTLE CONDITIONS.
X
X     STARBASES ALSO HAVE L.R. SENSORS.  IF YOU ARE DOCKED AND YOUR
X LONG-RANGE SENSORS ARE DAMAGED, YOU MAY USE THE ONES AT STARBASE
X BY USING THE <LRSCAN> COMMAND.

X                                                                        8
X **************
X * STAR CHART *
X **************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  CHART
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  C
X
X     AS YOU PROCEED IN THE GAME, YOU LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT
X WHAT THINGS ARE WHERE IN THE GALAXY.  THIS INFORMATION IS
X AUTOMATICALLY RECORDED FOR YOU (BY SPOCK) IN YOUR STAR CHART.
X
X     THE CHART LOOKS LIKE AN 8 BY 8 ARRAY OF NUMBERS.  THESE
X NUMBERS ARE INTERPRETED EXACTLY AS THEY ARE ON A LONG-RANGE
X SCAN.  A PERIOD (.) IN PLACE OF A DIGIT MEANS YOU DO NOT KNOW
X THAT INFORMATION YET.  FOR EXAMPLE, ... MEANS YOU KNOW NOTHING
X ABOUT THE QUADRANT, WHILE .1. MEANS YOU KNOW THAT IT CONTAINS
X A BASE, BUT AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF KLINGONS AND STARS.
X
X     LOOKING AT THE STAR CHART IS A FREE OPERATION.  IT COSTS
X YOU NEITHER TIME NOR ENERGY, AND CAN BE DONE SAFELY WHETHER
X IN OR OUT OF BATTLE.
X
X
X *****************
X * DAMAGE REPORT *
X *****************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  DAMAGES
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  DA
X
X     AT ANY TIME YOU MAY ASK FOR A DAMAGE REPORT TO FIND OUT WHAT
X DEVICES ARE DAMAGED AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO REPAIR THEM.
X NATURALLY, REPAIRS PROCEED FASTER AT A STARBASE.
X
X     IF YOU SUFFER DAMAGES WHILE MOVING, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A
X SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE REPORT WILL NOT SHOW ANY DAMAGE.  THIS HAPPENS
X IF THE TIME SPENT ON THE MOVE EXCEEDS THE REPAIR TIME, SINCE IN
X THIS CASE THE DAMAGED DEVICES WERE FIXED EN ROUTE.
X
X     DAMAGE REPORTS ARE FREE.  THEY USE NO ENERGY OR TIME, AND CAN
X BE DONE SAFELY EVEN IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE.

X *************************
X * MOVE UNDER WARP DRIVE *
X *************************
X
X     MNEMONIC:  MOVE
X     SHORTEST ABBREVIATION:  M
X     FULL COMMAND:  MOVE <MANUAL> <DISPLACEMENT>
X                    MOVE <AUTOMATIC> <DESTINATION>
X
X     THIS COMMAND IS THE USUAL WAY TO MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO
X ANOTHER WITHIN THE GALAXY.  YOU MOVE UNDER WARP DRIVE, ACCORDING
X TO THE CURRENT WARP FACTOR (SEE "WARP FACTOR").
X`0C
X                                                                        9
X     THERE ARE TWO COMMAND MODES FOR MOVEMENT; MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC.
X THE MANUAL MODE IS DEFAULT, AND REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
X
X          MOVE <MANUAL> <DELTX> <DELTY>
X
X <MANUAL> IS OPTIONAL.  IF OMITTED, MANUAL MOVEMENT IS ASSUMED.
X <DELTX> AND <DELTY> ARE THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DISPLACEMENTS FOR
X YOUR STARSHIP, IN QUADRANTS; A DISPLACEMENT OF ONE SECTOR IS 0.1
X QUADRANTS.  SPECIFYING <DELTX> AND <DELTY> CAUSES YOUR SHIP TO MOVE
X IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE SPECIFIED DESTINATION.  FOR EXAMPLE,
X THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE COMMAND TO MOVE 1 SECTOR TO THE RIGHT WOULD BE
X
X          M .1 0
X
X     THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES OF MANUAL MOVEMENT REFER TO THE
X SHORT-RANGE SCAN ON PAGE 5.
X
X     DESTINATION SECTOR      MANUAL MOVEMENT COMMAND

X           1 - 2                    M -.2 .1
X           1 - 4                    M 0 .1
X     (LEAVING QUADRANT)             M 0 .2
X           1 - 5                    M .1 .1
X           2 - 10                   M .6 0
X           5 - 6                    M .2 -.3
X           3 - 4                    M 0 -.1
X
X     THE AUTOMATIC MODE IS AS FOLLOWS:
X
X          MOVE <AUTOMATIC> <QROW> <QCOL> <SROW> <SCOL>
X
X WHERE <QROW> AND <QCOL> ARE THE ROW AND COLUMN NUMBERS OF THE
X DESTINATION QUADRANT, AND <SROW> AND <SCOL> ARE THE ROW AND
X COLUMN NUMBERS OF THE DESTINATION SECTOR WITHIN THAT QUADRANT.
X THIS COMMAND ALSO MOVES YOUR SHIP IN A STRAIGHT LINE PATH TO
X THE DESTINATION.  <AUTOMATIC> (A IS SUFFICIENT) MUST BE PRESENT.
X FOR MOVING WITHIN A QUADRANT, <QROW> AND <QCOL> MAY BE OMITTED.
X FOR EXAMPLE, TO MOVE TO SECTOR 2 - 9 WITHIN THE CURRENT QUADRANT,
X THE SHORTEST COMMAND WOULD BE
X
X          M A 2 9
X
X TO MOVE TO QUADRANT 3 - 7, SECTOR 5 - 8, TYPE
