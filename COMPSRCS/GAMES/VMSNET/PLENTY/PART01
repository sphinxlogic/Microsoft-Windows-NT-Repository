Hello!
	This is a short little game that I wrote several years ago, patterned
upon an ancient game in Beagle Bros' Magic Pack on their Game Disk.  It is
a version of "20 questions", where the computer asks the questions, and
then gives an answer.  It's written in uncommented Fortran, and uses the
Vax SMG package to do some of the screen and keyboard manipulation.  It needs
a VT-100 compatible terminal to work at present, but with proper use of SMG
it could probably be modified to work with any SMG-supported terminal.
	Of course, looking at the possible answers in the list below, something
suspicious must be going on if this program is to do anything interesting.
Note that if you type Control-A at the prompt "Press any key to continue..."
then the logical flag CHEAT is set to .TRUE.  When this flag is set, the
first key typed in response to the questions the comptuer asks is not displayed,
but is instead stored.  When the computer gets to the twentieth question
(or a period is typed as the "unprinted response"), it will then make its
guess, displaying the stored keystrokes instead of an answer from the list
below.  (The list below is used to display a dummy answer if control-A
wasn't typed.)
	Not much of a game, but good for amazing your friends a few times.
(As long as you are sitting at the keyboard, that is.)

c Plenty Questions, patterned after Beagle Bros' Magic Pack.
c Feel free to modify and improve this game as you wish, and maybe
c even send me your improved versions!  Certainly the question list can
c be improved (the "no" to "yes" ratio of answers is way to high).
c Also, the control sequences are currently VT-100 dependent, a better
c written program would use SMG to do all the screen manipulation.
c Note: if the game doesn't seem to be working, look closely at the use
c of the logical variable CHEAT.
c Original concept: Beagle Bros., early 80's, on Apple II Game Disk.
c This version: Tim Shoppa (shoppa@erin.caltech.edu), 1987 or so.
