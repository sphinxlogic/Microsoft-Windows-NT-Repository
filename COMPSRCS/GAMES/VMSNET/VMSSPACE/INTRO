Hi Friends

After about 3 months of coding work, I'm more or less proud to release this
little game. The Game SPACE EMPIRE nearly exists on every computer
system, now including Vms. So I think it's not nessesary to explain the aim
of the game. (There's a GAME-DESCRIPTION-FILE anyway-SPCEMP.DOC)
The sourcecode so far includes some parts which are not in use yet.
(ALLIANCE for example)
Anyway, I decided to left the whole thing complete, there might be another
crazy coder like me, who wants to continue the work.

By the way, I stopped coding, coz I sold all my computers. 
Yep that was a hard decission, but those computers 
were total TIME-SPENDIG-DEVICES. 
I will be still availble via EMAIL for any questions and so on.

One more thing, if you try to read the code, don't panic. We know that 
the code is a little bit spagetthi-style.
greetings

Roger
