I. Introduction

        The  object  of Space Empire is simple.  You are the absolute ruler
of  a  set  of worlds.  Your goal is to be the most powerful empire through
diplomacy,  economic  ploys,  and most of all, war.  The first person to be
"Space  Lord"  for  seven  days  in a row ascends the uridium throne of the
galaxy  and  becomes Lord of the Universe.  To be Space Lord, you must have
at least 150,000 points and be the highest scorer if there is more than one
empire with 150,000 points.




II. Running Your Empire

	At  the  beginning  of  each turn, you collect money in the form of
taxes from your people and ore mined from planets.  You also get a stock of
food  from agricultural worlds and a flow of weaponry from defense planets.
Additionally  there are some other kinds of planets, you can earn most with
tourism planets, but you can only buy a limited amount.  Otherwise you will
earn nothing at all.  You can buy aprox.  1 tourism planet for 100 mil.  of
our  population.   Moreover  the  people  dont  like  to travel if they are
unhappy.   If  you want to trade you could buy trade planets they wont give
you  much more money than mine-planets, but you can increase that amount if
you  buy  freighters  and pilots.  Your governing planets, which are purely
administrative worlds, don't do you any good and just sap your funds -- but
you need one of them for every 25 other planets.

	After  collecting  this money, you are allowed to budget your money
as you see fit.  Certain amounts will be requested which you are advised to
stay  close to.  Your people will also require food -- make sure you either
buy  enough  food  each round or have enough agricultural worlds to support
your  people!   Additionally  you  will  be asked to spend money for health
research,  and  technology  research.   Remember  healthy  people are happy
people!

	Soon,  you'll be able to buy extra things, including more weaponry,
planets,  etc.   Spend  wisely.  Don't use up all your money, or buy things
which  could  sap  all  your  money  away  in  the future.  The higher your
technology level is, the more weapons you can chose to buy and the stronger
your  defense  are.   The money suggested to spend for those points are the
minimum  amounts  to  keep the level.  Spend more to increase the level and
less to decrease, but who wants that ?

	You must keep your populace happy!  Abusing them by not giving them
enough  food  and  not allocating enough money to your planets will stir up
unrest.   There  are  many  factors which modify how happy your people are.
Make sure you learn these and keep them that way.  Internal unrest is worse
than the most powerful of enemy armies!


HINTS:   People  by  nature  are  happier when they are well fed.  The food
levels  suggested  by  the  program are the MINIMUM levels required to keep
them  at  their present status.  Same with money needed for the planets the
suggested amount is the minimum required to maintain the Status QUO.

To  build  planets and defenses effectively during your first rounds in the
game.   Start off by buying NOTHING BUT ORE PLANETS for the first ten turns
on  turn  one  you  should  buy all ore planets except for about 2 or three
agricultural  planets  always  keep the agricultural planets producing more
than  the minimum required of food.  Planet costs start to esculate rapidly
but  ore planets are the best investment.  Each planet requires 10K credits
to maintain and each governing planet requires 20K credits each.  Since ORE
planets  produce 21K credits of income you profit 10K credits for every ORE
planet you have.  KEEP the levels of governing planets up to the minimum of
1 gov planet for every 25 plus fraction thereof of the other planets.  Lack
government representation is extremely bad for your people.

After  round ten or fifteen start buying Defense Planets but make sure that
for every defense or agricultural planet you buy you alway buy at least one
ore  planet  to  support  it.   (Two  ore  planet  to support the governing
planets.)




III. Battle

	Battle  is  an  integral part of the game -- this is how you weaken
your  enemies and sieze planets from them.  The victor in battle depends on
many factors.

	Each unit of battle force works a little differently.  Soldiers are
the  base  unit  of  your  military  --  they have the weakest firepower in
battle,  but  you need them to back up all your other forces.  If you don't
back up your other weaponry with troops of soldiers, you are surely doomed.
Fighter  craft  (X-wings)  are offense only weapons, and are about twice as
effective  as  soldiers  when  attacking.   The cost a little more, and for
every 100 fighters you have, you need a carrier to transport them.  Defense
stations  cost  about  the  same  as fighters, and are defense only and the
power  increases  when your techlevel goes up.  Cruisers are both offensive
and  defensive,  have  more  firepower than either X-wings or soilders, but
cost  about  twice  as much.  The Y-wing fighters don't need carriers to be
transported  to  the battlefield.  Moreover they're slightly more powerfull
than X-wings but less then cruisers.  They are offensive and defensive they
are also quite cheap.  But you can't get them if your technolgy level is to
low. The Y-wings do not have the power to destroy enemies defense stations,
the only weapon against them are the X-Wings.

	If  your  technology level is very high you will get the possibilty
to  buy  Imperial  Starfighters, they are about twice as strong as Y-Wings.
(Pay attention the Starfighters need 100 soldiers each to operate).  In the
future you might even get Death Stars, who knows....

	The  morale  of  your  military is a very important factor.  If you
continuously lose battles, their morale will go down.  It will go up if you
win  battles  and allocate them extra money.  It is also changed by various
other  factors.   For  instance,  domestic  unrest tends to demoralize your
army.   Be  sure that you never attack an enemy with less then 50 soldiers,
otherwise you will surly loose the battle and so the army get demoralised.

	There  is always an element of chance.  A lesser enemy always has a
slight chance of winning a battle if the two battle forces are close enough
in size.

	If  the attacking battle force emerges the victor, he will gain 10%
of  his  enemy's  planets (rounded up).  His enemy will be wiped out of the
game  if  you  take  all of his planets.  This is one of the greatest moral
boosters  your  army  can  get.  Moreover you will get 10 % of the enemie's
bank account.

	New  players  are  protected from being attacked for a period of 20
turns,  unless  they  attack  someone else first (note 20 turns ends at the
beginning of turn 21.) If you fail to logon to the game for 7 days you will
lose  your protection and made open game for the rest of the players.  This
is  done  to  benefit  those who are actively playing the game and to clear
room for other players to join the game.

HINTS:   The  best  way  to attack is to spy on the player you are about to
attack  if  they  are not part of an alliance send slightly more of troops,
fighters  (against defense stations), and heavy cruisers than your opponent
has.   If  he  has  an  alliance send your best guess or what you think his
allaince  has  to support in addition to the normal required forces.  Note:
Alliances are not yet included in the VMS Version.




IV.  Missile Attacks

	Additionaly  to  the  battle  option you can fight your enemys with
different  types  of heavy missiles.  They are more powerfull than a normal
battle  attack.   They are 4 missile types all of them will cause one major
problem  to  your  enemy.

1) Anti-Matter    - these are the cheapest missiles availble and they 
                    destroy exactly one governing planet. (attention 
                    there's a second type quite like this one and that one 
                    destroys 50% of that type of plantes)
2) Thermo-Nuclear - these will cause severe health problems to the enemys 
                    population. Moreover your enemy will lose 
                    aprox. 30 % of his citizen
3) Chemical       - If this missile hits your enemy he will lose all 
                    agricultural planets and all food in stock. Moreover
                    his harmony will decrease.
4) Conventional   - very dangerous weapon, if you succed your enemy will 
                    lose half of his army. 
                    ( Therefore it's the most expansive )

	But  what  can  you do against a missile attack ?  The more defense
planets you own the higher the chance to reject a missile attack.  Moreover
you could buy missile-defense stations to get saver.




V.    Spies and Pirats

	Spying can be very useful during the game. If you want to attack someone
but you dont know how strong his army is, you could use this option.
The possibilities so far:

1) Covert Mission: Spy on Military and/or Government
2) Covert Mission: Spy on the Army strength         
3) Pirating: Steal enemy's Y-Wing starfighters      
4) Pirating: Steal enemy's Mk-Freighters            
5) Pirating: Attack enemy's TradePlanets    		[NOT YET INCLUDED}        
6) Show own Army strength (offense and defense)     
7) Secret Public Poll under your people             

2-5] You have to send more spy-power than your enemy owns, to succed !
3/4] To steal one ship you have to send 2 soldiers and one Y-Wing Fighter.
     Reason: A Y-Wing can transport only 2 people and you need the flight 
             the stolen ship back to your region.
     By the way if you just press return or enter 0, the max. availble
     amount of soldiers or fighters will be sent to the mission.

Good luck, 007 !! :-)




VI.   Trading / Bank-Stage / Lottery

	Trading is one more chance to earn more money.
In the Bank you can put money on your account or withdraw it. You will earn
intrest. Moreover you can send money to another player.
In the lottery you can win money what else.




VII.  Hints and Tips

1) Be sure you spend enough money in research. 1 or 2 credits more than
   suggested by the computer is never enough. Try to spend twice or 3 times 
   the amount asked.
2) A higher Techlevel will increase your defense stations power up 
   to 4 times! (That's twice as strong as the stronges offensive weapon !)
3) Bank accounts are usefull to save money espacialy to protect it against
   pirate attacks. But on the other hand you could loose it when you get 
   attack by an enemy.
4) Never give 0 credits when asked some money ! This would be a fatal mistake
   and maybe your last one.
5) It's worth trying to trade.
