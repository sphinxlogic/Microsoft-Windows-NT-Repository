X      19what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.`20
X      20Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
X      21You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
X      21like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessa

X      21resources right now.
X      22Do you really want to quit now?`20
X      23You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
X      24You are already carrying it!
X      25You can't be serious!`20
X      26The mongoose was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it
X      26becomes disturbed and you cannot catch it.
X      27You can catch the mongoose, but you cannot carry it.
X      28There is nothing here with a lock!
X      29You aren't carrying it!`20
X      30The mongoose attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry`20
X      30drives the snake away.
X      31You have no keys!`20
X      32It has no lock.`20
X      33I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
X      34It was already locked.
X      35The grate is now locked.
X      36The grate is now unlocked.
X      37It was already unlocked.
X      38You have no source of light.
X      39Your lamp is now on.
X      40Your lamp is now off.`20
X      41There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
X      41probably just as well.
X      42Nothing happens.
X      43  The runes are in elvish of an ancient mode, and read:  "Ennyn`20
X      43Durin Aran Moria:  Pedo mellon a minno.  Im Narvi hain echant: `20
X      43Celebrimboro Eregion teithanti thiw hin."  Being a scholar of`20
X      43classical languages, including ancient Elvish, I can translate
X      43them, and they read as follows:  "The doors of Durin, Lord of`20
X      43Moria.  Speak, friend, and enter.  I, Narvi, made them.`20
X      43Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs."
X      44There is nothing here to attack.
X      45The mongoose is now dead.  Its body disappears.`20
X      46Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
X      47You killed a little dwarf.
X      48You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
X      49With what?  your bare hands?
X      50Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.`20
X      51I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary`20
X      51describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words`
V20
X      51like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,`
V20
X      51up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
X      51hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of`
V20
X      51the action words that i know.  Usually you will need to give both th
Ve`20
X      51object and action words (in either order), but sometimes i can infer
X      51the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
X      51particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
X      51give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side`20
X      51effects; for instance, the rod scares the mongoose.  Usually people`
V20
X      51having trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Those peop
Vle
X      51trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting somethi
Vng
X      51beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
X      51different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
X      51distances with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets`
V20
X      51you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in t
Vhe
X      51forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving
V a`20
X      51room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the sout
Vh.
X      51good luck!
X      52It misses!
X      53It gets you!
X      54Ok
X      55You can't unlock the keys.
X      56You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in th
Ve`20
X      56main passage.`20
X      57I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on`
V20
X      57the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
X      58I need more detailed instructions to do that.`20
X      59I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate`20
X      59things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.`20
X      60A quick little mongoose has run into the room.
X      61A quick little mongoose has run out of the room.
X      62Are you trying to get into the cave?
X      63The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
X      63enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommen
Vd`20
X      63looking elsewhere for the keys.`20
X      64The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an`20
X      64occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-`
V20
X      64growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of`20
X      64various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by`
V20
X      64all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the`20
X      64spruce and berry bushes.
X      65Welcome to adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
X      66Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
X      66progress is unlikely.`20
X      67Blasting requires dynamite.`20
X      68I'm as confused as you are.`20
X      69Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in`20
X      69caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a dee
Vp`20
X      69pit leading down to water.
X      70You are now soaking wet!
X      71I think i just lost my appetite.
X      72Thank you, it was delicious!
X      73You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly o
Vf`20
X      73minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.`20
X      74The bottle of water is now empty.`20
X      75Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,`20
X      75Nothing exciting happens.`20
X      76Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
X      77Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.`20
X      78You can't pour that.
X      79Pervert!
X      80Which way?
X      81Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able t
Vo`20
X      81help you out, but i've never really done this before.  Do you want m

X      81to try to reincarnate you?
X      82All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......`20
X      82       0       0    --- poof!! ---
X      82You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,`
V20
X      82you emerge from the smoke and find....
X      83You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long i can
X      83keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?`20
X      84Okay, now where did i put my orange smoke?....
X      84Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.`20
X      85Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expe
Vct
X      85me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?`20
X      86Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!`20
X      91Sorry, but i no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
X      92You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
X      93You can't go through a locked steel grate!
X      94I believe what you want is right here with you.`20
X      95You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
X      96I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.`
V20
X      97There is no way across the fissure from here.`20
X      98You're not carrying anything.`20
X      99You are currently holding the following: `20
X     100It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
X     100have no mongoose seed.
X     101The snake has now devoured your mongoose.`20
X     102There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
X     103You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *really* mad!!
X     104You have nothing in which to carry it.
X     105Your bottle is already full.
X     106There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
X     107Your bottle is now full of water.`20
X     108Your bottle is now full of oil.`20
X     109You can't fill that.
X     110Don't be ridiculous!
X     111The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
X     112The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "Water
V?"
X     113The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.`20
X     114The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,`20
X     114although it requires some effort.`20
X     115The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.`20
X     116The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
X     117Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
X     117You'd best take inventory and drop something.`20
X     118You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
X     119You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
X     120I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.
X     121I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.
X     122You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.`20
X     123You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.`20
X     124A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,`
V20
X     124this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifyin
Vg`20
X     124bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
X     125The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
X     125promptly snaps shut again.
X     126You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way`20
X     126blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.`
V20
X     127There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.`20
X     128Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har
V,"
X     128he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
X     128chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes int
Vo`20
X     128the gloom.
X     129A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closi
Vng
X     129soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office."`20
X     130A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:`20
X     130   "This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
X     131It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close t
Vo`20
X     131closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
X     132The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echo
Ves
X     132fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
X     132smoke). . . .    as your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
X     133There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
X     133wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
X     133and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
X     133friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.`
V20
X     134There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
X     134wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pour
Vs`20
X     134in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including yo
Vu!
X     135There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the`
V20
X     135walls of the room.
X     136The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now severa
Vl`20
X     136threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
X     136knives at you!  All of them get you!
X     137Oh, leave the poor unhappy mongoose alone.
X     138I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.`20
X     139I don't know the word "STOP".  use "QUIT" if you want to give up.`20
X     140You can't get there from here.
X     141You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
X     142If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".
X     142To suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say`20
X     142"SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE" or "SAVE").  To re-start your game at a later`
V20
X     142time, start up a new adventure and after i say "You are standing..."
V,`20
X     142you must say "RESTORE".  you can't say "RESTORE" at any other`20
X     142time, however.`20
X     142To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a
X     142treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you g
Vet
X     142partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting`20
X     142killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There ar
Ve`20
X     142also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
X     142explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (
Vto
X     142distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are`
V20
X     142other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
X     142harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, ju
Vst
X     142keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
X     142haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
X     142it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner ma
Vny
X     142more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
X     142if you seem to be having trouble.  If i do, i'll warn you in advance
X     142how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
X     142save paper, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat`
V20
X     142the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
X     143Do you indeed wish to quit now?`20
X     144There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
X     145The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.`
V20
X     146It is beyond your power to do that.`20
X     147I don't know how.`20
X     148It is too far up for you to reach.
X     149You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
X     149black smoke.
X     150The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.`20
X     151What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
