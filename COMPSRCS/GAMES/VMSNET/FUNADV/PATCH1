I just downloaded FUNADV, and to my dismay, I saw that I needed a
PASCAL compiler for two files: USER.PAS and SHIFT.PAS

Well,  I don't have a PASCAL compiler, so I thought I'd upload a
replacement for user.pas in FORTRAN.  Also, instead of using the
SHIFT routine, you can easily substitute the FORTRAN JISHFTC function
which does the same thing.  The SHIFT function is called in FUNADV.FOR,
so replace both occurrences as follows:

SHIFT(1,n) becomes JISHFTC(1,n,32) 
SHIFT(1,k) becomes JISHFTC(1,k,32)

Remove all references to SHIFT in the $BUILD.COM file.


I renamed the USER routine to GETUSER; I saw that the COMMON was using
USER and I like to have uniqueness among common blocks and subroutines.
Of course, this requires you to change CALL USER to CALL GETUSER in the
WIZARD.FOR file, as well as changing references in $BUILD.COM from USER
to GETUSER.

The above may sound lengthy, but it'll only take a couple of minutes.
The next file is the actual routine to get the username.

Have fun.
