XThis is a source file distribution for the game FUNADV as implemented
Xin VAX Fortan.  (Well, ok, there are two pascal subroutines, which are
Xthere mainly because they had already been written to support other
Xcode, and I didn't bother to redo them in fortran.  Maybe for the
Xnext version.)  The game is a direct decendant from Adventure, and
Xcontains many of the same places...or anyway, so they might appear.
XThe game should prove refreshing to those who enjoy the traditional
Xadventure.`20
X
XThis game came from Georgia Tech, and does contain a few references
Xthat are based on the Tech computing environment in the late 1970's and
Xearly 1980's.  These include references to the "PSGAMES FORUM" program,
Xwhich was a primative conferencing system.  One notable feature of this
Xprogram was that it held three days worth of messages.  The process of
Xsetting up for the new day was the "Update", which was started by`20
Xbeing the first user to send a message on a new day.  Users would compete
Xfor this "honor";  getting the update, especally when many users were
Xtrying for it, was called "snarfing" the update.
X
X"Pete Bogman" (a handle) was a frequent user of this system who could`20
Xhave easily taught creative grammar and spelling to Biff.  Pete was also
Xnot noted for his domestic skills.  His sister was known as "Sweat Peat".
X
XDwight Rudolph was a systems programmer who was somewhat of a cult figure
Xto the admiring undergraduates.  Besides being a Cyber Wizard in every
Xsense of the word, he possessed a certian "savior faire" and dry wit
Xthat made him a defacto role model for the many system programmer
Xwantabes, of which I was one at the time. `20
X
XAn example of Dwight's comments, from the forum code, follow:
X
X***       THIS CODE WAS WRITTEN FOR USE WITH THE FORUM PROGRAM SUPPORTED
X*         BY THE SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.`20
X*         IT IS NOT COPYRIGHTED, POLYUNSATURATED, OR GUARANTEED IN ANY WAY.`
V20
X*         USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  IF IT DESTROYS YOUR CRITICAL DATA BASE,`
V20
X*         THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM.  THE AUTHOR ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR`20
X*         ITS USE OR MISUSE AND WILL NOT FIX IT AT A LATER TIME TO MEET`20
X*         YOUR NEEDS.  THE DOCUMENTATION IS SKETCHY AND OFTEN MISLEADING.`20
X*         YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  TURN THE PAGE IF YOU DARE.`20
X          EJECT`20
X
XAnyway, Funadv was written by Neal White III, using the source of adventure
Xas a starting point.  While there are many locations in FUNADV that will
Xseem familiar from Adventure, don't bet on it.  There are new paths in
Xnew directions, and things sometimes work the same.  Sometimes not.
XFor example, in Funadv, it is possible to carry enough water to the`20
Xplant without having to go back.
X
XAll files in the distribution are Ascii, except for FUNADV.EXE. which is
Xin Hexify format.  The dehex program source, in Macro, is included.
X `20
XThe data file FUNADV.DAT should be placed in the same directory as`20
XFUNADV.EXE.  No logicals, set def, etc, are required.
X
XThe local maintainer should create a binary database after setting
Xthe program up.  This allows for a somewhat faster startup.  This can
Xbe accomplished by entering "SAVE" to the "Are you a Wizard" question
Xat the beginning of the game.  This requires write access to the`20
Xdirectory where the game is stored.

X       2You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes bac

X       3You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.`20
X       4The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.`
V20
X       4It would be advisable to use the exit.
X       5You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.`20
X       6You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.`20
X       7You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
X       7rocky bed.
X       8At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
X       8in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
X       9You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into th
Ve`20
X       9dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
X       9leads into the depression.  A narrow trail heads south.`20
X      10You are standing at the base of an enormous cliff.  A huge river is`
V20
X      10flowing over the cliff, forming a waterfall.  A rainbow can be seen`
V20
X      10above the mist and spray.  The river continues west, and a forest is
X      10to the north.  A dark hole can be seen in the cliff.
X      11You are on the north side of a wide river.  The river flows from eas
Vt`20
X      11to west.  A depression is to the north.`20
X      12You are at a narrow beach of brilliant white sand.  the river turns`
V20
X      12north into a forest.
X      13You have been pulled into a giant whirlpool --you are spinning--
X      13--spinning--  `0A  --spinning--
X      13You have been sucked under!`20
X      14You are on a wide curving beach.  The sand appears green due to the`
V20
X      14greenish light which is filtering up from the depths of the river.
X      14There is a large roman numeral three chiseled deep into the rock wal
Vl.
X      14Perhaps you have found the lost third enterance to the cave!
X      14There is a dark corridor leading to the east.`20
X      15You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
X      15A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
X      16You are in a very small circular room.
X      17You are in the main power chamber for the entire cave.
X      17There is a passage to the north whose walls are covered with lichen.
X      18You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim ligh
Vt`20
X      18at the east end of the passage.`20
X      19You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surfac
Ve.
X      19A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris`
V20
X      19here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wa

X      19says "Magic Word ZZZZADV".
X      20You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.`20
X      21You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are froze
Vn`20
X      21rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
X      21from east and west sides of the chamber.
X      22At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
X      22passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
X      23The crack is far too small for you to follow.`20
X      24You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
X      24the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone`
V20
X      24staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mi
Vst
X      24swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
X      24staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.`20
X      25You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
X      25The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
X      26You are on the west side of the fissure in the hall of mists.`20
X      27You are in  a very low wide passage parallel to and north of the
X      27 hall of mists.`20
X      28You are at the west end of hall of mists.  A low wide crawl continue

X      28off the floor.
X      29You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side`
V20
X      29chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
X      29round two foot hole slants down.
X      30You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
X      30joins up with a narrow north/south passage.`20
X      31You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.`20
X      33this is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  the note says,`20
X      33"You won't get it up the steps".

X      38You can't get by the snake.`20
X      39You are in the south side chamber.
X      40You are in the west side chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
X      40A passage continues west and up here.`20
X      41You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.  the hole goes`
V20
X      41down to an E/W passage.`20
X      42You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to t
Vhe

V on
X      42a rock in the room's center.
X      43You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
X      44You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out
V of

V of
X      44white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right
V.`20
X      44Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that`20

X      45west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.`20
X      46You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads`
V20
X      46west.`20
X      47You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
X      47enters and exits through tiny slits.
X      48You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
X      48the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
X      49You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from t
Vhe
X      49north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
X      49going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here

Ve`20
X     106farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
X     106thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickeri

X     106formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
X     106light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a de
Vep
X     106gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to

X     106crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through th
Ve`20
X     106gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To`
