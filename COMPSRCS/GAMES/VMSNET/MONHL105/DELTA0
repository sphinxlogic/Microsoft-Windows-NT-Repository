                  MONSTER Helsinki V 1.06
                  -----------------------

    Monster, a multiplayer adventure game where the players create the
    world and make the rules.

    Derived from Rich Skrenta's Monster (from version 1).

    Includes programmable non-player characters (NPC) with own programming
    language - MDL (Monster Defination Language). Also rooms and objects
    can program with it (via so called hooks). NPCs are called to 'monster',
    all other MDL-objects are called to 'hook'.

    In this version have new documentation. So you perhaps want this.
    Look also bug fig of MONSTER/FIX (there was one severe bug).

Environment: VMS V4.x (MONSTER_INSTALL.COM requires V5.x)
             PASCAL 

THIS IS DELTA POSTING AGAIST VERSION 1.05
Delta from version 1.04 to version 1.05 is posted 1.7.1992
Version 1.04 is posted 14.6.1992

New to version 1.05:
- Jorma Korkiakoski translated Finnish ducumentation of MDL to English
  (This includes only MDL functions of version 1.05). And fix (part of)
  monster_e.hlp. (Thanks !)
- New commands:
	show charset
- New command forms:
	claim room
	claim object {object}
	claim monster {monster}
	claim spell {spell}
	disown room
	disown object {object}
	disown monster {monster}
	disown spell {spell}
	public room
	public object {object}
	public monster {monster}
	public spell {spell}

	If {orject}, {monster} or {spell} argument is missing, it is prompted.
	If it is ambiquous, list for possible matches are given (selection
		by number or cursor keys).
- New MDL-functions:
	boolean and (arg1,arg2,...)
	boolean or (arg1,arg2,...)
	or else (arg1,arg2,...)
	and then (arg1,arg2,...)
- Changed MDL-functions:
	get global flag(arg)
	strip (arg)
- Default character set is now Dec Multinational
- If argument of command is ambiquos, monster gives list of possible
  matches and player can select correct one by number or by cursor keys.
  (This not apply to all commands or all forms of commands.)
  This is available (at least) in following commands:
	claim [object|monster|spell] {something}
	disown [object|monster|spell] {something}
	public [object|monster|spell] {something}
	custom [object|monster] {something}
	get {obejct}
	drop {object}
	delete [room|object|monster] {something}
	scan {object}
	destroy {object}
	duplicate {object}
	erase {monster}
	reset {object}
	wear {object}
	wield {object}
	set {something}
- New tables in MONSTER.INIT:
	CHARTABLE:   (can be empty)
	{ charset ....
	  char ... }			This table also effects to parsing of 
	END OF CHARTABLE		MDL and MDL function strip(...).

	CLOSED MESSAGE:			This is same as ILMOITUS.TXT file
	{some text}				in previously.
	END OF MESSAGE
- New fields in MONSTER.INIT:		(this is value what MONSTER_INSTALL.COM
					 gives)
	database_poltime:		default "0 ::1"
	mdl_buffers: 			default 20
	dcl_access_allowed:		default yes
- Format of dump of MONSTER/DUMP is also changed little (as usual).
	MONSTER/REBUILD (of course) reads all previous formats.
- MDL parser now tires check if variable is used before it defination
	in compile time (not easy task, because variables are defined 
	dynamically).
- MDL code loading from terminal is now handled correctly (no block
	Monster's event loop). So you can use "g tt:" command to
	enter MDL -code.
- MDL interpreter should now be little faster (and uses memory
	little more sensible - however number of mdl -buffers
	is now 20 by default instead of 5).
- BUG fixes:
	- recovery routines in MONSTER/FIX destroys intergity
	  of database in version 1.05. Now fixed.
	- MONSTER/DUMP - MONSTER/REBUILD now not destroy end
	  of descriptions lines if these are near to 80 characters.
        - MONSTER/REBUILD don't now crashed so easily when it
	  detects some errors in dumpfile.
	- Some other bug fixes.

New in verstin 1.05 to version 1.04 (posted 1.7.1992):
 - MONSTER /BUILD and /DUMP commands now correct handle passwords
   of virual userids created by MONSTER/USER (you can't do
     text dump of database and build new database where password
     of virtual userids have saved in available)
 - MDL function 'or' accept now any number of parameters
 - MDL function 'and' accept now more than two parameters
 - New modules: VERSION.PAS (version number of monster)
                ALLOC.PAS
 - New image MONSTER_REBUILD.EXE - here is now commands:
		MONSTER/REBUILD
		MONSTER/FIX
		MONSTER/BATCH
 - Document have updated little

New in version 1.04 to version 1.03 (posted 24.11.1990):
 -  Several bugfixes (of course)
 -  New commands MONSTER/DUMP and MONSTER/BUILD (via MONSTER_DUMP.EXE)
 -  Reading of keyboard and database polling starategy have rewrote -
    should cause smaller IO-load to system (new GUTS.PAS).
 -  MDL -parser now writes offending line and points error position when 
    it detects error in MDL-program.
