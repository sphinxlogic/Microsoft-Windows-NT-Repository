X  still out there, feel free to make those patches to version 2.0, and
X  I'll be glad to include them in version 2.1, especially since we
X  now have a good mechanism for controlling options.
X+ 
X+ CHANGES IN VERSION 2.05
X+ 
X+ - Massive starvation bug *really* fixed. Located and hit with a can of
X+ Raid. Certain circumstances might still cause more minor breakages, but
X+ homelands will *not* starve (when they shouldn't). Hurrah. 
X+ 
X+ CHANGES IN VERSION 2.04
X+ 
X+ - A patch to fix the failure to reset hex and population counts after
X+ games. Released only as a patch.
