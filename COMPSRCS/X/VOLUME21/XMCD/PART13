XIndex Number Indicator
X
XThis indicator displays the currently playing index
Xnumber.  Most CDs do not have indices within a track,
Xthus the index number would be 1.  On CDs that do have
Xindices, you can advance to the next index or skip to
Xthe previous index using the "Previous Index" and
X"Next Index" buttons.
X
XThe indicator shows a dash "-" character when the
Xaudio playback is stopped or when there is no CD loaded.
XOn CD-ROM drives that do not report index information
Xduring playback, the display always shows "1".

XTrack List
X
XThis list shows the tracks available on the currently
Xloaded CD.  Each track entry consists of the track number,
Xthe time (see "Time Display Selector"), and the title of
Xthe track.
X
XIf the currently loaded CD does not have an associated
XCD Database entry, or if the CDDB entry does not
Xcontain any title information for this track, then "??"
Xwill be shown in the title portion.
X
XIf audio playback is currently in progress, the track
Xentry in the list is shown in bold font.
X
XYou can choose a track by clicking pointer button 1 on
Xthe desired track, causing the track entry to be shown
Xin reverse-video.  Once chosen, you can add this track
Xto the program play sequence ("Add To Program"), or pop
Xup the associated Extended Track Information window
X("Extended Track Information Button").
X
XIf you click pointer button 1 on an already chosen
Xtrack, it is un-chosen.
X
XDouble-clicking a track selection has the equivalent
Xeffect as entering the chosen track as the only track
Xin the program, and starting the play sequence.
X
XYou can also use the arrow keys to traverse the list.
XPressing the space bar is equivalent to clicking the
Xpointer button 1, and pressing the Enter or Return key is
Xequivalent to double- clicking the pointer button 1.

XVolume Control
X
XThis is the volume control slider.  You can control the
Xplayback volume by grabbing the "thumb" of the control
Xwith pointer button 1.  Alternatively, you can click to
Xthe right or to the left of the thumb and cause the
Xvolume to change in gradations.  Holding the Ctrl key
Xand clicking to the right or left of the thumb will
Xcause the volume to go to maximum or minimum,
Xrespectively.
X
XYou can also operate the volume control using the left
Xand right arrow keys, the Ctrl-left arrow and Ctrl-right
Xarrow key combinations, or the Home and End keys.
X
XThe software volume control may not be supported on
Xsome CD-ROM drives.  Also, on some CD-ROM drives this
Xslider serves as a mute control, and can only be set
Xto full-off or full-on positions.
