X
XKnown bugs/limitations
X----------------------
X
X1. Description:
X   Clicking the mouse button #3 on the volume control slider thumb
X   will not bring up the help window.  One must click on the numeric
X   label area instead.
X
X   Severity/Analysis:
X   Low severity.  This is a limitation of the Motif scale widget.
X
X   Solution/Workaround:
X   Use the numeric label area to bring up the help window for the volume
X   control.
X
X2. Description:
X   When clicking mouse button #3 on the volume control numeric label
X   area, sometimes the help window does not appear.
X
X   Severity/Analysis:
X   Low severity.  The problem occurs when the current keyboard input
X   focus is on the volume control slider.  This is a limitation of
X   the Motif scale widget.
X
X   Solution/Workaround:
X   Set the keyboard input focus on some other widget first (such as by
X   operating another control or button) before invoking the volume
X   control help window.

X		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
X		       Version 2, June 1991
X
X Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
X                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
X Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
X of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
X
X			    Preamble
X
X  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
Xfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
XLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
Xsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
XGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software
XFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
Xusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
Xthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
Xyour programs, too.
X
X  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
Xprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
Xhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
Xthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
Xif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
Xin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
X
X  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
Xanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
XThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
Xdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
X
X  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
Xgratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
Xyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
Xsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
Xrights.
X
X  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
X(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
Xdistribute and/or modify the software.
X
X  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
Xthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
Xsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
Xwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
Xthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
Xauthors' reputations.
X
X  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
Xpatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
Xprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
Xprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
Xpatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
X
X  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
Xmodification follow.
X
X		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
X   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
X
X  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
Xa notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
Xunder the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
Xrefers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
Xmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
Xthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
Xeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
Xlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
Xthe term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
X
XActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
Xcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
Xrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
Xis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
XProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).
XWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.
X
X  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
Xsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
Xconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
Xcopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
Xnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
Xand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
Xalong with the Program.
X
XYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
Xyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
X
X  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
Xof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
Xdistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
Xabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
X
X    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
X    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
X
X    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
X    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
X    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
X    parties under the terms of this License.
X
X    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
X    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
X    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
X    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
X    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
X    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
X    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
X    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
X    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
X    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
X
XThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
Xidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
Xand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
Xthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
Xsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
Xdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
Xon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
Xthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
Xentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
X
XThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
Xyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
Xexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
Xcollective works based on the Program.
X
XIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
Xwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
Xa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
Xthe scope of this License.
X
X  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
Xunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
XSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
X
X    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
X    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
X    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
X
X    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
X    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
X    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
X    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
X    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
X    customarily used for software interchange; or,
X
X    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
X    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
X    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
X    received the program in object code or executable form with such
X    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
X
XThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
Xmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
Xcode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
Xassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
Xcontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
Xspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include
Xanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
Xform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
Xoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
Xitself accompanies the executable.
X
XIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
Xaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
Xaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as
Xdistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
Xcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.
X
X  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
Xexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
Xotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
Xvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
XHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
Xthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
Xparties remain in full compliance.
X
X  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
Xsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
Xdistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
Xprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
Xmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
XProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
Xall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
Xthe Program or works based on it.
X
X  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
XProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
Xoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
Xthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
Xrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
XYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
Xthis License.
X
X  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
Xinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
Xconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
Xotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
Xexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
Xdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
XLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
Xmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
Xlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
Xall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
Xthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
Xrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
X
XIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
Xany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
Xapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
Xcircumstances.
X
XIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
Xpatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
Xsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
Xintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is
Ximplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
Xgenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
Xthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that
Xsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
Xto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
Ximpose that choice.
X
XThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
Xbe a consequence of the rest of this License.
X
X  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
Xcertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
Xoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License
Xmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
Xthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
Xcountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
Xthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.
X
X  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
Xof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
Xbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
Xaddress new problems or concerns.
X
XEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
Xspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
Xlater version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
Xeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free
XSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
Xthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
XFoundation.
X
X  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
Xprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
Xto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
XSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes

X	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
X
X  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
Xpossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
Xfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
X
X  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
Xto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
Xconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
Xthe "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
X
X    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
X    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
X
X    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
X    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
X    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
X    (at your option) any later version.
X
X    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
X    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
X    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
X    GNU General Public License for more details.
X
X    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
X    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
X    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
X
XAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
X
XIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
Xwhen it starts in an interactive mode:
X
X    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
X    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
X    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
X    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
X
XThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
Xparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
Xbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
Xmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
X
XYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
Xschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
Xnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
X
X  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
X  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

XThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
Xproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
Xconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
Xlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
XPublic License instead of this License.

XXmcd (Motif(tm) CD Audio Player) by Ti Kan
X------------------------------------------
X
XYou must have X11R4/Motif 1.1 or later to build xmcd.  Xmcd has been
Xsuccessfully built under both X11R4 + Motif 1.1 and X11R5 + Motif 1.2.
XIf you are running Motif 1.1, I recommend version 1.1.4 or later.
XAlso, you must have an ANSI C compatible compilation environment.
X
XXmcd can be built using the native X libraries that are supplied with
Xyour OS release.  If you have XFree86 installed, you can also build
Xxmcd using the libraries from the XFree86 distribution.  Make sure
Xyou use the right set of X include files to match!  Motif is not a
Xpart of the XFree86 package, so you will need to get it separately.
X
XIf you are running SCO UNIX or ODT, xmcd requires the C pre-processor
Xflag "-Dsco" (lower-case) to be set.  This is done by default on systems
Xrunning the ODT Development System.  If you are using XFree86, you must
Xmodify the appropriate "OsDefines" line in your
X/usr/X386/lib/X11/config/x386.cf file to include -Dsco.
X
XIf you are building xmcd on a SunOS 4.1.x platform, you must use the
XGNU C compiler (gcc) instead of the cc compiler.  This is because cc
Xunder SunOS 4.1.x is not ANSI compliant.
X
XOn all platforms, if you use gcc, you must add the following to
Xyour CFLAGS:
X
X	-fpcc-struct-return -fwritable-strings
X
XYou must compile on one of the supported UNIX OS flavors (See the
XREADME file for a list of the supported OS environments) to get a
Xreal functional xmcd.  You can compile on other platforms, but you
Xwill end up with a "demo" version of xmcd.
X
XYou can also force the build of the "demo" version by specifying
X-DDEMO_ONLY.  See the comments in Imakefile.  The "demo-only" version
Xhas been successfully compiled and run on the following OS platforms:
X
X	OSF/1 1.0 on HP-9000 Series 700 PA-RISC
X	SCO ODT 2.0 on x86
X	SCO ODT 3.0 on x86
X	Stratus SVR4.0 FTX 2.1
X	Stratus SVR4.0 FTX 2.2
X	SunOS 4.1.2 on Sun Sparc
X	UNIX SVR4.0 on x86
X	UNIX SVR4.2 on x86
X
XThe "demo" version does not actually control or respond to a real
XCD-ROM device.  Instead, a built-in CD-ROM simulater is used,
Xwhich allows you to play with the look-and-feel of xmcd and try
Xthe behavior of all the controls and functions.
X
XIn order to use the non-demo xmcd, your system must be set up
Xproperly to use a CD-ROM drive.  A good test is to see if you can
Xmount ISO-9660/High Sierra CD-ROM filesystems.  If your system does
Xnot support ISO-9660 but otherwise supports a raw CD-ROM device,
Xyou can try typing this command while logged in as the super-user:
X
X	dd if=DEVICE of=/dev/null bs=2k count=10
X
Xwhere DEVICE is the raw CD-ROM device, such as /dev/rcd0 (SCO ODT),
X/dev/rcdrom/cd0 (SVR4.0) or /dev/rcdrom/cdrom1 (SVR4.2).
X
XIf the dd command fails, then either your hardware is not set up
Xproperly, or your OS is not configured to support the CD-ROM device.
XYou should fix the problem first before attempting to run xmcd.
X
X
XBuild instructions:
X-------------------
X
X1. Take a look at Imakefile, read the comments, and make changes as
X   appropriate.
X2. Type "xmkmf" (or "imake -DUseInstalled")
X3. Type "make Makefiles"
X4. Type "make depend"
X5. Type "make"
X
X
XInstall instructions:
X---------------------
X
X1. Log in as the super-user and change to the xmcd source directory.
X2. Type "make install".  Answer all questions to configure xmcd.
X3. Edit LIBDIR/app-defaults/XMcd and make sure that the "XMcd.device:"
X   path matches the default raw CD-ROM device on your system.
X
X
XTo make a binary release:
X-------------------------
X
X1. Follow the Build Instructions as above.
X2. Make sure the binary you build has the proper mix of static vs.
X   shared library components for your target system. In particular,
X   if your target system does not have Motif installed, then you
X   will want to statically link libXm.a.  The same consideration
X   should be given to libXt, libXext, libX11, libnsl, libsocket,
X   libc, and others where applicable.  The more libraries you link
X   statically, the less platform-dependent the binary is, but the
X   larger it becomes.  In some cases, even a fully static xmcd binary
X   will still have problem running if the target system has different
X   kernel-to-library interfaces than the compiling system.
X2. Run the "makerel.sh" script.  The script generates a file
X   "xmcdbin.uue", which is a compressed and uuencoded tar format
X   file containing all files necessary for a xmcd binary distribution.
X
X
XTo make a source release:
X-------------------------
X1. Run the "makesrc.sh" script.  The script generates a file
X   "xmcdsrc.uue", which is a compressed and uuencoded tar format
X   file containing all xmcd source files.

XPorting Information
X-------------------
X
X
XINTRODUCTION
X
XA truly portable program should compile and run without modification
Xon different OS and hardware platforms.  Any CD Audio player software,
Xespecially under UNIX, is typically not very portable.  This is because
Xof the two following reasons:
X
X    1. Different OS implementations provide different means
X       of operating the CD-ROM drives.
X    2. Although there is an increasing number of CD-ROM drives
X       that implement and are conformant to the audio-related
X       commands as documented in the SCSI-2 specifications,
X       many non-SCSI-2 conformant CD-ROM drives exist, and
X       support audio operations only via incompatible vendor-
X       unique commands 
X
XXmcd strives to be as portable as possible by taking the following
Xdesign approach:
X
X    1. Harness the inherent portability advantages of the X Window
X       System, and the increasing popularity of the OSF/Motif GUI.
X       The X Window System gives us device-independent graphics
X       and network-extensibility, and Motif is rapidly becoming
X       the de facto standard UNIX GUI, and will soon be supported
X       on virtually every vendor's port of UNIX as well as UNIX-like
X       operating systems.
X    2. Strict adherence to ANSI C standards.
X    3. Modularize the internals of xmcd, such that the user interface
X       portion, the OS-interface portion, and the CD-ROM vendor-unique
X       support portions are each a separate and replaceable entity.
X    4. The OS-specific and device-specific portions are made as small
X       and self-contained as possible, so that changes to support
X       a new OS or new CD-ROM drive are not scattered about.
X
XCurrently xmcd already supports a wide array of SCSI CD-ROM drives
Xand several OS environments.  However, the more devices xmcd
Xsupports, and the more OS environments it runs under, the better.
XTo that end, I encourage you to contribute to xmcd and make it
Xa better program.  If you would like to add support of additional
XCD-ROM devices, port xmcd to run on another OS, or to add other
Xenhancements to xmcd, the xmcd internal architecture overview below
Xshould prove to be beneficial.
X
XXmcd currently contains code that assumes a POSIX-compliant UNIX
XC library and headers, and certain System V characteristics.
XExamples of these are:
X
X	- Uses "struct dirent" rather than "struct direct"
X	- Assumes existence of types such as "uid_t"
X	- etc...
X
XAlthough xmcd has been ported to run on SunOS (The SunOS 4.x kernel
Xis BSD-based), you may need to make certain modifications to port
Xxmcd to other BSD-derived or BSD-like environments.
X
XPlease note that xmcd is released as free software under the GNU
XGeneral License Agreement, which guarantees your right to modify
Xxmcd for yourself and others (please see the COPYING file for
Xdetails).  I do ask, however, that if you add new functionality
Xto xmcd or port xmcd to a new platform, please send all changes to
Xme so I can merge it into the main source code and include it in
Xthe next release.  All proper credit will be given, of course,
Xin the form of Copyright notices in the source file banners and
Xthe "About..." pop-up window.  This avoids diverging versions
Xand makes your enhancements accessible to more people.

X
XXMCD ARCHITECTURE
X
XXmcd is divided into two main subsystems, the Application Code
XSubsystem and the Device Interface Subsystem (These are hereafter
Xreferred to as ACS and DIS, respectively).
X
XThe diagram below shows the general xmcd architecture, and
Xidentifies where the various libraries (Motif, Xt, X11, socket,
Xand the C library) interface with the main xmcd bodies of code.

X                                OS Kernel
X
X
X
XThe ACS is the layer that deals with the user interface and mostly
Xuses Motif for that purpose.  It provides the look-and-feel of the
Xapplication and manages all user events.  The ACS also provides a set
Xof general service functions for the DIS to call.  There are two
Xgeneral classes of these functions.  The first of these are functions
Xthat cause changes on the user interface (display popup messages,
Xchange widget state, etc.), and the second are general service routines
X(perform byte-swapping, BCD to interger conversion, etc).  This layer
Xis hardware platform and OS independent and should require virtually
Xno modifications to port to other environments.
X
XThe DIS can be hardware and OS dependent.  The interface from the
XACS layer to the DIS is very high-level, consisting of function
Xcalls like cdlib_playpause(), cdlib_stop(), cdlib_rew(), cdlib_ff(),
Xand so on (see cdlib.h for the full list).  This gives the DIS a lot
Xof flexibility in how to implement the actual functionalities.
XFurthermore, the DIS physically resides in a library archive.
XAlthough it is currently linked into xmcd statically, if the need
Xarises it can be modified to be dynamically bound.
X
XThe DIS supplied with the current xmcd source code is a conglomerate
Xof the SCSI Passthrough module, an OS Interface module, and several
XVendor-unique modules (see diagram below).  This DIS implements all
Xthe non-user-interface aspects of CD audio functionality and operates
Xthe CD-ROM drive by delivering SCSI commands directly to the CD-ROM
Xdrive via a kernel-supported SCSI passthrough interface.
X
XXmcd currently supplies three OS Interface Modules, one for most
Xflavors of SVR4 on the x86 platform, another for SCO ODT, and a
Xthird "demo" module that provides a demo environment, but does not
Xactually operate a real CD-ROM drive (a CD-ROM simulator is invoked
Xinstead, mimicking the behavior of a CD-ROM drive).  Xmcd also supplies
Xseveral vendor-unique modules for Toshiba, Pioneer, NEC, and Hitachi
XCD-ROM drives.  Only one OS Interface module can be compiled in at a
Xtime (controlled by pre-processor directives), but multiple vendor-
Xunique modules can coexist.

XOn a kernel that does not supports SCSI-passthrough, but otherwise

XIn the supplied DIS, the SCSI Passthrough module portion contains
Xall the basic non-OS-dependent portion of the code that implements
Xdelivering SCSI commands to a CD-ROM drive.  It relies on the next
Xlayer, the OS Interface layer, to actually perform the SCSI command
Xdelivery.  The SCSI Passthrough module "knows" about the SCSI-2
Xset of audio-related commands, and sends these down to the OS
XInterface layer.  Which SCSI-2 commands to send are user-configurable
Xvia device-dependent configuration files.  This is important because
Xmany CD-ROM drives support some, but not all of the SCSI-2 audio
Xcommands.  Alternatively, if so configured, the SCSI Passthrough
Xmodule can call the Vendor-unique module to deliver non-SCSI-2
Xvendor-unique commands to the CD-ROM drive.
X
XAll entry points to the OS Interface module are named in the
Xform of pthru_xxx().  See lib_svr4.h, lib_odt.h and lib_demo.h
Xfor a full list.
X
XThe most important OS Interface module entry point is pthru_send(),
Xwhich is used by the SCSI Passthrough and Vendor-unique modules
Xto deliver SCSI commands to the drive.  pthru_send() takes
Xa number of arguments that are used to contruct a SCSI CDB,
Xamong other things.  The SCSI CDB is actually allocated and
Xfilled in the OS Interface module, and delivered using the
Xappropriate SCSI-passthrough mechanism.
X
X
X
XPORTING HINTS
X
XTo port xmcd to a different OS, two alternatives can be
Xconsidered:
X
X1. Use the existing DIS, but write a new OS Interface module.
X2. Write a whole new DIS.
X
XThe first choice is the obvious answer if the target OS supports
XSCSI Passthrough.  This choice is also quite easy to implement,
Xas the OS Interface module is typically fairly small and self-
Xcontained.  The existing OS Interface modules can be used as
Xa reference when writing a new one.
X
XThe second choice is feasible if the OS does not supply a SCSI
XPassthrough mechanism, or if non-SCSI drives are to be used.
XIf this is the approach taken, the SCSI Passthrough module
Xsource can be used as a reference, and much of its code can be
Xcopied, modified and re-used.
X
XIf you are writing an OS Interface module, keep in mind that you
Xwill need to deal with any special DMA address alignment limitations
Xpresent in your OS and/or hardware.  The data buffers allocated
Xwithin the existing SCSI-passthrough DIS are not guarateed to be
X32-bit word-aligned or page-aligned.
X
XRemember the issue of big vs. small endian?  Please use the
Xbswapxx() and lswapxx() routines provided in util.c (#include "util.h")
Xto perform byte swapping.  This is necessary because multi-byte
Xquantities in SCSI commands and data is in general big-endian,
Xbut xmcd is designed to run on host CPUs that are big-endian or
Xlittle-endian.  The swap routines should be used regarless of
Xwhether your main CPU endianess matches that of the SCSI device.
XWhether swapping actually takes place is controlled via the
XBYTE_ORDER #define (see xmcd.h).
X
XThere are also some minor OS-specific code you need to add in
Xconfigure.sh.  This is mainly to set up the correct default device
Xnode path name.
X
XTo support additional non-SCSI-2 CD-ROM drives via vendor-unique
Xpassthrough commands, you will need to add a vendor-unique module
Xto xmcd.  In addition to writing the new vendor-unique module, you
Xwill also need to make a few additions to lib_scsipt.c and lib_scsipt.h.
XLook for #ifdef TOSHIBA, #ifdef NEC, etc., in these files for examples.
X

XIf you are working on enhancing xmcd and need information, help
Xor advice, please send e-mail to me at "ti@amb.org".  Likewise,
Xsuggestions are also very welcome.

XINTRODUCTION
X------------
X
XThis is the release notes for xmcd.  Please read through this file
Xbefore building, installing, or using xmcd.
X
X
X
XSOURCE CODE RELEASE NOTES
X-------------------------
X
XThe source code of this version of xmcd supports the following operating
Xsystems environments:
X
X	1. UNIX System V Release 3.2 (on Intel x86)
X	   - SCO Open Desktop Version 2.x (X11R4 or X11R5 server)
X	   - SCO Open Desktop Version 3.x
X	   - SCO UNIX 3.2v4.x with XFree86 + Motif 1.2
X
X	2. UNIX System V Release 4.0 (on Intel x86)
X	   (Note: 4.0.3 or later recommended)
X	   - AT&T
X	   - Consensys
X	   - Dell
X	   - ESIX
X	   - ISC
X	   - Microport
X	   - Micro Station Technology
X	   - UHC
X	   - USL
X
X	3. UNIX System V Release 4.2 (on Intel x86)
X	   - Consensys
X	   - Information Foundation
X	   - Onsite
X	   - Univel/Novell UnixWare
X	   - USL
X
X	4. UNIX System V Release 4.2MP (on Intel x86)
X	   - USL (ES/MP TLP4/EA5 or later)
X
X	5. UNIX System V Release 4.0 (on Motorola 88k)
X	   - Motorola
X
X	6. HP-UX (on HP Series 700)
X	   - HP-UX Release 9.0 (see notes below)
X
X	7. SunOS (on Sun Sparc)
X	   - SunOS 4.x / Solaris 1.x (see notes below)
X
X	8. SunOS (on Sun Sparc)
X	   - SunOS 5.x / Solaris 2.x (see notes below)
X
X	9. SunOS (on Intel x86)
X	   - SunOS 5.x / Solaris 2.x (see notes below)
X
X
XIn general, binaries compiled on one OS can run on another OS under
Xthe same group.  Thus, xmcd compiled on Consensys SVR4.0 should run
Xon ESIX SVR4.0, but not on Univel UnixWare or SCO ODT.  There are some
Xissues with shared library compatibility amongst the different SVR4.0
Xvendors, so it is best to run xmcd on the same OS that it's compiled
Xon.
X
XXmcd's current SunOS 4.x run-time support is limited to systems
Xrunning the sun4c and sun4m kernels.  To find out which kernel you
Xhave, use the "arch -k" command.
X
XThe Motorola 88K support was contributed by Mark Scott.
X
XThe HP-UX and Solaris 2.x support is present in the xmcd source code,
Xbut is untested as of this writing.  You may need to make minor changes
Xto the xmcd sources and compile to make things work on these systems.
XA binary release is not currently available from the author for these
Xplatforms.  If you have success in bringing up xmcd on HP-UX and/or
XSolaris 2.x, please send all source changes to the author so the
Xmods can be integrated into a future xmcd release to be shared by all.
X
XSee the INSTALL file for information about the required X11 and Motif
Xlibrary versions and configurations, and build/install instructions.
X
XFor Copyright information, read the COPYING file.
X
XThe modular design of xmcd is such that support for other UNIX
Xenvironments can be easily added by implementing a new OS-interface
Xlibrary module for xmcd.  Moreover, support for other non SCSI-2
Xcompliant CD-ROM drives can also be added via new vendor-unique
Xlibrary modules.  See the "PORTING" file for details if you are
Xinterested in contributing to the development effort to make xmcd
Xrun under more environments and support more CD-ROM drives.
X
X
XGENERAL SOFTWARE NOTES
X----------------------
X
XThis release of xmcd features the following:
X
X	- Standard functions: Stop, Play, Pause, Next/Previous Track,
X	  Next/Previous Index, Fast forward/rewind with audio sample,
X	  Eject and On/off.
X	- Direct track access keypad.
X	- Volume control.
X	- Shuffle (random) play function.
X	- Repeat function.
X	- Sample function: Play a few seconds of each track.
X	- A->B function: Repeat from selectable point A and B.
X	- Eject inhibit function: To prevent someone from ejecting the
X	  disc by pressing the button on the drive.
X	- Track Program function: Play tracks in custom order.
X	- CD database function: Allows you to store CD title/track titles
X	  in database, and associate each disc with a play program.
X	  Displays the current playing disc title/track information.
X	  In addition, you can enter and display arbitrary text associated
X	  with the disc or each track, such as band information, lyrics,
X	  etc.
X	- Track/Index/Time display: Selectable to display elapsed time,
X	  remaining track time, or remaining disc time.
X	- Status display: for current play status, A->B mode, program
X	  mode, CD database.
X	- Main window button face labels can be configured to display
X	  pictorial symbols, or text with hotkey mnemonics.
X	- The complete application can be operated via the keyboard with
X	  full support for keyboard traversal and hotkeys.
X	- All labels and messages can be customized to non-English
X	  languages via X resources in the .Xdefaults file.
X	- All colors and many other functionality are user-customizable
X	  using X resource settings.
X	- On-line help information.
X
X
XXmcd uses the Motif toolkit to achieve a pleasing appearance, such that
Xit actually looks and feels like a real CD player for all basic
Xfunctions, yet takes advantage of the GUI and window system to make
Xprogramming and CD database functions easy.
X
XYour xmcd binary should only be run on the same OS platform group
Xthat it was compiled on.  For example, UNIX SVR4.0 binaries must
Xnot be run on a UNIX SVR4.2 system.  Likewise, a binary compiled
Xon a SunOS 4.x platform cannot be used on a SunOS 5.x system.
X
XDo not use xmcd if the CD-ROM drive contains a mounted filesystem
Xdata disc (ISO9660, High Sierra, Rockridge or other formats).  Always
Xuse the "df" or "mount" command to check if such a filesystem is mounted
Xbefore invoking xmcd.
X
X

X
XUnits denoted with a plus sign (+) are believed to work with xmcd, but
Xhave not been extensively tested yet.  If you have one of these drives
XI would like to hear from you.
X
XUnits denoted with an asterisk (*) can be configured to operate in the
XSCSI-1 or SCSI-2 mode (via jumpers or DIP switch).  You must configure
Xthe xmcd software accordingly (with the LIBDIR/xmcd/config/configure.sh
Xprogram).  Depending upon the specific model, you may find that xmcd
Xsupports more features while operating in SCSI-2 mode.  See the CD-ROM
Xdrive owner's manual for details about setting the mode.
X
XThis release of xmcd supports operating only the first disc on the
XPioneer multi-disc CD-ROM changers.  Pioneer DRM-604X units with
Xolder revisions of the firmware must be configured to operate in
Xthe SCSI-1 mode (DRM-600A emulation, via back panel DIP switches),
Xand xmcd must be configured as if it's operating a DRM-600A.  Newer
XDRM-604X units (and those that have their firmware upgraded) can be
Xset up to run in SCSI-2 mode, and xmcd must be set up to operate
Xa DRM-604X.
X
XTo avoid possible SCSI bus lock-up, never eject the disc using the
Xeject button on the front panel of the Hitachi CD-ROM drives while
Xthe unit is playing audio.  Use xmcd's software eject button instead.
XAlso, you may wish to adjust the XMcd.searchSkipBlocks and
XXMcd.searchPauseInterval resources to achieve the best audio
Xsampling effect during REW and FF search operations.
X
XThe Texel units implements only a subset of the SCSI-2 audio commands.
XXmcd will work on these but with somewhat reduced functionality.  Also,
Xthe Texel drive firmware should be version 1.10 or later to avoid
Xsystem lockups.
X
XNote that even if a CD-ROM drive is marketed as SCSI-2 compliant, it
Xstill may not implement the full set of audio-related commands that
Xxmcd requires.
X
XIf you have a CD-ROM drive not listed above, I would appreciate a note
Xfrom you regarding whether it works with xmcd or not.  If it works,
Xplease send me your xmcd device-specific configuration file for this
Xdrive (usually /usr/lib/X11/xmcd/config/NAME, where NAME is the name
Xof the character device of the CD-ROM drive).  I will then add your
Xdrive to the supported list.
X
XSome CD-ROM drives do not function well when the SCSI host adapter
Xboard is configured to "synchronous negotiation" mode.  Examples
Xof these include certain NEC and Hitachi units.  If you experience
Xmalfunctions with xmcd, check the host adapter board configuration
Xand try disabling the synchronous mode.  On the Adaptec AHA-1542B,
Xthere is a single jumper that controls whether synchronous negotiation
Xis enabled for all devices on the SCSI bus.  On the AHA-1542C,
Xsynchronous negotiation is configurable via the on-board setup program,
Xand is settable on a per-ID basis.  Please consult your SCSI host
Xadapter board owner's manual for information.

X.TH XMCD 1 "30 Oct 1993" "v1.0"
X
X.SH "NAME"
Xxmcd \- CD digital audio player utility for X11/Motif
X
X.SH "SYNOPSIS"
X.B xmcd
X.nh
X[\fItoolkitoption ...] [-\fIdev\fP device] [-\fIdbdir\fP path]
X
X.SH "DESCRIPTION"
X.I Xmcd
Xis a program that allows the use of the CD-ROM drive as
Xa full-featured stereo compact-disc player for the X window system.
X.PP
XMost of the features found on real CD players are available in
X.I xmcd,
Xsuch as shuffle and repeat, track programming functions, and
Xa numeric keypad for direct track access.  Additional functions
Xinclude sample play, A to B segment play, volume control, etc.
X.PP
XA built-in CD database feature allows the CD artist/title and
Xtrack titles, and other associated general purpose text to be
Xmaintained and loaded as the program is started or when a
XCD is inserted.
X.PP
XFull feature-specific pop-up help is available for
Xall controls, indicators, text input fields, and lists.
X.PP
XOn systems with more than one CD-ROM drive, multiple invokations of
X.I xmcd
Xcan be used to operate each drive independently.
X.PP
X.I Xmcd
Xis designed to be easy to use, as the main window is
Xpurposely made to resemble a real CD player front panel.
XAll other pop-up windows are also designed to be as
Xintuitive as possible.  Moreover, while the use of a mouse
Xis natural with
X.I xmcd,
Xall functionality can also be operated via the keyboard.
XThis is in conformance to the guidelines published in the
X.I OSF/Motif Style Guide
Xfrom the Open Software Foundation.
X.PP
XThe internal architecture of
X.I xmcd
Xis designed from the start to be easily portable to
Xmany operating system platforms, and adaptible to the myriad of
XCD-ROM drives available.
X
X.SH "OPTIONS"
XAll standard \fIXt Intrinsics\fR toolkit options are supported.
XIn addition,
X.I xmcd
Xsupports the following options:
X.TP
X.I \-dev\ device
XSpecifies the path name to the raw CD-ROM device.  If this option is
Xnot used, the default device to be used is the first
Xdrive set up with the
X.I xmcd
Xconfiguration program (See below).
X.TP
X.I \-dbdir\ list
XSpecifies a colon-separated list of category directories where
Xthe CD database files are to be kept.  See the description for
X\fBXMCD_DBPATH\fR in the ENVIRONMENT section below.
X
X.SH "X RESOURCES"
X.I Xmcd
Xhas many adjustable X resources to customize its look and feel, as well
Xas its behavior.  Notably, the colors of virtually every feature on
X\fIxmcd\fP's windows can be changed, as well as the text fonts.  All
Xtext labels can also be changed (for example, to another language).
X.PP
XThere are too many resources to list here, but the resource names
Xand their defaults (plus descriptive comments) can be found in the
X\fBLIBDIR\fI/app-defaults/XMcd\fR
Xfile (where LIBDIR is typically \fI/usr/lib/X11\fP).
XIt is not recommended
Xthat you change values in the \fBLIBDIR\fI/app-defaults/XMcd\fR file,
Xunless you want the changes to be forced upon all users of
X.I xmcd
Xon the system.  Instead, make a copy of this file, change the copy as you
Xsee fit, then place it in your home directory.  Your custom resource
Xsettings will then override the defaults when
X.I xmcd
Xis subsequently started.  Alternatively, you may also place specific
Xresources you wish to override in the
X.I .Xdefaults
Xfile in your home directory.
X
X.SH "DEVICE CONFIGURATION"
XThe X resources described in the previous section affect the
Xgeneral appearance and behavior of
X.I xmcd.
XThere are additional configurable parameters that must vary on a
Xper-drive basis.  For example, in some cases
X.I xmcd
Xmust operate the drive differently depending upon the brand
Xand model of the drive.  Thus, there must be a separate
Xconfiguration file for these parameters \fIper-device\fP.
XThe default file is \fBXMCDLIB\fI/config/\fBDEVICE\fR
X(where XMCDLIB is typically \fI/usr/lib/X11/xmcd\fP and DEVICE is
Xthe base name of the raw device special file for the CD-ROM drive
X; e.g., \fI/usr/lib/X11/xmcd/config/rcd0\fP).
XA configuration program \fBXMCDLIB\fI/config/configure.sh\fR
Xis provided to make maintaining the device-specific configuration
Xfile easy (Note: on SCO systems the configuration program can
Xalso be invoked as "\fImkdev xmcd\fP").
X.PP
XYou should always use the configuration program to set the
Xdevice-specific parameters when installing
X.I xmcd
Xfor the first time, or when the CD-ROM hardware configuration has
Xchanged.  If this is not done then
X.I xmcd
Xwill probably not operate correctly with your CD-ROM drive.
X.PP
X.B WARNING:
XIf
X.I xmcd
Xis not correctly configured, you may cause
X.I xmcd
Xto deliver commands that are not supported by your CD-ROM drive.
XUnder some environments this may lead to system hang or crash.
X.PP
XYou can override some of the device-specific configuration parameters
Xby adding your own configuration files.
X.I Xmcd
Xwill also look in \fBHOME\fI/.xmcdcfg/\fBDEVICE\fR file for
Xdevice-specific parameters (where HOME is your home directory
Xand DEVICE is as specified above).  Parameters found in this file
Xwill override the system defaults (except those parameters that
Xcannot be overidden; see the comments in the
X\fBXMCDLIB\fI/config/dev.config\fR for details).
X
X.SH "USING XMCD"
XThe basic functions of
X.I xmcd
Xare designed to operate the same way as on a real stereo CD player.
XThe pictorial symbols used on the main window buttons are intended
Xto illustrate the function in a non-language-specific manner.  You
Xcan also change all main window buttons to display a text label
Xinstead of the pictorial symbols, but clicking the \fBdisplay\fP
Xcheck-box button (the "A" symbol enclosed in a box) located at the
Xupper left hand corner of the main window.
X.PP
XThe CD database and track programming functions are operated
Xvia the CD Database/Track Program Editor pop-up subwindow.
XYou activate the subwindow by pressing the \fBcddb/prog\fP button
X(file cabinet symbol) on the main window (See "CD DATABASE" below).
X.PP
XThere will not be a per-item description of all the features,
Xbecause full on-line help is available (See "ONLINE HELP" below).
X
X.SH "ONLINE HELP"
XFor general information about
X.I xmcd,
Xclick the \fBhelp\fP (question mark symbol) button on the
X.I xmcd
Xmain window.  You can also get specific help information
Xabout each button, control, indicator, text entry area,
Xselection list by positioning the mouse cursor over the
Xdesired item, then clicking the third mouse button.
XA pop-up window will appear, containing the relevant
Xhelp text.
X
X.SH "TRACK PROGRAMMING"
XYou can program
X.I xmcd
Xto play only certain tracks, in a custom sequence.
XTo do so, invoke the CD Database window (by pressing the
X.B cddb/prog
Xbutton on the main window).  Select the desired track by clicking on
Xthe entry in the
X.B Track list,
Xand click the
X.B Add
Xbutton to add to the play sequence.  Notice that the track number
Xappears in the
X.B Play sequence
Xtext field.  You can also type the track numbers, separated with
Xcommas, directly in the
X.B Play sequence
Xfield.  Repeat until all desired tracks have been entered,
Xthen press the Track Program
X.B Play
Xbutton in the CD Database window (not the
X.B Play/Pause
Xbutton on the main window) to start the program play.
X.PP
XDuring program play, the
X.B prog
Xindicator in the main window display area "illuminates".
X
X.SH "CD DATABASE"
XThe CD Database feature of
X.I xmcd
Xallows you to enter the CD artist/title, track titles, other
Xfree-form text (such as band information, lyrics, etc.) associated
Xwith the disc and tracks, and a track play program.  After this
Xinformation is typed in and saved to a database file, it will
Xautomatically appear on the
X.I xmcd
XCD Database window when the same CD is inserted again.
X.PP
XYou must perform a "save" operation (press the
X.B Save
Xbutton) after typing in the database information before ejecting
Xthe CD or exiting, or the information will be lost.  If this is
Xthe first time this CD database entry is being stored, you will
Xbe asked to select a category (rock, classical, jazz, etc.) under
Xwhich to classify the CD.  The category is used by
X.I xmcd
Xto determine the actual directory in the filesystem to write
Xthe database file.
X.PP
XOnce the database information has been saved, the
X.B cddb
Xindicator on the
X.I xmcd
Xmain window display area "illuminates".
X.PP
XYou must type the CD information into the database because the
XCD's table of contents (TOC) contains only the number of tracks and
Xthe starting address of each track, but not the actual disc
Xand track titles.
X.PP
XThe CD database window should prove to be intuitive to use.
XYou may use the on-line help system to obtain specific help
Xinformation about the various buttons and items.
X.PP
XThe CD database information is stored in text files, one per CD,
Xin a designated directory (category).  The path of this
Xdirectory is \fBXMCDLIB\fI/cddb/\fBCATEGORY\fR, where XMCDLIB
Xis the directory specified by the XMcd.libdir resource, and
XCATEGORY is the category name selected when
X.B Save
Xis performed.  The list of categories used is specified by the
XXMcd.dbdir resource.  In addition, if the XMcd.dbdir resource
Xcontains full directory path names, then these will be used
Xwithout prefixing the \fBXMCDLIB\fI/cddb\fR.
X.PP
XYou may view the list of directories that
X.I xmcd
Xwill search for CD database files by pressing the
X.B About...
Xbutton and viewing the pop-up information window.
X.PP
XThe file name of each CD database entry is a hexadecimal representation
Xof a special "magic" number computed by
X.I xmcd
Xbased on the number of tracks, track timings, and other available
Xinformation about this CD.  This method is used because there is
Xno reliable unique CD identifier to be found on the CD
Xitself (the CD standard allows for a readable IPC/barcode but
Xvery few CDs actually contain such information).
X.PP
XSince different pressings of the same CD may sometimes contain slightly
Xdifferent track timings, the resultant magic number computed by
X.I xmcd
Xon these CDs will be different.  Thus, if you load a CD that is not
Xthe same one that a CD database entry was created with (but is
Xactually the same CD title),
X.I xmcd
Xmay not recognize it and display the database information
Xautomatically when you insert the CD.  In this event, you can
Xsearch the CD database and find the appropriate entry, and establish
Xa "link" to it.  To do so, press the
X.B Link
Xbutton, and select the appropriate category on the popup window.
X.I Xmcd
Xwill then present another pop-up window containing a list of all
XCD database entries in the specified category (that has the same
Xnumber of tracks as the currently inserted disc).  Select the
Xappropriate entry and a link will be made in the CD database.
X.PP
XThe
X.B Link
Xfeature alleviates the need to type in CD database information again
Xand avoids duplicate CD database entries.
X.PP
XIn very rare occasions it is possible that the magic number of a CD
Xconflicts with that of another.  This is a problem that will be addressed
Xin a future release of
X.I xmcd.
X
X.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
XSeveral environment variables are currently recognized by
X.I xmcd,
Xand are described as follows:
X.IP \fBXMCD_LIBDIR\fR
XThis is used to override the XMcd.libdir resource.  This parameter
Xis the directory path under which
X.I xmcd's
Xconfiguration files, help files, and CD database files are located.
XThe default value of XMCD_LIBDIR on most systems
Xis \fI/usr/lib/X11/xmcd\fR.
X.IP \fBXMCD_DBPATH\fR
XThis is used to override the XMcd.dbdir resource, which is a
Xlist of CD database category directories to be used under
X\fBXMCDLIB\fI/cddb\fR (where XMCDLIB is the directory root
Xspecified by the XMcd.libdir resource or the XMCD_LIBDIR
Xenvironment variable).  You may also use
Xthe \fB-dbdir\fR command line option, which has the highest
Xprecedence.  An example of a XMCD_DBPATH string is as follows
X(note the colon separators):
X.sp
X.in +4
X\fBrock:classical:jazz:newage:soundtrack:misc\fR
X.in -4
X.sp
XThis string will cause
X.I xmcd
Xto search the following directories for CD database files:
X.sp
X.in +4
X\fBXMCDLIB\fI/cddb/rock\fR
X.br
X\fBXMCDLIB\fI/cddb/classical\fR
X.br
X\fBXMCDLIB\fI/cddb/jazz\fR
X.br
Xetc.
X.in -4
X.sp
XYou may also specify absolute path names in the XMCD_DBPATH
Xentries.  Example:
X.sp
X.in +4
X\fBrock:classical:/usr/john/industrial:/usr/john/techno\fR
X.in -4
X.IP \fBHOME\fR
XThis is used to determine your home directory.  If HOME is not
Xdefined, then
X.I xmcd
Xtries to obtain it from the \fI/etc/passwd\fR file.  The home
Xdirectory path is used by
X.I xmcd
Xto locate the \fI.xmcdcfg\fR directory.
