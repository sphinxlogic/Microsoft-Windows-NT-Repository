XLink Database Entry Button
X
XSometimes different pressings of the same CD title
Xcan have different enough timing to appear as different
Xdiscs to Xmcd.  Thus, when you load a CD that is not
Xthe exact one that the CD Database entry was created
Xwith, Xmcd may not recognize it as a match to the
Xdatabase entry.
X
XWhen this happens, you can search the CD database
Xto see if a database entry exists for this CD, and
Xestablish a link (or alias) to it.  Once a link has
Xbeen established, Xmcd will recognize this CD.
X
XTo search the database and establish a link, select
Xthe Link button.
X
XUsing the link feature avoids the need for you to
Xenter all the information pertaining to the disc
Xagain.  It also keeps the database free of duplicate
Xentries (which may be different amongst each other).
X
XWhen you select the Link button, a CD Database directory
Xselection window appears, allowing you to choose the
Xsearch directory.  This limits the search to that specific
Xdirectory (if your current CD Database consists of only
Xone or no directory, then this step is omitted).  Another
Xpop-up will then appear, consisting of a list of candidate
XCD titles found in the directory.  These discs have the
Xsame number of tracks as the currently loaded CD.  Select
Xthe desired entry to link to by choosing the appropriate
Xlist entry and then select the OK button.

XLoad Database Entry Button
X
XSelecting this button will cause Xmcd to load the
XCD Database entry associated with the currently
Xloaded CD, if it exists.
X
XNormally, it is not necessary to use this function,
Xas Xmcd automatically loads the CD Database entry
Xwhen the CD is loaded.  This button forces a re-load
Xof the database entry, and is useful in the following
Xexample scenarios:
X
X  - You have edited the loaded version of the database
X    entry, have not saved it to the CD Database, and
X    want to discard your changes.
X
X  - The CD Database entry was modified since you
X    loaded the disc (by another Xmcd process or
X    perhaps via direct edit), and you want to load
X    the new version.
X
XThe button will have no effect if there is no CD
XDatabase entry for the currently loaded CD, or if
Xthere is no CD loaded.

XIf an eject operation is performed, Xmcd also starts

X
XIf you eject the disc manually (i.e., not using the

Xyou may want to select this button after ejecting
Xanyway, because this notifies Xmcd that the disc has
Xbeen withdrawn so that it can update its internal states,
Xand start polling for a new disc to be inserted.
XOtherwise, the next disc will not be automatically
Xdetected by Xmcd when it is loaded.  You must select
Xthe Stop button once for Xmcd to reinitialize itself.

Xdeveloped using the OSF/Motif toolkit.  It is a player
Xof digital audio compact discs utilizing the CD-ROM
Xdrives connected to your computer.  The audio
Xline-output on your CD-ROM drive can be connected
Xdirectly to an external amplifier and speakers, or to
Xa sound board with a built-in mixer and amplifier.
XMany CD-ROM drives also have a headphone jack and
Xvolume control on the front panel.
X
XXmcd does not control a sound board, thus the mixer on
Xa sound board must be operated via a separate
Xapplication.
X
XXmcd is a full-featured CD audio utility, offering
Xvirtually every feature that is found on standalone
X"real" component stereo CD players, plus many others
Xnot easily implementable (or usable) on such a player.
XThe following is a list of features supported by Xmcd:
X
X- Standard audio functions: Stop, Play, Pause, Previous
X   Track, Next Track, Previous Index, Next Index,
X   Rewind and Fast forward searching with audio sample,
X   Eject and On/off.
X- Direct track access keypad.
X- Volume control.
X- Shuffle (random) play function.
X- Repeat function.
X- Sample function: Play a few seconds of each track.
X- A->B function: Repeat from selectable point A and B.
X- Eject inhibit function: To prevent someone from ejecting
X   the disc by pressing the button on the drive.
X- Track Program function: Play tracks in custom order.
X- CD database function: Allows you to store CD title/track
X   titles in database, and associate each disc with a
X   play program.  Displays the current playing disc title/
X   track information.  In addition, you can enter and display
X   arbitrary text associated with the disc or each track,
X   such as band information, lyrics, etc.
X- Track/Index/Time display: Selectable to display elapsed
X   time, remaining track time, or remaining disc time.
X- Status display: for current play status, A->B mode,
X   program mode, CD database.
X- Main window button face labels can be configured to
X   display pictorial symbols, or text with hotkey
X   mnemonics.
X- The complete application can be operated via the
X   keyboard with full support for keyboard traversal and
X   hotkeys.
X- All labels and messages can be customized to non-
X   English languages via X resources in the .Xdefaults
X   file.
X- All colors and many other functionality are user-
X   customizable using X resource settings.
X- On-line help information.
X- Device-specific configuration files to make xmcd
X   adaptible to various brands of CD-ROM drives.
X
X
XXmcd undergoes continuous development and is being
Xported to new operating system environments.  Your
Xsuggestions are appreciated.  Please e-mail all feedback

XPrevious Track Button
X
XSelect this button to skip to the previous track.
XIf the current position is near the beginning of
Xthe current track, then the "previous" track is the
Xtrack with the next lower track number in normal
Xplayback mode, or the previous track in the play
Xsequence in the Shuffle or Program modes.  Otherwise,
Xthis button will cause playback to start from the
Xbeginning of the current track.
X
XYou may use this button during audio playback to
Xeffect the track change immediately, or, in normal
Xplayback mode only, change the track number while
Xstopped, then select the Play/Pause button to start
Xplayback at the designated track.
X
XIf you are already on the first track, selecting
Xthis button will have no effect.
X
XIf the playback state is paused when you use this
Xbutton, the state will remain paused when you change
Xto a new track.

XMode Selector Check Box
X
XThere are four toggle buttons in the Mode Selector
Xcheck box, described as follows:
X
X- Display Mode Selector
X
X  This button allows you to configure the Xmcd main
X  window push-buttons to either display a pictorial
X  symbol on their button-faces representing the
X  function, or to display text titles.
X
X  In Text Title mode, an underscore is shown below the
X  letter representing the short-cut key that can be used
X  to select the push-button.  If the specified short-cut
X  key does not work, try using the Shift, Ctrl, Alt or
X  Meta modifier keys in combination with the indicated
X  key.
X
X- Caddy Lock Selector
X
X  This button allows you to lock and unlock the CD caddy
X  when a disc is loaded.  When locked, a disc cannot be
X  ejected by pressing the Eject button on the CD-ROM
X  drive itself.  This is useful to prevent someone from
X  inadvertently ejecting the disc.
X
X  The Eject button on the Xmcd main window will still
X  function normally even when the caddy is locked.
X
X  This feature may not function on certain CD-ROM
X  drives, notably those that do not use a motorized
X  eject mechanism.
X
X- Repeat Mode Selector
X
X  This button allows you to enable or disable the
X  Repeat mode. When Repeat mode is enabled, Xmcd will
X  do the following:
X
X  * If normal playback is finished, Repeat mode will
X    cause the playback to commence again.
X  * If Shuffle playback is finished, Repeat mode will
X    cause a new shuffle sequence to be generated and
X    played.
X  * If Program playback is finished, Repeat mode will
X    play the program again.
X
X  The repeat operation will continue indefinitely until
X  the Repeat mode is disabled by selecting this button.
X
X  To repeat a single track, enter it as the only track
X  in a play program and start program playback with
X  Repeat mode enabled.
X
X- Shuffle Mode Selector
X
X  This button allows you to enable or disable the Shuffle
X  mode. When Shuffle mode is enabled, Xmcd will play all
X  the tracks on the CD in non-repeating random order.
X
X  You can enable and disable Shuffle mode only when
X  audio playback is not already in progress.  Also,
X  Shuffle mode will automatically disengage when you
X  enter Program Play mode or specify a track using the
X  Keypad window.
