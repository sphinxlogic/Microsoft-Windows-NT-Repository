XYou should really check out Imakefile to see if things are okay for your
Xsystem. Specifically, if you do not have your X11 headers in
X/usr/include/X11, you will have to change the INCLUDES line. There may be
Xother stuff you wish to fiddle with.
X
XRead README about getting "kanjidic", if you do not have it yet. It is
Xrequired for this program.
X
XYou technically do not need an ANSI compiler for this program, although 
X SUN's cc whines about "No Aggregate initialization", in "main.c"
XIf you're determined, you can fix that.
X
XAlso: This is techinically for X11R5. I do not think it will work on R4.
XApart from changing #include files, and fonts, I think that the R4 Xaw
Xsupport for 16-bit fonts is broken. If you manage to cobble something
Xtogether on your R4 system, I will be happy to incorporate your source
Xinto the "official" version of kdrill, but I will not go outof my to
Xsupport R4.

X
X.SH RESOURCES
XAll the above options can be set in a resource file, with the same names
Xas values. See the sample "KDrill" file for more detail, which is
Xnormally installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.
X
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X
X.B kdrill
Xis a program to drill users on meanings of kanji characters. Various
Xformats of drills are available:
X
X.RS 5
Xkanji to english
X
Xkanji to kana
X
Xenglish to kanji
X
Xkana to kanji
X.RE
X
XThe user can restrict the range of kanji to drill on in different, yet
Xcompatible, ways. The first way is to make a "usefile" (described below),
Xwith a an explicit list of desired kanji.
XA second way to limit the range of the drill is to change the gradelevel.
XThis can be done by clicking the Grade: button, using the -gradelevel
Xflag, or setting the gradelevel resource.
X
X
Xkdrill will use the "kanjidic" file to interpret many of the various
X16-bit kanji chars in the
X.I kanji24
Xfont supplied with the X11R5 distribution. It checks for a file by the name of
X.B "usefile"
Xin the current directory, although this name can be changed either with
Xthe '-usefile' option, or in a resource file.
X
X
X.I kanjidic
Xsubdivides its entries into grade levels, and frequency ratings. Grade
Xlevels are similar to school grade levels, but more compressed. For
Xkdrill's purposes, grade levels start at 1, and increase to 6. There are
Xmany kanji that do not have a grade level, due to their infrequency of
Xuse. You may specify that you only with to see kanji of a certain grade
Xlevel or lower. To use ALL kanji, you may specify gradelevel as 0. Grade
Xlevel 0 is the default, unless a resource file for kanjidrill has been
Xinstalled to override this.
X
X.I kanjidic
Xalso has a frequency rating for the top 2000 or so kanji. Kdrill will
Xdisplay this for your information, but the program does not attach any
Xsignificance to the number at present.
X
XAny grade level or frequency rating the current kanji has, will be
Xdisplayed in the top right hand side of the window, next to the "G:" and
X"F:" letters. The kanji number will be displayed \fIin
Xhexadecimal\fR(base 16) after the "#:" sign. It is displayed in
Xhexadecimal because that is what kanjidic, xfd, and the usefile display.
X
X.SH USEFILES
X
XA usefile consists of a list of hex numbers; one per line, no
Xinitial spaces allowed. A usefile makes the program only use particular
Xkanji, instead of the thousands possible in the dictionary. It is
Xpossible to add comment lines by having the very first character of a
Xline be "#". It is also possible to add english reminders after the number
Xon each line, so you remember what each number is.
XHex numbers can be checked or found by using the "xfd" util on the
X"kanji24" font. 
X
XGrade restrictions will apply to ALL kanji selected, even if you have a
Xusefile. Thus, if all your usefile-defined kanji are of grade 4 or
Xhigher, and you have selected grade 3 as a cut-off point, kdrill will
Xcomplain that there are not enough kanji available, and attempt to
Xincrease the grade level.
X
XIf you have a usefile, and wish the program to ignore it, you can run
X"kdrill -usefile none", and it will ignore it. "none" is NOT a keyword.
XIf you actually have a file in your directory named "none", use a
Xdifferent word.
X
X.SH KANJIDIC
XThe dictionary, kanjidic, is currently available where it originated, via
Xftp from
X.I monu6.cc.monash.edu.au,
Xor from a mirror in the U.S. at ftp.uwtc.washington.edu
X
XAt the monu6 site, both the dictionary and this program can currently be
Xfound in
X.I /pub/nihongo
X
X.SH BUGS
X"kanjidic" isn't perfect. There are "incomplete" entries, missing either
Xenglish or kana translations. There are also entries consisting of 
X"See Nxxxx" which isn't really an improvement.
