X! .At
X! .BR \-sp [ ecialtext ]

X! .I "special text"
X! mode for text objects.
X! .\"-------

X  Set the default font size for text objects (default = 12pt).

X! .BR \-te [ xtoutline ]
X! .Ap
X! Specifies that
X! .I xfig
X! will draw a red (on color machines) outline
X! of the ``actual'' bounding box of text objects.
X! This is not very useful anymore.
X! In the past it was useful to show you
X! the outline of rotated text since
X! .I xfig
X! didn't display rotated text then.

X! .I scale
X! .Ap
X! Set the multiplier for displayed line lengths etc.
X! This factor is multiplied by the actual length,
X! radius or diameter of the object currently
X! being drawn on the canvas.
X! It is useful for making scale drawings, where
X  e.g. 1 inch = 1 foot (userscale = 12.0) or 1cm = 1m (userscale = 100.0).

X! .At
X! .BR \-useru [ nit ]
X! .I units
X! .Ap
X! The
X! .I units
X! string is printed with the length information when drawing objects.
X! For example if the
X! .I userscale
X! = 1.0 and the
X! .I userunit
X! =
X! .I ft
X! then a line which is 3 inches long on the canvas would be displayed as
X! ``length = 3 ft'' when it is being drawn.
X! .IP
X! After
X! .I xfig
X! is started you may change the
X! .I userscale
X! and the
X! .I userunit
X! from a popup menu available by pressing mouse button 3 in the
X! .I units
X! box where the two rulers meet.
X  .SH "GRAPHICAL OBJECTS"
X! The objects in
X! .I xfig
X! are divided into
X! .B "primitive objects"
X! and
X! .BR "compound objects" .
X! The primitive objects are:
X! .IR ARC ,
X! .IR CIRCLE ,
X! .IR "CLOSED SPLINE" ,
X! .IR ELLIPSE ,
X! .IR POLYLINE ,
X! .IR POLYGON ,
X! .IR "ENCAPSULATED POSTSCRIPT" ,
X! .IR BOX ,
X! .IR ARC-BOX ,
X! .IR SPLINE ,
X! and
X! .IR TEXT .
X  .PP
X  A primitive object can be moved, rotated, flipped vertically or horizontally,
X  scaled, copied, aligned within a compound object or erased.
X! The
X! .I TEXT
X! primitive may not be flipped.
X  The attributes of any primitive object can be edited using a popup
X  panel (discussed below), so you can, for instance, set the position
X  of an object manually.
X  .PP
X! A compound object is composed of primitive objects.
X! The primitive objects
X! that constitute a compound can not be individually modified,
X! but they can be manipulated as an entity;
X! a compound can be moved, rotated, flipped
X! vertically or horizontally, scaled, copied or erased.
X! A compound that contains any boxes or arc-boxes
X! may only be rotated by 90 degrees.
X  .PP
X! Objects may overlap other objects according to their ``depth''.
X! Objects with larger depth number are obscured by objects with smaller depth.
X  .PP
X! .I Regular
X! polygons may be created using a special drawing mode, but a
X! general
X! .I POLYGON
X! is created as a result, which may then be modified, i.e.
X  the individual vertices may be moved if desired.
X  .SH "DISPLAY WINDOWS"
X! Ten regions comprise the display area of
X! .IR xfig :
X! the command region, top ruler, side ruler, drawing mode region,
X  editing mode region, filename region, message region,
X  mouse function indicator region and canvas region,
X  and indicator region with buttons to set and show current line thickness,

X  current figure and read the figure from the filename specified
X! in the \fIFilename\fP menu item \fIif any\fP, or the name
X! specified in the \fICurrent Filename\fP if the former is empty.
X  If there is a figure currently on the canvas and any modifications
X  have been made to it and not saved, a popup query
X  window will first appear asking if the user wishes to discard the current
X! figure or cancel the \fILoad\fP operation.

X  The current Export directory is updated to the current File directory when
X  Load is pressed.
X! 
X! A popup message window will appear and diagnostic messages will be written
X! if \fIxfig\fP changes any "illegal" object values to legal values.  For example,
X! older versions of \fIxfig\fP were lax about initializing unused parts such as
X! \fIdepth\fP, and would produce very large, random values.
X! \fIXfig\fP now will "clean up" bad values and inform you when it does so.
X! Also, if you read in an older file format, \fIxfig\fP will inform you that
X! it is converting it to the current format for that version of \fIxfig\fP.
