X  .SH "EDITING MODE PANEL COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS"
X  When a button in the editing mode panel is pressed, any
X  objects that may be affected by that editing operation will show their
X! corner markers.  Only those objects may be affected by the particular
X! edit mode.  In cases where two edit modes exist for one button, it
X  may be that the corner markers will appear for objects that may be
X  affected by one button but not the other.
X- 
X  .SH "SELECTING OBJECTS"
X  When multiple objects have points in common, e.g. two boxes that
X  touch at one corner, only one object can be selected by clicking on
X! that point. To select other objects, hold down the shift key while
X  pressing mouse button 1: the markers of one object will be
X! temporarily highlighted.  By repeatedly clicking mouse button 1 while
X  holding down the shift key, it is possible to cycle through all candidates for
X! selection at that point. To perform the selected action, e.g.
X! deleting one box, click on the point without holding down the
X! shift key.  The operation will be performed on the highlighted object.
X! 
X! \fBNote:\fP
X! If the mouse is not clicked near enough to an object marker or for whatever
X! reason \fIxfig\fP cannot "find" the object the user is trying to select,
X  a black square will temporarily appear above the mouse cursor.
X  .TP
X! .I GLUE COMPOUND
X  Compound objects are created by first tagging the objects to be compounded
X  and then pressing mouse button 3 to group the tagged
X! objects into a compound object.  Single objects are tagged by clicking
X! on them with mouse button 1.  A number of objects can be tagged at
X! once by using mouse button 2 to define the upper-left and
X! lower-right corners of a region enclosing the objects.
X  Tagged objects are shown with highlighted markers.
X! Tagged objects which are selected (see the SELECTING OBJECTS section above)
X  will be temporarily unhighlighted.
X  There is currently no special command to tag or untag all of the objects
X! within a figure.  You can untag all of the objects by changing from
X! GLUE mode to some other mode (apart from BREAK) and back again.
X  .TP
X! .I BREAK COMPOUND
X  Break a compound object to allow manipulation of its component parts.
X  Click mouse button 1 on one of the corner markers of the compound
X  object or along one of the imaginary lines defining the compound box.
X  Clicking with mouse button 2 will achieve the same effect
X  but will also tag the component parts (although you will not see the
X! tags until you change to the GLUE mode).  You can use this feature
X! to easily alter the objects within a compound.
X  .TP
X! .I SCALE OBJECT
X! Any object may be scaled.  If mouse button 1 is pressed on a
X! \fIBOX\fP or \fIARC-BOX\fP object, then that object will be scaled
X! proportionally to its aspect ratio.  If mouse button 2 is pressed
X! on any object, that object will be scaled up or down about its center.
X! Text may only be scaled if inside a compound object and then only if
X! its \fIRIGID\fP flag is set to \fINORMAL\fP (using the popup edit panel).
X! See the \fITransFig\fP manual for description of text options.
X  .TP
X  .I ALIGN
X! Align objects.  Click mouse button 1 to align objects inside a compound object
X  or mouse button 2 to align all objects on canvas according to the
X! setting in the \fIVERTICAL ALIGN\fP and \fIHORIZONTAL ALIGN\fP indicators.
X! The choices are the cumulative effect of vertically aligning the objects
X! to the \fITOP\fP, \fIMIDDL\fPE or \fIBOTTO\fPM edge and horizontally aligning
X! to the \fILEF\fPT, \fIMIDDL\fPE or \fIRIGH\fPT edge of the compound.
X  .TP
X! .I MOVE POINT
X! Modify the position of a point of any object except \fITEXT\fP and
X! \fICOMPOUND\fP objects.
X  For unrestrained movement, click mouse button 1 over the desired
X! point, reposition the point, and click the \fIleft\fP button again.
X  For horizontally or vertically constrained move, click mouse button 2
X  on the desired point and move either horizontally or vertically.
X! Notice that once you choose the direction (horizontal or vertical), movement
X! is constrained in that direction.  If, after moving the mouse initially, it
X  is moved in the other direction a greater distance than the current position
X  of the mouse relative to the starting point, then that will be the new
X! constraint direction.  In otherwords if you first move the mouse
X! \fIhorizontally\fP one inch (say) then move it \fIvertically\fP
X! 1.3 inches, the direction will switch to \fIvertical\fP until any
X! \fIhorizontal\fP motion exceeds 1.3 inches.
X  When the object is positioned where desired, click mouse button 1 to
X  place it if that button was used to start the move (unconstrained),
X  or mouse button 2 (constrained) if that button was used.
X  .TP
X  .I MOVE
X! Move object.  Click mouse button 1 (unconstrained move) or mouse button 2
X  (constrained move) on any corner marker of the object to be moved.
X  The horizontal/vertical constrained movement (mouse button 2) works
X! exactly as described for \fIMOVE POINT\fP.
