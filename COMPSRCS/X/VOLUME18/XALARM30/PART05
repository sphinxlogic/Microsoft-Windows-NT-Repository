.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I xalarm 
is an interactive alarm clock for the
.I X(1) Window System,
and is analogous to a combination of
.I leave(1)
and
.I calendar(1),
but much more powerful.  You can set the alarm either on the command line
or by using the popup window.  At the appropriate time and date,
.I xalarm
pops up a window to tell you that your time is up.  The time the alarm is to
trigger may be a specific time or a time for
.I xalarm
to wait before triggering.  The date may be a specific date or a number of days
in the future.
X
You can tell 
.I xalarm
to pop up warning windows at specified times before the alarm is to trigger,
in order to warn you of the impending triggering of the alarm, and specify
what message you want the alarm to display.
X
You can also make
.I xalarm
read alarm times and dates, along with the message to display in the alarm,
from alarm files.  This can be done once by
.I xalarm,
or you can make it read from the file periodically, as an
.I xalarm
daemon.  This enables you to forget your regular or important appointments, but
.I xalarm
will tell you by popping up at the appropriate time.
X
In the event that the current
.I X
session is terminated before
.I xalarm
has finished,
.I xalarm
saves its alarm (if it is not already in the alarm file) so that it will
automatically be restarted the next time
.I xalarm
is invoked.  Any daemons connected to the display will go away.
X
This means that you can set an alarm even if you are likely to terminate the
.I X
session underwhich you are currently running before it triggers, and the alarm
will still trigger on whatever display you are then connected to at the time.
X
The alarm window itself consists of a box of buttons and an area containing
the alarm message.  To give you an opportunity to carry on after the alarm has
triggered and be late anyway,
.I xalarm
allows you to snooze the alarm.  For the completely absent-minded,
.I xalarm
can also repeatedly re-trigger after a specified interval.
X
To help with setting the alarm, each popup displays the current time, and the
alarm itself also displays the time since the alarm last triggered.
.SH "USING XALARM TO SET AN ALARM"
If no alarm time is specified,
.I xalarm
will pop up a window in order for an alarm time to be entered.
X
This form is suitable for inclusion as a menu option under a window manager.
X
The window is also popped up if an invalid alarm or warning time is given
(see below for date and time syntax), or if you specify that confirmation
should be sought before setting the alarm.
X
The window gives you an opportunity to change the alarm setting, warning times,
and the message
.I xalarm
will display when the alarm is triggered.
X
The popup resizes itself to
edit any message larger than the space given by default.  The keymap used by
the Athena Dialog widget is modelled on the text buffer keymap of the
editor/environment
.I emacs(1).
Text may be entered when the pointer is anywhere within the popup.
X
This popup window comprises of four separate windows, dealing with the alarm
time, date, the warning time(s) and confirmation of all the settings (where you
can also re-edit the alarm message).
X
If the confirmation window is popped up, then you can re-edit the alarm time,
date, or warning time(s) by switching through the windows using the
.I edit
buttons.  Confirmation of a window's settings is made using the
.I enter
buttons, and the translations resource is set so that the
.I return
key will do the same thing.
X
XFrom the confirmation window you can also save the alarm settings in your own
alarm file.  You can make
.I xalarm
read alarms from this alarm file.
X
If confirmation is not enabled, then the window for confirmation of all
settings will not be popped up even if the other windows are.
X
Also see the examples section.
.SH "USING XALARM TO READ AN ALARM FILE"
You can put alarms in alarm files.
.I xalarm
looks in
.I ~/.xalarms
and all the files in the colon separated list of files in the environment
variable
.I XALARMFILEPATH.
X
This form is suitable for
inclusion in your
.I X
start up or initialisation  script.  It is suited to those who start up
.I X
on a regular (eg. daily) basis.
X
Each line in the file should consist of an optional date on which the alarm is
to trigger, optionally followed the by time and/or message.  If the time and/or
date are/is specified, then they must be separated from the date by a `-' on
its own.  If both the time and message are given, the time must come first.
X
If no date is specified, it is assumed to be today.  If no time is specified,
the alarm will trigger at the current time on whatever date is given.
X
The format for entries in an alarm file is therefore:
.PP
.nf
X				\fIdate [- [time] [message]]\fP
X	or
X				\fI      - [time] [message]\fP
.fi
X
To make it easier to put entries into the alarm file,
.I xalarm
can create them for you.  You can save settings by pressing the
.I save
button in the confirmation window when you have set the alarm that you want.
The settings are saved in the alarm file
.I ~/.xalarms.
X
You can use
.I XALARMFILEPATH
to include alarms shared among a number of people.  If a path in the list is
not absolute, then it is assumed to be relative to your home directory.
X
Blank lines and any line with `#' or `!' as the first character are ignored.
This can be used to structure and comment the alarm file.
X
All other command line options and resources still apply.  See below for the
date and time formats.  Also see the examples section.
.SH "USING A DAEMON TO READ AN ALARM FILE"
An alternative to using the file option to search for alarms within a certain
date, is to use an
.I xalarm
daemon.
X
This form is suitable for
inclusion in your
.I X
start up or initialisation  script.  It is suited to those whose
.I X
sessions typically span days.
X
The daemon behaves in the same way as invoking
.I xalarm
with the file option, except that it periodically attempts to scan the alarm
file(s).  The interval between scanning may be a date in the form of
.I +days,
or one of the special symbols
.I daily
(equivalent to
.I +1)
or
.I weekly.
See below for more on date formats.
X
Once started, the daemon immediately reads the alarm file(s), starting those
alarms which are within the date given.  It then sleeps until the number of
days given ahead (on the following Sunday if given as
.I weekly)
at just passed midnight before trying again, ad infinitum.  The daemon dies
when the connection to the display is lost.
X
Note that any
.I xalarm
processes that the daemon invokes will try to connect to the same display each
time.  If you move displays,
.I xalarm
cannot know.
X
Also see the examples section.
.SH "TIMES"
The definition is that for times given with 3 or 4 digits, the last 2 digits
are always assumed to be minutes.
X
Absolute times may be suffixed with `am' or `pm', and are assumed to be in
hours if given with 1 or 2 digits.
X
Times relative to the present time must be prefixed by `+', and are assumed to
be in minutes if given with 1 or 2 digits.
X
The special symbols
.I now
and
.I noon
may also be used, and are equivalent to
.I +0
and
.I 12:00,
respectively.  Hours and minutes may be separated with `:', `.' or `-'.
X
To prevent ambiguities, hours and minutes must be in their usual ranges.  If a
time of an hour or more is wanted, you must state it in hours and minutes.  It
is not possible to specify days in the time.
X
The format is a super-set (by far) of the format recognised by
.I leave(1).
X
Also see the examples section.
.SH "DATES"
The date may be in the form of that given by
.I date(1)
(day of week, day of month, month, year), but can be in any order, need not be
completely specified, and case is not significant.
.I xalarm
attempts to find the nearest real date which matches the date given.
X
Alternatively, the date may be specified as the number of whole days into the
future, by prefixing the number with `+'.  The special symbols
.I today, tomorrow
and
.I week
may also be used, and these symbols may be combined.  They are equivalent to
.I +0, +1
and
.I +7,
respectively.
X
Note that if there is more than one word in the date, then the date must be
quoted to stop the shell treating them as separate arguments.
X
When given as an argument to the
.I -date
option,
.I week
means ``seven days into the future''.  However, when it is used as an argument
to the
.I -file
or
.I -daemon
options, it means ``until the end of the current week'' (up to and including
the coming Sunday), as in
.I weekly.
This is to make it easier to get
.I xalarm
to set all the alarms for the current week.
X
Because the alarm is set in milliseconds, you cannot set an alarm for more than
49 days into the future (on the assumption that your machine has 32-bit
unsigned longs).
X
All symbols must consist of at least the first 3 characters of the name.
Unlike
.I calendar(1), tomorrow
always means tomorrow.
X
Also see the examples section.
.SH "WARNINGS"
When given, warnings are popped up at specified times before the alarm.  You
can also specify that a number of words from the alarm message should be
displayed with any warnings, in case you've forgotten what you set it for.  If
none are to be used, the warning will only indicate when the alarm is due.
X
Also see the examples section.
.SH "RINGING"
You can specify how
.I xalarm
announces itself, when either a warning or the alarm is popped up.  Each of
these events has a separate resource, which can be one of the special symbols
.I bell, beep
and
.I quiet,
or a shell script.
X
The first two cause the terminal bell to be rung, and
.I quiet
does nothing.  Otherwise it is assumed to be a shell script and is executed
under a Bourne shell
.I (sh(1)).
You can also control the volume at which the terminal bell is rung.
X
Note that if the script contains more than one word then the whole script must
be quoted to stop the shell treating them as separate arguments.
X
Also see the examples section.
.SH "SNOOZING AND PESTERING"
You can snooze the alarm and make it pester you, after the alarm has triggered.
X
Snoozing is done by selecting a time to snooze using the
.I +mins
buttons (they can be pressed as often as necessary) and pressing the 
.I snooze
button.  The snooze time may be zeroed by clicking on the
.I snoozetime
button (it has these two functions; display and zero).  For the really lazy,
the initial value of
.I snoozetime
can be set either by the relevant command line option or by its resource.
X
Pestering is done either by the relevant command line option or by its
resource.  The alarm will then re-popup after the specified interval, a bit
like
.I snooze
on autopilot.
X
Note that if you snooze the alarm, pestering is temporarily disabled and you
will have to rely on the snoozed alarm.
X
Also see the examples section.
.SH "MORE ON XALARM"
Even after you have set the alarm and confirmed it, you can reset the alarm
as long as you know the
.I xalarm
process number.  This can be found by using the
command line option to list process numbers, or
.I ps(1).
X
.I xalarm
makes maximum use of resources, as well as having a number of command
line options, and these can be used to control most of the appearance of
.I xalarm
and (just about) all of its behaviour.  Both command line options and useful
resources are listed below.
X
When
.I xalarm
is invoked it immediately attempts to fork off a child and exit itself, leaving
the child to continue with the alarm.  The child disappears when the
.I X
session on which display 
.I xalarm
is using is terminated.
X
You can exit from
.I xalarm
at any time by pressing the available
.I quit
button.
.SH "XMEMO, XFORTUNE & XYOW"
X
In reality,
.I xmemo
is just a front end to
.I xalarm
(implemented as
.I xalarm -time now -date today),
while
.I xfortune
and
.I xyow
are front ends to
.I xmemo
(implemented as
.I xmemo \fI"\fP`fortune`\fI"\fP
etc.).
Options supplied to them on the command line still override these defaults,
however.
.PP
Note that
.I xfortune
and
.I xyow
require
.I fortune(6)
and
.I yow(6)
respectively -
.I yow(6)
comes with
.I emacs(1).
Also note that since they are front ends to
.I xmemo,
you can actually give extra message text to include on the command line.  If
you specify a time in the future, you can edit the message text when asked to
confirm (if enabled).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.I xalarm
accepts all of the standard
.I X
Toolkit command line options along with the additional options listed below:
.TP 8
.B \-help
Print a (possibly) helpful usage message.
.TP 8
.B \-version
Print out the version number of
.I xalarm
in the form
.I version.patchlevel.
.TP 8
.B -restart[only]
This option makes
.I xalarm
attempt only to restart those alarms which had not finished when a previous
.I X
session was terminated.
.TP 8
.B \-kill \fIpid|all\fP
This option sends a signal to the process number
.I pid,
or to all
.I xalarm
processes, on the current host.  If the process is an
.I xalarm,
owned by you, it will exit.  Note these are what
.I ps(1)
thinks are
.I xalarm
processes, and only on the current host.
.TP 8
.B \-d[a]emon \fI+days|daily|weekly\fP
This option starts a new
.I xalarm
daemon on the current host connected to the current display.  See the above
description for more on alarm files, dates and daemons.
.TP 8
.B \-f[ile] \fI+days|date|today|tomorrow|weekly\fP
This option makes
.I xalarm
read alarms from the alarm file(s).  See the above description for more on the
alarm file and dates.
.TP 8
.B \-date \fI+days|date|today|tomorrow|week\fP
This option indicates the date on which the alarm is to be triggered.  See the
above description for more on dates.
.TP 8
.B \-t[ime] \fI+time|time|now|noon\fP
This option indicates at what time the alarm is to be triggered.  See the above
description for more on times.
.TP 8
.B \-w[arn] \fItime[,time...]\fP
Indicate the time(s) before the alarm is due to trigger when a warning should
be given.  They need not be in any particular order, and should be in the same
format as relative times, but without the preceding `+'.  Note that multiple
times must be separated by commas but without spaces.
.TP 8
.B \-c[onfirm]
This option overrides the resource value and forces
.I xalarm
to ask for confirmation, unless the alarm is due to trigger immediately.
.TP 8
.B \-warnwords [\-ww] \fInumber_of_words\fP
Indicate the number of words from the alarm message you wish to display with
the warning.
.TP 8
.B \-l[ist]
List the process numbers of any
.I xalarm
processes running on the current host.  Note that this lists what
.I ps(1)
thinks are
.I xalarm
processes, and only on the current host.
.TP 8
.B \-r[eset] \fIpid|all\fP
This option sends a signal to the process number
.I pid,
or to all
.I xalarm
processes, on the current host.  If the process is an
.I xalarm,
owned by you, it will pop up the confirmation window to allow you to re-edit
the alarm settings.  If the process is an
.I xalarm
daemon, it will have no effect.  Note these are what
.I ps(1)
thinks are
.I xalarm
processes, and only on the current host.
.TP 8
.B \-p[ester] \fItime\fP
Indicate the time that
.I xalarm
should wait before re-triggering.  It should be in the same format as relative
times, but without the preceding `+'.
.TP 8
.B \-s[nooze] \fItime\fP
Indicate the time that
.I snoozetime
should initially have when the alarm triggers.  It should be in the same format
as relative times, but without the preceding `+'.
.TP 8
.B \-alarmaudio [\-aa] \fIbell|beep|quiet|shell script\fP
The method by which
.I xalarm
should announce the fact that the alarm has been triggered.  See above for a
description on the different options.
.TP 8
.B \-warningaudio [\-wa] \fIbell|beep|quiet|shell script\fP
As above, but for when any warning windows are popped up.
.TP 8
.B \-q[uiet]
This is equivalent to specifying
.I -alarmaudio quiet -warningaudio quiet,
or setting the relevant resources to
.I quiet.
.TP 8
.B \-v[olume] \fIpercentage\fP
The percentage of full volume at which the terminal bell should ring, if it is
rung.  This currently applies to the terminal bell only.
.TP 8
.B \-nowarn [\-nw]
This option overrides the resource value and forces
.I xalarm
not to give any warnings.  This is the same as setting the warning times
resource to the empty string.
.TP 8
.B \-noconfirm [\-nc]
This option overrides the resource value and forces
.I xalarm
not to ask for confirmation.
.TP 8
.B \-nowarnwords [\-nww]
This option overrides the resource value and forces
.I xalarm
not to display any of the alarm text with any warnings.  This is the same
as setting the warningwords resource to zero.
.TP 8
.B \-nopester [\-np]
This option overrides the resource value and forces
.I xalarm
not to re-trigger the alarm once it has popped up.  This is the same as setting
the pester resource to zero.
.TP 8
.B \-noalarmaudio [\-naa] \-nowarningaudio [\-nwa]
These options make the relevant resource values
.I quiet,
and are equivalent to setting the audio method to
.I quiet.
.TP 8
.B \fImessage_text\fP
The remaining unrecognised text is used as the message displayed with the
triggering of the alarm.  Note that each separate argument is assumed to be a
single line, so words must be quoted if they are to appear on the same line.
For example:
.TP 8
X			% \fBxalarm "On one line" Secondline "Third line"\fP
X
It is a good idea always to use quotes, even when a line is only one word.
Newlines within arguments are recognised, so that input from other tools can be
used:
.TP 8
X			% \fBxalarm -time now "`fortune -l`"\fP
X
Also note that 
.I xalarm
deletes its copy of any arguments, including any message, given on the command
line, so your boss can't see them by looking at the
.I xalarm
process.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
An entry in an
.I X
initialisation file, invoked along with all the other utilities, before the
window manager is executed, making
.I xalarm
check the alarm file for today's appointments, asking for confirmation before
each of the alarms are set, and using up to three words from the alarm message
in any warning message:
.PP
.nf
X	xclock &
X	xbiff &
X	xalarm -file today -confirm -warnwords 3
X	exec twm
.fi
X
If you do not want to know about the alarms that remain from the previous
.I X
session, you could first restart them silently.  Here they are restarted with
warnings set at 15 and 30 minutes prior to each alarm's triggering.
X
To check the week's appointments, including some shared alarm files, warning 1
hour, and 30 and 15 minutes before each alarm (if you set the variable in your
.I X
initialisation script, rather than your login script, you may need to export
it):
.PP
.nf
X	XALARMFILEPATH=\\
X		/usr/local/lib/seminars.xlm:/usr/local/lib/meetings.xlm
X	export XALARMFILEPATH
X	xalarm -restartonly -noconfirm -warn 15,30
X	xalarm -file weekly -confirm -warn 1:00,30,15
.fi
X
Or to start an
.I xalarm
daemon, which is to scan the alarm file on a daily basis.  Each alarm should
not ask for confirmation, but should give warnings 30 and 15 minutes before
triggering, and pester every 5 minutes thereafter:
.PP
.nf
X	xalarm -daemon daily -noconfirm -warn 15,30 -pester 5
.fi
X
The alarm file might contain, for example, the lines:
X
.nf
X	# This is just a comment.
X	! So is this.  Format is: \fIdate [- [time] [message]]\fP
X	!                     or: \fI      - [time] [message]\fP
X
X	Wednesday - 12:30pm Football !!!
X	Sun 29 september - 9pm Drag yourself home.
X	Oct 4 - Contrib sometime today...
.fi
X
So that every Wednesday I have an alarm set for 12:30pm; on Sunday September 29
there is an alarm to be set for 9pm; on October 4 the alarm is to trigger
straight away.
.PP
A
.I twm(1)
window manger entry which forces
.I xalarm
to ask for confirmation, and have the triggered alarm re-trigger every 5
minutes:
.PP
.nf
X	Menu "Utilities" {
X		...
X		"alarm":	f.exec "xalarm -confirm -pester 5 &"
X		...
X	}
.fi
.PP
X
The following examples show how to set the alarm from the command line.  It is
often more convenient to invoke
.I xalarm
without specifying the time and, where necessary, the date and/or message as
arguments (using a window manager, say, as above), using the popup window to
enter these options.
X
If this was the method of entry, the option arguments would be entered in the
relevant Dialog box instead, just as they appear below (except that there is no
need to quote multi-word arguments).
X
To only restart those
.I xalarm
processes that were set before a previous
.I X
session was terminated, not including those in the alarm file:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxalarm -restartonly\fR
.PP
To set an alarm for tomorrow at noon, so as to avoid missing yet another
meeting:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxalarm -date tomorrow -time noon "MEETING!!!"\fR
.PP
To set an alarm on Tuesday week (that is one week on from the next Tuesday) at
3:30 in the afternoon:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxalarm -date "Tues week" -time 3-30pm\fR
.PP
To set an alarm for March 10th (my very own personal public holiday),
first thing in the morning, just in case I have forgotten:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxalarm -date "10 march" -time 9am "Birthday boy!"\fR
.PP
To set an alarm for 5 o'clock in the evening without confirmation, with the
snooze time initially 10 minutes, but with the default alarm message:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxalarm -time 5pm -snooze 10 -noconfirm\fR
.PP
To set an alarm for 2 hours in advance, warning 1 minute and 5 minutes before it,
with a message other than the default:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxalarm -time +2.00 -warn 5,1 "Get off your bottom"\fR
.PP
To set a completely silent alarm for 4.30 (not specifying am/pm, so it is
whichever is first), with the default warnings and a message other than the
default:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxalarm -quiet -time 4:30 "Time to sneak off home!"\fR
.PP
To reset a running
.I xalarm
we first find out its process number, and then we can reset it:
.nf
X
X	% \fBxalarm -list\fR
X	xalarms: 12345 12321
X	% \fBxalarm -reset 12345\fR
X
.fi
To put a 2 line message on the display
.I foo
immediately (this will only work if the display
.I foo
can be opened):
.TP 8
X	% \fBxmemo -display foo:0.0 "Bob!" "The bar for lunch?"\fR
.PP
To display a fortune (a random adage from hell) at a specific geometry in 5
minutes:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxfortune -geometry +10+300 -time +5\fR
.PP
To display a Zippy quote (yow!!!), characteristically harassing you every
minute and making some noise each time it triggers by executing a shell script:
.TP 8
X	% \fBxyow -pester 1 -alarmaudio "play -v30 yow.au"\fR
.PP
In this example,
.I -v30
is the option to make
.I play
play the audio data in the file
.I yow.au
at maximum volume.
.SH "WIDGET HIERARCHY"
.PP
.I xalarm
uses the Athena Widget set, and the widget hierarchy is as follows:
.PP
.nf
X	XAlarm (applicationShell)
X		Alarm! (transientShell)
X			alarm (form)
X				buttons (form)
X					quit (command)

.SH "TOOLKIT OPTIONS"
The following standard
.I X
Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used with 
.I xalarm:
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the
.I X
server to contact.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fP
This option specifies the preferred size and position of
.I xalarm.
It is a little meaningless to specify a size; it is as large as need be.
.TP 8
.B \-xrm \fIresourcestring\fP
This option specifies a resource string to be used.  This is especially
useful for setting resources that do not have separate command line options.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
.TP 8
.B XALARMFILEPATH
a colon separated list of file names to be used in conjunction with
.I ~/.xalarms
for
.I xalarm
to look for alarms to set.
.TP 8
.B HOME
The user's home directory.  This may be used by
.I xalarm
when looking for the user's alarm file.
.SH "FILES"
.TP 8
.B ~/.xalarms
The name of the alarm file looked at by
.I xalarm 
for alarms to set and where alarms are saved.  See also the environment
variable
.I XALARMFILEPATH.
.TP 8
.B ~/.xalarms.died
The name of the alarm file where
.I xalarm
stores its alarm which had not finished when the
.I X
session under which it was running was terminated.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
XX(1),

.SH "BUGS"
.TP 8
.B Preamble:
Because of the way
.I xalarm
has evolved (it started as a 24-hour period one-off alarm clock), its dealing
with dates, alarm files and the interface to these is not ideal.  Nobody said
evolution was perfect.
X
If you want to report a bug, or anything else, please first give as much
information as you can.  See
.I COMMENTS
at the end of the manual.
.TP 8
.B General:
Each alarm is a separate, forked,
.I xalarm
process, each with its own connection to the display.  There is no way to get
.I xalarm
to set more than one alarm or to display on several displays at once.
X
Because
.I xalarm
is one of those clients you tend to start from a window manager or from an
.I X
initialisation script, you may not see error messages that these
.I xalarm
processes write to standard error.  You will only see them if this output also
goes to, or is redirected to, your display.
X
If your shell initialisation script does any output,
.I xalarm
may get confused when trying to list other
.I xalarm
processes (and therefore also when killing or resetting all
.I xalarm
processes).
.TP 8
.B Daemons:
If you terminate the session which an
.I xalarm
daemon is running under, the daemon does not exit until just before it re-tries
to start new alarms from the alarm file.  It is possible, but unlikely, that
someone else may have got your particular display connection (not physical
display) in the meantime.
.I xalarm
cannot know when this happens.
X
It would be nice to be able to tell daemon and normal
.I xalarm
processes apart when listing them.
.TP 8
.B Saving to file:
The date saved in the alarm file is the exact date the alarm would trigger, not
the date specified in the date input popup window.  Both types of behaviour have
their advantages, but only this behaviour is implemented.
X
The same happens with those alarms that are saved when the
.I X
session under which they are running is terminated.  This type of behaviour
does seem more useful than the alternative.
X
Currently does not satisfactorily save alarms with multi-line messages.
.TP 8
.B Restarting:
Because uncompleted alarms are saved in the same format as the alarm file
format, the resource environment of restarted alarms is inherited from the
.I xalarm
which restarted them.  This is not necessarily the same as the original
resource environments of these alarms.
.TP 8
.B Times & Dates:
.I xalarm
is at the mercy of the system clock.
X
The message informing at what time
.I xalarm
is to trigger may appear to be wrong if the clocks go forwards or backwards
between the present and the time it is due to trigger.
X
If the time is relative to the present and confirmation is sought, the alarm
and warnings are set from when the time is confirmed, not from when
.I xalarm
was invoked.
X
Date and symbol names are recognised by the first three characters only, the
rest are ignored.  This is why
.I week
and
.I weekly
are equivalent, and
.I midday
and
.I midnight
are not implemented.  There is no real wild carding within dates.
X
You can only set an alarm that will trigger within the next 49 days (on the
assumption that your machine has 32-bit unsigned longs).
.TP 8
.B Editing:
The dialog box uses a subset of the
.I emacs(1)
editor/environment keymap for text buffers (which is certainly not a bug!).
X
However, the 
.I return
key event is translated by default into the
.I confirm
button event, as it is translated similarly in the alarm time and warning
dialog boxes.
To insert a newline, use
.I ctrl-m
(since under
.I emacs(1)
the
.I return
key is a synonym for
.I ctrl-m,
under
.I X
they generate different events), or just change the relevant resource(s) so
that
.I return
produces the desired effect.  The resources, followed by the necessary value,
are:
.TP 8
X	XAlarm.When?.time.value.translations
X	XAlarm.When?.date.value.translations
X	XAlarm.When?.warnings.value.translations
X	XAlarm.When?.confirm.value.translations
X
X				#override <Key>Return: newline()
.TP 8
.B Resetting & Killing:
Signalling is implemented very simply, and if the process signalled is not an
.I xalarm,
strange things may occur.  Usually, nothing will happen.
X
However, killing does not use the
.I KILL
signal, and is therefore relatively safe to use even though your
.I ps(1)
can never be 100% reliable.
X
Still, this can mean that when you reset or kill all
.I xalarm
processes, not all will have been signalled.
.TP 8
.B Input:
Doesn't take input from a pipe etc.
.TP 8
.B Audio:
Doesn't parse the alarm or warning message to produce voice output(!)

.SH "CONTRIBERS"
A lot of people have put in effort for
.I xalarm
since it was first released in the summer of 1991; testing, suggesting,
commenting, cajoling and even fixing, in all the areas that software
development entails.  Not all will have been mentioned below, but thanks for
your input.
X
Big thanks yet again have to go to Gisle Hannemyr, Norsk Regnsesentral (NCC), J
Braham Levy, UDSP Lab, University of Keele and Ex-Tek Associates (UK), and
Stefan Haenssgen, Informatik Rechnerabteilung, University of Karlsruhe, for
their help with ideas, comments and code, in the making of
.I xalarm
version 3.03.  Thanks also to Paul Moore for his help in porting
.I xalarm
for version 3.04.
X
For getting version 3 from version 2 in the first place, thanks have to go to
Bill Leonard, Harris Computer Systems Division, Florida, for harassing me with
suggestions for improvements to make
.I xalarm
version 3 a useful tool and this manual page easier to understand, and Andreas
Stolcke, International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, for his help
fixing code.  Without both, xalarm would still be pretty much as version 2.
X
Thanks also to J Braham Levy, Stefan Haenssgen, Jamie Zawinski, Jason Venner
and Kimmo Suominen for their help with version 3.
X
For their help and suggestions with
.I xalarm
"over the years", I would also like to thank (in no real order) Steve Aronson,
Dave Brooks, Reiner Hammer, Jay Lawlor, Janet Anstett, Gordon Freedman,
Francois-Regis Colin and Jeffrey Mast.  If I've missed anyone, sorry.

.SH "COMMENTS"
I'd welcome any; comments, suggestions, code, bug reports and fixes, etc.
Don't forget to include which version of
