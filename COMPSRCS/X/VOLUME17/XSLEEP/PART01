There may be some other way to do this, but....

Xsleep opens up an X connection, sleeps for the specified number of
seconds, and then closes the connection and exits.

Why do something so silly?  Well I'll tell you.  It's because many X
servers reset themselves when they have no connections.  This is a
pain when you're starting up a session, because you do an xset, an
xrdb, an xmodmap, etc., and between each one the server resets itself.
So to prevent this, do an xsleep first, then your initializations,
then start up your real clients.
