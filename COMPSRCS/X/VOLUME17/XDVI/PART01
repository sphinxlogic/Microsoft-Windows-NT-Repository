XINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
X
XTo install, do the following:
X    1.	Read the ENVIRONMENT section of xdvi_man.sed to determine the correct
X	default values for the XDVIFONTS and XDVISIZES environment variables.
X	Edit the Imakefile or Makefile and change the values of the make
X	variables DEFAULT_FONT_PATH and DEFAULT_FONT_SIZES to these values.
X	If your site uses virtual fonts, do the same thing with the
X	DEFAULT_VF_PATH variable.  Note that support of virtual fonts in xdvi
X	does not include support of built-in Postscript<tm> fonts.
X
X	(Note:  for X10 compilation, use Makefile_10 instead of Makefile.)
X
X	You may also wish to change other compilation options; they are
X	described later in this file.
X
X    2.  make xdvi and try it out.  If the settings in step one are incorrect,
X	you can use the corresponding environment variables to quickly try out
X	different values.  If the values set in step 1 were incorrect,
X	rm font_open.o and go back to step 1.
X
X	If you get the error that the #include file <stdlib.h> does not exist,
X	then you should include -DX_NOT_STDC_ENV in the DEFS variable in the
X	Makefile or Imakefile.  In X11R5 or later this problem should not
X	come up.
X
X    3.  make xdvi.man.
X
X    4.  Install xdvi and xdvi.man.
X
X
X	The X10 flag only affects xdvi.c (and the flags MSBITFIRST, BMSHORT,
X	and BMLONG, see below).
X
X	Note in particular the compilation flags USE_PK, USE_GF, and USE_PXL,
X	which can be set to reflect which font formats are actually used at
X	your site.
X
XOther compilation flags are:
X	SYSV		(dvi_init.c font_open.c xdvi.c)  Set for System V
X			compilation.
X	VMS		Set for VMS compilation.
X	MSBITFIRST	(X11 only; xdvi.c dvi_draw.c gf.c pk.c pxl.c)  Store
X			bitmaps internally with the most significant bit at
X			the left.  For performance reasons, it would be best
X			to set this to coincide with what your server uses.
X			Use the keystroke '^P' to find information in this
X			regard.  Generally, you should use MSBITFIRST if and
X			only if '^P' reports bitord = 1, and BMSHORT/BMLONG
X			(below) should be set to match whatever '^P' reports
X			under "Unit =".  But, if bitord = byteord, then the
X			latter setting should not matter much.
X	BMSHORT		(X11 only; xdvi.c dvi_draw.c gf.c pk.c pxl.c)  Store
X			bitmaps in short integers instead of bytes.  See
X			MSBITFIRST for other relevant comments.  To check
X			performance, you can use:
X				time xdvi -d 8 file.dvi
X	BMLONG		(X11 only; xdvi.c dvi_draw.c gf.c pk.c pxl.c)  Store
X			bitmaps in long integers instead of bytes.
X	ALTFONT		(xdvi.c)  Default font to use if the font named in the
X			dvi file cannot be found.  Can be set to NULL.  By
X			default, it is "cmr10".
X	SEARCH_SUBDIRECTORIES (font_open.c)  Enable recursive searching of
X			subdirectories for font files (* and ** specifiers).
X			This also enables the TEXFONTS_SUBDIR environment
X			variable and the DEFAULT_SUBDIR_PATH makefile variable.
X	XDVIFONTS_ONLY	(font_open.c) Never check the TEXFONTS environment
X			variable.  Normally xdvi checks TEXFONTS if the
X			XDVIFONTS variable is not set.  This option is
X			recommended if the version of TeX in use requires
X			that the TEXFONTS variable be set.  See the relevant
X			paragraph in xdvi_man.sed for more details.  This
X			option turns off that paragraph.
X	NOTOOL		(X11 only; xdvi.c)  Compile using raw X calls.
X	BUTTONS		(xdvi.c)  Put radio buttons on the right side of the
X			window for commonly used commands.
X	A4		(xdvi.c)  Use European size paper by default.
X	NOQUERY		(xdvi.c)  Set this if you have trouble compiling the
X			definition of drawingWidgetClass.
X
XAll flags should be set in the appropriate Makefile via the variable ``DEFS''.

XNotes of historical nature follow.  Most recent changes are listed at the end
Xof the file.
X
X================================================================
X
XThis directory contains a version of xdvi capable of reading GF, PXL
Xand PK font files. This version of xdvi is based on the source that
X"came with" X v10r3. Xdvi was modified by Paal Kvamme at the Norwegian
XInstitute of Technology, based on the modifications I had made to
Xdviimp (a dvi to ImPress converter). This code was again more or less
Xdirectly translated from the web source of PKtoPX.
X
XIf you discover (and fix) any bugs in this code, please notify me, so
XI can make the corresponding changes myself.

XAdditional notes:
X	X11 version now works on the IBM PC/RT as well as VAX.
X			[eichin:19880313.1330EST]
X================================================================
X*MORE* fixes (for athena release locker) [eichin:19880722.2058EST]
XFixes:
X	narrow vertical and horizontal lines no longer disappear.
X	bogus underlining (which usually occured on even sample sizes
Xof odd sized characters) no longer occurs.
X	-S number (or typing number followed by S) will adjust the
Xsampling fraction; 0 is special cased to mean if anything in the
Xsampled zone is set, set the sample, else clear it. Interesting to
Xexperiment with, though not useful for reading (the default value of 3
Xis just right.)
X	-display and -geometry arguments work (so do old style forms,
Xthough they were broken before)
X	fixed one of the PK debugging messages to print the correct
Xfont name instead of printing the pointer as text.
X	included Ken Raeburn <raeburn>'s changes to support multiple
Xscreens.
X================================================================
XMore changes:
X
X    1.  Incorporated the bitmap under a viewport widget using the toolkit
X	(X11 only);
X    2.  Added an icon and icon geometry arguments (X11 only);
X    3.  Supported window resizing;
X    4.  Added a 'c' option to move whatever is currently under the cursor to
X	the center of the window;
X    5.  Added an 'R' option to reread the .dvi file, and added logic to make
X	'R' happen automatically whenever any part of the window is exposed
X	and the dvi file changes (so that you can iconify xdvi, run tex,
X	deiconify xdvi, and voila!);
X    6.  Added a 'magnifying glass':  when you push a button, a window pops
X	up, showing the region of the page, unshrunk;
X    7.  Added support for gf fonts;
X    8.  Upgraded font searching (at our site we use /usr/custom/tex82/gf
X	for gf fonts, /usr/custom/tex82/pk for pk fonts, etc.);
X    9.  Made numerous internal changes (removed all the lint I could,
X	made unshrunk bitmaps permanently resident, which speeds up size
X	changing, made table.h necessary only for pxl.h, split up the source
X	file into xdvi.c, dvi.c, gf.c, pxl.c, and pk.c, made shrinking occur
X	relative to the character's hot point, etc.)
X   10.  The program reads SIGIO signals and processes incoming events
X	immediately, so that it can stop displaying things that would be
X	erased anyway.  If these interrupts are not coming through, then
X	it also checks for incoming events every several dozen characters
X	displayed.
X   11.  Further split up dvi.c into dvi_init.c and dvi_draw.c; added
X	compilation options for various internal bitmap representations.
X	Fixed it so gcc won't give warnings, and so it works with R3 toolkit.
X--  Patchlevel 2:  --
X   12.  Added MAXCHARS compilation option.  Eliminated the nonsense with
X	generating table.h.
X--  Patchlevel 3:  --
X   13.  Added -altfont command line option and SYSV compilation option.
X================================================================================
X
X4/1989  Modified for System V boxes. -DSYSV compiler option.
X
XDonald Richardson, donr@crystal.mie.clarkson.edu
X
X================================================================================
X--  Patchlevel 4:  --
X   14.  Removed MAXCHARS compilation option.  It's automatic now.  Made X10
X	scrolling smoother.  Implemented the moving magnifying glass.
X--  Patchlevel 5:  --
X   15.  Implemented compilation without the toolkit, as well as scrollbars
X	and tpic support in X10.  Also this version should work with color
X	VAXstations, although overstrike characters will come out incorrectly.
X   16.  Fixed a bug in gf reading routines:  specials at the beginning of
X	a character def. were not being processed.  Thanks to
X	kevin@amath.washington.edu for a bug report and fix.
X   17.  Added 'k' keystroke.
X--  Patchlevel 6:  --
X   18.  Added buttons on the right side of the window.
X   19.  Added -pagewidth and -pageheight command line options and A4
X	compilation option.
X   20.  Added a yet more robust font finding algorithm.
X--  Patchlevel 7:  --
X   21.  Replaced -pagewidth and -pageheight options with -paper.
X--  Patchlevel 8:  --
X   22.  Added compatibility for X11R4 and VMS.  Fixed up alignment of rules.
X--  Patchlevel 9:  --
X   23.	Removed obsolete '#' and '=' options from the X11 version:  they
X	interfere with emacs.
X--  Patchlevel 10: --
X   24.	Implemented arrow keys, expert mode, searching for the font's actual
X	size first, the -[xy]offset and -sw options, and numerous bug fixes.
X--  Patchlevel 11: --
X   25.	Implemented recursive searching for font files in subdirectories.
X   26.	Changed +sw to -hushspecials and implemented -hush.
X   27.	Modified mksedscript so that the man page comes out neater.
X   28.  Added a -keep option and resource to match the `k' keystroke.
X--  Patchlevel 12: --
X   29.  Implemented virtual fonts (this does not include built-in
X	Postscript<tm> fonts!!!).
X   30.	Numerous bug fixes, and X11R5 support.

XXDVI - DVI Previewer for VAX VMS systems running the DECWindows software.

X
XDESCRIPTION
X-----------
X
X   XDVI is a program which runs under the DECWindows system. It is used to
X   preview DVI files, such as those produced by TeX and LaTeX.
X
X   XDVI has the capability of displaying the file reduced by various (integer)
X   factors, and also has a "magnifying glass" which allows one to see a small
X   part of the unshrunk image momentarily.
X
X   Before displaying any page or part thereof, XDVI checks to see if the DVI
X   file has changed since the last time it was displayed.  If this is the case,
X   XDVI will reinitialize itself for the new DVI file.  For this reason,
X   exposing parts of the XDVI window while TeX is running should be avoided.
X   This feature allows you to preview many versions of the same file while
X   running XDVI only once.
X
XOPTIONS
X-------
X
X   In addition to specifying the .DVI file (with or without the .DVI), XDVI
X   supports the following command line options.  If the option begins with a "+"
X   instead of a "-", the option is restored to its default value.  By default,
X   these options can be set via the resource names given in parentheses in the
X   description of each option.
X
X   +<page>               Specifies the first page to show.  If + is given
X                         without a number, the last page is assumed; the first
X                         page is the default.
X
X   -s <shrink>           (.shrinkFactor)  Defines the initial shrink factor.
X                         The default value is 3.
X
X   -density <density>    (.densityPercent)  Determines the density used when
X                         shrinking bitmaps for fonts.  A higher value produces a
X                         lighter font.  The default value is 40.
X
X   -p <pixels>           (.pixelsPerInch)  Defines the size of the fonts to use,
X                         in pixels per inch.  The default value is 300.
X
X   -l                    (.listFonts)  Causes the names of the fonts used to be
X                         listed.
X
X   -rv                   (.reverseVideo)  Causes the page to be displayed with
X                         white characters on a black background, instead of vice
X                         versa.
X
X   -bw <width>           (.borderWidth)  Specifies the width of the border of
X                         the window.
X
X   -borderwidth <width>  Same as -bw.
X
X   -fg <color>           (.foreground)  Determines the color of the text
X                         (foreground).
X
X   -foreground <color>   Same as -fg.
X
X   -bg <color>           (.background)  Determines the color of the background.
X
X   -background <color>   Same as -bg.
X
X   -hl <color>           (.highlight)  Determines the color of the page border.
X                         The default is the foreground color.
X
X   -bd <color>           (.borderColor)  Determines the color of the window
X                         border.
X
X   -bordercolor <color>  Same as -bd.
X
X   -cr <color>           (.cursorColor)  Determines the color of the cursor.
X                         The default is the color of the page border.
X
X   -margins <dimen>      (.Margin)  Specifies the size of both the top and side
X                         margins.  This should be a decimal number optionally
X                         followed by "cm", e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving a
X                         measurement in inches or centimeters.  XDVI determines
X                         the "home" position of the page within the window as
X                         follows.  If the entire page fits in the window, then
X                         the margin settings are ignored.  If, even after
X                         removing the margins from the left, right, top, and
X                         bottom, the page still cannot fit in the window, then
X                         the page is put in the window such that the top and
X                         left margins are hidden, and presumably the upper
X                         left-hand corner of the text on the page will be in the
X                         upper left-hand corner of the window.  Otherwise, the
X                         text is centered in the window.  See also `M' under the
X                         KEYSTROKES section.
X
X   -sidemargin <dimen>   (.sideMargin)  Specifies the side margin (see above).
X
X   -topmargin <dimen>    (.topMargin)  Specifies the top and bottom margins (see
X                         above).
X
X   -offsets <dimen>      (.Offset)  Specifies the size of both the horizontal
X                         and vertical offsets of the output on the page.  This
X                         should be a decimal number optionally followed by "cm",
X                         e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving a measurement in inches or
X                         centimeters.  By decree of the Stanford TeX Project,
X                         the default TeX page origin is always 1 inch over and
X                         down from the top-left page corner, even when
X                         non-American paper sizes are used.  Therefore, the
X                         default offsets are 1.0 inch.
X
X   -xoffset <dimen>      (.xOffset)  Specifies the size of the horizontal
X                         offset of the output on the page (see above).
X
X   -yoffset <dimen>      (.yOffset)  Specifies the size of the vertical offset
X                         of the output on the page (see above).
X
X   -keep                 (.keepPosition)  Sets a flag to indicate that XDVI
X                         should not move to the home position when moving to a
X                         new page.  See also the `k' keystroke.
X
X   -hushspecials         (.hushSpecials)  Causes XDVI to suppress warnings about
X                         \special strings which it cannot process.
X
X   -hushchars            (.hushLostChars)  Causes XDVI to suppress warnings
X                         about references to characters which are not defined in
X                         the font.
X
X   -hush                 (.Hush)  Causes XDVI to suppress all suppressable
X                         warnings.
X
X   -paper <papertype>    (.paper)  Specifies the size of the printed page.  This
X                         may be of the form WxH (or WxHcm), where W is the width
X                         in inches (or cm) and H is the height in inches (or
X                         cm), respectively.  There are also synonyms which may
X                         be used:  us (8.5x11), usr (11x8.5), legal (8.5x14),
X                         foolscap (13.5x17), as well as the ISO sizes a1-a7,
X                         b1-b7, c1-c7, a1r-a7r (a1-a7 rotated), etc.  The
X                         default size is 8.5 x 11 inches.
X
X   -mgs[n] <size>        (.magnifierSize[n])  Specifies the size of the window
X                         to be used for the "magnifying glass" for Button n.
X                         See the MOUSE ACTIONS section.  Defaults are 200, 350,
X                         600, 900, and 1200.
X
X   -mgs <size>           Same as -mgs1.
X
X   -altfont <font>       (.altFont)  Declares a default font to use when the
X                         font in the DVI file cannot be found.  This is useful,
X                         for example, with PostScript fonts.
X
X   -thorough             (.thorough)  XDVI will usually try to ensure that
X                         overstrike characters (e.g., \notin) are printed
X                         correctly.  On monochrome displays, this is always
X                         possible with one logical operation, either AND or OR.
X                         On color displays, however, this may take two
X                         operations, one to set the appropriate bits and one to
X                         clear other bits.  If this is the case, then by default
X                         XDVI will instead use the copy operation, which does
X                         not handle overstriking correctly.  The "thorough"
X                         option chooses the slower but more correct choice.  See
X                         also -copy, below.
X
X   -copy                 (.copy)  Always use the copy operation when writing
X                         characters to the display.  This option may be
X                         necessary for correct operation on a color display, but
X                         overstrike characters will be incorrect.
X
X   -geometry <geometry>  (*geometry)  Specifies the initial geometry of the
X                         window.
X
X   -icongeometry <geometry> (.iconGeometry) Specifies the initial position for
X                         the icon.
X
X   -iconic               (.iconic)  Causes the XDVI window to start in the
X                         iconic state.  The default is to start with the window
X                         open.
X
X   -display <display>    Specifies the host, display, and screen to be used for
X                         displaying the DVI file.  The display must be specified
X                         in the form node::display.screen.  The default is
X                         obtained from the logical name "DECW$DISPLAY", which
X                         may be defined using the SET DISPLAY command.
X
XKEYSTROKES
X----------
X
X   XDVI recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its window.  Each may
X   optionally be preceded by a (positive or negative) number, whose
X   interpretation will depend on the particular keystroke.  Note that the
X   keystrokes are case sensitive.
X
X   q    Quits the program.  Control-C, control-D, and control-Z will do this,
X        too.
X
X   n    Moves to the next page (or to the nth next page if a number is given).
X        Synonyms are `f', Space, Return, Line Feed, and <Next Screen>.
X
X   p    Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).  Synonyms are `b',
X        control-H, Delete, and <Prev Screen>.
X
X   g    Moves to the page with the given number.  Initially, the first page is
X        assumed to be page number 1, but this can be changed with the `P'
X        keystroke, below.  If no page number is given, then it goes to the last
X        page.
X
X   P    "This is page number n."  This can be used to make the `g' keystroke
X        refer to actual page numbers instead of absolute page numbers.
X
X   Control-L    Redisplays the current page.
X
X   ^    Move to the "home" position of the page.  This is normally the upper
X        left-hand corner of the page, depending on the margins as described in
X        the -margins option, above.
X
X   u    Moves up two thirds of a window-full.  The <Up Arrow> key is a synonym
X        for this keystroke.
X
X   d    Moves down two thirds of a window-full.  The <Down Arrow> key is a
X        synonym for this keystroke.
X
X   l    Moves left two thirds of a window-full.  The <Left Arrow> key is a
X        synonym for this keystroke.
X
X   r    Moves right two thirds of a window-full.  The <Right Arrow> key is a
X        sysnonym for this keystroke.
X
X   c    Moves the page so that the point currently beneath the cursor is moved
X        to the middle of the window.  It also (gasp!) warps the cursor to the
X        same place.
X
X   M    Sets the margins so that the point currently under the cursor is the
X        upper left-hand corner of the text in the page.  Note that this command
X        itself does not move the image at all.  For details on how the margins
X        are used, see the -margins option.
X
X   s    Changes the shrink factor to the given number.  If no number is given,
X        the smallest factor that makes the entire page fit in the window will be
X        used.  (Margins are ignored in this computation.)
X
X   S    Sets the density factor to be used when shrinking bitmaps.  This should
X        be a number between 0 and 100; higher numbers produce lighter
X        characters.
X
X   R    Forces the DVI file to be reread.  This allows you to preview many
X        versions of the same file while running XDVI only once.
X
X   k    Normally when XDVI switches pages, it moves to the home position as
X        well.  The `k' keystroke toggles a `keep-position' flag which, when set,
X        will keep the same position when moving between pages.  Also `0k' and
X        `1k' clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the -keep option.
X
XMOUSE ACTIONS
X-------------
X
X   If the shrink factor is set to any number other than one, then clicking any
X   mouse button will pop up a "magnifying glass" which shows the unshrunk image
X   in the vicinity of the mouse click.  This subwindow disappears when the mouse
X   button is released.  Different mouse buttons produce different sized windows,
X   as indicated by the -mgs option.  Moving the cursor while holding the button
X   down will move the magnifying glass.
X
X   Also, the scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard X Window way:
X   pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar moves the top or left edge of the scrollbar
X   to that point and optionally drags it;  pushing Button 1 moves the image up
X   or right by an amount equal to the distance from the button press to the
X   upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3 moves the image down
X   or left by the same amount.  Note that this is different than the way
X   DECWindows normally defines the actions of the mouse buttons in scrollbars.
X
XLOGICAL NAMES
X-------------
X
X   Unless the -display option is used on the command line, XDVI uses the logical
X   name "DECW$DISPLAY" to specify which bit map display terminal to use.  This
X   logical name may be defined with the SET DISPLAY command.
X
X   The logical name "XDVIFONTS" determines the directory path(s) searched for
X   fonts in the following manner.  The string consists of one or more strings
X   separated by slashes.  In each such string, the substring "%f" is changed to
X   the font name; "%d" is changed to the magnification; and "%p" is changed to
X   the font family ("gf", "pk", or "pxl").  If no "%f" appears in the string,
X   then the string ":%f.%d%p" is added on the end.  For example, if the string
X   is "TEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.%d]%f.%p" and the font is cmr10 at 300 dpi, then XDVI
X   looks for TEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.300]CMR10.GF, TEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.300]CMR10.PK,
X   and TEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.1500]CMR10.PXL, in that order.  An extra slash
X   anywhere in the "XDVIFONTS" logical name causes the system default
X   directories to be tried at that point.  If the font is not found in the
X   desired size, then XDVI will try to find the nearest size.  If the font
X   cannot be found at all, then XDVI will try to vary the point size of the font
X   (within a certain range), and if this fails, then it will use the font
X   specified as the alternate font (cf. -altfont).
X
X   For compatibilty with some versions of TeX, you may also use the logical name
X   "TEXFONTS" in place of "XDVIFONTS", although in that case the string should
X   not include any "%" specifiers.
X
X   The logical name "XDVISIZES" must be set to indicate which sizes of fonts are
X   available.  It should consists of a list of numbers separated by slashes.  If
X   the list begins with a slash, the system default sizes are used, as well.
X   Sizes are expressed in dots per inch; decimals may be used for "pxl" files:
X   for example, a 300 dots per inch file magnified by half a step comes out to
X   1643 dots per five inches, which should be encoded as 328.6.  The current
X   default set of sizes is 300/328.6/360/432/518.4/622/746.4.  XDVI will also
X   try the actual size of the font before trying any of the given sizes.
X
XFILES
X-----
X
X   TEX_FONTS   System default directory for font pixel files.
X
XRESOURCE NAMES
X--------------
X
X   All of the command line options may be set via the resource names given in
X   parentheses in the descriptions of the options.  This may be used to define a
X   specific set of options as the default each time you run XDVI.  To make use
X   of this feature, create a file named DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT in the same directory
X   as the rest of your DECW*.DAT files.  Include in this file the resource names
X   and arguments of each of the options you wish to specify.  For example:
X
X      XDvi.copy: off
X      XDvi.thorough: on
X      XDvi.shrinkFactor: 2
X      XDvi.Margin: 0.95
X      XDvi*geometry: 1015x750+3+25
X
X   When XDVI is invoked, it would behave as if it had been invoked with the
X   following command:
X
X      XDVI +copy -thorough -s 2 -margins 0.95 -geometry 1015x750+3+25 dvifile
X
X   Specifying options on the command line will override any options specified
X   via resource names in the DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT file.
X
XINSTALLATION
X------------
X
X   The installation of XDVI on a VMS system is relatively easy.  If you have a
X   source-only distribution, you will need to have access to the VAX C compiler
X   to build an executable image.  The following steps should get you started:
X
X   1) Gather all of the distribution files into one directory, and then create
X      the executable image by executing the MAKE_VMS.COM file:
X
X         $ @MAKE_VMS
X
X   2) Create a help file for XDVI using the supplied XDVI.RNH file:
X
X         $ RUNOFF XDVI.RNH
X
X   3) Insert the resulting XDVI.HLP file into one of your local help libraries:
X
X         $ LIBRARY /INSERT HELPLIB.HLB XDVI.HLP
X
X   4) Modify the command file you use to set up the TEX commands so that it
X      defines the foreign symbol XDVI, and the logical names XDVIFONTS and
X      XDVISIZES.  For more information on the expected contents of the logical
X      names, see the LOGICAL NAMES section of this document.  The following
X      lines are what I use locally:
X
X      $ PROC      = F$ENVIRONMENT ("PROCEDURE")
X      $ TEXDIR    = F$PARSE (PROC, , , "DEVICE", "NO_CONCEAL") + -
X                    F$PARSE (PROC, , , "DIRECTORY", "NO_CONCEAL")
X      $ TEXDIR    = TEXDIR - "][" - "][" - "][" - "]"
X      $ TEXDISK   = TEXDIR + ".]"
X      $ PIXELS    = TEXDIR + ".GF.CANON300.]"
X      $ LPIXELS   = TEXDIR + ".LOCAL.PIXELS.CANON300.]"
X      $!
X      $! Define the virtual disk devices.
X      $!
X      $ DEFINE /PROCESS /TRANSLATE = (CONCEAL, TERMINAL) TEX_DISK   'TEXDISK'
X      $ DEFINE /PROCESS /TRANSLATE = (CONCEAL, TERMINAL) PIXELS$    'PIXELS'
X      $ DEFINE /PROCESS /TRANSLATE = (CONCEAL, TERMINAL) LPIXELS$   'LPIXELS'
X      $!
X      $! Define the directories for TeX and its related TeXware.
X      $!
X      $ DEFINE TEX_EXE       TEX_DISK:[LOCAL.PROGRAMS]
X      $ DEFINE TEX_PIXELS    PIXELS$, LPIXELS$
X      $!
X      $! Define the information necessary to run XDVI.
X      $!
X      $ XDVI :== "$TEX_EXE:XDVI"
X      $ DEFINE XDVIFONTS "TEX_PIXELS:[DPI%d]%f.%p"
X      $ DEFINE XDVISIZES -
X              "300/328.6/360/432/518.4/600/622/746.4/895.8/1075/1200/1290/1548"
X      $ EXIT
X
X   5) If you wish, you may create a DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT file that specifies a
X      default set of command line options.  See the RESOURCE NAMES section for
X      more information and an example of what I use locally.

X1 XDVI
X.BREAK
XXDVI is a program which runs under the DECWindows system. It is used to
Xpreview DVI files, such as those produced by TeX and LaTeX.
X.SKIP
XXDVI has the capability of displaying the file reduced by various
X(integer) factors, and also has a "magnifying glass" which allows one
Xto see a small part of the unshrunk image momentarily.
X.SKIP
XBefore displaying any page or part thereof, XDVI checks to see if
Xthe DVI file has changed since the last time it was displayed.  If this
Xis the case, XDVI will reinitialize itself for the new DVI file.  For
Xthis reason, exposing parts of the XDVI window while TeX is running
Xshould be avoided.  This feature allows you to preview many versions
Xof the same file while running XDVI only once.

X.SKIP
XSpecifies the size of both the horizontal and vertical offsets of the
Xoutput on the page.  This should be a decimal number optionally followed by
X"cm", e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving a measurement in inches or centimeters.
XBy decree
Xof the Stanford TeX Project, the default TeX page origin is always 1 inch
Xover and down from the top-left page corner, even when non-American paper
Xsizes are used.  Therefore, the default offsets are 1.0 inch.
X.SKIP
XThe resource name is ".Offset".
X.INDENT -1
X3 -p
X.BREAK
X-p <pixels>
X.SKIP
XDefines the size of the fonts to use, in pixels per inch.  The

X.SKIP
XSpecifies the size of the printed page.  This may be of the form WxH
X(or WxHcm), where W is the width in inches (or cm) and H is the height
Xin inches (or cm), respectively.  There are also synonyms which may be
Xused: us (8.5x11), usr (11x8.5), legal (8.5x14), foolscap (13.5x17),
Xas well as the ISO sizes a1-a7, b1-b7, c1-c7, a1r-a7r (a1-a7 rotated),

X.SKIP
XThe resource name is ".paper".
X.INDENT -1
X3 -margins
X.BREAK
X-margins <dimen>
X.SKIP
XSpecifies the size of both the top and side margins.  This should be a
Xdecimal number optionally followed by "cm", e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving a
Xmeasurement in inches or centimeters.
XXDVI determines the "home" position of
Xthe page within the window as follows.  If the entire page fits in the
Xwindow, then the margin settings are ignored.  If, even after removing
Xthe margins from the left, right, top, and bottom, the page still
Xcannot fit in the window, then the page is put in the window such that
Xthe top and left margins are hidden, and presumably the upper
Xleft-hand corner of the text on the page will be in the upper
Xleft-hand corner of the window.  Otherwise, the text is centered in
Xthe window.  See also `M' under the Keystrokes help entry.
X.SKIP
XThe resource name is ".Margin".
X.INDENT -1
X3 -mgs[n]
X.BREAK
X-mgs[n] <size>
X.SKIP

X.BREAK
X-sidemargin <dimen>
X.SKIP
XSpecifies the side margin (see -margins).
X.SKIP
XThe resource name is ".sideMargin".
X.INDENT -1
X3 -thorough
X.BREAK
XXDVI will usually try to ensure that overstrike characters (e.g.,
X\notin) are printed correctly.  On monochrome displays, this is always
Xpossible with one logical operation, either AND or OR.  On color
Xdisplays, however, this may take two operations, one to set the
Xappropriate bits and one to clear other bits.  If this is the case,
Xthen by default XDVI will instead use the copy operation, which does
Xnot handle overstriking correctly.  The "thorough" option chooses the
Xslower but more correct choice.  See also -copy.
X.SKIP
XThe resource name is ".thorough".
X.INDENT -1
X3 -topmargin
X.BREAK
X-topmargin <dimen>
X.SKIP

X.SKIP
XSpecifies the size of the vertical offset of the output on the page (see
X-offsets).
X.SKIP
XThe resource name is ".yOffset".
X
X.INDENT -1
X2 Keystrokes
X.BREAK
XXdvi recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its window.
XEach may optionally be preceded by a (positive or negative) number, whose
Xinterpretation will depend on the particular keystroke.  Note that the
Xkeystrokes are case sensitive.
X.INDENT -1
X3 q
X.BREAK
XQuits the program.  Control-C, control-D, and control-Z will do this, too.
X.INDENT -1
X3 n
X.BREAK
XMoves to the next page (or to the nth next page if a number is given).
XSynonyms are `f', Space, Return, Line Feed, and <Next Screen>.
X.INDENT -1
X3 p
X.BREAK
XMoves to the previous page (or back n pages).  Synonyms are
X`b', control-H, Delete, and <Prev Screen>.
X.INDENT -1
X3 g
X.BREAK
XMoves to the page with the given number.  Initially, the first page is
Xassumed to be page number 1, but this can be changed with the `P'
Xkeystroke.  If no page number is given, then it goes to the last page.
X.INDENT -1
X3 P
X.BREAK
X"This is page number n."  This can be used to make the `g'
Xkeystroke refer to actual page numbers instead of absolute page numbers.
X.INDENT -1
X3 Control-L
X.BREAK
XRedisplays the current page.
X.INDENT -1
X3 ^
X.BREAK
XMove to the "home" position of the page.  This is normally the upper
Xleft-hand corner of the page, depending on the margins as described in
Xthe -margins option.
X.INDENT -1
X3 u
X.BREAK
XMoves up two thirds of a window-full.  The <Up Arrow> key is a synonym for this
Xkeystroke.
X.INDENT -1
X3 d
X.BREAK
XMoves down two thirds of a window-full.  The <Down Arrow> key is a synonym for
Xthis keystroke.
X.INDENT -1
X3 l
X.BREAK
XMoves left two thirds of a window-full.  The <Left Arrow> key is a synonym for
Xthis keystroke.
X.INDENT -1
X3 r
X.BREAK
XMoves right two thirds of a window-full.  The <Right Arrow> key is a synonym for
Xthis keystroke.
X.INDENT -1
X3 c
X.BREAK
XMoves the page so that the point currently beneath the cursor is moved to
Xthe middle of the window.  It also (gasp!) warps the cursor to the same place.
X.INDENT -1
X3 M
X.BREAK
XSets the margins so that the point currently under the cursor is the upper
Xleft-hand corner of the text in the page.  Note that this command itself does
Xnot move the image at all.  For details on how the margins are used, see
Xthe -margins option.
X.INDENT -1
X3 s
X.BREAK
XChanges the shrink factor to the given number.  If no number is given, the
Xsmallest factor that makes the entire page fit in the window will be used.
X(Margins are ignored in this computation.)
X.INDENT -1
X3 S
X.BREAK
XSets the density factor to be used when shrinking bitmaps.  This should
Xbe a number between 0 and 100; higher numbers produce lighter characters.
X.INDENT -1
X3 R
X.BREAK
XForces the dvi file to be reread.  This allows you to preview many
Xversions of the same file while running XDVI only once.
X.INDENT -1
X3 k
X.BREAK
XNormally when XDVI switches pages, it moves to the home position as
Xwell.  The `k' keystroke toggles a `keep-position' flag which, when
Xset, will keep the same position when moving between pages.  Also `0k'
Xand `1k' clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the -keep option.
X
X.INDENT -1
X2 Mouse_Actions
X.BREAK
XIf the shrink factor is set to any number other than one, then
Xclicking any mouse button will pop up a "magnifying glass" which shows
Xthe unshrunk image in the vicinity of the mouse click.  This subwindow
Xdisappears when the mouse button is released.  Different mouse buttons
Xproduce different sized windows, as indicated by the -mgs option.
XMoving the cursor while holding the button down will move the
Xmagnifying glass.
X.SKIP
XAlso, the scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard X Window way: pushing
XButton 2 in a scrollbar moves the top or left edge of the scrollbar to
Xthat point and optionally drags it; pushing Button 1 moves the image
Xup or right by an amount equal to the distance from the button press
Xto the upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3 moves
Xthe image down or left by the same amount.  Note that this is
Xdifferent than the way
XDECWindows normally defines the actions of the mouse buttons in scrollbars.
X
X.INDENT -1
X2 Logical_Names
X.BREAK
XSome logical names can be defined to override the values defined when
XXDVI was compiled.
X.INDENT -1
X3 DECW$DISPLAY
X.BREAK
XUnless the -display option is used on the command line, XDVI uses the logical
Xname "DECW$DISPLAY" to specify which bit map
Xdisplay terminal to use.  This logical name may be defined with the SET
XDISPLAY command.
X.INDENT -1
X3 XDVIFONTS
X.BREAK
XThe logical name "XDVIFONTS" determines the directory path(s) searched for fonts
Xin the following manner.  The string consists of one or more strings
Xseparated by slashes.  In each such string, the substring "%f" is
Xchanged to the font name; "%d" is changed to the magnification; and
X"%p" is changed to the font family ("gf", "pk", or "pxl").  If no "%f"
Xappears in the string, then the string ":%f.%d%p" is added on the end.
X.SKIP
XFor example, if the string is "TEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.%d]%f.%p" and the font is
Xcmr10 at 300dpi, then XDVI looks for TEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.300]CMR10.GF,
XTEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.300]CMR10.PK, and TEX_DISK:[TEX.FONTS.1500]CMR10.PXL,
Xin that order.
X.SKIP
XAn extra slash anywhere in the the "XDVIFONTS" logical name causes the
Xsystem default directories to be tried at that point.  If the font is not
Xfound in the desired size, then XDVI will try to find the nearest size.  If the
Xfont cannot be found at all, then XDVI will try to vary the point size
Xof the font (within a certain range), and if this fails, then it will
Xuse the font specified as the alternate font (cf. -altfont).
X.SKIP
XFor compatibilty with some versions of TeX, you may also use the logical name
X"TEXFONTS" in place of "XDVIFONTS", although in that case the string should
Xnot include any "%" specifiers.
X
X.INDENT -1
X3 XDVISIZES
X.BREAK
XThe logical name "XDVISIZES" must be set to indicate which
Xsizes of fonts are available.  It should consists of a list of numbers
Xseparated by slashes.  If the list begins with a slash, the system
Xdefault sizes are used, as well.  Sizes are expressed in dots per
Xinch; decimals may be used for "pxl" files: for example, a 300 dots
Xper inch file magnified by half a step comes out to 1643 dots per five
Xinches, which should be encoded as 328.6.  The current default set of
Xsizes is 300/328.6/360/432/518.4/622/746.4.  XDVI will also try the actual
Xsize of the font before trying any of the given sizes.
X
X.INDENT -1
X2 Resource_Names
X.BREAK
X   All of the command line options may be set via the resource names given in
X   the descriptions of the options.  This may be used to define a
X   specific set of options as the default each time you run XDVI.  To make use
X   of this feature, create a file named DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT in the same directory
X   as the rest of your DECW*.DAT files.  Include in this file the resource names
X   and arguments of each of the options you wish to specify.  For example:
X.SKIP
X.LITERAL
X   XDvi.copy: off
X   XDvi.thorough: on
X   XDvi.shrinkFactor: 2
X   XDvi.Margin: 0.95
X   XDvi*geometry: 1015x750+3+25
X.END LITERAL
X.SKIP
X   When XDVI is invoked, it would behave as if it had been invoked with the
X   following command:
X.SKIP
X.LITERAL
X   XDVI +copy -thorough -s 2 -margins 0.95 -geometry 1015x750+3+25 dvifile
X.END LITERAL
X.SKIP
X   Specifying options on the command line will override any options specified
X   via resource names in the DECW$XDEFAULTS.DAT file.
