X
"Clear Messages" clears the current console messages from the scrolling display.
X
"Reset Filter" causes contool to stop processing a multi-line filter.  If the user has incorrectly specified the end pattern of a multi-line filter, contool may never stop processing that filter, preventing subsequent messages from being displayed.  This sleection cancels any multi-line fiter in effect.  If a multi-line filter is being processed, its starting pattern will be displayed in the left footer of the contool window.
X
The default selection is "Become Console".
# 
:edit
The Edit button lets the user edit either the contool properties or the current filter set.
X
The "Filters" selection brings up the Filters dialog.
X
The "Properties" selection brings up the Properties dialog.
X
The default selection is "Filters".
# 
:display
The contool console display contains the text of those messages which contool has been configured to display.  Some messages may be timestamped.  Which messages make it into the console is controlled by the Filters dialog; how many messages are retained is determined by the Properties dialog.
# 
:prop_controls
The Properties dialog box lets you modify various default attributes of contool.  These attributes include how to handle messages which do not match any filter, message logging and printing, and icon images.
# 
:default_action
The Default action setting determines what action contool will take when a message arrives that does not match any filter.
X
If "Beep" is selected, the machine bell will be rung the indicated number of times.
X
If "Command" is selected, the indicated command will be executed.  The contents of the message are written to the command's standard input.
X
If "Flash icon" is selected, contool's icon will flash, alternating between the "Check console" and "Flash" images specified in the contool Properties dialog box.
X
If "Log message" is selected, contool will write the message to the log file, provided that logging is enabled and occurs after filtering.
X
If "Open window" is selected, contool will open to a window (if iconic) and move in front of any obscuring windows.
X
If "Timestamp" is selected, a timestamp will be written to the console before the message text.  Timestamping is further controlled by the timestamp resolution defined in the contool Properties dialog box.
X
# 
:default_beep_count
This numeric text field determines the number of times the terminal bell will be rung when a message arrives that does not match any filter.
X
This item is only enabled if "Beep" is enabled in the "Default action" setting.
# 
:default_beep_times
This numeric text field determines the number of times the terminal bell will be rung when a message arrives that does not match any filter.
X
This item is only enabled if "Beep" is enabled in the "Default action" setting.
# 
:default_command
This text field determines the command that will be exedcuted when a message arrives that does not match any filter.  The contents of the message are written to standard input of the executing command.
X
This item is only enabled if "Command" is enabled in the "Default action" setting.
# 
:log_file
The Log file text field contains the path of the file to which messages are written if logging is enabled.
X
Messages are always appended to the file, preserving any previous contents.
X
Typing a space in this field will cause file name completion to occur, expanding the current pathname to match, as much as possible, any existing files with the same name.
# 
:log_style
The Log messages setting determines whether messages will be written to the log before or after filtering.
X
If "Before filtering" is selected, everything received by contool is written to the log.
X
If "After filtering" is selected, only those messages that do not match any filter, or that match a filter whose match action is to save the message, are written to the log.
# 
:archive_style
The Archive messages setting determines when messages will be moved from the main contool display window into the message archive.
X
If "Manually" is selected, messages will only be moved to the archive when the user explicitly selects "Archive Messages" from the View menu in the main contool window.
X
If "When closing contool" is selected, messages will be moved to the archive whenever the user closes the main contool window.  This makes it easier to determine which messages in the main contool window are current, since all previously viewed messages were copied to the archive the last time contool was closed.
X
Even if you select "When closing contool" for this setting, you can always explicitly move the messages to the archive by selecting "Archive Messages" from the View menu in the main contool window.
X
Archived messages can be viewed by selecting "Archive..." from the View menu in the main contool window.
# 
:print_filter
The Print filter text field specifies the command which will be used to print the console when "Print" is selected from the contool "File" menu.
X
This command should route its standard input to a printer.
# 
:good_icon
The "All is well" icon text field should contain the path of a file containing the image to be used by contool when it is not flashing its icon.  The image should have been produced using iconedit(1).
X
If this field is blank, the default icon is used.
# 
:bad_icon
The "Check console" icon text field should contain the path of a file containing the image to be used by contool when it is flashing its icon.  The image should have been produced using iconedit(1).  The image will be alternated with the "Flash" image to produce a blinking effect.
X
If this field is blank, the default icon is used.
# 
:flash_icon
The "Flash" icon text field should contain the path of a file containing the image to be used by contool when it is flashing its icon.  The image should have been produced using iconedit(1).  The image will be alternated with the "Check console" image to produce a blinking effect.
X
If this field is blank, the default icon is used.
# 
:stamp_resolution
The Timestamp resolution numeric text item specifies the number of seconds that must elapse before contool will write a new timestamp to the console.  Even if a filter requires that a timestamp be written, the stamp will only be inserted if the specified time has transpired.  This keeps the console from becoming clogged with a large number of similar timestamps.
# 
:message2
The Timestamp resolution numeric text item specifies the number of seconds that must elapse before contool will write a new timestamp to the console.  Even if a filter requires that a timestamp be written, the stamp will only be inserted if the specified time has transpired.  This keeps the console from becoming clogged with a large number of similar timestamps.
# 
:max_message
The Maximum message text numeric field determines the maximum number of characters contool will keep in the console display.  If inserting a new message would exceed this amount, contool will remove text from the beginning fo the display to make room.  The amount of text removed is determined by the "Overflow deletion amount" value.
# 
:message3
The Maximum message text numeric field determines the maximum number of characters contool will keep in the console display.  If inserting a new message would exceed this amount, contool will remove text from the beginning fo the display to make room.  The amount of text removed is determined by the "Overflow deletion amount" value.
# 
:delete_amount
The Overflow deletion amount numeric field determines how much text will be removed from the start of the console to make room for a new message whose insertion would cause the console the exceed the "Maximum message text" size.
X
Contool will attempt to remove whole messages from the console in order to retain an orderly appearance.
# 
:message4
The Overflow deletion amount numeric field determines how much text will be removed from the start of the console to make room for a new message whose insertion would cause the console the exceed the "Maximum message text" size.
X
Contool will attempt to remove whole messages from the console in order to retain an orderly appearance.
# 
:props_apply
The Apply button causes the values displayed in the Properties dialog to become the current contool properties.  Before Apply is pressed, changes made in this dialog do not affect contool.
X
Even after pressing Apply, the changes are not written to the contool configuration file.  If you wish your changes to remaina cross invocations of contool, use the "Save Configuration" dialog to write the properties to the configuration file.
# 
:props_reset
The Reset button restores the values in the Properties dialog to match the current values in use by contool.  Any changes made to these values and not applied to contool are discarded.
# 
:filter_controls
This is the contool filter editing dialog.  You use this dialog to add, delete, and modify console message filters.
# 
:filter_list
This scrolling list displays the current contool filter set.  Each line corresponds to one filter.
X
The starting pattern for each filter is shown in the list, preceded by a small glyph which indicates whether the filter is a single-line or multi-line filter.
X
To see the other attributes of a single filter, select that filter with the mouse.  The attributes will be displayed in the Filter dialog box.
X
If you select more than one filter, the remainder of the dialog box will be grayed out.  The dialog box is also disabled if no filter is selected.
# 
:filter_insert
The Insert button inserts a new, blank filter into the filter list.  The menu associated with the button allows you to specify where the new filter will be inserted.
X
The insert positions are at the top of the list, the bottom of the list, and before or after the current selection.  These last choices are only enabled if exactly one filter in the list is selected.  The default position is at the bottom of the list.
X
After inserting the new filter, any other selected filters are deselected, and the new filter is selected.  You can then define the attributes of this new filter, and update the filter using the Update button.
# 
:filter_edit
The Edit button lets you modify the current filter list.  The menu associated with this button provides Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete operations.
X
The Cut operation removes the selected filters from the list and places them on the clipboard.  You can place these filters back into the list using the Paste operation.
X
The Copy operation places a copy of the selected filters onto the clipboard.  The Paste operation will paste the copied filters into the list.
X
The Paste operation pastes filters on the clipboard into the filter list.  The Paste submenu provides four posting positions: at the top of the list, the bottom of the list, and before or after the current selection.  The last two choices are only enabled if exactly one filter in the list is selected.  The default position is at the bottom of the list.
X
The Delete operation removes the selected filters from the list.  The filters are not placed on the clipboard.  Once deleted, filters cannot be recovered with the Paste operation.
X
The Cut, Copy, and Delete operations are only enabled when one or more filters in the list are selected.  The Paste operation is only enabled after a Cut or Copy operation has placed filters on the clipboard.
X
The default edit operation is Cut.
# 
:filter_update
The Update button applies the current filter attributes displayed in the Filters dialog box to the currently selected filter.  The only way to modify a filter is to select it, change its attributes, and click the Update button.
X
The Update button is only enabled when exactly one filter in the list is selected.
X
You must use Update to make changes to a filter take effect.  Clciking the Apply button does not perform an Update function on the current filter.
# 
:filter_type
The Type setting determines whether the currently selected filter will match one or several lines of text written to the console.
X
If "Single line filter" is selected, the "Pattern" text field is enabled, and must contain a regular expression describing the line of text to be matched by this filter.
X
If "Multi-line filter" is selected, both "Pattern" and "End pattern" are enabled.  The "Pattern" field should contain a pattern which will match the first line of a multi-line filter.  The "End pattern" must match the last line of the multi-line filter.  All text between the first and last lines is considered part of the filtered text.
# 
:start
The Pattern text field contains a regular expression (see ed(1), for more on regular expressions) which will match the first line of a message written to the console.  For single line filters, this is the only line matched by the filter.  For multi-line filters, lines of text beginning with the first line and continuing until a line matches the "End pattern" are considered part of the filtered text.
# 
:stop
The End pattern text field contains a regular expression (see ed(1) for more on regular expressions) which will match the last line of a multi-line filter.
# 
:filter_timeout
This numeric text field determines how long contool will process a multi-line filter.  If contool does not receive a message matching the specified end pattern before the timeout value, the filter is disabled.  This prevents a filter with an erroneous end pattern from absorbing all subsequent console messages.
X
A timeout value of zero indicates that no timeout will be in effect.
X
This item is only enabled if "Type" is set to "Multi-line filter".
# 
:filter_timeout_units
This numeric text field determines how long contool will process a multi-line filter.  If contool does not receive a message matching the specified end pattern before the timeout value, the filter is disabled.  This prevents a filter with an erroneous end pattern from absorbing all subsequent console messages.
X
A timeout value of zero indicates that no timeout will be in effect.
X
This item is only enabled if "Type" is set to "Multi-line filter".
# 
:comment
The Comment text field should contain a short description of what the current filter does.  Since some filters can be quite arcane, this description can be helpful to new users.
X
This field is optional, and can be left empty.  Let your conscience be your guide...
# 
:ignore
The When matched selection determines what contool does with a message once it has matched a filter.
X
If "Save message" is selected, the actions selected in the "When saved" setting are performed, and the message text is written to the  console.
X
If "Ignore message" is selected, "When saved" is disabled and the message text is discarded.
# 
:action
The When saved setting determines what action contool will take when a particular filter matches a console message.
X
If "Beep" is selected, the machine bell will be rung the indicated number of times.
X
If "Command" is selected, the indicated command will be executed.  The contents of the message are written to the command's standard input.
X
If "Flash icon" is selected, contool's icon will flash, alternating between the "Check console" and "Flash" images specified in the contool Properties dialog box.
X
If "Log message" is selected, contool will write the message to the log file, provided that logging is enabled and occurs after filtering.
X
If "Open window" is selected, contool will open to a window (if iconic) and move in front of any obscuring windows.
X
If "Timestamp" is selected, a timestamp will be written to the console before the message text.  Timestamping is further controlled by the timestamp resolution defined in the contool Properties dialog box.
X
When a new filter is created, the save actions are set to match the default message actions defined in the Properties dialog box.
# 
:filter_beep_count
This numeric text field determines the number of times the terminal bell will be rung when a message arrives matching the current filter.
X
This item is only enabled if "When matched" is set to "Save message" and "Beep" is enabled in the "When saved" setting.
# 
:filter_beep_times
This numeric text field determines the number of times the terminal bell will be rung when a message arrives matching the current filter.
X
This item is only enabled if "When matched" is set to "Save message" and "Beep" is enabled in the "When saved" setting.
# 
:filter_command
This text field determines the command that will be exedcuted when a message arrives matching the current filter.  The contents of the message are written to standard input of the executing command.
X
This item is only enabled if "When matched" is set to "Save message" and "Command" is enabled in the "When saved" setting.
# 
:filters_apply
The Apply button takes the set of filters displayed in the filter list and makes them the current contool filter set.  Before Apply is pressed, any additions, deletions, or changes made to the filters remain local to the Filters dialog box.
X
Even after pressing Apply, the filter changes are not written to the configuration file.  In order to make your changes take effect for subsequent invocations of contool, use the Save Configuration dialog box to write them to your configuration file.
# 
:filters_apply_and_save
The Apply and Save button takes the set of filters displayed in the filter list and makes them the current contool filter set.  The filters are then saved to the current configuration file, along with the current tool properties.  If you wish to save just the filters or just the tool properties, or wish to save to a different file, you should press the Apply button instead and use the more general purpose Save Configuration dialog box.
X
Before this button is pressed, any additions, deletions, or changes made to the filters remain local to the Filters dialog box.
X
# 
:filters_reset
The Reset button discards any changes you have made to the displayed filter set, restoring the filters to match the set currently in use by contool.
X
Changes made to the filters are local to the Filters dialog box.  You can discard your work and start fresh with the existing filter set by pressing the Reset button.
# 
:load_controls
The Load Configuration dialog lets the user load tool properties and/or filter definitions from a configuration file.
# 
:load_type
The Load selection lets the user choose which items are to be loaded from the configuration file.
X
If "Tool properties" is selected, contool properties will be loaded from the file.
X
If "Filter definitions" is selected, new filters will be loaded from the file, replacing any existing filters.
# 
:load_file
The Configuration file text field must contain the name of the desired configuration file.
X
Typing a space in this field will cause file name completion to occur, expanding the current pathname to match, as much as possible, any existing files with the same name.
# 
:accept_load
The Load button causes the selected items to be read from the configuration file.  Existing properties and/or filters are replaced by those read from the file.
# 
:store_controls
