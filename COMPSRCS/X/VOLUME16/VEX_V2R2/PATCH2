			    Xv2r2 Patch #2

This file patches:

	mit/extensions/xv/server/ddx/sunrop/pip_impl.h

to included cg8reg.h from /usr/include/sbusdev rather than from
/usr/include/sundev as it used to.

To apply this patch:

cd to the top of the source tree (to the directory containing the "mit"
and "contrib" subdirectories) and do:

        patch -p -s < ThisFile

Patch will work silently unless an error occurs.  You will likely get
two warning messages, which can be ignored:

        mkdir: mit: File exists

If you want to watch patch do its thing, leave out the "-s" argument to patch.

After applying this patch:

You need to build the Xsun server again.  You can do this by making
everything (slow), or by going to the directory
mit/extensions/xv/server/ddx/sunrop and saying

	make depend
	make

followed by doing to mit/server and saying

	make Xsun (or make loadXsun)

Prereq: xv-patch-level-1
