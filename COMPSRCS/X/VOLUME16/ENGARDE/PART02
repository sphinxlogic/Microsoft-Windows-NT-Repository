X                             ENGARDE v1.0
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X      A game written for X11R4 with OSF/MOTIF widgets by Bill James.
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
XOBJECT:
X
XTo have 4 pieces in a row, column, diagonal that are all of one player's 
Xcolor, that player is to be considered the winner.
X
X
XDESIGNATIONS:
X
X -  The center set of squares is know as the "grid".
X -  The single columns to the right and left of the grid are
X      called "side-bars", possible preceded by a "left" or "right".
X -  The squares and circles are called "pieces", with the unfilled
X      piece being "white", and the filled piece being "black".
X
X
XCHARACTERISTICS OF THE BOARD:
X
X    Each piece is to be considered a magnet with one pole painted 
Xwhite, and the other painted black.  A piece is considered to be
Xwhite if the white side is face up, else it is black.  On circular 
Xpieces the positive side is painted white, while on the squares it 
Xis the negative side.  The grid is also merely a set of magnetized 
Xsquares, with either the positive or negative side facing upwards.
XThe grid also contains spaces that are not magnets at all, but are 
Xmerely null spots, and do not affect the pieces at all.  
X
XExamples:
XSample Grid :
X    
X   + + - + O -     + = positive grid face up
X   - - + - + -     - = negative grid face up
X   O - + - - +     O = null grid space
X   + + - + + -
X   - + + O - -
X   - - - - + +
X
XEvery new game, the board shuffles it's magnets to form a new
Xgrid.
X
XWhen a player moves a piece onto the grid, the magnetic interactions
Xcause the piece to show the color painted on the magnet side with
Xthe same polarity as the grid place.  e.g. when a piece moves on
Xa positive grid place, the positive side of the magnet is repulsed, 
Xand is therefore face up.
X
X  Before Move          After Move Piece is:
X   Piece is:      When moved onto grid with magnet:
X--------------------------------------------------
X| Shape | Color ||| Positive | Negative |  Null  |
X--------------------------------------------------
X|  SQU  |  Wh   |||    Bl    |    Wh    |   Wh   |   
X|  SQU  |  Bl   |||    Bl    |    Wh    |   Bl   |
X|  CIR  |  Wh   |||    Wh    |    Bl    |   Wh   |
X|  CIR  |  Bl   |||    Wh    |    Bl    |   Bl   |
X--------------------------------------------------
X
XRULES OF MOVEMENT:
X
XThe arrows to either side of the message box designate whose turn it is.
XThis player has the following options:
X
X1.  The player may take a piece from his side-bar and place it
X    on any space on the center grid where there is no other piece.
X
X2.  The player may move any piece that is currently on the grid
X    EXCEPT the last piece moved to another spot guided by these rules:
X    2a.  Piece cannot move to occupied place.
X    2b.  Piece may only move in one direction.
X    2c.  Piece cannot move more than 2 spaces in a single direction,
X           either Up, Down, Left, Right, or the Diagonals.
X    2d.  Piece may only be moved 2 spaces in a direction if the first
X           space in that direction is occupied (it jumps the first piece).
X    2e.  Piece may not be placed back onto side-bar.
X    
X
XSTRATEGY HINTS:
X
X - Try to save a piece on your side-bar, being able to place it anywhere
X      on the grid may save your neck.
X
X - Try to keep track of what polarity the grid locations are as you find
X      them out, they won't change until the next game.
X
X - Don't forget about the null spaces.  If a piece keeps the same color
X      when it moves, a null space is always a possibility.
