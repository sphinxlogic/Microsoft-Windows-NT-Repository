X.SH NAME
Xxfig \- Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B xfig
X[\fIoptions\fP]
X[\fIfile\fP]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Xfig 
Xis a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
Xinteractively in an X window.  
X.B It runs under X version 11 
X.B release 4 or higher
Xand requires a three-button mouse.
X.I file 
Xspecifies the name of a file to be edited. The description of objects in
Xthe file will be read at the start of \fIxfig\fP. 
X.PP
XThe \fITransFig\fP package is used to print the output from \fIxfig\fP.
X.PP
XNote for previous \fIxfig\fP users:
X.PP
XThe \fIf2p\fP and \fIf2ps\fP translators have been phased out
Xbecause the \fITransFig\fP package from Micah Beck is a more general
Xpurpose translator for more graphics languages.
XThe \fITransFig\fP package can be used as a back-end processor to xfig 
Xto produce various types of output:
X.IP "LaTeX - "12 
X\fIfig2dev -L latex\fP translates \fIxfig\fP to \fILaTeX\fP
Xpicture environment commands which can be
Xprocessed along with other
X.I LaTeX
Xcommands.
X.IP "Postscript -
X\fIfig2dev -L ps\fP produces a \fIPostScript\fP output.
X.IP "Pic -
X\fIfig2dev -L pic\fP produces a pic output.
X.IP "PiCTeX -
X\fIfig2dev -L pictex\fP produces
X.I PiCTeX
Xoutput.
XThis contains macros that can be used with the
X.I PiCTeX
Xenvironment under
X.I TeX
Xor
X.I LaTeX.
X.IP "Others -
X\fIfig2dev\fP has options for these other languages:
X\fIbox\fP,
X\fIepic\fP,
X\fIeepic\fP,
Xand \fIeepicemu\fP.
X.PP
XThe \fITransFig\fP package is available from the contributed software
Xon the distribution tapes of X11 Release 5 from MIT and from
Xftp.cs.cornell.edu (directory /pub/fig) and 
Xsun.soe.clarkson.edu (directory /pub/transfig) via anonymous ftp.
XIt is also available by mail from the Clarkson archive server.
XTo find out about using the server, send the one-line message "help" to
Xarchive-server@sun.soe.clarkson.edu.
X.LP
XNote: \fITransFig\fP versions 2.1.4 and later support color 
Xoutput for \fIPostScript\fP.

X/usr/local/lib/xfig.
X.SH "GRAPHICAL OBJECTS"
XThe objects in \fIxfig\fP are divided into \fBprimitive objects\fP and
X\fBcompound objects\fP. The primitive objects are: \fIARC\fP, \fICIRCLE\fP,
X\fICLOSED SPLINE\fP, \fIELLIPSE\fP, \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP,
X\fIENCAPSULATED POSTSCRIPT\fP, \fIBOX\fP, \fIARC-BOX\fP, \fISPLINE\fP, 
Xand \fITEXT\fP.  
X.PP
XA primitive object can be moved, rotated, flipped vertically or horizontally,
Xscaled, copied, aligned within a compound object or erased.
XThe TEXT primitive may not be flipped. It may be rotated but only the markers 
Xshow the rotation (on-screen).  Text IS rotated on \fIPostScript\fP output.
XThe attributes of any primitive object can be edited using a popup
Xpanel (discussed below), so you can, for instance, set the position
Xof an object manually.
X.PP
XA compound object is composed of primitive objects. The primitive objects
Xthat constitute a compound can not be individually modified, but they can
Xbe manipulated as an entity; a compound can be moved, rotated, flipped
Xvertically or horizontally, scaled, copied or erased.  A compound that 
Xcontains any boxes, arc-boxes, ellipses or circles may only be rotated by 
X90 degrees.
X.PP
X\fIRegular\fP polygons may be created using a special drawing mode, but a
Xgeneral \fIPOLYGON\fP is created as a result, which may then be modified, i.e.
Xthe individual vertices may be moved if desired.
X.SH "DISPLAY WINDOWS"
XNine regions comprise the display area of \fIxfig\fP: the 
Xcommand region, top ruler, side ruler, drawing mode region, 
Xediting mode region, message region,
Xindicator region with buttons to set and show current line thickness,
Xline style, color, area-fill gray color and several other settings, mouse 
Xfunction indicator region and canvas region. 
X(The mouse function indicator region was inspired by the UPS
Xdebugger from the University of Kent.)
XThe drawing and editing mode regions may be placed (together) to the left or 
Xright of the the canvas window (default: left).
X.SH "COMMAND PANEL FUNCTIONS"
X.TP

XPressing return in the file name window will also load the file.
X
XA popup message window will appear and diagnostic messages will be written
Xif xfig changes any "illegal" object values to legal values.  For example,
Xolder versions of xfig were lax about initializing unused parts such as 
X\fIdepth\fP, and would produce very large, random values.
X\fIXfig\fP now will "clean up" bad values and inform you when it does so.
XAlso, if you read in an older file format, \fIxfig\fP will inform you that
Xit is converting it to the current format for that version of xfig.
X
XThis window can be popped down by clicking the mouse button on the 
X\fIDismiss\fP button.  The messages will be cleared before reading a new file.

X.SH "INDICATOR PANEL COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS"
X.PP
XThe indicator panel contains buttons to set certain drawing parameters, such as
Xline thickness, canvas grid, rotation angle etc.
XAll of the buttons use the same mouse buttons for setting values.  
XPressing the \fIleft\fP mouse button on the indicator will pop up a panel
Xin which either a value may be typed (e.g. for a line thickness) or the
Xmouse may be clicked on one of several buttons (e.g. for grid style or 
Xfont name).  For those that expect a value, pressing return in the value
Xpart of the window will set the new value and pop down the menu.
X.PP
XPressing the \fImiddle\fP mouse button on an indicator will decrement the value
X(e.g. for line thickness)
Xor cycle through the options in one direction (e.g. font names), while pressing 
Xthe \fIright\fP mouse button will increment the value or cycle through the options
Xin the other direction.
X.TP
X.I ZOOM SCALE
XThe canvas zoom scale may be set/increased/decreased with this button.
XThe integer zoom scale is displayed within the zoom button. Ruler,
Xgrid and linewidth are scaled, too.  Pressing the control key and the right
Xmouse button together will set the zoom scale to 1.
X.sp
XThe figure may also be zoomed by defining a zoom rectangle by pressing 
Xthe control key and left mouse button together.  This will define one corner
Xof the zoom rectangle.  Move the mouse and click the left button again to 
Xdefine the opposite corner of the zoom rectangle.
X.TP
X.I ROTATION ANGLE
XThe rotation angle for rotating objects may be set/increased/decreased with
Xthis button.
XNote that not all objects may be rotated, and certain objects may only be
Xrotated by certain angles.
XPressing the \fImiddle\fP or \fIright\fP button will decrease(increase) the angle
Xin steps of 15 degrees.  To select other angles, press the \fIleft\fP button and
Xenter the angle in the popup menu.
X.TP
X.I NUMBER OF POLYGON SIDES
XThe number of sides used in creating a \fIREGULAR POLYGON\fP is set with
Xthis button.
X.TP
X.I GRID MODE
XWith this button the user may select no grid,
X1/4 inch (5mm in metric mode) grid or 1/2 inch (10mm) grid.
X.TP
X.I POINT POSITION
XThis button controls the coarseness of object placement on the canvas. 
XThe options are arbitrary placement, 1/16 inch (2mm in metric mode), 1/4
Xinch (5mm) or 1/2 inch (10mm).  This allows the user to easily place objects
Xin horizontal or vertical alignment.
X
XThis also restricts which objects may be "picked up" by the mouse when editing.
XIf a corner of an object is not positioned on the canvas on a multiple
Xof the point positioning resolution you may not be able to pick it.  If this 
Xhappens, a black square will temporarily appear above the mouse cursor.  
XThis square will also appear anytime the user tries to pick a nonexistent
Xobject.
X.TP
X.I SMART-LINKS MODE
XThis button controls the smart-links mode.  When turned on, lines which
Xlink box-like objects together (henceforth called \fIlinks\fP) are treated
Xspecially when one of the box-like objects is moved.
XWhen set to \fIMOVE\fP mode, the end point of the link which touches
X(or is very near) the perimeter of the box is moved with the
Xbox so that the box and the end point remain linked.
XWhen set to \fISLIDE\fP mode, the end segment of the link slides so
Xthat the box remains linked and the angle of the end segment is maintained.
XThis is useful for keeping the last segment of a link horizontal or vertical.
X
X(At the moment, this mode only works for the \fIMOVE\fP and \fICOPY\fP
Xfunctions and only works for \fIPOLYLINE\fP links and box-like objects.
XAnother limitation at the moment is that if both ends of a link touch
Xthe box being operated on, only one end of the link will be adjusted.)
X.TP
X.I VERTICAL ALIGN
XThis sets the vertical alignment mode for the \fIALIGN\fP button in the
Xediting mode panel.  The choices are no vertical alignment, align to top edge,
Xmiddle or bottom edge of compound.

X.SH "EDITING MODE PANEL COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS"
XWhen a button in the editing mode panel is pressed, any
Xobjects that may be affected by that editing operation will show their
Xcorner markers.  Only those objects may be affected by the particular
Xedit mode.  In cases where two edit modes exist for one button, it
Xmay be that the corner markers will appear for objects that may be
Xaffected by one button but not the other.
X.TP
X.SH "SELECTING OBJECTS"
XWhen multiple objects have points in common, e.g. two boxes that
Xtouch at one corner, only one object can be selected by clicking on
Xthat point. To select other objects, hold down the shift key while
Xpressing the \fIleft\fP mouse button: the markers of one object will be
Xtemporarily highlighted.  By repeatedly clicking the \fIleft\fP button while
Xholding down the shift key, it is possible to cycle through all candidates for
Xselection at that point. To perform the selected action, e.g. 
Xdeleting one box, click on the point without holding down the
Xshift key.  The operation will be performed on the highlighted object.
X
X\fBNote:\fP
XIf the mouse is not clicked near enough to an object marker or for whatever
Xreason \fIxfig\fP cannot "find" the object the user is trying to select,
Xa black square will temporarily appear above the mouse cursor.
X.TP
X.I GLUE COMPOUND
XCompound objects are created by first tagging the objects to be compounded
Xand then pressing the \fIright\fP mouse button to group the tagged
Xobjects into a compound object.  Single objects are tagged by clicking
Xon them with the \fIleft\fP button.  A number of objects can be tagged at
Xonce by using the \fImiddle\fP button to define the upper-left and
Xlower-right corners of a region enclosing the objects.
XTagged objects are shown with highlighted markers.
XTagged objects which are selected (see the SELECTING OBJECTS section above)
Xwill be temporarily unhighlighted.
XThere is currently no special command to tag or untag all of the objects
Xwithin a figure.  You can untag all of the objects by changing from
XGLUE mode to some other mode (apart from BREAK) and back again.
X.TP
X.I BREAK COMPOUND
XBreak a compound object to allow manipulation of its component parts.
XClick the \fIleft\fP button on the one of the corner markers of the compound 
Xobject or along one of the imaginary lines defining the compound box.
XClicking with the \fImiddle\fP button will achieve the same effect
Xbut will also tag the component parts (although you will not see the
Xtags until you change to the GLUE mode).  You can use this feature
Xto easily alter the objects within a compound.
X.TP
X.I SCALE OBJECT
XAny object may be scaled.  If the \fIleft\fP button is pressed on a
X\fIBOX\fP or \fIARC-BOX\fP object, then that object will be scaled
Xproportionally to its aspect ratio.  If the \fImiddle\fP button is pressed
Xon any object, that object will be scaled up or down about its center.
XText may only be scaled if inside a compound object and then only if 
Xits \fIRIGID\fP flag is set to \fINORMAL\fP (using the popup edit panel).
XSee the \fITransFig\fP manual for description of text options.
X.TP
X.I ALIGN
XThis button will align objects inside a compound object according to the
Xsetting in the \fIVERTICAL ALIGN\fP and \fIHORIZONTAL ALIGN\fP indicators.  
XThe choices are the cumulative effect of vertically aligning the objects 
Xto the \fITOP\fP, \fIMIDDL\fPE or \fIBOTTO\fPM edge and horizontally aligning 
Xto the \fILEF\fPT, \fIMIDDL\fPE or \fIRIGH\fPT edge of the compound.
X.TP
X.I MOVE POINT
XModify the position of a point of any object except \fITEXT\fP and 
X\fICOMPOUND\fP objects.
XFor unrestrained movement, click the \fIleft\fP button over the desired 
Xpoint, reposition the point, and click the \fIleft\fP button again.
XFor horizontally or vertically constrained move, click the \fImiddle\fP
Xbutton on the desired point and move either horizontally or vertically.
XNotice that once you choose the direction (horizontal or vertical), movement
Xis constrained in that direction.  If, after moving the mouse initially, it
Xis moved in the other direction a greater distance than the current position
Xof the mouse relative to the starting point, then that will be the new
Xconstraint direction.  In otherwords if you first move the mouse 
X\fIhorizontally\fP one inch (say) then move it \fIvertically\fP 
X1.3 inches, the direction will switch to \fIvertical\fP until any 
X\fIhorizontal\fP motion exceeds 1.3 inches.
XWhen the object is positioned where desired, click the \fIleft\fP to
Xplace it if the \fIleft\fP button was used to start the move (unconstrained), 
Xor the \fImiddle\fP button (constrained) if that button was used.
X.TP
X.I MOVE
XMove object.  Click the \fIleft\fP (unconstrained move) or \fImiddle\fP
X(constrained move) button on any corner marker of the object to be moved.
XThe horizontal/vertical constrained movement (\fImiddle\fP button) works 
Xexactly as described for \fIMOVE POINT\fP.
X.TP
X.I ADD POINTS
XAdd points to \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fISPLINE\fP,
Xor \fICLOSED SPLINE\fP objects (points of a \fIBOX\fP can not be added
Xor deleted).  Note that a \fIREGULAR POLYGON\fP is really an ordinary
X\fIPOLYGON\fP, so adding points to this object is allowed and does NOT keep 
Xthe polygon regular.
X.TP
X.I COPY / CUT TO CUT BUFFER
XCopy object to canvas or cut buffer.  Click the \fIleft\fP (unconstrained 
Xcopy) or \fImiddle\fP (constrained copy) button on any corner marker of 
Xthe object to be copied (for \fICIRCLE\fP and \fIELLIPSE\fP
Xobjects, mouse may also be clicked on their circumferences).
XThe object will be duplicated and then moved exactly as in \fIMOVE\fP.
XIf the \fIright\fP button is clicked on an object, that object is copied 
Xto the cut buffer for pasting into this or another figure.
XThe file used for the cut buffer is called \f3.xfig\f1
Xin the user's \f3$HOME\f1 directory.  This allows a user to run two or more
Xxfig processes and cut/paste objects between them.
XIf there is no \f3$HOME\f1, a file is
Xcreated in \f3/tmp\f1, called \f3xfig\f2PID\f1 where \f2PID\f1 is the 
Xxfig process ID.
X.TP
X.I DELETE POINTS
XDelete points from \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fISPLINE\fP,
Xor \fICLOSED SPLINE\fP.  Objects (points of a \fIBOX\fP or \fIARC-BOX\fP 
Xcan not be added or deleted).  
XNote that a \fIREGULAR POLYGON\fP is really an ordinary
X\fIPOLYGON\fP, so deleting points from this object is allowed and does NOT 
Xkeep the polygon regular.
X.TP
X.I DELETE
XClick the \fIleft\fP button on an object to delete the object.
XDelete a \fIregion\fP of the canvas by clicking the \fImiddle\fP button
Xand dragging the mouse to define an area of objects to delete.
XClicking the \fIright\fP button on an object will copy the object 
Xto the cut buffer (see \fICOPY/CUT TO CUT BUFFER\fP above).
X.TP
X.I EDIT OBJECT
XEdit settings for an existing object.
XClick the \fIleft\fP button on the object and a pop-up menu will appear
Xshowing existing settings for the object.  Some of the menu entries
Xmay be changed by typing new values in the appropriate windows. These
Xare editable Ascii\%TextWidgets and allow cut and paste.
XOthers pop up a sub-menu of multiple choices when pressed and held.
XPress the "done" button to apply the changes to the object and finish.
XPress the "apply" button to apply the changes but keep the menu up for
Xfurther changes.  Press the "cancel" button to cancel the changes and 
Xpop down the menu.

X.I UPDATE
XBy pressing the \fIleft\fP button on an object, the current settings for
Xthe indicator buttons (line width, line style, area fill etc.) are
Xcopied into that object.  If the \fImiddle\fP button is clicked on an
Xobject, the settings in the object are copied into the indicator button
Xsettings.  Thus, one may copy attributes of one object to another.
XThe \fIdepth\fP attribute is not copied when updating objects.
X.TP
X.I FLIP VERTICALLY
XFlip the object up/down (\fIleft\fP button) or copy the object and flip it

X.I ROTATE CLOCKWISE
XRotate the object (\fIleft\fP button) or copy and rotate it 
X(\fImiddle\fP button) -N degrees (clockwise), where N is the amount 
Xset in the rotation indicator button.  The object is rotated about 
Xthe chosen point.
XNot all objects can be rotated, and not all can be rotated at arbitrary
Xangles.  For example, \fIBOX\fP, \fIARC-BOX\fP and \fIEPS\fP objects may
Xonly be rotated by 90 degrees.
XText objects may be rotated although only the markers are rotated on 
Xthe screen, but the text
Xitself is not displayed rotated because of the limitations of the X11
XWindow System.  Text IS rotated correctly on \fIPostScript\fP output, however.
X.TP
X.I ROTATE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE
XRotate the object (\fIleft\fP button) or copy (\fImiddle\fP button) 
X+N degrees (counter-clockwise), where N is the amount set in the rotation
Xindicator button.  The object is rotated about the chosen
Xpoint.
X.TP
X.I SPLINE <-> POLYLINE
XTurn \fIPOLYGON\fP into a \fICLOSED INTERPOLATED SPLINE\fP object, or
Xturn \fIPOLYLINE\fP into a \fIINTERPOLATED SPLINE\fP object.

X(Brian V. Smith)
X.PP
XNot all operations employ smart redrawing of objects which are altered
Xas a by product of the operation.  You may need to use \fIRedraw\fP
Xin these cases.
X.PP
XMust compile xfig with \fB-DOPENWIN\fP in order to make xfig handle
XOpenWindows scalable fonts correctly.
X.PP
XThere is a bug in OpenWindows 2.0 which relates to pixmaps in widgets.
XYou must compile xfig with the \fB-DOPENWIN_BUG\fP option for this problem.
X.PP
XIf the image is panned or the xfig window iconified and de-iconified
Xduring the middle of an operation (e.g. while drawing a line), the picture
Xwill be distorted.  This can be corrected using \fIRedraw\fP after the
Xoperation is complete.
X.PP
XRotated text, circles and ellipses will be displayed horizontally on the screen.  
XThey will be rotated only when printed on \fIPostScript\fP output.
X.PP
XCorners of object scaled with point positioning in one of the grid 
Xmodes will not always fall on the grid line, but to the closest pixel.
