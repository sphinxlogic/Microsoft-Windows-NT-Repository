X  version 1.1:
X  added patches for X11R3 - from duncan@mips.com
X  quicker vader updating - from koreth@ebay.sun.com
X  and bitdir - the BitmapDirectory resource, courtesy of me.
X  Tue Aug  7 1990
X
X  version 1.2:
X  added multi-resolution code.  created new bitmaps for large-scale.
X  added new resource for scale: Vaders*Scale, 1=normal, 2=large.
X
X  version 1.3:
X  added explosions for aliens.
X  cleaned up some dirty code so the program will compile without 
X   complaints from gcc and added applications-default directory search
X   - from jik@athena.mit.edu
X
X  version 1.4:
X  added font resource for score display.
X  remade Vaders window into a Form widget, with two children - 
X   the gamewindow and the information window.
X  cleaned up stuff so lint would be happy.
X
X  version 2.0:
X  added buttons for commands.
X  added info screen [me!]
X  folded bitmaps back into the code, removed bitdir.
X  The application can now run without any customization of resources,
X   or knowledge of the file system.
