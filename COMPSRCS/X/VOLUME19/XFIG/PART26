X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B xfig
X[\fIoptions\fP]
X[\fIfile\fP]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Xfig
Xis a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
Xinteractively in an X window.
X.B It runs under X version 11
X.B release 4 or higher
Xand requires a two- or three-button mouse.
X.I file
Xspecifies the name of a file to be edited. The description of objects in
Xthe file will be read at the start of \fIxfig\fP.
X.PP
XWhen using a two-button mouse
Xuse the <Meta> key and the right button at the same time to effect
Xthe action of the middle button.
X.PP
XThe \fITransFig\fP package is used to print or export the output from \fIxfig\fP.
X.PP
XNote for previous \fIxfig\fP users:
X.PP
XThe \fIf2p\fP and \fIf2ps\fP translators have been phased out
Xbecause the \fITransFig\fP package from Micah Beck is a more general
Xpurpose translator for more graphics languages.
XThe \fITransFig\fP package can be used as a back-end processor to \fIxfig\fP
Xto produce various types of output:
X.IP "LaTeX - "12
X\fIfig2dev -L latex\fP translates \fIxfig\fP to \fILaTeX\fP
Xpicture environment commands which can be
Xprocessed along with other
X.I LaTeX
Xcommands.
X.IP "Postscript -
X\fIfig2dev -L ps\fP produces a \fIPostScript\fP output.
X.IP "Pic -
X\fIfig2dev -L pic\fP produces a pic output.
X.IP "PiCTeX -
X\fIfig2dev -L pictex\fP produces
X.I PiCTeX
Xoutput.
XThis contains macros that can be used with the
X.I PiCTeX
Xenvironment under
X.I TeX
Xor
X.I LaTeX.
X.IP "Others -
X\fIfig2dev\fP has options for these other languages:
X\fIbox\fP,
X\fIepic\fP,
X\fIeepic\fP,
Xand \fIeepicemu\fP.
X.PP
XThe \fITransFig\fP package is available via anonymous ftp from
Xexport.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/R5fixes/transfig-fixes/transfig.2.1.X.tar.Z, 
Xwhere the X is the current patchlevel.
X.LP
XNote: \fITransFig\fP versions 2.1.4 and later support color
Xoutput for \fIPostScript\fP.

X.TP
X\fB-iconG[eometry]\fP \fI+X+Y\fP
XSpecifies the position for the icon.
X.TP
X.B \-inc[hes]
XMake inches the unit of choice (default).
X.TP
X.B \-me[tric]
XMake centimeters the unit of choice.
X
XAfter \fIxfig\fP is started you may change the units from metric to

Xbutton 3 in the \fIunits\fP box where the two rulers meet.
X.TP
X.B \-internalBW \fIwidth\fP
XUse lines of width \fIwidth\fP between all buttons and panels (default = 1).
X.TP
X.B \-inv[verse]
XUse inverse video (white on black).
X.TP
X.B \-k[eyFile] \fIcompose-key-file\fP
XUse \fIcompose-key-file\fP instead of \fICompKeyDB\fP for compose (meta) key
Xdatabase.  If there are no "/"s in the name, the file must reside in the \fIxfig\fP
Xlibrary directory, \fI$XFIGLIBDIR\fP, usually /usr/local/lib/X11/xfig.
XIf there are any "/"s in the name it is taken as is (not relative
Xto \fI$XFIGLIBDIR\fP).
XIf there is a leading "~/" in the string then the ~ is expanded to the
Xuser's home directory.
X.TP
X.B \-lat[exfonts]
XStart \fIxfig\fP with \fILaTeX\fP font selection.  Normally, the \fIPostScript\fP
Xfonts are available as the default.  This flag selects the \fILaTeX\fP
Xfonts to start.
X.TP
X.B \-le[ft]
XChange the position of the side panel window to the left of the canvas window.
X.TP
X.B \-mo[nochrome]
XUse black and white only.
X.TP
X\fB-nor[mal]\fP \fIfont\fP
XCause the font used for the message panel and ruler numbers to be \fIfont\fP.
XThis font is also used on the canvas when the selected font is not available
Xin an X11 font (default = fixed).
X.TP
X.B \-not[rack]
XTurn off cursor (mouse) tracking arrows.
X.TP
X\fB-ph[eight]\fP \fIunits\fP
XMake \fIxfig\fP come up \fIunits\fP high (where units are either cm or in).
X.TP
X\fB-pw[idth]\fP \fIunits\fP
XMake \fIxfig\fP come up \fIunits\fP wide (where units are either cm or in).
X.TP
X.B \-ri[ght]
XChange the position of the side panel window to the right of the canvas window
X(default: left).
X.TP
X.B \-sc[alablefonts]
XAllows use of the X11R5 scalable fonts.
X.TP
X.B \-nosc[alablefonts]
XDisables use of the X11R5 scalable fonts.  You might want to use this for
Xdebugging.
X.TP
X.B \-sh[owallbuttons]\fP
XShow all the \fIxfig\fP indicator buttons instead of only those relevant
Xto the current drawing mode.  Normally, the buttons \fIline width\fP,
X\fIarea-fill\fP, \fIgrid mode\fP, \fItext size\fP, etc. are only visible when
Xthey are relevant to the current drawing mode.
XThe \fB-showallbuttons\fP option makes all
Xof the indicator buttons visible at all times.  This takes up more screen
Xreal estate, but allows the user to see all settable parameters.
X.TP
X.B \-sp[ecialtext]
XStart \fIxfig\fP with the \fIspecial text\fP mode for text objects.
X.TP
X\fB-startf[ontsize]\fP \fIpointsize\fP
XSet the default font size for text objects (default = 12pt).
X.TP
X\fB-startl[atexFont]\fP \fIfont\fP
XSet the starting font name for \fILaTeX\fP fonts.
X.TP
X\fB-startp[sFont]\fP \fIfont\fP
XSet the starting font name for \fIPostscript\fP fonts.
X.TP
X.B \-te[xtoutline]
XSpecifies that xfig will draw a red (on color machines) outline
Xof the "actual" bounding box of text objects.
XThis is mostly useful for determining what rotated text will look like
Xsince xfig doesn't rotate the text (other than 0, 90, 180, or
X270 degrees) on the canvas.
X.TP
X.B \-tr[ack]
XTurn on cursor (mouse) tracking arrows (default).
X.TP
X\fB-users[cale]\fP \fIscale\fP
XSet the multiplier for displayed line lengths etc.  This factor is multiplied
Xby the actual length, radius or diameter of the object currently
Xbeing drawn on the canvas.  It is useful for making scale drawings, where
Xe.g. 1 inch = 1 foot (userscale = 12.0) or 1cm = 1m (userscale = 100.0).
X.TP
X\fB-useru[nit]\fP \fIunits\fP
XThe \fIunits\fP string is printed with the length information when drawing objects.
XFor example if the \fIuserscale\fP = 1.0 and the \fIuserunit\fP = \fIft\fP 
Xthen a line which is 3 inches long on the canvas would be displayed as 
X"length = 3 ft" when it is being drawn.
X
XAfter \fIxfig\fP is started you may change the \fIuserscale\fP
Xand the \fIuserunit\fP from a popup menu available by pressing mouse
Xbutton 3 in the \fIunits\fP box where the two rulers meet.
X
X
X.SH "GRAPHICAL OBJECTS"
XThe objects in \fIxfig\fP are divided into \fBprimitive objects\fP and
X\fBcompound objects\fP. The primitive objects are: \fIARC\fP, \fICIRCLE\fP,
X\fICLOSED SPLINE\fP, \fIELLIPSE\fP, \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP,
X\fIENCAPSULATED POSTSCRIPT\fP, \fIBOX\fP, \fIARC-BOX\fP, \fISPLINE\fP,
Xand \fITEXT\fP.
X.PP
XA primitive object can be moved, rotated, flipped vertically or horizontally,
Xscaled, copied, aligned within a compound object or erased.
XThe TEXT primitive may not be flipped. It may be rotated but only the markers
Xshow the rotation (on-screen) for angles other than 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees.
XText IS rotated on \fIPostScript\fP output.
XThe attributes of any primitive object can be edited using a popup
Xpanel (discussed below), so you can, for instance, set the position
Xof an object manually.
X.PP
XA compound object is composed of primitive objects. The primitive objects
Xthat constitute a compound can not be individually modified, but they can
Xbe manipulated as an entity; a compound can be moved, rotated, flipped
Xvertically or horizontally, scaled, copied or erased.  A compound that
Xcontains any boxes or arc-boxes may only be rotated by 90 degrees.
X.PP
XObjects may overlap other objects according to their "depth".  Objects with
Xlarger depth number are obscured by objects with smaller depth.
X.PP
X\fIRegular\fP polygons may be created using a special drawing mode, but a
Xgeneral \fIPOLYGON\fP is created as a result, which may then be modified, i.e.
Xthe individual vertices may be moved if desired.
X.SH "DISPLAY WINDOWS"
XTen regions comprise the display area of \fIxfig\fP: the
Xcommand region, top ruler, side ruler, drawing mode region,
Xediting mode region, filename region, message region,
Xmouse function indicator region and canvas region,
Xand indicator region with buttons to set and show current line thickness,
Xline style, color, area-fill gray color and several other settings.
X(The mouse function indicator region was inspired by the UPS
Xdebugger from the University of Kent.)
XThe drawing and editing mode regions may be placed (together) to the left or
Xright of the the canvas window (default: left).
X.SH "COMMAND PANEL FUNCTIONS"
X.TP
X.I Quit
XExit from \fIxfig\fP, discarding the figure. If the figure has been modified and
Xnot saved, the user will be asked to
Xconfirm the action, by clicking mouse button 1 on a confirm/cancel popup menu.
X.TP
X.I Delete ALL
XDelete all objects from the canvas window (may be undone).
X.TP
X.I Undo
XUndo the last object creation, deletion or modification.

X.TP
X.I POINT POSITION
XThis button controls the coarseness of object placement on the canvas.
XThe options are exact (on pixel) placement, 1/16 inch (2mm in metric mode), 1/4
Xinch (5mm) or 1/2 inch (10mm).  This allows the user to easily place objects
Xin horizontal or vertical alignment.
X
XThis also restricts which objects may be "picked up" by the mouse when editing.
XIf a corner of an object is not positioned on the canvas on a multiple
Xof the point positioning resolution you may not be able to pick it.  If this
Xhappens, a black square will temporarily appear above the mouse cursor.
XThis square will also appear anytime the user tries to pick a nonexistent
Xobject.

XThis button controls the smart-links mode.  When turned on, lines which
Xlink box-like objects together (henceforth called \fIlinks\fP) are treated
Xspecially when one of the box-like objects is moved.
XWhen set to \fIMOVE\fP mode, the end point of the link which touches
X(or is very near) the perimeter of the box is moved with the
Xbox so that the box and the end point remain linked.
XWhen set to \fISLIDE\fP mode, the end segment of the link slides so
Xthat the box remains linked and the angle of the end segment is maintained.
XThis is useful for keeping the last segment of a link horizontal or vertical.
X
X(At the moment, this mode only works for the \fIMOVE\fP and \fICOPY\fP
Xfunctions and only works for \fIPOLYLINE\fP links and box-like objects.
XAnother limitation at the moment is that if both ends of a link touch
Xthe box being operated on, only one end of the link will be adjusted.)

X
X.SH "SELECTING OBJECTS"
XWhen multiple objects have points in common, e.g. two boxes that
Xtouch at one corner, only one object can be selected by clicking on
Xthat point. To select other objects, hold down the shift key while
Xpressing mouse button 1: the markers of one object will be
Xtemporarily highlighted.  By repeatedly clicking mouse button 1 while
Xholding down the shift key, it is possible to cycle through all candidates for
Xselection at that point. To perform the selected action, e.g.
Xdeleting one box, click on the point without holding down the
Xshift key.  The operation will be performed on the highlighted object.
X
X\fBNote:\fP

Xlower-right corners of a region enclosing the objects.
XTagged objects are shown with highlighted markers.
XTagged objects which are selected (see the SELECTING OBJECTS section above)
Xwill be temporarily unhighlighted.
XThere is currently no special command to tag or untag all of the objects
Xwithin a figure.  You can untag all of the objects by changing from
XGLUE mode to some other mode (apart from BREAK) and back again.
X.TP
X.I BREAK COMPOUND
XBreak a compound object to allow manipulation of its component parts.
XClick mouse button 1 on one of the corner markers of the compound
Xobject or along one of the imaginary lines defining the compound box.
XClicking with mouse button 2 will achieve the same effect
Xbut will also tag the component parts (although you will not see the
Xtags until you change to the GLUE mode).  You can use this feature
Xto easily alter the objects within a compound.
X.TP
X.I SCALE OBJECT
XAny object may be scaled.  If mouse button 1 is pressed on a
X\fIBOX\fP or \fIARC-BOX\fP object, then that object will be scaled
Xproportionally to its aspect ratio.  If mouse button 2 is pressed
Xon any object, that object will be scaled up or down about its center.
XText may only be scaled if inside a compound object and then only if
Xits \fIRIGID\fP flag is set to \fINORMAL\fP (using the popup edit panel).
XSee the \fITransFig\fP manual for description of text options.

X.I MOVE POINT
XModify the position of a point of any object except \fITEXT\fP and
X\fICOMPOUND\fP objects.
XFor unrestrained movement, click mouse button 1 over the desired
Xpoint, reposition the point, and click the \fIleft\fP button again.
XFor horizontally or vertically constrained move, click mouse button 2
Xon the desired point and move either horizontally or vertically.
XNotice that once you choose the direction (horizontal or vertical), movement
Xis constrained in that direction.  If, after moving the mouse initially, it
Xis moved in the other direction a greater distance than the current position
Xof the mouse relative to the starting point, then that will be the new
Xconstraint direction.  In otherwords if you first move the mouse
X\fIhorizontally\fP one inch (say) then move it \fIvertically\fP
X1.3 inches, the direction will switch to \fIvertical\fP until any
X\fIhorizontal\fP motion exceeds 1.3 inches.
XWhen the object is positioned where desired, click mouse button 1 to
Xplace it if that button was used to start the move (unconstrained),
Xor mouse button 2 (constrained) if that button was used.

X.I ADD POINTS
XAdd points to \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fISPLINE\fP,
Xor \fICLOSED SPLINE\fP objects (points of a \fIBOX\fP can not be added
Xor deleted).  Note that a \fIREGULAR POLYGON\fP is really an ordinary
X\fIPOLYGON\fP, so adding points to this object is allowed and does NOT keep
Xthe polygon regular.
X.TP
X.I COPY / CUT TO CUT BUFFER
XCopy object to canvas or cut buffer.  Click mouse button 1 (unconstrained
Xcopy) or mouse button 2 (constrained copy) on any corner marker of
Xthe object to be copied (for \fICIRCLE\fP and \fIELLIPSE\fP
Xobjects, mouse may also be clicked on their circumferences).
XThe object will be duplicated and then moved exactly as in \fIMOVE\fP.
XIf mouse button 3 is clicked on an object, that object is copied
Xto the cut buffer for pasting into this or another figure.
XThe file used for the cut buffer is called \f3.xfig\f1
Xin the user's \f3$HOME\f1 directory.  This allows a user to run two or more
Xxfig processes and cut/paste objects between them.
XIf there is no \f3$HOME\f1, a file is created in a temporary directory
Xcalled \f3xfig\f2PID\f1 where \f2PID\f1 is the xfig process ID.
XThe temporary directory used is specified in the environment variable
X\fIXFIGTMPDIR/\fR.  If that variable is empty or not set then \fI/tmp\fP is used.
X.TP
X.I DELETE POINTS
XDelete points from \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fISPLINE\fP,
Xor \fICLOSED SPLINE\fP.  Objects (points of a \fIBOX\fP or \fIARC-BOX\fP
Xcan not be added or deleted).
XNote that a \fIREGULAR POLYGON\fP is really an ordinary
X\fIPOLYGON\fP, so deleting points from this object is allowed and does NOT
Xkeep the polygon regular.

XEdit settings for an existing object.
XClick mouse button 1 on the object and a pop-up menu will appear
Xshowing existing settings for the object.  Some of the menu entries
Xmay be changed by typing new values in the appropriate windows. These
Xare editable Ascii\%TextWidgets and allow cut and paste.
XOthers pop up a sub-menu of multiple choices when pressed and held.
XYet others are buttons which toggle a setting on or off (e.g. arrow
Xheads on lines).
X
XPress the "done" button to apply the changes to the object and finish.
XPress the "apply" button to apply the changes but keep the menu up for
Xfurther changes.  Press the "cancel" button to cancel the changes and
Xpop down the menu.

X.TP
X.I UPDATE
XBy pressing mouse button 1 on an object, the current settings for
Xthe indicator buttons (line width, line style, area fill etc.) which
Xhave been selected for update are copied into that object.
XWhen \fIxfig\fP is started, all indicator buttons which are components of objects
Xare selected for update.  To unselect an indicator, click on the update button
Xand click mouse button 1 on the small button in the upper-right
Xcorner of the indicator.  When that indicator is selected the foreground color
X(default black) shows.  When it is unselected the background color (default white)
Xshows.
X.sp
XIf mouse button 2 is clicked on an object, the settings in the object
Xthat are selected by the indicator buttons are copied into those indicator button
Xsettings.  Thus, one may copy selected attributes of one object to another.
X.TP
X.I FLIP VERTICALLY
XFlip the object up/down (mouse button 1) or copy the object and flip it
X(mouse button 2). Point to part of the object, click
Xthe appropriate button.  That object will be flipped vertically
Xabout that point.
X.TP
X.I FLIP HORIZONTALLY
XFlip the object left/right (mouse button 1) or copy the object and flip it
X(mouse button 2). Point to part of the object, click
Xthe appropriate button.  That object will be flipped horizontally
Xabout that point.
X.TP
X.I ROTATE CLOCKWISE
XRotate the object (mouse button 1) or copy and rotate it
X(mouse button 2) -N degrees (clockwise), where N is the amount
Xset in the rotation indicator button.  The object is rotated about
Xthe chosen point.
XNot all objects can be rotated, and not all can be rotated at arbitrary
Xangles.  For example, \fIBOX\fP, \fIARC-BOX\fP and \fIEPS\fP objects may
Xonly be rotated by 90 degrees.
XText objects may be rotated, although for angles other than 0, 90, 180
Xand 270 degrees only the markers are rotated on the screen
Xbecause of the limitations of the X11 Window System.
XText IS rotated correctly on \fIPostScript\fP output, however.
X.TP
X.I ROTATE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE
XRotate the object (mouse button 1) or copy (mouse button 2)
X+N degrees (counter-clockwise), where N is the amount set in the rotation
Xindicator button.  The object is rotated about the chosen
Xpoint.
X.TP
X.I SPLINE <-> POLYLINE
XTurn \fIPOLYGON\fP into a \fICLOSED INTERPOLATED SPLINE\fP object, or
Xturn \fIPOLYLINE\fP into a \fIINTERPOLATED SPLINE\fP object.
X.TP
X.I ADD/DELETE ARROWS
XAdd or delete arrow heads of \fIARC\fP, \fIPOLYLINE\fP or \fISPLINE\fP
Xobjects.  Add an arrow head by clicking mouse button 1 on the
Xendpoint of the object.  Delete an arrow head by clicking
Xmouse button 2 on the endpoint or arrow head.  The length and thickness
Xof the arrowheads may be modified using the popup edit panel.
X.SH "PANNING"
XThe figure may be panned by clicking mouse button 1, 2 or 3
Xin the rulers.  Clicking mouse button 1 in the top ruler
Xwill pan the image to left the by 1/2 inch (1cm in metric mode),
Xadjusted for zoom factor. Clicking mouse button 3 in the top ruler
Xwill pan the image right by the same amount.
XBy pressing and \fIholding\fP mouse button 2 the user may drag
Xthe ruler by the amount desired, thus panning the image by that amount.
X.PP
XThe figure is panned up and down in the same way by clicking the mouse
Xin the ruler on the right of the canvas.  Also, the figure can be returned
Xto its origin by clicking mouse button 1 in the units
X(e.g. \fIcm\fP or \fIin\fP) box.
X.PP
XThe arrow keys may also be used to pan the image and the home key to
Xreturn the figure to the origin.  Also, pressing the Control Key and
Xmouse button 2 will pan the figure to the origin.

X.SH BUGS and RESTRICTIONS
XPlease send bug reports, fixes, new features etc. to:
X.br
Xbvsmith@lbl.gov
X(Brian V. Smith)
X.PP
XNot all operations employ smart redrawing of objects which are altered
Xas a by product of the operation.  You may need to use \fIRedraw\fP
Xin these cases.
X.PP
XMust compile \fIxfig\fP with \fB-DOPENWIN\fP in order to make \fIxfig\fP handle
XOpenWindows scalable fonts correctly.
X.PP
XSome servers do not allow bitmaps/pixmaps taller than the screen height
Xor wider than the screen width.  That is why there is a limit on the width
Xof the top ruler and height of the side ruler.  If you need wider/taller
Xrulers AND your server allows bigger pixmaps, you may define MAX_TOPRULER_WD
Xand/or MAX_SIDERULER_HT in your Imakefile in the DEFINES line.  For example,
Xto have a maximum top ruler width of 1160 pixels, add
X-DMAX_TOPRULER_WD=1160 to your DEFINES line in the Imakefile.
X.PP
XThere is a bug in OpenWindows 2.0 which relates to pixmaps in widgets.
XYou must compile \fIxfig\fP with the \fB-DOPENWIN_BUG\fP option for this problem.
X.PP
XIf the image is panned or the \fIxfig\fP window iconified and de-iconified
Xduring the middle of an operation (e.g. while drawing a line), the picture
Xwill be distorted.  This can be corrected using \fIRedraw\fP after the
Xoperation is complete.
X.PP
XRotated text will be displayed horizontally or vertically (i.e. angles
Xof 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees) on the screen.
XThey will be rotated correctly when printed on \fIPostScript\fP output.
X.PP
XCorners of object scaled with point positioning in one of the grid
Xmodes will not always fall on the grid line, but to the closest pixel.
