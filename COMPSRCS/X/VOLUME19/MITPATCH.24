Patches for a variety of problems in R5 are available via anonymous
ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu and via the xstuff mail archive server on
expo.lcs.mit.edu.

Fixes are available via anonymous ftp to export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
in the directory /pub/R5/fixes/.  The file for this fix is "fix-24".
Instructions for applying the fix are included in the file.  Fixes usually
propagate to other distribution sites as well, so it may pay to check at a
nearer site first.

For those without ftp access, individual fixes can be obtained by mail by
sending a message to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11).  In the usual
case, the message should have a subject line and no body, or a single-line
body and no subject.  For example, make the line:
	send fixes 24
to get this fix.  To get a summary of fixes, make the line:
	index fixes
If you need help, make the line:
	help
Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return
addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If you
happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
	path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
	path zot!gzork!me@uunet.uu.net
in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.

Brief notes on what fix 24 corrects:


Xt: XtMakeGeometryRequest can emit erroneous ConfigureWindow requests
Xt: merging databases with Xlib can invalidate Xt's cached database
Xt: ExtractLocaleName() returns NULL when locale is C
Xt: XtAppAddInput might not handle maximum open file descriptors
Xt: XtRemoveInput when multiple callbacks on same source and condition
Xt: XtGrabKeyboard and XtGrabPointer with an unrealized widget
Xt: SelectionI.h assumes sizeof(long) == 32
Xt: returns selection value allocated by Xlib
Xt: selection owners that specify a done_proc, with certain requests
Xt: internal event handler unnecessarily asks for nonmaskable events
Xt: assumes all key translators use the same standard modifiers
Xt: faulty grab registration
Xt: missing parameters in unsupported DEBUG code in TMgrab.c
Xt: action proc binding reference count overflows at 4096
Xt: parsing and matching productions containing key sequences
Xt: parsing of productions containing "None" and "Any" modifiers
Xt: parsing productions with Meta as event abbreviation
Xt: semantics of productions with "Any" should be AnyModifier
Xt: XtOverrideTranslations fails to override double click translations
Xt: VarCreate.c assumes ability to assign to a va_list type
Xt: Alloc.c: conflicting typedef when XTTRACEMEMORY #defined
Xt: nonsense about uninitialized memory by Purify in Create.c
Xt: unused structure item in timeout representation
