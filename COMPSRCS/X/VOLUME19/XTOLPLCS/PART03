XFrom 1.3 (patchlevel 3) -> 1.3.1 (patchlevel 3.1):
X-------------------------------------------------
X
X  - Changed the adding of geometry options to be the first options as opposed
X    to adding them onto the end.  This is especially needed for programs that
X    have an option that needs to go at the end (i.e. xterm's -e option).
X    (brought to my attention by etj90)
X
XFrom 1.2 (patchlevel 2) -> 1.3 (patchlevel 3):
X---------------------------------------------
X
X  - Fixed compile bugs as reported by gcc.  Add gcc support in Imakefile
X    and Makefile.simple (they are commented out). (compile bugs brought
X    to my addention by Michael Salmon, Chung Tin Kwok, Simon Leinen, Nelson
X    Minar, Malcolm C. Strickland)
X
X  - Fixed bug which caused xtoolplaces to core dump (when epoch is around).
X    (brought to my attention by Ted Rodriguez-Bell).
X
XFrom 1.2 Beta (patchlevel 1) -> 1.2 Final (patchlevel 2):
X--------------------------------------------------------
X  - Added support for emacs (source code supplied by Kresten).
X
X  - Added support for xconsole (suggested by Matthias Pfuetzner).
X
X  - The function strdup() was added for systems that don't have it
X    (brought to my attention by Renato).
X
X  - Put double quotes around options with whitespace in them (brought to
X    my attention by Larry W. Virden).
X
XFrom 1.1 Beta (patchlevel 1) -> 1.2 Beta (patchlevel 1):
X-------------------------------------------------------
X
X  - Added checking of a null WM_COMMAND (Filemgr's wastebasket and
X    Mailtool's Compose window) (problem found by Larry E. Wagner).
X
XFrom 1.0 -> 1.1 Beta (patchlevel 1):
X-----------------------------------
X
X  - Added handling of resources as defined in Volume One, Xlib Programming
X    Manual, p. 346 (suggested by Larry W. Virden).
X
X  - Fixed bug in fix_command(), didn't take into account that X positions
X    can have + and - signs in them.
