Subject:  v26INF3:  Future plans for comp.sources.unix
Newsgroups: comp.sources.unix

Posting-number: Volume 26, Info 3
Archive-name: index26.3

This is the third introductory message about comp.sources.unix.
The first described how to submit sources to comp.sources.unix, where the
archive sites are, and how to contact them.  The second one listed all the
sources that have been published in this newsgroup.  This one lists some
of the moderators' plans for the future.

1. There's a new mailing list which receives copies of all articles posted
   on comp.sources.unix.  The list is called unix-sources@pa.dec.com (or
   uunet!decwrl!unix-sources, for the domain-impaired).  Send requests
   about being added or deleted to the -request address, not to the
   moderator.  If you are on the BRL list now, you will be moved to the new
   list automatically, some time before the end of Volume 26 (this one).

2. We're going to alter our posting software so that parts 2..last of any
   submission, and any patches, have a "References:" header pointing back
   to part 1.  This will make threaded news readers (and notes readers)
   happier.

3. We're going to restructure the archives and the index to group together
   all versions and patches for any package so that you can tell at a glance
   what the most recent version of something is, and where it is.  We will
   not be deleting old versions, since although mostly useless, they have
   historic and sentimental value.  We will endeavour to make the old-style
   index listings still "work", probably through the use of copious symbolic
   links on the archive hosts.

4. Volume 25 had in it all the things that were in the previous moderator's
   work queue when we took over.  Volume 26 (this one) will have all the
   things which have been submitted since we took over, possibly including
   the things that come in between now (when Volume 26 is open but empty)
   and whenever we get done with all the things presently in the queue.

5. Moderator's lament: you can see that the sources have not been flowing
   all that smoothly.  Digging through many megabytes of old sources to
   find the things that still need to be posted, has taken time.  Contacting
   each author to check for newer versions or patches has taken more time.
   Testing and repacking the sources takes still more time.  Even so, we
   are caught up somewhat and are making visible progress.  (Rich, wherever
   you are, buy yourself an ice cream cone for all the times I yelled about
   my sources not being published quickly -- this is A LOT OF WORK.  --vix)
