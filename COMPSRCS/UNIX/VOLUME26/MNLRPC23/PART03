X@chapter Overview
X@cindex Overview
X
This document describes my C++ interface to Sun Remote Procedure Calls.
It is based on sources from Peter Bersen that I got from some newsgroup,
though I don't remember which one. I liked the basic idea but disliked
several aspects of the interface details. So I adapted it to my likes. I
intended some minor changes but soon found myself renaming classes,
changing method parameters, introducing new classes, etc. The result is
by no way compatible with the original version. It is, I hope,
nevertheless useful.
X
Basically, the interface defines six class: @code{XdrInfo},
X@code{RpcRequest}, @code{RpcCallback}/@code{RpcMethodCall},
X@code{RpcService} and @code{RpcStub}.
X
X@code{XdrInfo} objects describe the external data representation of a
type. There are predefined @code{XdrInfo}s for the basic types.
X@code{RpcRequest} objects describe the available procedure calls. They
are constructed from a unique request number, the @code{XdrInfo}s of the
procedure's arguments and its return type. @code{RpcCallback} is an
object that holds a pointer to a function and information about the
number of its arguments. @code{RpcMethodCall} is a template that in a
similar way holds a pointer to an object and one of its methods and
Information about the number of its arguments.
X
An @code{RpcRequest} and its matching @code{RpcCallback} or
X@code{RpcMethodCall} may be registered with an @code{RpcService}.
XExactly one object of type @code{RpcService} may be instantiated in a
program that implements an RPC server. Method @code{Provide ()} is a
loop that waits for requests and dispatches them.
X
A client program instantiates an object of type @code{RpcStub}.  The
constructor establishes a connection to the server specified by its
arguments. Procedures of the server may be invoked using method
X@code{Call (@dots{})}.

X@chapter Installation
X@cindex Installation
X
The rpc++ library has successfully been tested using a patched gcc-2.2.2
on a SparcStation running SunOS 4.1.[12] and a 386 system running
Interactive Unix (a SYSV 3.2). Patching gcc-2.2.2 was necessary because
the unpatched version can't handle typedefs that are local to templates.
The bug report with patches can be found in the source directory in file
X@code{gcc-2.2.2.fix}.
X
As a prerequisite to using RPCs with C++ you need ANSI-C/C++ conformant
header files for RPC. I have provided such files in the directory
X@code{StdHdrs/rpc} of the source tree. To avoid any copyright conflicts,
they are derived from the public available RPC source code rather than
from the files that come with SunOS 4.1.X. The differences are minor.
The SunOS 4.1.X files define some additional functions. You have to
either copy the files from @code{StdHdrs/rpc} or patched files from your
X@code{/usr/include/rpc} to a directory where gcc can find them. If you
don't want to install them globally in gcc's include directory, you can
include them by using an additional ``@code{-I}'' flag during
compilation.
X
In SunOS you can simply type `@code{make install INSTROOT=@dots{}}'
which will make the library and install it in @code{INSTROOT/lib} and
the header files in @code{INSTROOT/include/rpc++}.  Other Unices will
probably have problems with the `install' command. Type only `make' and
copy the resulting @code{librpc++.a} to your local library directory and
the files @code{rpc++/*} to an @code{rpc++}-subdirectory of your local
include directory.

Class XdrInfo describes serializers. It combines the xdrproc_t with the
size info (the size of the data to be converted) usually needed if you
want to apply a serializer.
X@end deftp
X
There is only one constructor for @code{XdrInfo}:
X
X@deftypefn Constructor {} XdrInfo (xdrproc_t @var{t}, size_t @var{s})
Construct an @code{XdrInfo} for a type. The type can be converted to an
external data representation (serielized) with function @var{t}. Its
size (in bytes, from @code{sizeof (type)}), is @var{s}.
X@end deftypefn
X
The methods query the information given to the constructor:
X
X@deftypefn Method xdrproc_t Proc () const
Return the conversion function stored in an @code{XdrInfo}.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method size_t Size () const
Return the size of the type described by the @code{XdrInfo}.
X@end deftypefn
X
There are a number of predefined @code{XdrInfo}s. They are defined as

Declared in: @code{"rpc++/request.h"}
X
X@deftp Class RpcRequest
RpcRequest is a class that specifies a request for a procedure that is
part of (registered with) a service.
X@end deftp
X
There are several constructors for @code{RpcRequest}. They vary in the
number of @code{XdrInfo}s used to describe the input parameters of the
procedure.
X
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcRequest (u_long @var{reqid}, const XdrInfo* @var{out}, ReqType @var{t}=normal)
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcRequest (u_long @var{reqid}, const XdrInfo* @var{out}, const XdrInfo* @var{in1}, ReqType @var{t}=normal)
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcRequest (u_long @var{reqid}, const XdrInfo* @var{out}, const XdrInfo* @var{in1}, const XdrInfo* @var{in2}, ReqType @var{t}=normal)
These constructors construct an @code{RpcRequest} for a procedure with
zero, one or two arguments. Additional similar constructors are defined
for procedures with up to seven arguments. @var{reqid} uniquely
identifies the request (the procedure of the server). @var{reqid} may
not be 0. The @code{XdrInfo*}s following @var{reqid} specify the types of
the input parameters. They are followed by the @code{XdrInfo*} that
describes the type of the value returned by the RPC. If no value is
returned, @code{&Xdr::Xvoid} must be given as argument
X(@pxref{XdrInfo}). The final optional argument @var{t} specifies the
call mode: @code{RpcRequest::normal}, @code{RpcRequest::batched} or
X@code{RpcRequest::async} (see below).
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcRequest (u_long @var{reqid}, const XdrInfo* @var{out}, const XdrInfo** @var{intypes}, ReqType @var{t}=normal)
This constructor can be used to construct an @code{RpcRequest} with an
arbitrary number of arguments. The pointers to @code{XdrInfo} are passed
in an array. The number of elements in the array must be one more than
the number of parameters and the last element must be zero.
X@end deftypefn
X
If the request type @var{t} is @code{RpcRequest::normal}, method
X@code{Call} (@pxref{RpcStub}) assembles the message to the server, sends
it, waits for a reply and returns the result.
X
If the request type is @code{RpcRequest::batched}, method
X@code{RpcStub::Call} assembles the message to the server and puts it in
a buffer. Messages are only flushed if the buffer is full or
X@code{RpcStub::Call} is used with a @code{normal} or @code{async}
request.
X
If the request type is @code{RpcRequest::async}, method
X@code{RpcStub::Call} (@pxref{RpcStub}) assembles the message to the
server and sends it, as with @code{normal}. It does, however, not wait
for a result. Mode @code{async} is implemented by calling the underlying
RPC--function @code{clnt_call} with a timeout of zero.
X
As in both non--normal cases (@code{batched} and @code{async})
X@code{RpcStub::Call} does not wait for a return value from the server,
the return type of the @code{RpcRequest} must be specified as
X@code{&Xdr::Xnull}.
X
Note that requests that are registered for a service are stored in an
array using the request identification as the index, so keep ids small.
X
Normally, requests should be specified in a header file included by both
the server and the client program (@pxref{Matching server and clients}).

As could be seen from the parameter types in the constructors, functions
and methods that are called in response to a request from a client know
only about pointers to void as arguments and result values because their
real type is coded in the @code{RpcRequest} and not known at compile
time. The only way to avoid this is to implement some kind of rpcgen++.
However, I never liked this kind of tools and I'm willing to risk a bit
of type unsafeness in this case.
X
When a procedure (or method) is called, its arguments point to values
X(the variants with an arbitrary number of arguments receive an array of
pointers to values) of the types specified in the constructor of the
X@code{RpcRequest} that led to the invocation of the procedure. I
recommend to access the values and assign them to local variables of the
procedure in the first statements. E.g.:
X@example
void* Add (void* s1p, void* s2p)
X@{
X  int s1 = *(int*)s1p;
X  int s2 = *(int*)s2p;
X  ...
X@end example
X
The return value of the procedure is a pointer to the result. Therefore,
results may never be put in automatic variables. They must be global or
static. E.g.:
X@example
X  ...
X  static int sum;
X  sum = s1 + s2;
X  return (void*)&sum;
X@}
X@end example
X
Note the special case of strings (defined as parameters or return values
using @code{Xdr::Xwrapstring}, @pxref{XdrInfo}). If you think of a
string as being defined as a type ``@code{typedef char* string}'', it is
obvious that a string is passed as argument or returned as result by a
X@code{string*}, i.e., a @code{char**}. E.g.:
X@example
void* Capitalize (void* strp)
X@{
X  static char* str;
X  str = *(char**)strp;
X  str[0] = toupper (str[0]);
X  return (void*)&str;

Declared in: @code{"rpc++/service.h"}
X
X@deftp Class RpcService
An object of type @code{RpcService} provides the server capabilities
within a program.
X@end deftp
X
There are two constructors for @code{RpcService}:
X
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcService (u_long @var{prog}, u_long @var{vers})
Construct an object representing the @var{vers}'th version of program
X(service) number @code{prog}.
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcService (u_long @var{vers})
Construct an object representing the @var{vers}'th version of a transient
program (service).
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method bool OK ()
Returns TRUE if the service is ready for operation, i.e., has successfully
been established during construction.
X@end deftypefn
X
The number of a service, especially a transient service, can be obtained
with method @code{@w{Program ()}}:
X
X@deftypefn Method u_long Program ()
Returns the number of the program (service). This is either the number
passed as an argument to the constructor or a number from the transient
program area.
X@end deftypefn
X
The next step after the construction of an @code{RpcService} is to
register the requests handled by the service:
X
X@deftypefn Method {virtual void} Register (const RpcRequest& @var{req}, const AnyRpcCallback& @var{cb})
Associate request @var{req} with the procedure or object/method pair
specified by @code{cb}. The usual way to call @code{Register} is
X@example
X@{
X  RpcService svc (...);
X  svc.register (addreq, RpcCallback (Add));
X  ...
X@}
X@end example
X@end deftypefn
X
If a service is to be provided no longer, it can be unregistered:
X
X@deftypefn Method {virtual void} Unregister (const RpcRequest& @var{req})
Undoes the effect of a previous Register with the same argument
X@var{req}.
X@end deftypefn
X
Sometimes servers provide ``dynamic'' services. The numbers of these
services are send to the clients as, e.g., results of some well known
request and can be used by the server and the client to construct an
RpcRequest. A number representing such a dynamic service can be
allocated with @code{ReserverService}:
X
X@deftypefn Method {u_long} ReserveService ()
Returns a service number that is not in use yet.
X@end deftypefn
X
Of course, @code{ReserveService} should only be called after all well
known services have been registered.  A Service number allocated by
X@code{ReserveService} is freed if the service is subsequently
unregistered.
X
After all requests have been registered, the object of type
X@code{RpcService} can provide the service:
X@deftypefn Method void Provide ()
Repeatedly wait for a request and handle it by calling the procedure or
method registered for it.
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Method void Provide (timeval& @var{maxWait})
Waits until the time specified by @var{maxWait} has expired or a service
has been requested and handled.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method {virtual void*} HandleError ()
X@code{HandleError} is a protected method that is called when an error
occurs. The cause of the error is stored in a protected member variable
X@code{errorState}. If the default error handling (shown below) is not
appropriate for your application, derive your own class from
X@code{RpcService} that implements a different error handling policy. If
you consider an error recoverable, reset @code{errorState} to
X@code{RpcService::noError} in your error handler. Else, @code{OK ()}
keeps returning FALSE.
X@example
void RpcService::HandleError ()
X@{
X  switch (errorState)
X    @{
X    case reconstructionAttempt:
X      cerr << "rpc++: Attempt to construct another instance of RpcService.\n";
X      exit (1);
X    case cantCreateTCPService:
X      cerr << "rpc++: can't create tcp service.\n";
X      exit(1);
X    case cantRegisterService:
X      cerr << form ("rpc++: can't register (%d, %d, tcp).", prog, vers);
X      exit(1);
X    case cantSendReply:
X      cerr << "rpc++: can't reply to RPC call.\n";
X      break;
X    case invalidResult:
X      cerr << "rpc++: registered routine has return NULL pointer.\n";
X      abort ();
X    case notRegistered:
X      cerr << "rpc++: requested RPC routine not registered.\n";
X      break;
X    case cantGetArgs:
X      cerr << "rpc++: can't get procedure arguments.\n";
X      break;
X    case cantFreeArgs:
X      cerr << "rpc++: can't free XDR arguments.\n";
X      break;
X    @}
X  errorState = noError;
X@}
X@end example
X@end deftypefn
X
If the program that provides the service has other things to do as well,
i.e., does not only handle requests, it usually has its own main loop
that handles events. This loop must be extended to handle RPC events,
i.e., if anything happens on the RPC file descriptors, it must call
X@code{svc_getreqset} just as @code{Provide ()} does.
X@example
void RpcService::Provide ()
X@{
X  int dtbsz = getdtablesize();
X  fd_set readfds;
X
X  for(;;)
X    @{
X      readfds = svc_fdset;
X      switch(select (dtbsz, &readfds, 0, 0, 0))
X        @{
X        case -1:
X          if (errno != EBADF)
X            continue;
X          cerr << "PRC++: select: " << sys_errlist[errno] << '\n';
X          return;
X          break;
X        case 0:
X          continue;
X        default:
X          svc_getreqset (&readfds);
X          break;
X        @}
X    @}
X@}
X@end example
X
The following methods are only available during the execution of a
callback, i.e., they can be applied to @code{RpcService} if a pointer to
the invoking object has been declared as last parameter of a callback
routine.
X
X@deftypefn Method {struct sockaddr_in*} Caller ()
Return the socket address information of the calling host.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method char* CallerName ()
Return the name of the calling host.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method void Reply ()
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Method void Reply (void* @var{res})
Normally, a request to the server terminates when the callback completes
X(either with or without returning a value, depending on the return
type). In some cases it is desirable to reply to the client before all
the actions related to the request have been completed. This allows the
client to resume execution. The result (if any) must of course not
depend on the functions still to be executed.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method void Interrupt ()
This is the proper way to terminate the loop entered by calling
X@code{Provide()}. After return from the callback that invoked
X@code{Interrupt()} method @code{Provide()} will return.

X
Declared in: @code{"rpc++/stub.h"}
X
X@deftp Class RpcStub
An @code{RpcStub} represents the client side of a connection.
X@end deftp
X
There are two constructors for @code{RpcStub} that vary in the position
of their arguments only:
X
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcStub (u_long @code{prognum}, u_long @code{versnum}, char* @var{hostname}="localhost", timeval @var{timeout}=defaultTimeout, bool @var{connect}=TRUE)
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Constructor {} RpcStub (u_long @code{prognum}, u_long @code{versnum}, char* @var{hostname}="localhost", bool @var{connect}=TRUE, timeval @var{timeout}=defaultTimeout)
Construct an @code{RpcStub} that connects to the @var{versnum}'th
version of program (service) @var{prognum} on host @var{hostname}. The
timeout for successful completion of communication operations is
X@var{timeout} which defaults to 25 seconds. Unless @var{connect} is
false, the constructor makes a connection attempt.
X@end deftypefn
X
There are various methods:
X
X@deftypefn Method void Reconnect (bool @var{handle_errors} = TRUE)
Connect to the server. Usually this method is called if the connection
was not to be established by the constructor or if the connection
attempt failed and is to be repeated. If @var{handle_errors} is
X@code{FALSE}, no error handler is called in case of failure.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method bool OK ()
Returns TRUE if the stub is ready for operation, i.e., connected to a
server.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method CLIENT* Service ()
Access to the standard RPC level. Returns the handle that identifies the
server.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method timeval GetTimeout () const
Returns the default timeout for network operations.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method void SetTimeout (timeval& @var{timo})
Sets the default timeout for network operations
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method void* Call (RpcRequest& @var{req}, bool @var{handle_errors}=TRUE)
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Method void* Call (RpcRequest& @var{req}, void* @var{in1}, bool @var{handle_errors}=TRUE)
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Method void* Call (RpcRequest& @var{req}, void* @var{in1}, @var{in2} bool @var{handle_errors}=TRUE)
Request the operation specified by @var{req} from the server, passing
zero, one or two arguments. There are declarations of this method for up
two seven arguments. Arguments are passed as pointers to the argument
values. The value returned by @code{Call} is a pointer to the result
returned by the server. The result is valid until @code{Call} is called
again. If @var{handle_errors} is FALSE and an error occurs, @code{Call}
simply returns 0. Else, it calls method @code{HandleError} (see below).
X@end deftypefn
X@deftypefn Method void* Call (RpcRequest& @var{req}, void** @var{invals}, bool @var{handle_errors}=TRUE)
The variant of @code{Call} that handles an arbitrary number of
arguments.  Pointers to the arguments are passed in an array in
parameter @var{invals}. The size of the array must match the number of
arguments given to the constructor of @var{req}.
X@end deftypefn
X
X@deftypefn Method {virtual void*} HandleError ()
X@code{HandleError} is a protected method that is called when an error
occurs. The cause of the error is stored in a protected member variable
X@code{errorState}. If the default error handling policy (shown below) is
not appropriate for your application, derive your own class from
X@code{RpcStub} that implements a different one. If you consider an error
recoverable, reset @code{errorState} to @code{RpcStub::noError} in your
error handler. Else, @code{OK ()} keeps returning FALSE.  If an error
occurs during a @code{Call} and parameter @var{handle_errors} is TRUE,
X@code{Call} invokes @code{HandleError} and returns its result as result
of the call.
X@example
void* RpcStub::HandleError ()
X@{
X  switch (errorState)
X    @{
X    case notConnected:
X      cerr << "rpc++: Stub has not been connected to server.\n";
X    case cantCreate:
X      cerr << clnt_spcreateerror ("rpc++") << '\n';
X      break;
X    case cantCall:
X      cerr << clnt_sperror (svc, "rpc++") << '\n';
X      exit (1);
X    @}
X  return 0;
X@}
X@end example
X@end deftypefn
X
If the cause of an error can be detected and fixed (e.g., using
X@code{Reconnect}, @code{ReCall} can be called to repeat the call that
caused the error in the first place with its original arguments:
X
X@deftypefn Method void* ReCall (bool @var{handle_errors})
May be called from within an error handler only. Repeats any previous
call and returns its result (or 0 in case of failure). Normally,
X@var{handle_errors} should be @code{FALSE} to avoid infinite recursive
calls of the error handler.
X@end deftypefn
X
X
While no or little improvement of coding quality can be gained from
deriving a service specific class from @code{RpcService}, the opposite
is true for @code{RpcStub}.  A service specific derivation may define
methods that have the ``real'' argument lists instead of pointers to
void. These methods are simply implemented by casting the arguments and
X(inline) calling one of the @code{Call}--methods. Apart from better
type checking, this has the advantage of keeping details like the
available @code{RpcRequest}s local to the definition of the derived
class (see the example in the @code{example}--directory).

X@cindex Global objects
X
As a general C++ rule, be careful with global objects. The sequence of
constructor invocations for global objects is not defined. This is the
reason, why @code{RpcRequests} are constructed from pointers to
X@code{XdrInfo}s rather than from @code{XdrInfo}s.
X
Both @code{XdrInfo}s and @code{RpcRequest}s tend to be instantiated as
global objects or static member variables. If the constructor of
X@code{RpcRequest} received @code{XdrInfo}s instead of pointers and
copied the information contained in the @code{XdrInfo} (the solution I
had preferred), it may happen that the @code{XdrInfo} has not been
constructed yet and thus contains invalid data.
X
The same problem occurs if you want to define a global
X``alias--@code{XdrInfo}'' matching a ``@code{typedef int myint}''.
Don't use @code{XdrInfo Xmyint (Xdr::Xint)} as this may copy the
uninitialized @code{Xdr::Xint}. Use @code{XdrInfo& Xmyint = Xdr::Xint}
instead.

X@cindex Destruction rules
X
Objects of type @code{XdrInfo} are resources that can be used more than
once, i.e., in different @code{RpcRequest}s. If they were handled
properly, references to @code{XdrInfo} would be counted and the
X@code{XdrInfo} destructed automatically if the last reference is
removed (unless it is the @code{XdrInfo} of a predefined type).
X
Such a resource management for @code{XdrInfo}s has been considered
unnecessary as @code{XdrInfo}s will rarely be dynamic objects. If the
user allocates an @code{XdrInfo} on the stack or the heap, it is his
responsibility to assure that the object is valid until the last
X@code{RpcResource} that uses it has been destructed.

X@section Matching server and clients
X
In order to make sure that the server and the clients agree about the
protocol, all @code{RpcRequest}s for a service should be declared in a
header file and instantiated in a corresponding source file. The header
file and the compiled source file make the ``library'' that provides the
service. Thus a server consists of three files: the server executable, a
header file defining the service that is to be included in client
sources and an object file which must be linked to the client
executable.

X@display
Copyright @copyright{} 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
X675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
XEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

X
X@unnumberedsec Preamble
X
X  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.
X
X  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.
X
X  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
X
X  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
X
X  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
X
X  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
X
X  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.
X
X  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.
X
X  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.
X
X  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.
X
X  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
X
X  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.
X
X  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
X``work based on the library'' and a ``work that uses the library''.  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.
X
X  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

X@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
X@end ifinfo
X
X@enumerate
X@item
This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called ``this License'').  Each licensee is
addressed as ``you''.
X
X  A ``library'' means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
X(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
X
X  The ``Library'', below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A ``work based on the
Library'' means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ``modification''.)
X
X  ``Source code'' for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
X
X  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
X
X@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
X
X  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
X
X@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
X
X@enumerate
X@item
The modified work must itself be a software library.
X
X@item
You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
X
X@item
You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
X
X@item
If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.
X
X(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
X@end enumerate
X
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
X
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
X
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
X
X@item
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
X
X  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
X
X  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
X
X@item
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
X
X  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
X
X@item
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ``work that uses the Library''.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
X
X  However, linking a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ``work that uses the
library''.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
X
X  When a ``work that uses the Library'' uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
X
X  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
X
X  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
X
X@item
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
X
X  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
X
X@enumerate
X@item
Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ``work that
uses the Library'', as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)
X
X@item
Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.
X
X@item
If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.
X
X@item
Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
X@end enumerate
X
X  For an executable, the required form of the ``work that uses the
Library'' must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
X
X  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
X
X@item
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
X
X@enumerate
X@item
Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.
X
X@item
Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
X@end enumerate
X
X@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
X
X@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
X
X@item
XEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
X
X@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
X
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
X
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
X
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
X
X@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
X
X@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
X
XEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
X``any later version'', you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
X
X@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing

X@unnumberedsec How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
X
X  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).
X
X  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
X``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
