X.SH NAME
X.LP
X\fButree\fR \- Screen oriented filesystem browser and utility
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.LP
utree [options] [rootdirectory]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.LP
The screen oriented filesystem browser and utility
X\fButree\fR descends the directory hierarchy
rooted in your home directory,
defined in a tree list file if given,
or rooted in \fBrootdirectory\fR if given,
and displays the directory tree on the so called \fItree screen\fR.
On the \fItree screen\fR \fButree\fR lets you walk thru the tree,
execute some default and user defined commands on it
and change to any directory in the tree.
X.br
If you have changed to a directory \fButree\fR displays all files
in this directory on the so called \fIfile screen\fR.
On the \fIfile screen\fR \fButree\fR lets you walk thru the file list
and execute some default and user defined commands on files.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.LP
The following command line options are interpreted by \fButree\fR:
X.sp
X.TP 16
X\fB-L\fR
XFollow symbolic links to directories
X.TP
X\fB-S\fR

X.TP
X\fB-a\fR
Read in all directories,
including those that begin with a dot (.),
which are normally skipped
X.TP
X\fB-b\fR
Suppress ringing of the bell (useful for visual bells)
X.TP
X\fB-c\fR
Don't display and update a clock every second
X.TP
X\fB-d var=[val]\fR
Set the variable \fBvar\fR to value \fBval\fR
or unset the variable \fBvar\fR
X.TP
X\fB-d typ:[cmd]\fR
Define the command \fBcmd\fR for the filetype \fBtyp\fR
or undefine any command for the filetype \fBtyp\fR

X.TP
X\fB-l lev\fR
Build the tree up to level \fBlev\fR for quicker startup
X.TP
X\fB-o\fR
Omit saving changes in variables and filetype command definitions,
command history and key bindings
X.TP
X\fB-p lin\fR
Use \fBlin\fR lines for displaying filenames of the current directory
on the \fItree screen\fR (default: 3)
X.TP
X\fB-q\fR
Build the tree up to level 2 (like -l 2)
X.TP
X\fB-r\fR
Build the tree scanning and reading the file system
instead of reading a tree list file
X.TP
X\fB-s\fR
Don't use hardware scrolling
X.TP
X\fB-u\fR

the tree from a tree list file
X.TP
X\fB-v mod\fR
Set using video attributes to mode \fBmod\fR.
X\fBmod\fR may be \fB2\fR for all possible,
X\fB1\fR for bold and underline
and \fB0\fR for none video attributes.
X.TP
X\fB-w\fR
Suppress warnings about unreadable directories
X.TP
X\fB-x cmd\fR
Use and execute the string \fBcmd\fR as initial input at startup.
The string \fBcmd\fR is a simple sequence of \fButree\fR commands
X.PP
The boolean options \fBbcgnosw\fR and the
numerical options \fBipv\fR may also be pre-set in
the environment variable \fBUTREE\fR.
XE.g. if you want to suppress ringing of the bell and
displaying and updating the clock and if you prefer a tree indention
of 4 columns set the environment variable \fBUTREE\fR to '\fBbci4\fR'
for this reason.
X.br
Most of the options correspond to \fButree\fR
variables and therefore they may also be set or unset
with the variable command (\fB=\fR).
See the sections \fIglobal commands\fR and \fIvariables\fR below.
X.SH UTREE STARTUP
X.LP
If \fButree\fR is called without the optional command line parameter
X\fBrootdirectory\fR or this directory is rooted in your
home directory \fButree\fR tries to build up the directory tree
reading a file \fB.utreelist\fR in your home directory,
which contains a list of your directory tree created
by a previous \fButree\fR session
or by the additional shell script \fButree.mklist\fR called before.
If the command line option \fB-f lst\fR is given
X\fButree\fR builds up the tree from this list file \fBlst\fR
which may be created with the denoted shell script \fButree.mklist\fR
or a command like \fBfind\fR.
XEntries in such list files have to start with the
directory separator / (slash) in the first column of the line.
All other entries are ignored and skipped.
X.sp
If building the tree from a list file
the file lists of directories are created and read in on demand only,
which means when a directory becomes the current directory
by moving the cursor to this directory.
This speeds up the start of \fButree\fR because there is no need
for scanning and reading the filesystem for subdirectories
what may take some time for larger filesystems.
X.sp
In all others cases,
if no list file is given with the
command line option \fB-f lst\fR,
X\fBrootdirectory\fR is rooted in your home directory
and the file \fB.utreelist\fR is not found,
or the command line option \fB-r\fR is given
X\fButree\fR builds up the tree by
scanning and reading the filesystem recursively.
You can speed up the start with the commandline option
X\fB-l lev\fR which causes \fButree\fR to build the
initial directory tree only up to level \fBlev\fR similar to
the option \fB-l\fR of the well known \fBfind\fR command.
At runtime some commands let you expand the directory
tree later and inspect directories and subtrees
not visible at startup (see below).
X.SH SCREEN LAYOUT
X.LP
The screen is divided into three regions.
The top screen line,
the so called \fIecho line\fR is for displaying
messages and entering input.
The second screen line,
the so called \fIhelp line\fR is for displaying
help messages and the \fButree\fR default
or user defined menu lines.
X.br
The rest of the screen forms a window on the directory tree
on the \fItree screen\fR or
on the file list of the current directory
on the \fIfile screen\fR.
Or he is used for displaying variable or filetype commands settings,
for displaying help pages and displaying command outputs.
X.SH UTREE SCREENS AND MENUS
X.LP
X\fBUtree\fR knows the following screens and menus:
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fBtree screen\fR
This is the initial screen displayed when \fButree\fR is started
and has built up the directory tree.
The \fItree screen\fR forms a window on the directory tree.
The current directory on which most commands are
working is highlighted and the last
screen lines are used to display the first files
of the file list of the current directory.
You may move the window over the directory tree,
enlarge or shrink the directory tree window
or walk thru the directory tree and execute
default and user defined commands on directories and subtrees.
On the help line the most important commands available
for directories or subtrees on
the \fItree screen\fR are shown in the default \fItree menu\fR.
The tree menu shows the names of the
the \fItree screen\fR commands,
the keystrokes to invoke a command are marked with uppercase letters.
You may switch the menu to a user defined menu line
displaying user defined commands for the \fItree screen\fR.
XFor further information about all \fItree screen\fR commands
see the sections \fIglobal commands\fR,
X\fItree screen commands\fR and \fIvariables\fR of this manual page.
X.sp
X.TP
X\fBfile screen\fR
The \fIfile screen\fR forms a window on all files of the
current directory.
The current file on which most commands are
working is highlighted.
Yoy may move the window over the file list
or walk thru the file list and execute
default and user defined commands on files.
On the help line the most important commands
for files available on
the \fIfile screen\fR are shown in the default \fIfile menu\fR.
The file menu displays the names of the
the \fIfile screen\fR commands,
the keystrokes to invoke a command are marked with uppercase letters.
You may switch the menu to a user define menu line
displaying user defined commands for the \fIfile screen\fR.
XFor further information about all \fIfile screen\fR commands
see the sections \fIglobal commands\fR,
X\fIfile screen commands\fR and \fIvariables\fR of this manual page.
X.sp
X.TP
X\fBhelp screen\fR
If you have switched to the \fIhelp screen\fR with
the help command (\fBh\fR)
on the help line the
X\fIhelp menu\fR is displayed and you may
select help about interesting topics.
The help menu displays the names of all
available help topics,
the keystrokes to select help about a topic
are marked with uppercase letters.
XFor more information see the section \fIhelp pages\fR below.
X.sp
X.TP
X\fBvariables screen\fR
If you have switched to the \fIvariables\fR screen with
the variables command (\fB=\fR)
all variables and their settings are displayed
and you may set or unset any of the variables.
On the help line is shown how to set or unset a variable
in a short form.
All changes in variables definitions are
saved to the file \fB.utree\fR in your home directory
if the variable \fBAUTOSAVE\fR is set.
XFor more information see the section \fIvariables\fR below.
X.sp
X.TP
X\fBcommands screen\fR
If you have switched to the filetype \fIcommands screen\fR with
the filetype commands command (\fB:\fR)
all filetype commands and their settings are displayed
and you may set or unset any of the filetype commands.
On the help line is shown how to set or
unset a filetype command in a short form.
All changes in filetype command definitions are
saved to the file \fB.utree\fR in your home directory
if the variable \fBAUTOSAVE\fR is set.
XFor more information see the section \fIfiletype commands\fR below.
X.sp
X.TP
X\fBshell screen\fR
If you have switched to the \fIshell screen\fR with
the shell command (\fB!\fR) for executing commands
not supported directly by \fButree\fR
all previously entered commands saved in a so called
history list are displayed on the \fIshell screen\fR.
You may get any command from the history list
into the line editor for editing and execution
or enter and execute a new command.
All commands up to a maximal number defined in
the variable \fBHISTSIZE\fR are saved in the
history list.
Before leaving \fButree\fR all saved commands
in the history list are saved to a
history file \fB.utreehist\fR in your home directory
if the variable \fBAUTOSAVE\fR is set.
At startup this file is searched for and read in
if found.
XFor more information see also the section \fIvariables\fR below.
X.sp
X.TP
X\fBbindings screen\fR
If you have switched to the \fIbindings screen\fR
with the bindings command (\fB|\fR) all
currently defined key bindings and their meaning are
displayed and you may bind any key to an appropriate
utree command or to insert a string into the
input buffer.
At startup a file \fB.utree-TERM\fR in your home directory
or a file \fButree-TERM\fR in a global startup directory
is read in if found containing key bindings for
the terminal type defined in the environment variable \fBTERM\fR.
All changes in key bindings you have done on the
X\fIbindings screen\fR at runtime are saved to \fB.utree-TERM\fR
if the variable \fBAUTOSAVE\fR is set.
XFor more information see also the section \fBkey bindings\fR
below.
X.sp
X.TP
X\fBstatus screen\fR
The status command (\fBs\fR) displays all information
available about a file or directory on the \fIstatus screen\fR.
Here you may change the ownership, group membership
or access rights of a file or directory.
On BSD systems not all of the denoted changes may be allowed
for normal users.
X.SH KEY NAMING CONVENTIONS AND DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
X.LP
All \fButree\fR commands are simple single letter commands or
control sequences.
The default or user defined commands therefore
are invoked with a single keystroke or a combination
of the <\fICONTROL\fR> key with
another key.
The naming conventions in the following manual sections
for \fButree\fR commands invoked by a keystroke are:
X.sp
X.TP  20
X\fBkey\fR
means hit this <\fIkey\fR> only
X.TP
X\fBC-key\fR
means hold down the <\fICONTROL\fR>-key and hit <\fIkey\fR>
X.PP
To permit rebinding of pre-defined keys or
binding functions keys to \fButree\fR commands
all control sequences have special names.
All key or functions names and their default bindings
are list in the table below

default key bindings are used instead of the
names or functions.
X.PP
Some function keys are supported by \fButree\fR,
i.e. the four arrow or cursor keys,
and are bound to appropriate functions.
See the sections \fIkey bindings\fR and \fIfunction keys\fR
below for more details.
X.SH HELP PAGES

X.SH LINE EDITOR COMMANDS
X.LP
Many \fButree\fR commands need some user input for
further processing which is done with a builtin
simple line editor.
Many commands pre-set the input buffer with
a default input line if this default is known.
XFor some commands you can use the keys
C-n and C-p to scroll in already existing
input lists and select an input line
for editing or processing
without entering the line completely.
The line editor knows about the following functions:
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fBCR,NL\fR
Accept and send the input line
X.TP
X\fBC-c,C-y\fR
Cancel input and leave the line editor
X.TP
X\fBC-o\fR
Switch from overwrite-mode to insert-mode or vice versa
X.TP
X\fBC-l\fR
Redisplay the input line
X.TP
X\fBC-f\fR
Move the cursor one character forward
X.TP
X\fBC-b\fR
Move the cursor one character backward
X.TP

X.TP
X\fBC-n\fR
Get the next entry into the line editor
X.TP
X\fBC-p\fR
Get the previous entry into the line editor
X.PP
All other printable characters are appended at the end of input line,
inserted in insert-mode
or overwrite the character under the cursor in overwrite-mode.
The current mode is displayed at the end of the help line.
Most line editor commands are also available with function keys,
see the section \fIfunction keys\fR below.
X.SH VARIABLES
X.LP
Utree knows about and uses the following variables which may be
set or unset at startup in the startupfile \fB$HOME/.utree\fR,
with some commandline options (see \fIoptions\fR above),
or the variables command (\fB=\fR) on the \fIvariables screen\fR:
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fBBELL\fR
or \fBBL\fR: Allow ringing of the bell if set
X.TP
X\fBCLOCK\fR
or \fBCL\fR: Show and update clock every second if set
X.TP

Not all terminal database termcap or terminfo
definitions of the graphical character set are
correct

X\fBTERMSCROLL\fR
or \fBTS\fR: Use hardware terminal scrolling if set.
On some terminals (i.e. on the X terminal emulator xterm)
redrawing the screen may be faster than scrolling
X.TP
X\fBSCANTREE\fR
or \fBST\fR: Allow scanning the tree for changes if set.
Many commands scan the directory tree after execution
what may take some time.
Prohibiting tree scanning
therefore may speed up \fButree\fR a little bit
X.TP

key bindings and history list
to appropriate files in the home directory
X.TP
X\fBTREEINDENT\fR
or \fBTI\fR: Set the tree level indention column (3 .. 9) if possible.
Normally the tree level indention column is calculated dependent
on the number of screen columns and the maximal filesystem depth automatically
X.TP
X\fBVIDEOMODE\fR
or \fBVM\fR: Set using of video attributes.
X2 means use all possible attributes and their combinations.
X1 means use the attributes reverse and underline only.
X0 means don't use any video attribute.
X.TP
X\fBFILELINES\fR
or \fBFL\fR: Number of lines of the file window on the \fItree screen\fR
X(1 .. 9, default 3)
X.TP
X\fBHISTSIZE\fR
or \fBHS\fR: Maximal number of shell commands which are hold
in the shell commands history list (6 .. 99, default: 22)

editor options
X.TP
X\fBEDITOPTS\fR
or \fBEO\fR: File editor options
X.TP
X\fBPAGER\fR
or \fBPG\fR: Program for viewing files.
When redefining the pager variable don't forget to
check and set or unset the pageopts variable
for pager options
X.TP
X\fBPAGEOPTS\fR
or \fBPO\fR: File pager options
X.TP
X\fBXDUMPER\fR
or \fBXD\fR: Program for hexdumping files.

X.TP
X\fBLPRINTER\fR
or \fBLP\fR: Program for printing files or sending files to the
printer spooling system.
When redefining the lineprinter variable don't forget to
check and set or unset the lprintopts variable
for lineprinter options
X.TP
X\fBLPRINTOPTS\fR
or \fBLO\fR: Printer options
X.TP
X\fBBACKUP\fR
or \fBBK\fR: Program or shell script for backing up a directory or tree
X.TP
X\fBBACKUPOPTS\fR
or \fBBO\fR: Backup options
X.TP
X\fBSHELL\fR
or \fBSH\fR: Interactive shell for shell escape
X.TP
X\fBTREECMD1..9\fR
or \fBT1..9\fR: User defined \fItree screen\fR commands 1 .. 9
X.TP
X\fBFILECMD1..9\fR
or \fBF1..9\fR: User defined \fIfile screen\fR commands 1 .. 9
X.PP
Variables are set with a line '\fBvariable=value\fR'
or '\fBshorthand=value\fR'
X(i.e. '\fBtreecmd1=ps -ef\fR' or '\fBt1=ps -ef\fR')
and unset with a line '\fBvariable=\fR' or '\fBshorthand=\fR'
X(i.e. '\fBt1=\fR').
When defining user tree or file commands some sprintf
like format characters lead in by a percent sign (\fB%\fR) have a
special meaning and are expanded before the command is executed.
XFor further information about the command line format see the
section \fIline formats\fR below.
X.br
The last sharp sign (\fB#\fR) in a variable definition is used as leadin
for a menu item of the defined user file or tree command.
XExample: the variable definition '\fBfc1=wc -l %F #Count\fR' for the user
defined file command 1 is expanded to '\fBwc -l filename\fR'
and in the user command file menu '\fBCount\fR' is displayed
behind menu item 1.
X.SH FILETYPE COMMANDS
X.LP
On \fIfile screen\fR you can execute a file or a command on it
with the \fButree\fR execute command (\fBx\fR).
You are requested for parameters if the current file is executable,
for a command to execute on the
current file if it is not executable.
XFor a type of file you can define so called \fIfiletype commands\fR
which are called if the current file matches a given file pattern.
X.br
XFiletype commands can be set and unset at startup in
the startupfile \fB$HOME/.utree\fR,
with the commandline option \fB-d\fR
or the filetype command (\fB:\fR) similar
to setting and unsetting variables.
XFiletype commands are set with a line like '\fBfiletype:command\fR'
X(i.e. '\fB*.c:cc -c -O\fR').
The command (i.e. '\fBcc -c -O\fR') is then executed
if the current file matches the given file pattern
X(i.e. '\fB*.c\fR' for a C source file ending with '\fB.c\fR').
XFiletype commands are unset with a line '\fBfiletype:\fR'
X(i.e. '\fB*.c:\fR').
X.br
When defining filetype commands some sprintf like format characters
lead in by a percent sign (\fB%\fR) have a special meaning and are
expanded before the command is executed. For further information
about file patterns and the format line
characters and her meaning
see the sections \fIfile patterns\fR
and \fIline formats\fR below.
X.SH LINE FORMATS
X.LP
When defining a user tree or file command
or a filetype command some sprintf like format line
characters are known and expanded before the command is executed.
These format line characters and their meaning are:
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fB%B\fR or \fB%b\fR
is expanded to the basename (filename without extension)
of the current file or directory
X.TP
X\fB%D\fR or \fB%d\fR
is expanded to the full pathname of the current directory
X.TP
X\fB%F\fR or \fB%f\fR
is expanded to the filename of the current file or directory
X.TP
X\fB%H\fR or \fB%h\fR
is expanded to the pathname of your home directory
X.TP
X\fB%P\fR or \fB%p\fR
is expanded to the full pathname of the current file or directory
X.TP
X\fB%R\fR or \fB%r\fR
is expanded to the pathname of the root directory
from where \fButree\fR was started
X.TP
X\fB%S\fR or \fB%s\fR
is expanded to additional parameter(s) for a command which are requested
before the command is executed
X.PP
The command line '\fBcommand %s %f >%b.out\fR' i.e. is expanded before execution
to '\fBcommand parameters filename >basename.out\fR'
with filename of the current file or directory (\fB%f\fR),
basename.out of the current file or directory (\fB%b.out\fR)
and additional parameters (\fB%s\fR)
which are requested before command execution.
X.br
XFor further information about tree, file and filetype commands
see the sections \fIvariables\fR and \fIfiletype commands\fR.
X.SH FILE PATTERNS
X.LP
Some commands (list, find, grep, tag or untag) require
file patterns for matching files using some
special (or meta) characters.
X.br
Shell like filename pattern matching interprets the
following meta characters:
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fB*\fR
matches all characters in a filename
X.TP
X\fB?\fR
matches one character in a filename
X.TP
X\fB[class]\fR
matches one character from a character class.
A character class includes all characters enclosed between
the opening and closing brackets (\fB[\fR and \fB]\fR).
If in a class definition a minus sign (\fB-\fR) is found
between two other characters
this means the range from the character before and the
character behind the minus sign.
If the first character of a class definition is a exclamation mark
X(\fB!\fR) this means matching of all characters excluded those
defined in the class, i.e.
X.TP
X[abc]
matches the characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'
X.TP
X[a-z_]
matches the characters from 'a' to  'z' and '_'
X.TP
X[!a-z_]
matches all characters except 'a' to 'z' and '_'
X.PP
XFile size pattern matching interprets the following
meta characters:
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fB=size\fR
matches all files of size \fBsize\fR
X.TP
X\fB!size\fR
matches all files not of size \fBsize\fR
X.TP
X\fB>size\fR
matches all files larger than \fBsize\fR
X.TP
X\fB<size\fR
matches all files smaller than \fBsize\fR
X.PP
Size may be specified in bytes (\fBb\fR, default),
kilo bytes (\fBk\fR) or mega bytes (\fBm\fR),
i.e. '\fB>2k\fR' matches all files larger than
X2 kilo bytes or 2048 bytes.
X.sp
X.PP
The additional file time pattern matching interprets the
following meta characters:
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fB)time\fR
matches all files modified within \fBtime\fR
X.TP
X\fB(time\fR
matches all files not modified within \fBtime\fR
X.PP
Time may be specified in minutes (\fBm\fR),
hours (\fBh\fR, default), days (\fBd\fR) or weeks (\fBw\fR),
i.e. '\fB)2d\fR' matches all files modified within last 2 days.
X.sp
To combine shell like filename patterns and/or
additional file size and modification time patterns use
X.sp
X.TP 20
X\fB&\fR
for \fBAND\fRing of patterns
X.TP
X\fB|\fR
for \fBOR\fRing of patterns
X.PP
If a character is preceeded by a backslash or enclosed in quotes
his interpretation is suppressed and he is used as he is.
X.SH KEY BINDINGS
X.LP
All defaults key bindings are listed in the section
X\fIkey naming conventions and default key bindings\fR above.
All supported function keys if defined in the termcap or
terminfo terminal database and their default bindings
are listed in the next section.
Rebindings of default keys or additional bindings
of other keys may be done in terminal dependent
startupfiles \fButree-TERM\fR in a global directory
containing \fButree\fR startupfiles or in
files \fB.utree-TERM\fR in your home directory where \fBTERM\fR denotes
the terminal type as defined in the environment variable \fBTERM\fR.
These startup files are built from lines
like \fB'key_sequence=utree_key'\fR
or \fB'key_sequence="string"'\fR.
Key_sequence describes the function key string,
utree_key the \fButree\fR key or function name,
a string enclosed in braces a string to insert
into the input buffer.
A comment lead in by a sharp sign (#) should
contain the name of the bound key.
XFor defining key sequences of function keys
control keys are defined with a
leading caret (^, i.e. ^x, ^? means DEL)
and some other special characters
may be defined lead in by a backslash (\e).
These escaped characters and their meaning are:
b backspace (^h),  f formfeed (^l),
n newline (^j), r return (^m), t tab (^i),
e or E escape (^[ or ESC) and s space.
If a backslash is followed from up to three
digits this defines an octal given character.
I.e. the definition '\ee^O\e003=END' binds the
keystring <ESCAPE> <CONTROL-O> <ASCII-3> to the
X\fButree\fR key or function END.
X.PP
The simplest way to define keys is to switch
to the \fIbindings screen\fR and there to do all bindings.
You have only to hit the key to bind and terminate
the key sequence with CR or NL.
Therefore CR or NL or key sequences containing CR or NL
cannot be bound on the \fIbindings screen\fR.
Then you have to enter the \fButree\fR name where the key
is to bind to.
You can use C-n and C-p to select the wanted name.
At last you should give a short comment to the
bound key(i.e. the key name) for documentation.
If you want to bind a key for insertion of a string
X(and so to bind function keys to simple letter commands)
you have to enter the string enclosed in braces.
I.e. the binding \fB'\eeh="h"'\fR binds the
key <ESCAPE> <h> to the string <h> and the
so called help.
Any bindings you have done on the \fIbindings screen\fR
are saved to a file \fB.utree-TERM\fR into your home directory
if the variable AUTOSAVE is set.
X.SH FUNCTION KEYS
X.LP
The following function keys are supported by \fButree\fR
and pre-bound at startup to appropriate functions
if they are defined in your system's termcap or terminfo database:
