Description:
	Acknowledgment list updated. It's always nice for people who
	contribute to have their effort acknowledged, and it's not nice
	when they contribute and earn no credit for it...

	Badtart wrongly reported end-of-tape when last block was short,
	hence usually missing small files held in that (incomplete) block.
	Thanks to Kim Walden <kim@enea.se> for putting me on the right
	track.

Repeat-By:

	Run the following:

		echo "abc" > foo		# Create small file
		kit foo					# Kit it
		mv foo foo.orig			# Save original
		unkit -b Kit01			# Unkit via badtar
		
	before applying this patch and see how unkit misses the file....
	Apply the patch and try again to make sure unkit catches that
	small file.

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -p -N -d DIR", where DIR is your kit source
	directory.  Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch -p -N <thisarticle".
	If you don't have the patch program, apply the following by hand,
	or get patch (version 2.0, latest patchlevel).

	After patching:
		make clean
		Configure -d
		make
		make install

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel.h file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

	If you are missing previous patches they can be obtained from me:

		Raphael Manfredi <ram@eiffel.com>

	If you send a mail message of the following form it will greatly speed
	processing:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailpatch PATH kit 2.0 LIST
			   ^ note the c

	where PATH is a return path FROM ME TO YOU either in Internet notation,
	or in bang notation from some well-known host, and LIST is the number
	of one or more patches you need, separated by spaces, commas, and/or
	hyphens.  Saying 35- says everything from 35 to the end.

	To get some more detailed instructions, send me the following mail:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailhelp PATH
