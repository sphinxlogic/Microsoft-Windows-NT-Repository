[The latest patch for kit version 2.0 is #28.]

System: kit version 2.0
Patch #: 25
Priority: HIGH
Subject: forgot checks for archives with more than 10 parts
Subject: kit's own shar removes ark*isdone for multipart archives
Date: Wed Feb 10 15:29:07 PST 1993
From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@eiffel.com>

Description:
	Sanity checks for multipart archives could fail if using kit's own
	shell archive builder, or when the archive had more than 10 parts.
	Indeed, the 'rm' line scanned by the 'secure' script would be
	incorrectly diagnosed as insecure in those cases.

Repeat-By:
	Build a kit with more than 10 parts (for instance using a small
	-S option) and then try to unkit it with perl secure checks.
	It will miserably fail...

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -p -N -d DIR", where DIR is your kit source
	directory.  Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch -p -N <thisarticle".
	If you don't have the patch program, apply the following by hand,
	or get patch (version 2.0, latest patchlevel).

	After patching:
		make clean
		Configure -d
		make
		make install

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel.h file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

	If you are missing previous patches they can be obtained from me:

		Raphael Manfredi <ram@eiffel.com>

	If you send a mail message of the following form it will greatly speed
	processing:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailpatch PATH kit 2.0 LIST
			   ^ note the c

	where PATH is a return path FROM ME TO YOU either in Internet notation,
	or in bang notation from some well-known host, and LIST is the number
	of one or more patches you need, separated by spaces, commas, and/or
	hyphens.  Saying 35- says everything from 35 to the end.

	To get some more detailed instructions, send me the following mail:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailhelp PATH
