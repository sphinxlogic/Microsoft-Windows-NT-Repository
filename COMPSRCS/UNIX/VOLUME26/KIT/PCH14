Patch #: 14

Subject: a missing quote led to a syntactically incorrect archive
Date: Tue Mar 24 13:46:34 PST 1992
From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@eiffel.com>

Description:
	This patch has a low priority if you use 'cshar' for archive
	packing. Otherwise, there is a severe bug in rshar.SH which
	prevented it from actually working.

	Addresses in README updated (credits section).

	Fixed some loose declarations in badtar.c.

	Fixed a typo in makeshar.SH. In case an incorrect option
	was found, the error report was not accurrate.

	Determination of user name made more portable. If logname is
	not available (e.g. on BSD systems), whoami is used instead.

	A missing quote in rshar.SH led to a syntactically incorrect
	archive. The generated test for file length was not properly
	terminated by a 'fi'. This bug was reported by Gurvan Lullien
	<lullien@inf.enst.fr>.

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -p -N -d DIR", where DIR is your kit source
	directory.  Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch -p -N <thisarticle".
	If you don't have the patch program, apply the following by hand,
	or get patch (version 2.0, latest patchlevel).

	After patching:
		Configure -d
		make
		make install

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel.h file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

	If you are missing previous patches they can be obtained from me:

		Raphael Manfredi <ram@eiffel.com>

	If you send a mail message of the following form it will greatly speed
	processing:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailpatch PATH kit 2.0 LIST
			   ^ note the c

	where PATH is a return path FROM ME TO YOU either in Internet notation,
	or in bang notation from some well-known host, and LIST is the number
	of one or more patches you need, separated by spaces, commas, and/or
	hyphens.  Saying 35- says everything from 35 to the end.

	To get some more detailed instructions, send me the following mail:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailhelp PATH
