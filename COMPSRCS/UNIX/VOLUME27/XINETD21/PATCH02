1. What this patch fixes

only_from/no_access addresses would get inverted on little-endian
machines when such addresses were specified using the numeric notation
(for example, 128.138.45.3 would become 3.45.138.128). This bug was in
the numeric_addr function which did not convert the result of inet_addr
to host-byte-order.  A work around for the bug would be to use the
factorized address notation (for example, 128.138.45.{3})


2. How to apply this patch

Cd to the xinetd directory and use the command:
	patch < "name of this file"
This patch will modify the files
	Makefile
	CHANGELOG
	addr.c

The VERSION variable in the Makefile will be changed to 2.1.3.
You will need to recompile xinetd after applying this patch.
The accompanying libraries are *not* affected by this patch.



Prereq: 2.1.2
