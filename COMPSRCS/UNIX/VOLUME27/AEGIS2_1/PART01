NAME
	aegis -	project	change supervisor
	Copyright (C) 1990, 1991, 1992,	1993 Peter Miller.

	GNU General Public License.  [...]

	aegis (ee.j.iz)	n., a protection, a defence.

DESCRIPTION
	The aegis program is a CASE tool with a	difference.  In
	the spirit of the UNIX Operating System, the aegis
	program	is a small component designed to work with other
	programs.

	Many CASE systems attempt to provide everything, from
	bubble charts to source	control	to compilers.  Users are
	trapped	with the components supplied by	the CASE system,
	and if you don't like one of the components (it	may be
	too limited, for instance), then that is just tough.

	In contrast, UNIX provides many	components of a	CASE
	system - compilers, editors, dependency	maintenance tools
	(such as make),	source control tools (such as RCS).  You
	may substitute the tool	of your	choice if you don't like
	the ones supplied with the system - gcc, jove, cake, to
	name just a few.  The aegis program adds to this list
	with software configuration management,	and true to UNIX
	philosophy, the	aegis program does not dictate the choice
	of any of the other tools (although it may stretch them
	to their limits).

	Enough hype, what is it	that the aegis program does?
	Just what is software configuration management?	 This
	question is sufficiently broad as to require a book in
	answer.	 In essence, the aegis program is a project
	change supervisor.  It provides	a framework within which
	a team of developers may work on many changes to a
	program	independently, and the aegis program coordinates
	integrating these changes back into the	master source of
	the program, with as little disruption as possible.
	Resolution of contention for source files, a major
	headache for any project with more than	one developer, is
	one of the aegis program's major functions.

	It should be noted that	the aegis program is a
	developer's tool, in the same sense as make or RCS are
	developer's tools.  It is not a	manager's tool - it does
	not provide progress tracking or manage	work allocation.

X	aegis -	project	change supervisor
X	Copyright (C) 1990, 1991, 1992,	1993 Peter Miller.
X	All rights reserved.
X
X	The aegis program is distributed under the terms of the
X	GNU General Public License.  See the LICENSE section,
X	below, for more	details.

X
XDESCRIPTION
X	The aegis program is a CASE tool with a	difference.  In
X	the spirit of the UNIX Operating System, the aegis
X	program	is a small component designed to work with other
X	programs.
X
X	Many CASE systems attempt to provide everything, from
X	bubble charts to source	control	to compilers.  Users are
X	trapped	with the components supplied by	the CASE system,
X	and if you don't like one of the components (it	may be
X	too limited, for instance), then that is just tough.
X
X	In contrast, UNIX provides many	components of a	CASE
X	system - compilers, editors, dependency	maintenance tools
X	(such as make),	source control tools (such as RCS).  You
X	may substitute the tool	of your	choice if you don't like
X	the ones supplied with the system - gcc, jove, cake, to
X	name just a few.  The aegis program adds to this list
X	with software configuration management,	and true to UNIX
X	philosophy, the	aegis program does not dictate the choice
X	of any of the other tools (although it may stretch them
X	to their limits).
X
X	Enough hype, what is it	that the aegis program does?
X	Just what is software configuration management?	 This
X	question is sufficiently broad as to require a book in
X	answer.	 In essence, the aegis program is a project
X	change supervisor.  It provides	a framework within which
X	a team of developers may work on many changes to a
X	program	independently, and the aegis program coordinates
X	integrating these changes back into the	master source of
X	the program, with as little disruption as possible.
X	Resolution of contention for source files, a major
X	headache for any project with more than	one developer, is
X	one of the aegis program's major functions.
X
X	It should be noted that	the aegis program is a
X	developer's tool, in the same sense as make or RCS are
X	developer's tools.  It is not a	manager's tool - it does
X	not provide progress tracking or manage	work allocation.

XBENEFITS
X	So why should you use the aegis	program?
X
X	The aegis program uses a particular model of the
X	development of software	projects.  This	model has a
X	master source (or baseline) of a project, and a	team of
X	developers creating changes to be made to this baseline.
X	When a change is complete, it is integrated with the
X	baseline, to become the	new baseline.  Each change must
X	be atomic and self-contained, no change	is allowed to
X	cause the baseline to cease to work.  "Working"	is
X	defined	as passing it's	own tests.  The	tests are
X	considered part	of the baseline.  The aegis program
X	provides support for the developer so that an entire copy
X	of the baseline	need not be taken to change a few files,
X	only those files which are to be changed need to be
X	copied.
X
X	In order to ensure that	changes	are unable to cause the
X	baseline to cease to work, aegis mandates that changes be
X	accompanied by at least	one test, and that all such tests
X	be known to complete successfully.  These steadily
X	accumulated tests form an ever increasing regression test
X	suite for all later changes.  There is also a mandatory
X	review stage for each change to	the baseline.  While
X	these requirements may be relaxed per-change or	even per-
X	project, doing so potentially compromises the "working"
X	definition of the baseline.
X
X	The win	in using the aegis program is that there are O(n)
X	interactions between developers	and the	baseline.
X	Contrast this with a master source which is being edited
X	directly by the	developers - there are O(n!)
X	interactions between developers	- this makes adding "just
X	one more" developer a potential	disaster.
X
X	Another	win is that the	project	baseline always	works.
X	Always having a	working	baseline means that a version is
X	always available for demonstrations, or	those "pre-
X	release	snapshots" we are always forced	to provide.
X
X	The above advantages are all very well - for management
X	types.	Why should Joe Average Programmer use the aegis
X	program?  Recall that RCS provides file	locking, but only
X	for one	file at	a time.	 The aegis program provides the
X	file locking, atomically, for the set of files in the
X	change.	 Recall	also that RCS locks the	file the instant
X	you start editing it.  This makes popular files	a project
X	bottleneck.  The aegis program allows concurrent editing,
X	and a resolution mechanism just	before the change must be
X	integrated, meaning fewer delays for J.A.Programmer.

XARCHIVE	SITE
X	The latest version of aegis is available by anonymous FTP
X	from:
X	    Host:   ftp.cse.nau.edu (134.114.64.70)
X	    Dir:    /pub/Aegis
X	    File:   aegis.2.1.tar.Z	# the complete source
X	    File:   aegis.2.1.patch.Z	# patch	to take	2.0 to 2.1
X	    File:   aegis.2.1.ps.Z	# PostScript of	the User Guide
X
X	To use anonymous FTP, give "anonymous" as the user name
X	(omit the quotes) and your email address as the	password.
X
X	My grateful thanks to Paul Balyoz <pab@ftp.cse.nau.edu>
X	for his	generosity in providing	this archive space.
X
X	This directory also contains a few other pieces	of
X	software written by me.	 Some are referred to in the
X	aegis documentation.  Please have a look if you	are
X	interested.
X
X	For those of you without FTP, I	recommend the use of an
X	ftp-by-email server.  Here is a	list of	a few (there are
X	many more):
X		ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
X		ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au
X
X	In general, you	can get	a help message about how to use
X	each system by sending email with a subject of "help" and
X	a message body containing just the word	"help".
X
XMAILING	LIST
X	A mailing list has been	created	so that	users of aegis
X	may exchange ideas about how to	use the	aegis program.
X	Discussion may include,	but is not limited to: bugs,
X	enhancements, and applications.	 The list is not
X	moderated.
X
X	The address of the mailing list	is
X		aegis-users@bmr.gov.au
X
X	To subscribe to	this mailing list, send	an email message
X	to majordomo@bmr.gov.au	with a message body containing
X	the single line
X		subscribe aegis-users
X	Please note that bmr.gov.au is an Internet site, so if
X	you have an address which is not readily derived from
X	your mail headers (majordomo is	only a Perl program,
X	after all) you will need to use	a message of the form:
X		subscribe aegis-users address
X	where address is an email address which	makes sense from
X	an Internet site.
X
X	The software which handles this	mailing	list CANNOT send
X	you a copy of the aegis	program.  Please use FTP or ftp-

X
XCOMPARISON WITH	CVS
X	One of the most	common questions about aegis is	"How does
X	it compare with	CVS?"
X
X	The CVS	program	aims to	provide	a repository, RCS for
X	sets of	files.	The aegis program aims to provide a
X	baseline, a repository,	consistency of the baseline, and
X	validation of changes being made to the	baseline.
X
X	A simplistic way of thinking of	this is	"CVS is	over
X	RCS", but "aegis is over RCS and make".	 Actually CVS
X	requires RCS, whereas aegis may	be configured to use
X	almost any history tool; similarly for the dependency
X	maintenance tool, aegis	may be configured to use almost
X	any sufficiently capable tool (unfortunately traditional
X	make isn't sufficiently	capable, but the name is well
X	known and evokes the appropriate functional image).
X
X	The most significant point of departure	is around the
X	"cvs checkin" functionality.  In CVS, this is
X	unconditional; a developer can add a poorly though-out
X	code change, or	even indulge in	a little vandalism, with
X	nothing	to prevent it.	In contrast, the aegis program
X	breaks this step into several pieces: the change must be
X	be known to build, the change must have	tests and those
X	tests be known to have run and passed, the change must
X	then be	reviewed (double check), and then built	and
X	tested again (triple check).
X
X	For a more detailed discussion,	see appendix C of the
X	User Guide.
X
XNEW IN THIS RELEASE
X	A number of features have been added to	aegis with this
X	release.  A few	of them	are detailed here:
X
X	* Can now ask for history to maintained	for file
X	generated by the build.	 This is useful	for generating
X	patch files.
X
X
X	Plus the usual crop of bug fixes and tinkering.	 For
X	excruciating detail, and also acknowledgements of those
X	who generously sent me feedback, please	see the	CHANGES
X	file included in this distribution.
X
XBUILDING
X	Instructions on	how to build and test the aegis	program
X	are to be found	in the BUILDING	file included in this
X	distribution.

XSOME HISTORY
X	The idea for aegis did not come	full-blown into	my head
X	in the shower, as some of my programs do, but rather from
X	working	in a software shop which used a	simplistic form
X	of something similar.  That system was held together by
X	chewing-gum and	string,	it was written in a disgusting
X	variant	of Basic, and by golly the damn	thing worked
X	(mostly).  The aegis program is	nothing	like it, owes
X	none of	its code to that system, and is	far more
X	versatile.
X
X	Since that company decided to close down our section, we
X	all moved on simultaneously (all 60 of us), sometimes
X	working	together, and sometimes	not, but always	keeping
X	in touch.  With	suggestions and	conversations with some
X	of them	early in 1990, the manual entries for aegis took
X	shape, and formed most of the design document for aegis.
X
X	Since getting the first	glimmerings of a functional aegis
X	late in	1990 it	is increasingly	obvious	that I never want
X	to be without it ever again.  All of my	sources	that I
X	modify are instantly placed under aegis, as is anything	I
X	distribute.  All code I	write for myself, and all new
X	code I write for my employer, goes under aegis.	 Why?
X	Because	it has fewer bugs!
X
X	Example: one of	the sources I carry with me from job to
X	job is "cook", my dependency maintenance tool.	Cook had
X	existed	for 3 years before aegis appeared on the scene,
X	and I used it daily.  When I placed cook under aegis, I
X	found 6	bugs!  Since then I have found a few more.  Not
X	only are there now fewer bugs, but they	never come back,
X	because	the regression test suite always grows.
