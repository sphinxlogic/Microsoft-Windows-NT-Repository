This is the third introductory message about comp.sources.unix.
The first described how to submit sources to comp.sources.unix, where the
archive sites are, and how to contact them.  The second one listed all the
sources that have been published in this newsgroup.  This one lists some
of the moderator's plans for the future.

			-Paul Vixie

1. There's a new mailing list which receives copies of all articles posted
   on comp.sources.unix.  The list is called unix-sources@pa.dec.com (or
   uunet!decwrl!unix-sources, for the domain-impaired).  Send requests
   about being added or deleted to the -request address, not to the
   moderator.  If you were on the BRL list, you were moved to the new
   list automatically, some time ago.

2. We're going to alter our posting software so that parts 2..last of any
   submission, and any patches, have a "References:" header pointing back
   to part 1.  This will make threaded news readers (and notes readers)
   happier.

3. We're going to restructure the archives and the index to group together
   all versions and patches for any package so that you can tell at a glance
   what the most recent version of something is, and where it is.  We will
   not be deleting old versions, since although mostly useless, they have
   historic and sentimental value.  We will endeavour to make the old-style
   index listings still "work", probably through the use of copious symbolic
   links on the archive hosts.
