Subject:  v27INF2:  List of sources in the archives
Newsgroups: comp.sources.unix,comp.sources.d
Approved: paul@vix.com

Submitted-by: paul@vix.com (Paul Vixie)
Posting-number: Volume 27, Info 2
Archive-name: index27.2

This is the second introductory message about comp.sources.unix.  The first
described how to submit sources to comp.sources.unix, where the archive
sites are, and how to contact them.  This one lists all the sources that
have been published in this newsgroup.

We are considering a new archive layout and index; we expect to implement
it by the end of the century (this one).  See the third introductory message
(v27INF3) for more "futures".
