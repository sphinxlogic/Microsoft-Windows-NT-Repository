There have been several requests for the uptime program.
Although sysinfo has all of the information of uptime, I prefer
running it standalone.  So here it is.

Note that uptime is simply Lenny Tropiano's sysinfo program modified
to look like uptime.  You will need loadavgd that comes with sysinfo
to run this.

XFor those who want to have the uptime command on your 3b1, but
Xdo not want to run sysinfo, here it is.
X
XHere is what the output of uptime looks like:
X 9:32 pm  up 72 days,  2:12,  load average:  0.14, 0.09, 0.07        
X
XIt shows the current time, the time since last boot and
Xthe load averaged for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
X
XI modified Lenny Tropiano's sysinfo program, so that it prints out
Xa line that is very close to that produced by BSD's uptime(1).
XThe difference is that this version does not print the number
Xof users logged on.
X
XSimply type make, and move uptime to your favorite bin directory.
XUptime will not run unless you are running loadavgd.
XLoadavd is found along with sysinfo, so you will need to get that,
Xif you have not already got it.
X
XLenny gets all of the credit for this progam (except for that which
Xhe gave to others).
