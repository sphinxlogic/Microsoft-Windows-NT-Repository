Posting-number: Volume 2, Issue 25
Archive-name: misc-sh/part01

This is the README file for the Dave Brierley collection of miscellaneous
source programs.  The collection is posted in seven separate pieces but
all of the source came from the "misc" directory on my machine.  As a result
of this, there is only one README file and only one Makefile, although each
of the seven postings will contain a copy of these two files.  I suggest
that you obtain (or save) as many of these postings as you are interested
in, unpack them all in a single directory, and then compile the sources.
Note that some of the programs are actually shell scripts and therefore do
not need compilation.

install.sh
 A shell script version of the BSD install command.

null.sh
 Zero out one or more files.

tolower.sh
 Convert file names to lower case.  Requires ksh.

toupper.sh
 Convert file names to upper case.  Requires ksh.

#! /bin/sh
# This is a shell archive.  Remove anything before this line, then unpack
# it by saving it into a file and typing "sh file".  To overwrite existing
# files, type "sh file -c".  You can also feed this as standard input via
# unshar, or by typing "sh <file", e.g..  If this archive is complete, you
# will see the following message at the end:
#		"End of archive 1 (of 1)."
# Contents:  MANIFEST Makefile README install.sh null.sh tolower.sh
#   toupper.sh

XThis is the README file for the Dave Brierley collection of miscellaneous
Xsource programs.  The collection is posted in seven separate pieces but
Xall of the source came from the "misc" directory on my machine.  As a result
Xof this, there is only one README file and only one Makefile, although each
Xof the seven postings will contain a copy of these two files.  I suggest
Xthat you obtain (or save) as many of these postings as you are interested
Xin, unpack them all in a single directory, and then compile the sources.
XNote that some of the programs are actually shell scripts and therefore do
Xnot need compilation.
X
XINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
X1. Compile all the source programs by typing "make all".  Edit the Makefile
X   if you did not unpack all seven of the pieces.  Note that the Makefile
X   does not contain explicit commands for using the shared library.  I always
X   depend on "ccc" to do this for me.
X2. Copy the resultant executables to your favorite bin directory.  I always
X   use "/usr/local/bin".
X3. Copy the various shell scripts to the bin directory and make then executable
X   using the chmod command.  The shell scripts are all distributed with a
X   suffix of ".sh".  I suggest you remove this suffix when you install it, but
X   that is entirely up to you.
X
X
XDescription of programs included in this package.  There is a line of dashes
Xseparating each of the seven pieces.
X
Xbsdln.c
X A version of the ln command that follows the BSD behaviour.  I.e. if the
X target file exists, the command will fail.  The standard 3b1 version will
X remove the target.
X
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
Xinstall.sh
X A shell script version of the BSD install command.
X
Xnull.sh
X Zero out one or more files.
X
Xtolower.sh
X Convert file names to lower case.  Requires ksh.
X
Xtoupper.sh
X Convert file names to upper case.  Requires ksh.
X
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
Xndf.c
X Almost emulates the BSD df command.  I say "almost" because I chose to
X display the numbers in terms of blocks instead of kbytes since everything
X else on the machine displays sizes in blocks.  Supports the "-i" option
X to displays inode information.  Also supports specifying any random
X directory as an argument and it will figure out what file system it is.
X
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
Xdisktest.c
X A program used by the format script to test the floppy disk to be doubly
X sure that it is usable.
X
Xformat.sh
X Format a floppy disk.  Asks questions to determine desired parameters, such
X as number of cylinders and number of sectors.  Will optionally run an
X intensive surface test of the floppy (see disktest.c), build a file system
X structure, and make the floppy bootable.  The main processing is done in a
X loop so you can format multiple floppies easily.
X
Xnewfs.sh
X Reads the VHB from the floppy and then builds a file system structure on it.
X
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
Xtecho.c
X A version of echo that allows direct access to termcap capabilities.  A lot
X easier to use than intermixing calls to echo with calls to tput.
X
Xtecho.1
X Hey, I actually wrote a man page for this one!
X
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
Xwclipper.c
X A program to read in the wtmp file and output the tail end of it.  Useful
X if you want to maintain an N-day history of who has been using your system.
X The output size can be specified in terms of days or kbytes.
X
Xwtmp.fix.sh
X A shell script to control the operation of wclipper.
X
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------
X
Xemail.c
X A version of the "email" program.  This program should be installed as
X /usr/bin/email and it will be used by pcmgr (or by smgr) when you click
X on the envelope icon.  It provides a safe interface to the mail program
X by making sure the uid is set correctly and by doing a chdir to the
X users home directory (both of which are already being done by pcmgr).
X This version also provides a unique feature of reading an "rc" file
X from the users home directory (~/.email.rc), which can be used to specify
X what mail program to use.  See the sample provided.
X
Xemail.rc
X Sample .email.rc file.
