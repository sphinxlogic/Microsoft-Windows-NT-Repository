Environment: UNIX, MS-DOS, getopt, lex, yacc
Patch-To: cproto: Volume 29, Issue 61-62

This patch brings cproto to version 3 patchlevel 6.  This patch fixes a
portability problem that prevented it from being compiled with pre-ANSI
C compilers.  Thanks to Pat Myrto <ole!rwing!pat@nwnexus.wa.com> for
reporting this bug.

X  - Fix: The -v option did not output declarations for function pointers.
X  - Fix: String literals continued over more than one line messed up the
X    line number count.
X! - Fix: The program generated incorrect prototypes for functions that take
X!   a variable argument list using <varargs.h>.
X! - Fix: When converting functions from the standard input, cproto generated
X!   no output if no functions needed to be converted.
X  - Fix: Now does not output a warning if an untagged struct is found in a
X    typedef declaration.
X  - Added the -b option which rewrites function definition heads to
X    include both old style and new style declarations separated by a
X    conditional compilation directive.  For example, the program can

X  - Now use "#if __STDC__" instead of "#if defined(__STDC__)".
X  - GNU bison orders the y.tab.c sections differently than yacc, which
X    resulted in references to variables before they were declared.  The
X    grammar specification was modified to also be compatible with bison.
