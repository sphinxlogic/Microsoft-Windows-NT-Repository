X    4.1.2  Other Fields
X
X    The	'tty' field may	be used	to select an outgoing line other than the
X    default.  For important considerations on line choice, see the sections
X    titled "Choosing a Dialout Line" and "DCDwatch".
X
X    The	'duplex' field may be used to select a duplex value other than the
X    default 'F'	(full).
X
X    The	'baud' field may be used to select a baud rate value other than	the
X    default selected at	Configure time.
X
X    The	'parity' field may be used to select a parity value other than the
X    default selected at	Configure time.
X
X
X    The	'Add NL	to transmitted CR' and 'Add NL to received CR' fields are
X    usually left defaulted to 'N' (no).	 If you	will be	communicating with a
X    terminal (as in a chat with	a human), you will usually need	to set both
X    of these fields to 'Y' as well as to select	'H'alf duplex.

X    4.2.2  Switches
X
X    Many switches are used to override defaults	specified at the time the

X
X
X    ECU	Technical Description				      31
X
X
X
X    Confifgure procedure was used.  Note these defaults	may also be
X    overriden interactively if the command does	not specify automatic
X    startup option (-p or dialing argument).  Also, the	value chosen by	a
X    dialing directory entry or an initial procedure will override the
X    Configured default and/or the value	specified by this switch.
X
X
X    4.2.2.1  -b	<baud>
X
X    This switch	overrides the default baud rate.  Any valid UNIX rate may be
X    chosen. ECU	chooses	the number of stop bits	based on the baud rate.
X    Rates below	300 baud get 2 stop bits.  Rates 300 baud and above get	one
X    stop bit.
X
X
X    4.2.2.2  -d
X
X    The	-d switch instructs ECU	to "die" (terminate with error status) if an
X    initial procedure (-p) fails.  This	switch ensures a batch ECU execution
X    will hang up any connection	and terminate if a procedure error occurs.
X    See	also -D	below.
X
X    Absence of the -d and -D switches causes ecu (upon any completion of the
X    initial procedure) to enter	the 1) interactive mode	if a line was
X    successfully attached by the procedure or 2) the setup screen if no	line
X    was	attached.
X
X
X    4.2.2.3  -e, -o, -n
X
X    Normally, ECU starts up with data bits and parity chosen at	Configure
X    time.  The -e, -o and -n switches allow you	to override the	default.
X
X    Since combinations like eight data bit and even parity or seven data
X    bits and no	parity are not in  ECU's capability to use, the	parity
X    selection also dictates the	choice of data bits. Even or odd parity
X    implies seven data bits.  No parity	implies	eight data bits.
X
X
X    4.2.2.4  -h
X
X    Normally, ECU starts up in the full	duplex mode.  If half duplex is
X    desired, the -h switch is used.
X
X
X    4.2.2.5  -l	ttyspec
X
X    When ECU starts up,	it normally chooses a line as described	later in the
X    section titled "Choosing a Dialout Line".  Specifying the -l switch
X    overrides the default tty specified	at Configure time.  Depending upon
X    other command line options,	this switch may	be nothing more	than a hint.

X
X
X
X
X
X    ECU	Technical Description				      32
X
X
X
X    The	argument to the	switch is the base name	of the tty (e.g., "tty1a" or
X    "acu0").  On SCO, since ttys are all named consistently according to the
X    "/dev/ttyxx" form, you may omit the	"tty" (e.g., "1a" or "4g").
X
X    For	important considerations on line choice, see the sections titled
X    "Choosing a	Dialout	Line" and "DCDwatch".
X
X
X    4.2.2.6  -p	<proc>
X
X    The	-p switch causes ECU to	execute	the procedure <proc> ("<proc>.ep")
X    immediately	upon startup.  Such a procedure	is termed the initial
X    procedure.	It is recommended that,	when used, -p be the last switch on
X    the	command	line.  All non-switch arguments	after <proc> are passed	as
X    arguments to the initial procedure (see the	descriptions of	the integer
X    function %argc and the string function %argv in the	Procedure Manual).
X
X    For	example,
X
X	ecu -p batchjob	remsys 22
X    automatically executes the procedure command equivalent
X	do 'batchjob' 'remsys' '22'
X
X
X    The	initial	procedure may read command line	options	with functions like
X    %line, %baud and %parity.  It is also free to override any of these
X    values it wishes.  See the procedure manual	for more information.
X
X
X    4.2.2.7  -t
X
X    The	-t switch instructs ECU	to map incoming	and outgoing carriage
X    returns to carriage	return/line feed pairs.	 This is helpful if the
X    remote connection will be to a display terminal rather than	a computer.
X    Use	of the -h switch may also be necessary.
X
X    The	interactive commands nlin and nlout also control this feature.
X
X
X    4.2.2.8  -D
X
X    The	-D switch instructs ECU	to unconditionally terminate when an initial
X    procedure finishes.	 Contrast with the -d switch.
X
X
X    4.2.2.9  -F	name
X
X    Normally, the TERM environment variable is used to determine the
X    funckeymap entry (keyboard configuration) to be used.  Sometimes, the
X    TERM variable is not adequate for identifying your keyboard	arrangement.
X    The	-F switch switch, like the $ECUFUNCKEY environment variable, allows

X    you	to use override	the funckeymap entry used.  For	more information,
X    see	the section titled "Function Key Mapping (Recognition)".
X
X
X    4.2.2.10  -P phonedir
X
X    The	-P switch causes ECU to	begin execution	using an alternate phone
X    directory.	The default is ~/.ecu/phone.  You should specify a full
X    pathname if	you anticipate using the change	directory command once ecu
X    starts.
X
X
X    4.2.2.11  -T level
X
X    The	-T switch sets the procedure language trace level.  <level> is a
X    decimal digit.  0 is for no	tracing	(the default) and 1 is for tracing.
X    Values higher than 1 are for debugging ECU and have	varying	effects	from
X    revision to	revision.
X
X
X    4.2.3  Non-Switch Arguments
X
X    Aguments are optional.  <tel-number> or <logical> may appear when the -p
X    switch is absent.  One or more <arg> arguments may appear when the -p
X    switch is used.  These arguments are handled as described by "-p" above.
X
X
X    4.2.3.1  <tel-number>
X
X    This type of argument has a	digit as its initial character and
X    represents an actual telephone number to be	passed to a modem dialer
X    program or Dialers chat script.  The string	may contain non-numeric
X    characters if appropriate for a dialer program, such as dialTBIT or
X    dialgT2500 (see the	gendial	subdirectory).	For example:
X
X	ecu -ltty2a -b 19200 -e	5551212C
X
X    uses tty2a (assumed	to be connected	to a Trailblazer modem because of
X    the	dialer-specific	telephone number) and establishes a 19200 baud,	even
X    parity PEP Compressed connection after dialing 5551212.
X
X
X    4.2.3.2  <logical>
X
X    This type of argument has an alphabetic initial character and causes the
X    dialing directory entry by that name to be dialed.	The line may be
X    specified by '-l', but if the dialing directory specifies a	line (tty
X    field contains other than 'Any'), the dialing directory entry will
X    override it.  The '-b', '-e' and '-o' switches are ignored;	the values
X    specified by the dialing directory entry are used.	The '-t' and '-h'
X    switches are valid and honored if present.

X
X
X
X    4.2.3.3  <arg>
X
X    This type of argument is passed to an initial procedure when the -p
X    switch is present.
X
X
X    ecu	-p unixlogin user pwd ansi43
X
X    executes unixlogin.ep with arguments 'user'	'pwd' 'ansi43'
X
X    For	more detail, refer to the description of -p, -d	and -D below.
X
X
X    4.3	 Environment Variables
X
X
X    Prior to starting ECU, it is useful, but not necessary, to establish two
X    environment	variables, ECUPROMPT and ECUHELP.
X
X
X    4.3.1  ECUPROMPT
X
X    The	ECUPROMPT environment variable determines the prompt printed by	ECU
X    when the interactive command key ("HOME") is pressed.  When	you first
X    run	ECU, try setting it to your name, e. g.,
X
X	 setenv	ECUPROMPT Ralph	   if you use csh
X
X	 ECUPROMPT=Ralph	   if you use sh, ksh, etc.
X	 export	ECUPROMPT
X
X    Then, when you see how it used, you	may wish to establish a	more
X    permanent choice in	your .login or .profile.
X
X
X    4.3.2  ECUHELP
X
X    Ordinarily,	ECU looks for interactive command help information in
X    "ecuhelp.data" (in the ecu library directory, normally
X    /usr/local/lib/ecu).  The ECUHELP environment may be set to	the complete
X    pathname of	the ecu	help file if an	alternate file is to be	used.
X
X    The	help file is explained later in	the section titled "Online Command
X    Dictionary".
X
X
X    4.3.3  ECUFUNCKEY
X
X    See	the description	of the -F command line switch and the section titled
X    "Function Key Mapping (Recognition)".

X    5.	Interactive Mode Commands
X
X
X    The	following is a partial list of commands	available in the interactive
X    (non-procedure) mode.  It is not necessary to enter	the entire command
X    in most cases.  The	portion	of each	command	which must be entered is
X    capitalized	in the following section headers.
X
X    Refer to the sections titled Interactive Command History and Line
X    Editing for	more information.
X
X
X    5.1	 AUTORZ	: Automatic ZMODEM Receive
X
X    Usage: autorz [off | on | ]
X
X    ECU	in the interactive mode	(no procedure executing) can interpret a
X    SUB, 'B', '0', '0' receive data sequence as	a ZMODEM ZRQINIT frame and
X    automatically begin	a ZMODEM receive operation.  This command controls
X    or displays	this feature.  By default, this	feature	is turned on.
X
X
X    5.2	 AX : ascii char to hex/oct/dec
X
X    usage: ax [<param>]
X
X
X    <param> may	be a single ASCII character, a standard	ASCII identifier
X    (such as ETX), or a	two-character control character	identifier (such as
X    ^C,	typed as a caret followed by a C).
X
X    If no argument is supplied,	a table	of control characters is printed
X    containing decimal,	octal, hex, ASCII identifiers and two-character
X    control character identifier.
X
X
X
X    5.3	 BAud :	set/display line baud rate
X
X    usage: baud	[<baud-rate>]
X
X
X    <baud-rate>, if specified, must be taken from the values 110, 300, 600,
X    1200, 2400,	4800, 9600, 19200 and 38400.  On some systems, 19200 and
X    38400 may not be supported.	 If a baud rate	less than 300 is selected, 2
X    stop bits are automatically	specified; other baud rates set	1 stop bit.
X    If <baud-rate> is not supplied, the	current	baud rate is displayed.
X
X    The	setting	may be automatically changed as	the result of a	'dial'
X    command.  See also the dial	and parity command descriptions.

X
X
X    5.4	 BN : all console event	alarm
X
X    Usage: bn [	off | on | alert ]
X	   bn [	0 | 1 |	2 ]
X
X
X    "bell notify": If no parameter is supplied,	the current setting is
X    displayed.	Specifying 0 or	off disables the facility; 1 or	on causes an
X    audible alarm to be	sounded	upon receipt of	a bell (0x07) character	from
X    the	remote system; 2 or alert causes an audible alarm upon receipt of
X    ANY	characters.  This command may not be functional	in the version for
X    your system.
X
X    On SCO, different alarm styles are sent depending upon the type of event
X    causing the	alarms.	 The alarms consist of Morse characters.  Even if
X    you	do not understand Morse, the patterns of the alarm tones are
X    distinct enough to be distinguishable.
X
X    Additionally on SCO, if you	are running ECU	from a multiscreen, the
X    alarms will	be signalled even if you have temporarily switched to
X    another screen.
X
X    BN is set to 1 (on)	when ECU begins	executing.
X
X
X    5.5	 BReak : send break to remote
X
X    usage: break
X
X
X    This command sends a break signal to the remote system.
X
X
X
X    5.6	 CD : change current directory
X
X    usage: cd [<dir-path>]
X
X
X    This command allows	you to change the working directory of the ECU
X    process.  If <dir-path> is supplied, the previous working directory	is
X    displayed, and <dir-path> is made the new working directory.  A history
X    of previous	directory changes is maintained.  Entering the cd command
X    shows the numbered history list and	allows you to select a new directory
X    by entering	the number.  Other commands allow deletion of directories
X    from the list or saving the	list to	file ~/.ecu/dir.  This file is
X    automatically read at ECU startup, providing a convenient list of
X    directories	available for quick selection.	If you edit this file by
X    hand, you may force	ECU to re-read the file	using the %read	option.
X
X    The	%xmitcd	option transmits "cd "+current_directory+CR to the remote, a

X
X
X
X    convenience	to set the remote current directory to the same	as your
X    local one.
X
X    The	%pushd # option	pushes the current directory onto the same stack
X    used by the	pushd interactive command and changes the current directory
X    to the numbered directory specified	by #.  Use the popd interactive
X    command to return to the previous directory.
X
X    Other %options have	usage information by entering them with	no
X    arguments.
X
X    5.7	 DA : decimal to ascii char
X
X    usage: da [<decimal-val>]
X
X
X    <decimal-val> is a decimal value between 0 and 256;	the parity (sign)
X    bit	is stripped and	the equivalent ASCII character value is	displayed.
X
X    If no argument is supplied,	a table	of control characters is printed
X    containing decimal,	octal, hex, ASCII identifiers and two-character
X    control character identifier.
X
X
X    5.8	 DCDwatch
X
X    usage: dcdwatch [<dcdwatch-param>]
X
X
X    This command controls the DCD watcher.  The	optional parameter may be:
X
X       y  yes -	enable DCD watcher
X       n  no - disable DCD watcher
X       t  terminate - terminate	ECU on loss of DCD
X
X    Entering the command without an argument shows the current status.
X
X    The	DCD watcher when enabled causes	ECU to monitor the DCD line (within
X    the	limits imposed by the OS with its CLOCAL=0 functionality).  When the
X    watcher is on and DCD drops, ecu automatically performs the	action of
X    the	interactive or procedure hangup	command.  If the 't'erminate option
X    is chosen, then after hangup processing is complete, the ECU program
X    will terminate.
X
X    The	state of the watcher may be changed by the use of the dial command
X    which uses a directory entry that changes the DCD watcher status.
X
X    The	DCD watcher depends upon the tty driver	to return zero on a read
X    when DCD is	low when the termio flag CLOCAL	is reset.  The tty driver
X    must ignore	DCD if CLOCAL is set.  If your system offers a "modem" and
X    "direct" choice (by	choice of filename), you probably need to use the

X
X
X
X    "modem" choice for this to work properly.  However,	the choice depends
X    upon the needs of the underlying driver you	are using.  For	instance, if
X    you	are using FAS in a shared modem	application, your getty	should use
X    the	"modem"	choice and ECU should use the "direct" choice.	Some
X    experimentation may	be required.
X
X
X    5.9	 Dial :	dial remote destination
X
X    usage: dial	[<dial-param>]
X
X
X    <dial-param> may take one of two forms, a telephone	number to dial
X    (initial digit) or a logical name (initial letter) which can be found in
X    the	user phone directory (in file ~/.ecu/phone).
X
X    If a telephone number is supplied, the phone number	is dialed; you must
X    first have set the desired baud rate and parity using the baud and
X    parity commands.  (If the last character of	a telephone number is a
X    dollar sign, it is removed and is replaced with the	contents of the
X    first line in ~/.ecu/credit.  See the description of the dialing
X    directory.)
X
X    If a logical name is entered, the phone directory is searched; if the
X    entry is found, the	baud rate and parity is	automatically set.  if a
X    procedure file can be found	in the current directory, the user's home
X    .ecu subdirectory or the ECU library directory "ep"	(normally
X    /usr/local/lib/ecu/ep) whose name matches the logical name,	then the
X    procedure is executed with the argument '!INTERACTIVE'.
X
X    If <dial-param> is not supplied, then a screen-oriented self-documenting
X    <:-)> directory manager is executed; you may scan the directory to
X    select a number to dial, as	well as	add, remove and	edit entries.
X
X    5.9.1  Alternate Dialing Directory
X
X    The	default	dialing	directory is ~/.ecu/phone.  You	may change to
X    another directory by issuing the interactive dial command with no
X    arguments to enter the dialing directory menu, selecting 'c'hange dial
X    directory, and entering the	name of	a new directory.  The specified
X    pathname must either be a fully qualified pathname or a pathname
X    relative to	the current working directory.	Once an	alternate directory
X    has	been selected, it will be used by both the interactive command 'dial
X    <logical>' and the dialing directory menu.
X
X    Using the dial command with	a directory entry may change the DCD watcher
X    (dcdwatch) status.	See the	section	on the dcdwatch	command	for more
X    information.
X
X    See	the section below titled "Choosing a Dialout Line" for more

X    5.9.2  Multi-Number	Redial Cycle
X
X    While in the  dialing directory, you may "mark" one	or more	entries	for
X    a cyclical redial attempt.	When any entry is marked, typing ENTER
X    (carriage return or	line feed/newline) causes each marked entry to be
X    dialed in turn until one of	the remote systems is successfully
X    connected.	When a successful connection occurs, ECU unmarks the
X    associated entry, leaving the others marked.  Thus,	you may	mark several
X    entries and	merely reenter the dialing directory after each	connection
X    is finished	and press ENTER	to reenter the redial cycle.  If a single
X    entry is marked, ECU pauses	15 seconds between each	dialing	attempt,
X    otherwise 5	seconds.  Pressing 'c' will cause the pause to be
X    prematurely	terminated and the next	attempt	to be made.  Pressing your
X    interrupt key (DEL,	^C or whatever)	aborts the cycle.  If you interrupt
X    an active dialing attempt, you will	be prompted as to whether or not you
X    wish to cycle to the next entry or abort the cycle.
X
X    If no entries are marked for redial, the current, highlighted directory
X    entry is used for dialing.
X
X    To unmark a	single entry, press 'M'	(uppercase M).	To unmark all
X    entries, press 'U'.
X
X
X    5.9.3  Automatic Dialing/Login Procedure
X
X    Upon dialing from the menu,	if a procedure file can	be found in the
X    current directory, the user's home .ecu subdirectory or the	ECU library
X    subdirectory "ep" (normally	/usr/local/lib/ecu/ep) whose name matches
X    the	logical	name, then the procedure is executed with the argument
X    '!MENU'.  It is the	responsibility of the automatically executed
X    procedure to establish connection with the remote system (by using the
X    procedure dial command).  An example of an automatic login procedure can
X    be found in	the distribution subdirectory 'models' named 'sysname.ep'.
X    A companion	procedure is 'unixlogin.ep'.
X
X    For	example,
X
X    | entry name | telephone number | tty | baud P | ...
X    | sysname	 | 555-1234	    | Any | 2400 N | ...

X
X    usage: do <procname> [<arg>	... ]
X
X
X    Perform ECU	procedure.  Ecu	searches for <procname>.ep in the current
X    directory.	If the file is not found, the program looks for	the file in
X    the	~/.ecu directory and in	the ep subdirectory of the library directory
X    (usually /usr/local/lib/ecu/ep).  One or more arguments may	be passed to
X    the	procedure.  Arguments are made available in the	called procedure by
X    use	of the %argc integer function and %argv	string function.

X    typed by you at the	keyboard.  The overwhelming majority of	remote
X    systems provide the	echo function, in which	case full duplex must be
X    used.  For the rare	occasions when the remote system does not echo your
X    keyboard input, setting half duplex	will allow you to see what you are
X    typing.

X
X
X    When communicating with another terminal in	a "teletype conversation",
X    setting half duplex	is generally required.	In such	cases, use of the
X    nl,	nlin and nlout commands	may also be required.

X
X    5.12  EXit : drop carrier, exit program
X
X    usage: exit
X
X
X    This command terminates ECU	promptly.  If your modem does not drop
X    carrier upon loss of Data Terminal Ready (DTR), the	command	will
X    terminate ECU, but may leave the communications line off hook.  It is
X    strongly recommended that you configure your modem to hang up the phone
X    line when DTR drops.  A shorthand version of this command exists: '.' is
X    equivalent to exit.

X			    f full speed transmission
X			    e echo pacing
X			    s single line transmission
X
X
X
X    "file insert": This	command	causes file characters to be inserted into
X    the	transmit data stream as	though they had	been entered at	the
X    keyboard.  No error	correction is provided,	although XON/XOFF flow
X    control is obeyed.
X
X    If <filename> is not entered on the	command	line, a	prompt for the
X    filename is	made.  Once the	filename has been entered and file has been
X    opened, you	are asked whether the file should be transmitted at full
X    speed, by "echo pacing" or by a single line	at a time.  You	may also
X    append an 'f', 'e' or 's' argument to the command line.
X
X    If your remote can tolerate	it, full speed transmission is the fastest.
X    Some systems are not capable of receiving large amount of data
X    ("streaming	data") without pauses.	Even with "full" speed transmission,
X    some "pacing" (inter-character delay) is introduced	to ease	loading	on
X    the	remote system.	Pressing the interrupt key (DEL) stops a full speed
X    transmission.
X
X    By specifying echo pacing, it is possible to increase the likelihood of
X    proper receipt.  Echo pacing reads the return data stream to attempt to

X    stops an echo paced	transmission.
X
X    As a last resort, if echo pacing is	not working for	you, (i.e., you	are
X    using the command in an environment	where the remote does not echo your
X    characters), single	line at	a time transmission is available.  With
X    "single" line transmission,	you must press the space key to	initiate
X    sending each line.	Pressing the 'ESC' or 's' key stops the	transfer.

X    5.14  FKEy : function key definition
X
X    usage: fkey	[<keyset_name>]
X	   fkey	-r
X
X
X    This command allows	the mapping of function	keys F1-F12, PgUp, PgDn, End
X    and	Ins and	the cursor up, down, left and right keys to emit a desired
X    sequence of	characters when	a function key is pressed.  <keyset_name>
X    specifies which key	set in ~/.ecu/keys is to be selected. Sample entry:
X
X	 hayes
X	     F1:escape:+ + +
X	     F2:autoans:A T S 0	= 1 cr
X	     F3:dial:A T D T
X	 bbs
X	     F1:cancel:^K
X	     F2:yes:y cr
X
X
X    -r resets the key handler to the same state	as when	ECU was	started.
X    See	the section above titled "Standard Function Keys".
X
X    If a keyset_name matches a logical dial directory name, it is loaded
X    after a connection is established.

X
X    The	case of	the entered argument is	unimportant.
X
X    If only one	argument is supplied, the mapping for the specified key	is

X
X
X    This command redials a number previously dialed with the 'dial' command.
X    Modem status is tested and multiple	retries	may be made.  <retry-count>
X    specifies how many retries are to be made.	<pause-interval> specifies
X    how	many seconds the program pauses	after a	failure	to connect.  You
X    must specify <retry-count> in order	to specify <pause-interval>.  The
X    default value for <retry-count> is 10, for <pause-interval>	is 60.
X
X    You	should know that in some jurisdictions,	it is ILLEGAL to dial the
X    same telephone number more than a specified	number of times	during some

X
X    5.37  RTScts : control RTS/CTS flow	control
X
X    usage: rtscts [ off	| on | no | yes	| 0..7 ]
X
X
X    This command controls the RTS/CTS flow control feature of the line
X    driver (which may or may not work).	 This is a very	confusing area
X    though it should not be.
X
X    If no argument is supplied,	the current setting is displayed.
X    Specifying 0 or n disables the facility; 1 or y causes RTS/CTS flow
X    control to be enabled.
X
X    What the command does is to	manipulate the RTSFLOW and CTSFLOW bits	of
X    the	termio c_cflag word (see termio(S)).
X
X    SCO's sio driver before UNIX 3.2v4/ODT 2.0 does half duplex	flow
X    control.  FAS does hardware	flow control based on the device magic
X    number, but	if you use a device number specifying no hardware flow
X    control, RTSFLOW and CTSFLOW can be	used to	specify	SCO-style flow
X    control.  CRTSFL offers full duplex	line control on	3.2v4 and later	ONLY
X    for	SCO's sio driver.
X
X
X	  arg |	RTSFLOW	| CTSFLOW    arg | RTSFLOW | CTSFLOW | CRTSFL

X				      4	 |   0	   |   0     |	 1
X
X    Choice 4 only works	on SCO 3.2v4 and ODT 2.0.  As you can see, numeric
X    values are masks.  If the 4	bit is present in the numeric value, it
X    overrides the lower-order bits:  Specifying	7 as an	argument specifies
X    CRTSFL is to be used if it is supported, otherwise RTSFLOW and CTSFLOW.

X    /etc/uucp on SunOS and SVR4).
X
X
X    6.1.1  Devices
X
X    ECU	reads this file	to determine what tty devices are available for
X    outgoing calls. The	fourth field must contain a baud rate or range of
X    baud rates acceptable for the line.	 The fifth field of each entry must
X    contain either the full pathname of	an (SCO) modem dialer program (with
X    leading slash) or the name of an entry in the HDB Dialers file (no
X    leading slash).  For more information, consult the UUCP documentation
X    for	your system and	see "Dialers" and "Choosing a Dialout Line" below.
X
X
X    6.1.2  Dialers
X
X    Dialers entries may	be specified in	the Devices entry. ECU provides
X    Dialers support that is largely compatible with most System	V HDB uucico
X    programs.  Refer to	your system's UUCP documentation for general usage
