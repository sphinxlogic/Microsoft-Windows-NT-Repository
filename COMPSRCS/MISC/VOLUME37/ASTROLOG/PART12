XL) -Xi switch, 'i' key: Certain people have asked that some of the X
X   charts be modified in various minor ways, i.e. in either adding or
X   removing certain information. Rather than add a new hard to remember
X   minor option for each change, I have added one major new switch which
X   covers all the charts. The new -Xi switch will invoke this
X   "induce/inhibit information" option, and pressing the 'i' key in a
X   window will accomplish the same thing by toggling the mode's status.
X   By default, all the charts are as before, but when this bonus option
X   is set, it affects each X window chart in a different way, as follows:
X
X o For the standard -v and relationship -r0 -v wheel charts, it will
X   inhibit the display of the aspect grid in the center - useful for
X   speed or when doing large time lapse animations when it would get in
X   the way.
X
X o For the -g aspect grid, it will flip the aspects and midpoints across
X   the center diagonal, i.e. the midpoints will be below it and the
X   aspects above it, instead of the other way around. For the -r0 -g
X   relationship aspect grid, the entire grid will be replaced with one
X   showing all midpoints between all the objects in the two charts.
X
X o For the -Z horizon chart and -S space chart, it will, for the major
X   planets, increase the size of the "points" showing where each object
X   actually is, making a brighter "spot", for easier viewing; combine
X   this in the horizon chart with the 'l' key label inhibitor and get a
X   very realistic view of the night sky, with planets brighter and all.
X
X o For the -L astro-graph chart, this will eliminate the display of the
X   Ascendant, Descendant, and Nadir lines, leaving just the vertical
X   Midheaven lines and zenith points, for a remarkable increase in speed
X   and much less clutter when including many objects.
X
X o For the -XW world map display, this will show the Earth's ley line
X   locations; and for the -XP polar globe view, it will show the southern
X   hemisphere instead of the northern.
X
X o For the -XG globe display, it will display the zenith locations of all
X   planets (and stars if -U in effect) on the globe, i.e. where on the
X   Earth each object could be viewed by looking straight up. This on the
X   globe display is almost identical to the astro-graph chart without its
X   various lines, except of course that the projection of the world map
X   is different. It's also similar to the -Z horizon display, except that
X   it's free from the distortion of projecting the celestial sphere upon
X   a plane, so it has use to star gazers. However, animation mode here
X   will still only affect what part of the Earth is viewable, and won't
X   update the chart from which the zenith locations were obtained.
X
X----
X
XHere is a list of bug fixes over version 2.10:
X
X1) There was a major glitch in the uranian overwrite routine which
X   would not only display the uranian positions a degree or two off from
X   where they should be, but would also garble the positions of all the
X   other objects, too! Since the uranians are now displayed separately,
X   this is no longer a problem.
X
X2) The display of midpoints was always 0.5 degree ahead of where they
X   should be. For example, the midpoint of planets at 0Gem and 0Can would
X   have been 15Gem30 instead of 15Gem0. Believe it or not, this bug has
X   been in Astrolog since version 1.1, and I'm glad to say that it's
X   *not* in version 2.2!
X
X3) If one switched X window modes from a wheel chart to the
X   relationship aspect grid, extra junk would be displayed in some cells.
X   The aspect grid routine has been fixed now to make sure that those
X   cells that don't have aspects in them stay blank.
X
X4) Attempting to display a chart with no time or space (i.e. a chart
X   generated with the -o0 option) in an X window would dump core if the
X   chart information was also to be printed at the bottom of the window.
X   Now, these charts are no longer a problem, and as with the standard
X   listing, these charts are flagged as existing outside the space time
X   continuum.
X
X5) The -Z local horizon chart when displayed in an X window would fail
X   to recognize the -R restrictions before, and they properly do now.
X
X6) Certain VMS X window systems didn't like the procedure I named
X   "box" in the graphics portion (was already defined). This has been
X   renamed to eliminate the problem.
X
X7) When downloading the Astrolog source code, certain systems didn't
X   correctly transfer lines that began with a decimal point (e.g. the
X   numbers in the planetary data area). These have been prefixed with 0's
X   to fix the problem.
X
X8) Even when compiling for non X window systems, the previous version
X   would still compile in the graphics draw tables and world map data.
X   Although this wouldn't affect the running any, it would needlessly
X   make the executable larger. Now, trust that the only data compiled
X   into the program will be what the user wants as expressed in the
X   compile time options.
X
X9) The X window response time was very slow if the world map was ever
X   displayed in the lowest scale size, due to continuous error processing
X   since the vertical axis of these maps were smaller than the
X   established minimum window size. The minimum window size allowed has
X   been adjusted to accomodate all scale sizes. Also, on a related note,
X   Astrolog windows behave better when one resizes them: instead of
X   immediately resizing the window to within bounds if one makes the
X   window too big or small, it now won't allow windows to be stretched
X   beyond the established limits.
X
X0) Finally a warning for PC users: You will probably want to change
X   the value of DIVISIONS in astrolog.h from its current value of 24 to a
X   lower value like 6 or so. Leaving it as is invoked complaints of
X   extreme slowness and occasional multiple hits in the -d aspect search
X   routine, where the same aspect would get listed more than once. Also
X   for PC users, I eliminated the problem of the 16 bit PC ints not
X   having enough precision to compare with the 32 bit Unix ints, in that
X   everything is done using longs now.

XAstrolog 2.25 posted Thu, 18 Jun 92 18:54:43 GMT
X************************************************
X
XAfter posting version 2.20 to alt.astrology, I found one small bug and
Xa few omissions, so I simply made those changes before posting
XAstrolog 2.25 to comp.sources.misc. To be honest, I did add one small
Xfeature or two, but nothing major.
X
XAnyway, here is a list of the changes I made in version 2.25:
X
X1) Bug fix: Version 2.20 has a bug which I accidentally introduced, in
Xwhich the planet declination values in the standard -v chart listing
Xwould always be positive. Version 2.25 fixes this. (This is basically
Xthe only change that will affect non X windows users.)
X
X2) Omission: When pressing the 'H' key in an X window to get a list of
Xvalid keypresses, version 2.20 wouldn't display all the keys
Xavailable, since I forgot to include some of them in that help list.
XThe key press features that I forgot to include, which are now
Xproperly listed in 2.25, were: The 'h' heliocentric toggle, the 's'
Xsiderial zodiac toggle, the 'B' dump window to root background key,
Xand the 'v' dump chart positions to text screen key.
X
X3) Omission: Related to the above, I forgot to include the new -ga
Xapplying vs. separating aspect grid switch in the -H help list. (It
Xwould still work correctly, it just wasn't listed.)
X
X4) New features: In X windows, press the 'f' key to toggle the status
Xof whether or not the chart should be modified to correspond to the
Xappropriate domal chart (where the house positions are represented as
Xzodiac positions and vice versa). Press the 'F' key to toggle the
Xstatus of whether or not the chart should be modified to correspond to
Xa decan chart (where each sign is divided in thirds representing the
Xtwo other signs in its element). These keys of course correspond the
X-f, and -3 options, respectively.
X
X5) Enhancement: The -XP polar globe view feature can now be animated.
XBefore, entering animation mode with such a view in place would yield
Xno visible effect. Now, such a chart will rotate about pole in the
Xcenter of the screen.
X
X6) I probably should have made this more clear in the version 2.20
X"Update" file before, but when compiling, be sure to change the values
Xin the "astrolog.dat" file, in addition to the "astrolog.h" file, to
Xcorrespond to your present location. The documentation now makes this
Xmore clear, and includes one large "Helpfile" listing all of the
Xfeatures and documentation in this version of Astrolog. (Remember when
Xposting version 2.20 here, I just included a list of changes added to
Xversion 2.10; the new Helpfile is a large stand alone documentation.)
X
X7) Finally, I should mention that my e-mail address has changed. It is
Xno longer pullen@lynx.cs.washington.edu, and this change has been made
Xto the code and documentation of version 2.25.

X************************************************
XAstrolog 2.30 posted Fri, 12 Sep 92 01:20:42 GMT
X************************************************
X
XPrecisely one year ago today I posted the very first version of our
XAstrolog astrology program to this newsgroup! Today, being the first
Xanniversary of that version 1.00, is an appropriate time to release
Xthe newest version of Astrolog: 2.30. Today is also a nice day
Xastrologically for such an activity: We have an energetic Moon Uranus
XSextile, a Mercury Neptune Trine enhancing mystical thinking, Mars is
Xin the last degree of mental Gemini, and of course, we have the
Xtechnical yet spiritual Virgo/Pisces Full Moon!
X
XThis file describes the new features, changes, and bug fixes in
Xversion 2.30 of Astrolog (over the most recent previous version, 2.25,
Xposted ~3 months ago). Although this new version is a stand alone
Xprogram, this Update file requires knowledge of the features of
Xversion 2.20 or 2.25 in order to make sense. If you aren't familiar
Xwith version 2.20 or 2.25, get and read the version 2.25 Helpfile that
Xwas posted earlier, or get it from any comp.sources.misc archive. (I
Xask the maintainer of the hilbert.maths.utas.edu.au alt.astrology ftp
Xsite to please add the code for this version to the /pub/astrology
Xdirectory along with previous versions. I'm not presently planning on
Xposting this version to comp.sources.misc right away, since I just
Xposted version 2.25, but a future version 2.40 will certainly be.)
X
XSome of the things added to version 2.30 are general interpretations
Xof planet positions and aspects, more support for aspects and making
Xthe charts look better, and several new functions not directly related
Xto astrology but still very useful, and of course a few important bug
Xfixes. Although most of the changes were for the text displays,
Xnevertheless X window users should like the new local space star chart
Xdisplay. Ability to have some graphics even on a non-X window system
Xis supported, and I finally got around to commenting all the code!
X
XThis post of Astrolog consists of 12 articles. They are: this Update
Xfile, the 8 source files, the standard astrolog.dat defaults file, the
XUnix Makefile, and a version History file, all the rest of which
Xshould be near this one in the article list. (I'm working on updating
Xthe comprehensive feature list to reflect version 2.30, and hopefully
Xeven a user friendly Astrolog FAQ file, but for now we'll have to do
Xwith the version 2.25 one and this Update list.) To make extracting
Xthe files easy for all users, I've posted the files straight in ascii
Xform to the net with no .sig files or "cut-here" prompts; in rn, one
Xcan extract the article with the "w" command and not have to use an
Xeditor on the file afterward.
X
X--
X
XAs with previous versions, a few changes have been made to this
Xversion, i.e. not just new features, but some things valid before are
Xno longer so. A list of these follows:
X
X1) The -AO switch allowing one to specify maximum orbs for aspects,
Xbut which as a side effect suspended maximum orbs that particular
Xplanets imposed, was a limited and unintuitive way to deal with
Xaspects. This switch has been completely eliminated. Now, one uses
Xjust the -Ao switch to give orbs for aspects. To deal with orbs that
Xplanets themselves impose, use the new -Am switch described later. In
Xaddition, one no longer uses -Ao by passing in a list of orbs for the
Xaspects. Now, the -Ao switch works clearer: it takes two parameters,
Xthe index of the aspect, and then what that aspect's orb should be.
X
X2) Astrolog.dat files for versions 2.25 and before won't work with
Xversion 2.30, because now there are additional definable parameters
Xinserted in this file. For the -I influence interpretation chart, the
Xpower given to planets in ruling sign, planets exalted in sign,
Xplanets in ruling house, and planets exalted in house, may now be
Xspecified. In addition, there are some additional lists in the file
Xdealing with aspects that will be described later.
X
X3) This is minor, but the calculation of the powers of aspects in the
X-I influence chart has been changed. Now, the power of an aspect is
Xmore accurately based on the total power of the planet in its
Xplacement, as opposed to just based on the inherent planet itself. In
Xother words, for example, a Conjunction between, say Venus and the
XSun, now gives more power to Venus if the Sun is in its ruling sign
XLeo than if it is in Aquarius. This will of course tend to make all
Xthe aspect power quantities in the -I list a bit higher.
X
X4) As with other versions, the true default chart in the program, i.e.
Xthe chart the program displays if one forces it to output chart
Xinformation even when a chart isn't being dealt with, e.g. displaying
Xa non-chart related X window -XG globe display, and then reverting to
Xa wheel chart, has been changed. Now it is set to the chart for the
Xposting of this program itself, i.e. the time of the Full Moon here in
XSeattle: Sep 11, 1992 7:18pm (-7:00 GMT) 122W20 47W36.
X
X5) Finally, unrelated to the program itself, I was just thinking about
Xhow we deal with Daylight Saving Time. Now, I've always said that one
Xshould subtract one hour from the time in question if Daylight time
Xwas in effect. This will generate the chart properly. However, I was
Xthinking that what really happens when Daylight Time arrives is that
Xthe whole time zone shifts forward one hour, in that the local time is
Xstill correct, it's just that the relation to GMT has changed an hour.
XIn other words, when casting charts for Daylight Time, one should
Xsubtract one hour from the time zone entered, and not the local time
Xitself. Now, the chart will be displayed properly either way, but it
Xseems that the one with the shifted time zone is clearer. I wanted to
Xbring up the subject so each can choose what they prefer.
X
X--
X
XNow, a comprehensive list of the features and extensions added to this
Xversion of Astrolog follows:
X
XA) A brief interpretation of the meaning of the positioning of each
Xplanet in its sign and house is supported with the -vI switch. If one
Xincludes the -vI switch, then instead of the standard -v listing of
Xplanet positions, the planet positions will be listed with a brief
Xinterpretation of what they mean. Again, I have to say that this is a
Xpretty limited version of interpretation, being nothing more than a
Xcombining of phrases representing the planet, sign, and house in
Xquestion; nevertheless, people who don't know how to interpret charts
Xmight find this to be of use (or at least amusing. :)
X
XB) Similar to the above, ability to give a brief interpretation of
Xeach aspect in the aspect grid is supported with the -gI switch. When
Xthe -gI switch is included, the standard -g aspect grid will be
Xreplaced with a list of each aspect occurring and a brief listing of
Xwhat it means. Again, this is mainly just a lookup of the general
Xmeanings of each planet and the aspect in question, but still might be
Xfound of interest by some. (Note: only the first 11 aspects, out to
Xthe Bi-Quintile, can be considered.)
X
XC) Related to the above, the -I0 switch, invoked by itself, will
Xdisplay the general meanings of each sign, each house, each planet,
Xand each aspect, on the screen. This is more or less the database the
Xprogram uses to base the above interpretations on.
X
XD) The -g text aspect grid now displays orbs to the nearest minute
Xinstead of only to the tenth of degree as before. Also, midpoints are
Xdisplayed to the nearest minute instead of just to the degree. And,
Xon the main diagonal (or edges if a relationship aspect grid) is
Xdisplayed the sign of the planet in question in addition to the planet
Xname itself. This extra accuracy comes from my making each cell in the
Xgrid 3x3 characters instead of just 3x2 as before, which gives more
Xroom to print information. This change should make the aspect part of
Xthe program much more useful and easy to read for text users. There's
Xbeen one more nice change: the unintuitive '.' for positive orbs and
X',' for negative orbs has been replaced with a logical '+' for
Xpositive and '-' for negative; for the -ga aspect grids we have a 'a'
Xfor applying aspects and 's' for separating. (Satisfied yet Maggie? ;)
X
XE) Ability to explicitly specify maximum orbs that any aspect can make
Xto a particular planet is supported with the -Am switch. This is used
Xfor objects like the North Node which require narrower orbs than what
Xthe aspects themselves normally allow. The -Am switch takes two
Xparameters: the first to indicate the index of the object, and the
Xsecond to indicate what the maximum orb allowed to it will be. By
Xdefault, the only objects with restriction are the Node, Part of
XFortune, Vertex, and stars, which allow a 2 degree max orb to them.
XWith this option, one can change these limits or impose restrictions
Xfor other planets too. (Before, these particular values were forced.)
XThe astrolog.dat file has been expanded to read in the default planet
Xorbs for the first 20 objects.
X
XF) Ability to widen an aspect orb for any planet is supported with the
X-Ad switch. This is used for objects like the Sun and Moon which allow
Xwider orbs to them then what the aspects themselves allow. Like the
X-Am switch, this -Ad switch takes two parameters: the first to
Xindicate the object, and the second to indicate how much wider orbs
Xallowed to it will be. By default, the only objects which have orbs
Xwidened for them are the Sun and Moon, each of which adds one degree
Xto the orb of any aspect to it, and these particular values were
Xforced. With this option, one can change these additions or allow
Xother objects to have them, too. The astrolog.dat file has been
Xexpanded to read in these orb additions for the first 20 planets.
X
XG) Biorythm charts are now supported by Astrolog with the -rb switch!
XAlthough not directly related to Astrology, the concepts are similar,
Xand adding this didn't require much extra code, and since some are
Xinterested in this, I felt I'd add it in. The biorythm theory says
Xthat we have have three main types of energy: Physical, Emotional, and
XIntellectual. These three run in continuous wave cycles from high to
Xlow, each of which repeats about every 30 days or so. Therefore, a
Xbiorythm chart for a particular day should describe how much energy
Xone has or how they are feeling in this area. Now, Astrolog considers
Xbiorythm charts as a type of relationship chart, because in order to
Xgenerate one, two dates or charts are needed: the birth date of the
Xperson, and the date to cast their chart for. Technically the program
Xwill replace the standard -v listing of planet positions with the
Xbiorythm chart when -rb is in effect. As an example, "-rb file1 file2"
Xwill cast the chart for the birthday signified by chart1 or chart2
X(whichever is older) for the date in the other file. Remember that one
Xcan substitude the pseudo filename 'tty' to mean get the chart info
Xfrom the terminal instead.
X
XThe actual biorythm chart itself will display, for the day in
Xquestion, what the percentages of the physical, emotional, and
Xintellectual cycles are, as numbers from -100% (low ebb) to +100%
X(happy and full of energy). In addition, the biorythm percentages for
Xthe seven days before (T-7 days) and the seven days after (T+7 days)
Xthe date in question will be listed, too, so one can see if the cycles
Xare rising or falling. Finally, as a cute way to help in
Xinterpretation, the program prints the appropriate smiley, medium, or
Xsad face after each percentage. (BTW, it takes over 58 years for all
Xthree cycles together to synchronize and repeat themselves.)
X
XH) Another useful non-astrological function added is the ability to
Xdetermine how many days have passed between two dates, with the -rd
Xswitch. As with the -rb option, this is considered a relationship
X"chart" because it requires the input of two different dates, and when
X-rd is in effect, again the standard -v planet position listing will
Xbe replaced by a line telling how many days are in the interval. For
Xexample, "-rd person1 person2", will display how many days person1 is
Xolder than person2 (or the other day around). Want to find out how
Xmany days old you will be on Jan. 1, 2000? Do "-rd yourchart tty", and
Xtype in the first date of the next millenium, and see what you get!
X
XI) The -t option has been enhanced based on the above two new
Xfeatures. Remember, the -t option is a shorthand for specifying a
Xrelationship comparision chart where one of the charts is that for the
Xcurrent moment now (assuming you have TIME compiled in.) The -tb
X<file> switch will display the person indicated in file's biorythm for
Xtoday. The -td <file> switch will display how many days old the person
Xin the file is today.
X
XJ) Just as the -1 option is use to cast a chart with an object on the
XAscendant, the new -2 <object> switch will cast a chart with the
Xspecified object on the Midheaven. The house cusps will be rotated so
Xthat the object in question is conjunct the 10th house cusp. If
X<object> is not specified, the Sun will be assumed by default.
X
XK) The new -F option is used to force a particular object's position
Xto always be a particular location in the zodiac. This feature can be
Xused as an easy way to manually include things Astrolog normally
Xdoesn't in various charts. For example, this can be used to force the
Xposition of some minor thing, like the Vertex, to always be the
Xlocation of whatever you prefer, like the 0 degrees Aries point, or an
Ximportant midpoint. Then you can do an aspect grid, transit search, or
Xwhatever, and calculate aspects to midpoints or transits over
Xmidpoints. The -F switch takes three arguments: first is the index of
Xthe object to replace, next is the sign from 1..12 to force it to be,
Xand third is the degree within the sign. For example, if I want to see
Xif anything is making an exact aspect today with my Sun Moon midpoint
Xat 6Sag28, I could do "astrolog -n -d -F 16 9 6.28", which would
Xreplace the North Node with my Sun Moon midpoint in the aspect search.
X
XL) The -+ add number of days to chart before casting it option has
Xbeen changed to make the chart header show the date of the actual new
Xchart, instead of the original one. For example, today (9-11), if I do
X"astrolog -n -+ 2" I will get the chart for two days from now, and the
Xchart header will display 9-13. (Before, the proper chart for 9-13
Xwould get displayed, but the chart header would still say the date of
Xthe original 9-11 chart.) This change is more intuitive, and even has
Xsome special uses. For example, if you want to know what the date
Xwas/will be when you are 10000 days old, do "astrolog -i yourchart -+
X10000" and see what the date in the resulting chart header is.
X
XM) The -w text chart wheel display has a small addition to the chart
Xheader information displayed in the middle of the wheel: the day of
Xthe week that the date falls on. This may seem minor, but this is a
Xway to calculate the day of the week for any date. If you forgot what
Xday of the week you were born on, display your chart with the -w
Xswitch, and ignore the chart and just check the day of the week in the
Xheader information. Similarly, one could use this to make a calendar
Xfor any particular month by casting a -w chart for the 1st of the
Xmonth in question, and building the calendar from that starting point.
X
XN) The -H0 switch will display a list of the 12 signs of the zodiac,
Xand the 12 houses, listing their standard and traditional names. This
Xis similar to switches like -O or -A, in that it displays lists of
Xthings (objects, aspects, or in this case the signs) that Astrolog
Xuses in its charts.
X
XO) One more summation field has been added in the -v planet position
Xlist chart to the right of the element table. (Presently we have the
Xnumber of objects in positive and negative polarity signs, in the
Xupper and lower halves in the chart, and in the Eastern and Western
Xhalves of the chart.) The new field is a division of objects into the
Xfirst six and second six signs of the zodiac. The number of objects in
Xthe first six signs of the zodiac will be printed, labeled by the
Xcharacter '<'. (The number in the second half isn't printed; just
Xsubtract from the total if you want to know.) According to a book on
Xthe Kaballah, the emphasis of the first six signs on the zodiac is on
X"what's to learn", and the emphasis on the second six signs is on
X"what's to share". Use or interpret this as you wish.
X
XP) I have taken the liberty to define ruling and exalting signs for
Xthe asteroids (and the rest of the first twenty objects that don't
Xalready have them.) This won't affect much other than whether a 'R',
X'F', 'e', or 'd' is displayed in the -v charts, but it will slightly
Xaffect the powers given to these objects in the -I influence chart
Xsince they now can be in their ruling sign. The -O object list will
Xdisplay the list of ruling and exalting signs (and the fall and
Xdebilitating signs which are just opposite the above) for all these
Xobjects in addition to the planets; however, I have listed them below:
X
XChiron, the compassionate, experienced healer, is most similar in
Xfunction to Pisces, hence Chiron rules here. Chrion expresses well in
Xcaring, feeling, Cancer, hence Chiron exalts here. Ceres, goddess of
Xagriculture and representing the mothering, reproductive instinct, is
Xsimilar in function to Taurus, hence Ceres rules here. Ceres expresses
Xwell in the nurturing, caring, sign of Cancer, hence Ceres exalts
Xhere. Pallas Athena, mentally acute and unemotional, is most similar
Xin function to Virgo, hence Pallas rules here. Pallas expresses well
Xin practical, disciplined, introverted Capricorn, hence Pallas exalts
Xhere. Juno, ability to sacrifice self-interests to maintain a
Xrelationship, is most similar in function to relationship oriented
XLibra, hence Juno rules here. Juno expresses well in sociable, crowd
Xpleasing Leo, hence Juno exalts here. Vesta, with its orientation to
Xdirecting hidden creative or sexual energy without fear, is most
Xsimilar in function to Scorpio, hence Vesta rules here. Vesta
Xexpresses well in individualistic, quirky Aquarius, hence Vesta exalts
Xhere. The North Node, with its emphasis on being able to break from
Xthe past routine and pursue the unfamiliar and personal growth, is
Xmost similar in function to soceity questioning independent Aquarius,
Xhence it rules here. The Node expresses well in growth and sacrifice
Xoriented Virgo, hence the Node exalts here. The Part of Fortune is
Xcalculated based on the positions of the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant; if
Xthese three objects are in their ruling signs, then the Fortune will
Xfall in Pisces, hence the Fortune should rule here. Similarly, if the
XSun, Moon, and Ascendant are all in their exalting signs, then the
XFortune will fall in Aquarius, hence the Fortune should exalt here.
XThe Midheaven, being the 10th house cusp, corresponds to Capricorn,
Xruled by Saturn. Hence the Midheaven's ruling and exalting signs are
Xthe same as Saturn's: Capricorn and Libra. The Ascendant corresponds
Xsimilarly to Mars, hence its ruling and exalting signs are the same:
XAries and Capricorn. The Vertex, being always near the Descendant,
Xcorresponds to Libra, and hence has the same rulership and exaltation
Xas Venus: Libra and Pisces.
X
XQ) The user interface where one manually inputs the chart information
Xhas been enhanced in a few ways. First, the true names of months or
Xtheir abbreviations may be entered (in upper or lower case) instead of
Xthe corresponding number if you prefer. At most the first three
Xletters of the month are needed; some months (like February which is
Xthe only month starting with "F") may be abbreviated all the way up to
Xtheir first letter. The second enhancement is that the time value may
Xbe entered with a "pm" or "am" (or just "p" and "a") suffix in
Xaddition to the standard 24 hour clock always used up to now. For
Xexample, instead of entering "18.30" for "6:30pm", you can enter
X"6.30pm" or even "6.3p" and the program will process it the same.
XSimilarly, "12.30am" can be used instead of "0.30", and so on. The
Xfinal enhancement is that colons may be used instead of decimal points
Xfor the time and location values. For example "6.30" may be entered as
X"6:30" intead, and longitude values like "122.20" may be entered
X"122:20", which is more intuitive than those earlier decimal points.
X
XR) One more object, another star, has been added to the program.
XActually, this isn't really a star, but the Andromeda (M31) Galaxy.
XThis is the closest galaxy to our own Milky Way, and various
Xextraterrestrial hierarchies are said to be based there, so its
Xposition should be of significance. Its object index is that of the
Xvery last object in the program, which is presently #79.
X
XS) Finally, all the C source files for the program have been
Xcompletely commented! Although it may not be commented heavily, at
Xleast every routine has a comment describing what it does, and
XAstrolog is now a more respectable program as opposed to being a huge
XHACK! (Actually, I probably could have doubled the number of features
Xadded to this version of the program if I didn't spend all that time
Xputting in those comments! :)
X
XNow, for a list of the new features added in the graphics area:
X
XT) There is a new compile time variable dealing with graphics (in
Xaddition to the X11 one) called GRAPH. One comments out the #define
XGRAPH line if they don't want graphics, and not just if they don't
Xhave X windows. In other words, one can now generate most of
XAstrolog's graphics charts even if they don't have X windows. (The X11
X#define is still there for we X windows users who will find the
Xgraphics features just as before.) Now, when GRAPH is defined but X11
Xisn't, the program will generate the charts, but just never try to
Xbring up a window; it will simply always assume that you are writing a
Xbitmap file. The bitmap file will contain a (unfortunately always
Xblack and white) image of what would normally be in the window, just
Xas the -Xb switch does. One can then use any of various graphics
Xutilities to convert the image into something they can display on
Xtheir system. (Any system that can compile Astrolog should be able to
Xcompile in the non X window graphics features as well.)
X
XU) A new graphics chart is available through the -Z0 switch: local
Xhorizon charts suitable for stargazing. Now, as in previous versions,
Xthe normal -Z switch generates a listing of the planets with repect to
Xthe local horizon, and the -Z combined with the -X switch generates a
Xgraphic image of the planets and stars on the local horizon. This
Xchart assumes one is facing due south, and is divided left to right by
Xthe horizon line, with straight up being toward the top of the screen
Xand straight down toward the bottom. This is a good chart, especially
Xfor noticing the rising and setting of planets and other objects, but
Xthe fact that the meridian is split up causes distortion when trying
Xto view objects high up in the sky. Therefore, if one combines the new
X-Z0 switch with the -X switch, a new differently oriented local
Xhorizon chart will be displayed. Here, the zenith point straight up is
Xin the center of the screen, and the horizon line is a surrounding
Xcircle. Due north is along the line from the center to the top of the
Xscreen, due south is on the line from the center to the bottom, east
Xis to the left, and west is to the right. In other words, this is just
Xlike what one would see if they were lying on their back looking
Xstraight up with their feet to the south, so this should be better for
Xstargazing. Outside the circle marks what's below the horizon, and the
Xextreme corners of the screen mark the nadir - what's straight down.
XAs with the normal -Z graphic chart, this one has the various axes
Xmarked at five degree increments.
X
XV) The new -XW0 switch is just like the normal -XW switch in that it
Xjust displays the world map and nothing else, except that this new
X-XW0 map generated will be in what's called the Mollewide projection,
Xa good looking form often used for maps of the world, as opposed to
Xthe standard rectangular map projection used up until now which
Xdistorts the polar regions of the globe across the top and bottom of
Xthe screen. (The Mollewide projection pinches the polar regions
Xtogether, generating a elliptical map, which is similar to the -XG
Xglobe displays, but which shows the whole world instead of just half.)
X
XW) The -XW and -XW0 maps can be animated like as the -XG globe display
Xcan. Animation of these maps (which before would just sit there) are
Xdone by shifting the whole map to one side or the other. In fact, such
Xa feature can be used indirectly to shift one of the X window
Xastro-graph charts (which are drawn on the world map) from the normal
Xcase of having the date line on the edges of the screen: Go into the
Xworld map or globe display, animate it a bit, and then change graphic
Xmodes to display the astro-graph chart, and it will be shifted by the
Xcorresponding amount. (Note that animating the astro-graph screen
Xitself will change the chart info, not how the screen itself is done.)
X
XX) Because the -XW world map, and -XP polar globe display, can be
Xanimated just as the -XG general globe display can, the -XW and -XP
Xswitches now accept optional parameters on the command line that will
Xspecify what degree (from 0 to 359) to start the map at, just like the
X-XG switch does. In addition, the -XG option itself accepts a second
Xoptional parameter, which is the starting angle for the globe's tilt,
Xfrom -90 to +90 degrees.
X
XY) A new bitmap output mode has been added to the graphics routines.
XIf one changes BITMAPMODE in astrolog.h to the character 'A' when
Xcompiling, then all bitmaps output will be in a straight ascii form,
Xwith one character corresponding to each pixel. This format is
Xidentical to the result produced by the unix command bmtoa, and it can
Xbe converted back into a bitmap with the unix command atobm. Although
Xnot as efficient spacewise, this is a simpler format, and is
Xrecommended for those without X windows who are still using Astrolog's
Xgraphics, if they want to write their own conversion program.
X
XZ) This is probably more of a glitch fix than a new feature, but
Xanyway one may have noticed that text would never get printed in a
Xbitmap. This could be problem, because it meant that the chart
Xinformation couldn't be shown, and the actual object labels of stars
Xand other things without glyphs wouldn't appear in bitmaps. This was
Xcaused by the fact that the program always used the X library text
Xprinting routine to show any text. Well, now Astrolog includes its own
Xinternal 6x10 text font, which works just as well as the X library's
Xdoes, and which can be written in the -Xb bitmaps as well.
X
XWell, I've reached the end of the alphabet, so this concludes the 26
Xnew features in Astrolog 2.30 :)
X
X--
X
XAnd now for a list of bugs in version 2.25 that have now been fixed:
X
X1) A very major bug caused all the positions of the stars to always be
Xabout 25 degrees farther in the zodiac than they should have been. In
Xother words, all the stars were in the wrong positions and this
Xfeature was basically useless in version 2.25. All the stars are now
Xin their proper positions at all times.
X
X2) The entire X astro-graph chart would be shifted a large amount if
Xthe longitude of the chart in question was different from the present
Xdefault longitude. This was because the program improperly used the
Xdefault longitude instead of the longitude of the chart in question in
Xthe astro-graph routine. This was only in the X version; the text
Xastro-graph routine would always work fine. Now they both work
Xproperly.
X
X3) The locations of the lines in both the text and X astro-graph
Xroutines would slightly change if one changed the location of the
Xchart in question. This was minor and almost unnoticeable, since the
Xabberation would never be more than a degree in any direction.
XNevertheless, astro-graph charts should be based only on birth time
Xand never on location, so this was a slight problem. This has been
Xfixed so the astro-graph charts are always identical no matter what
Xthe location data may be.
X
X4) A glitch in command switch processing would allow any time zone
Xexcept zero to be passed to the -z switch. Now, "-z 0" is accepted and
Xproperly processed.
X
X5) The -rm time space midpoint chart would occasionally have the
Xlongitude of the resulting chart 180 degrees off from where it should
Xbe, if both charts were close to different sides of the date line.
XThis will no longer happen.
X
X6) Those objects which imposed maximum limits upon the aspect orbs
Xthat any other object could make with it, e.g. 2.0 degrees for the
XNorth Node and others, would force this value to be the orb with it
Xeven if the orb for the aspect in question was less. For example, if
Xone set septiles to have a max orb of 1 degree, then the program would
Xstill allow a 2 degree septile between the planet in question and the
Xnorth node to appear in the grid. This has been fixed, and now the
Xlesser between the aspect's defined orb and the object's defined orb
Xis used to determine if an aspect is in effect.
X
X7) The -Ao and -AO switches would work properly, but would cause
Xadditional command line switches after their aspect orb lists to not
Xget processed. This has been fixed.
X
X8) Finally, the fiasco caused for PC users by my inserting #define int
Xlong in the code to fix the fact that PC's ints are only 16 bits has
Xbeen remedied. Now, ints remain ints, and those variables in the code
Xwhich require 32 bits are specifically defined long, which is what I
Xshould have done in the first place. In fact, to save space, some
Xlarge arrays were able to be declared in 8 bit chars, so the problem
Xof PC's running out of global variable space should no longer be a
Xproblem.

X************************************************
XAstrolog 2.40 posted Wed, 20 Jan 93 03:23:16 GMT
X************************************************
X
X     Surprise! The Sun enters Aquarius today, sign of the unexpected.
X(Aquarius quote: I'm not weird, everyone else is :) To appropriately
Xhonor one of my favorite signs of the zodiac, I am releasing the
Xnewest version of Astrolog: 2.40!
X
X     This particular file describes the new features and bug fixes in
Xversion 2.40 of Astrolog (over the formerly most recent version, 2.30,
Xposted four months ago). This new version is a stand alone program;
Xhowever, this Update file requires knowledge of the features in
Xversion 2.30 in order to be of much use. If you aren't already
Xfamiliar with version 2.30, get and read the version 2.30 Helpfile
Xthat was posted here last month, which should be available at our
Xalt.astrology anonymous ftp site at hilbert.maths.utas.edu.au.
X
X     The main new things added to version 2.40 are ansi mode graphics
Xand color for text charts, and midpoint charts, in addition to much
Ximproved PC support. This is the first version that I've ever
Xpersonally tested and run on a PC, so it should run just as smoothly
Xon a PC as on a Unix system with X windows. X window graphics support,
Xalthough I haven't added very much to this release, at least is as
Xeasy to work with as before, and is less buggy too.
X
X     The long awaited PC windows graphics that I've promised are not
Xhere yet. It is however very easy now to compile with the GRAPH option
Xset, so PC users can generate bitmaps. Under Microsoft Windows at
Xleast one can generate a Windows .bmp file and then go set their
Xbackground to it, indirectly simulating the -XB switch used by X
Xusers. Since (1) all the former versions of Astrolog have been
Xdifficult to compile for PC's, (2) I have a nice easily compilable
Xversion right now with some decent new features, (3) The real version
XI was planning on posting will still take a couple of months, (4)
XThere were unfortunately a few bugs in version 2.30 that would cause
Xproblems on Unix and X platforms that I was getting all this email
Xover, I have chosen to post this version now instead of waiting.
XThere may be less new features than normal, but that will mean less
Xbugs, and besides it isn't that difficult to release a new version.
X
X     This post of Astrolog consists of 7 articles. First is this
XUpdate file. Second is instructions on how to compile along with the
XUnix Makefile and makefiles for a few other platforms. Third is the
Xastrolog.dat defaults file (remember astrolog.dat files from version
X2.30 and before are not compatible with 2.40!) Fourth is the 8 source
Xfiles all together in one big shar file (no more one source file per
Xarticle releases!) Fifth are the same 8 source files again, but in a
Xuuencoded .zip file (unix users can easily extract through the shell
Xarchive, while PC users will like this zip file.) Sixth is a uuencoded
Xready to run executable for PCs (of course the code should be easy to
Xcompile now too.) Seventh is a History file describing the things
Xadded to the 10 previous versions of astrolog that have been posted in
Xthe past. I have also put all these files in /pub/incoming/astrolog at
Xthe hilbert ftp site, so they should be readily accessible via ftp in
X/pub/astrology soon. As for a formal comprehensive Helpfile describing
Xall the features in 2.40 together, I haven't made that up yet, but I
Xwill soon (and I promise it won't take me three months as it did with
Xversion 2.30! I don't like writing documentation! :)
X
X--
X
XHere are the new features for version 2.40 that aren't in previous releases!
X
XA. -k switch: Ansi graphics! The text charts may now be displayed in
X   color, as well as with real graphics characters instead of with stuff
X   like dashes and pluses. This makes the text charts look almost as
X   cool as their color X11 graphic counterparts. All that's needed is a
X   terminal that accepts ansi escape sequences.  You will get garbage if
X   you include -k on a non-ansi terminal. Most PC's are in ansi mode, so
X   if you have a PC this should work. Include the -k switch on the
X   command line, and the program will display all charts as before, but
X   change the color appropriately for every part of any chart printed!
X   Just try a -w chart, a -g grid, or a -T list and see the difference
X   of how much easier it is to find a planet or aspect among a large chart.
X
X   Color isn't used randomly but is based on logic. Most colors are very
X   similar to the ones chosen in the color X charts. In general,
X   everything is based on the following rules for elements: Fire is Red,
X   Earth is Yellow, Air is Green, and Water is Blue. Zodiac signs and
X   positions are printed in the color of their element. Houses are
X   printed in the color of their corresponding sign. Planets are printed
X   in the color of the sign they rule. As for the other objects, we have
X   the following colors: Asteroids are in bright purple (magenta),
X   Uranians are in dim purple, and non-physical points like the Node,
X   Fortune, and Vertex are in a bluish gray (dark cyan). Stars are
X   either orange if they are bright (magnitude < 1.0) or a dark red if
X   dimmer. For aspects we have the following: Conjunctions are Yellow,
X   Oppositions are Blue, Squares are Red, Trines are Green, Sextiles are
X   Light Blue (Cyan). For the minor aspects we have magenta for
X   inconjunct/semisextile, orange for semisquare/sesquiquadrature, dark
X   cyan for all the quintiles, dark purple for all the septiles, and
X   dark red for all the noviles.
X
XB. -m switch: A new chart type is available: true midpoint charts.
X   Before midpoints were only available in the aspect grid. Use the -m
X   switch and get a list of all midpoints printed out sorted in zodiac
X   order. So if you want to see if any important midpoint is close to
X   your Sun, this is a much easier chart to use than to scrutinize the
X   midpoint/aspect grid.
X
XC. -m0 switch: Aspects too may now be displayed in a nice ordered
X   list, instead of only in the -g aspect grid. Invoke the above switch
X   as -m0 instead of just -m and get a list of every aspect from the
X   aspect grid printed out one per line. The order in which they are
X   printed is based on the total "power" in the aspect, i.e. the
X   influence of the two planets in question, the aspect in question, and
X   the orb. The same info and data from the -I influence charts are used
X   here, so changing those default influences will affect the ordering.
X   The two planets are printed, the aspect they make, their orb, and
X   then the power of the aspect used in ordering. Any power number more
X   than 10 is a very major aspect. An exact Sun Moon conjunction can
X   exceed 25. So, if you want to know if that exact Mars Jupiter
X   conjunction is more powerful than that wide Sun Moon sextile, try a
X   -m0 chart and find out at least what Astrolog's opinion is.
X
XD. -Xb switch extension: If GRAPH is defined, there is a new format
X   one can output bitmap files in. The .bmp extension bitmap files
X   commonly used on PC's running under Microsoft Windows are supported.
X   One can change this default file mode in astrolog.h before compiling,
X   or it may be specified directly as described below. If you have a PC
X   running Windows, you can set your root background to be one of these
X   monochrome Astrolog bitmaps by: use the -Xb option to create a bitmap
X   file, then rename it to have the extension .bmp and put it in your
X   Windows subdirectory, then go into Program Manager -> Control Panels
X   -> Desktop and select this file to be your "wallpaper".
X
XE. -Xb switch extension: Another bitmap file extension, this one
X   allows the the bitmap file mode to be changed without having to
X   recompile the program, as had to be done before. Now, one can change
X   the mode by putting an extra character on the command line after the
X   -Xb switch. Specifically, to override the compile time mode, use -Xbn
X   for a standard X11 bitmap, -Xbc for an X11 bitmap with some white
X   space removed, -Xbv for a very compact X11 bitmap, -Xba for the one
X   character per pixel ascii dump, and finally -Xbb for the new .bmp
X   mode described above.
X
XF. -X1 <object> switch: Yet another graphics feature, this allows one
X   to effectively rotate one of the graphic wheel charts so that a
X   particular object is hinged to the left hand (east) edge of the
X   chart. Given the -X1 switch with the index value of an object, the
X   wheel is drawn but always rotated so that the object in question is
X   at the left side of the chart. By default we have the ascendant at
X   the left edge, of course. This is useful for tracking important
X   planets so one knows where they are, but yet doesn't distort the
X   house cusps as the -1 switch does. This is basically my official
X   version of the "-D" switch in Andrew's 2.30 PC port posted earlier.
X
XG. -X2 <object> switch: This is identical to the -X1 switch above
X   except here we rotate the entire graphic wheel so the object in
X   question is always at the top of the chart. Note that during a day,
X   the degree difference between the Ascendant and Midheaven varies in
X   most house systems, so that with the Ascendant hinged at the left
X   edge, the Midheaven will wobble back and forth near the top of the
X   wheel. If you prefer, "-X2 18" will fix the Midheaven at the top of
X   the screen, and the chart will be like before except the Ascendant
X   will be the one to wobble near the left edge of the chart.
X
XH. The -w text wheel switch takes an optional parameter now to
X   specify the size in text rows of each house printed. Before, this
X   always has to be four, but now one may increase (realize this will
X   make the chart require more than 24 lines to print) or decrease
X   (don't know why you would want to, but you can) this value to their
X   preference. The parameter may range from 1 to 10, being 4 by
X   default, and with this you can nicely generate a text wheel chart
X   with all 79 objects in it, which before would overflow the houses.
X
XI. The -+ and -- add/subtract number of days to current chart before
X   casting options before always required a parameter. Now, this
X   parameter is optional, defaulting to 1. For example, to see what
X   aspects are occurring among the planets tomorrow, before you would
X   have to include "-n -+ 1 -d", and now we can just do "-n -+ -d".
X
XJ. The astrolog.dat file has been extended to accept three additional
X   variables. First is whether the -k ansi graphics should always be in
X   effect. If set, then it is assumed -k is always in affect, and one
X   needs then to use the -k switch to return to normal. This is
X   recommended for PC users who display charts on the screen more often
X   than they print one out. Second is the default number of rows to pass
X   to the -w switch. To change this before one has to recompile the
X   program; now we can just change the value in the astrolog.dat file (or
X   just put the value after -w). Finally, the value of DIVISIONS may be
X   changed in the file. This value tells how many segments we should
X   divide each day, etc, when doing aspect or transit searches (-d or
X   -T). More segments is slower but can be more accurate by a minute or
X   two. I suggest a value of 24 here for Unix systems and 8 for PC's, but
X   now it is easy to experiment to see what would be best for you.
X
XK. Many PC users are accustomed to specifying command line parameters
X   with a "/" instead of the "-" familiar in the Unix environment. Now,
X   either of these formats are allowed. One may invoke a command switch
X   with a dash, with a slash, or with no lead character at all, and
X   Astrolog will process it properly.
X
XL. This is hardly a new feature, but the old NOASTEROIDS compile time
X   option that would automatically assume -R to be in effect is gone.
X   This was reduntant, and can easily be done by restricting the
X   appropriate planets with the astrolog.dat file now that that's here.
X
XM. Very minor, but the -g aspect/midpoint grids now include the
X   degree of each planet that is labelled down the main axis in addition
X   to its zodiac sign location.
X
X--
X
XHere are the bugs in version 2.30 that have been fixed in this release.
X
X1. The default restrictions weren't read correctly from the
X   astrolog.dat file. This was a major problem that was often more than
X   just the program ignoring what was put in that file. Some systems
X   would always crash with a bus error upon startup, while some would
X   print over a dozen lines telling of "bad memory access" every time
X   the program was invoked. Everything works find now (as it did in all
X   versions before 2.30).
X
X2. A major bug that primarily affected some Unix users, was one which
X   on some systems would prevent one from being able to open an X
X   window, always giving a "Can't Open Display" message. Everything
X   works fine now (again as it did in all versions before 2.30). This
X   was due to an unfortunate conflict between an Astrolog and a system
X   function.
X 
X3. On PC systems, the transit lists would display garbage for the
X   dates about 2/3 of the way down the list. This was due to an overflow
X   of small ints on the PC. These lists are displayed without error now.
X
X4. Another PC glitch, this bug caused the day of the week displayed
X   in the middle of the -w text wheel chart to always be off by a few
X   days. This was another overflow of a 16 bit PC int that has been
X   fixed.
X
X5. PC users would have all kinds of trouble if they tried to compile
X   with GRAPH #define'd. The compiler would puke on the large (over one
X   megabyte) bitmap array, and even if one got around this, there would
X   be many flaws in the display due to still more int overflows. Well,
X   now the overflows are all fixed, and the bitmap array is much more
X   efficient and is down to under 64K in size! So all PC users should be
X   able to run with the GRAPH option now, and finally get to see some
X   graphics. (X window users will still find everything as before.)
X
X6. Astrolog.dat files from before version 2.30 were not compatible
X   with 2.30 itself. This wasn't a bug, in that version 2.40 is no
X   exception (version 2.30 astrolog.dat files won't work with it and
X   must be replaced.) What was a problem is that version 2.30 wouldn't
X   complain about these old files, and would happily read all sorts of
X   erroneous data in. The program would either hang trying to read the
X   old file, or would read in all kinds of crazy defaults. Now
X   everything is fine, and the program will print a nice error message
X   if one tries to run this version on any pre 2.40 astrolog.dat file.
X
X7. The automatic convert string month to number feature in the main
X   manual data entry area would generate the wrong number for certain
X   months. Simply entering numbers would always work, but typing in some
X   strings such as "Jan", "Mar", "Apr", etc, would not result in the
X   logical month number implied. No longer a problem.
X
X8. The -F switch was flawed in that although it would correctly
X   change the location of the object in question, the original house the
X   object would have been in was not updated. As a result, one could
X   move a seventh house Venus in Libra over to Aries, and the program
X   would display Venus in Aries, but still in the 7th house! Everything
X   is updated properly now.
X
X9. In the -ga aspect grid lists, the orbs of aspects between two
X   stars would always be displayed to be zero, even if this wasn't the
X   case. The proper orbs between stars in the grid are printed now.
X
X10. The -1 and -2 put object on house cusp options would not allow
X   one to include any of the objects beyond the first 20. This has been
X   remedied, and now one may include uranians, stars, etc here.
X
X11. The -I0 general interpretations list would ignore the current -A
X   number of aspects setting when it displayed the meanings of the
X   aspects. Minor, but still something to be fixed.
X
X--
X
X     That's it for this pre-new Moon release. Expect a version 2.50 or
Xeven a 3.00 with real Windows for PC's, and more interpretation stuff,
Xetc, next time. Instructions to compile are in the next article with
Xthe Makefiles. The astrological "chart" (and hence the default chart
Xin memory you get if you force an X window chart without giving any
Xtime) for version 2.40 is at 5:29pm PST (8 hr before GMT) on Jan 19,
X1993 here in Seattle, WA 122W20, 47N36 (cusp of Aquarius.)
