XHelpfile for Astrolog version 3.00 (March 1993):
X
XThis file contains a complete list of all the features available in
XAstrolog version 3.00, and documentation on how to use each option.
XThe file is divided into six parts:
X
X1) A summary list of all the main features which are accessed via
Xcommand line parameter switches, along with a list of single keypress
Xcommands that can be given in an X window or to the screen (assuming
Xyou have graphics) to change the display in various ways.
X
X2) The list of command switches and keypresses is repeated, but after
Xeach option is listed a more lengthy description of the details of
Xthe feature.
X
X3) Details of default parameters, in compile time options and in the
Xdefault parameter file, are described.
X
X4) Descriptions of things that appear in the Astrolog text displays
Xare described. This consists of describing how to enter chart
Xinformation into the program, and how to interpret what is seen in
Xthe main display.
X
X5) Next to last is a description of the different graphic chart
Xdisplays and how they are organized, and the X windows features in
Xgeneral. (Looking for a quick impressive display to prove Astrolog
Xwas worth compiling? In Unix try: "astrolog -Xn -XG -Xw 400". :)
X
X6) Finally are discussed the program's graphics features for PC's,
Xhow to use them, and the few ways they are different from X windows.

X**********************************
XDESCRIPTION OF EACH COMMAND SWITCH
X**********************************
X
X     Note: Astrolog allows command line parameter switches to be
Xinvoked with either the leading dash ("-") standard to Unix users, or
Xa leading slash ("/") that many PC users are accustomed to. Not only
Xthat, but the leading character is actually optional, and isn't
Xnecessary at all! For example, the command "astrolog -i chartfile -R
X-u -U -Z -Xs 300 -Xi -XB" can be done as "astrolog /i chartfile /r /u
X/U /Z /Xs 300", or can be abbreviated as "astrolog i chartfile R u U
XZ Xs 300 Xi XB". (This is subject to a couple of minor limitations,
Xin that one can't have the -1 or -3 option follow a -R restriction
Xlist of numbers, since "-1" will be considered a number.)
X
X     Note: Many switches are technically a "toggle" instead of a
X"set" for the particular feature in question. For example, "astrolog
X-v -g -g" will only result in the -v chart being printed; an aspect
Xgrid won't because the first -g turned it on while the second -g
Xturned it off again. This can be useful, in say the -e everything
Xswitch. If you want all of Astrolog's charts except the astro-graph,
Xyou can do "astrolog -e -L", where the -e turns everything on and the
X-L turns the astro-graph chart, already on because of -e, off. In
Xanother example, to get a chart with only the stars in it, one can do
X"astrolog -R0 -RU", where the -R0 restricts everything, and the -RU
Xunrestricts all the stars.
X
X----
X
XAstrolog command switches (version 3.00) (March 1993):
X
X-H: Display this help list.
X
X  This option displays a list exactly like the one given above on the
X  screen. Note: Concerning the list itself, PC users are accustomed to
X  seeing command switches with a leading slash "/" instead of a dash
X  "-". To accommodate this, this list of options available does, if the
X  program has been compiled for a PC, display all the switches with a
X  leading "/" instead of a "-". (On Unix and other systems they will
X  still be displayed with the standard leading "-".)
X
X-H0: Display names of zodiac signs and houses.
X
X  The -H0 switch will display a list of the 12 signs of the zodiac,
X  and the 12 houses, listing their standard and traditional names. This
X  is similar to switches like -O or -A, in that it displays lists of
X  things (objects, aspects, or in this case the signs) that Astrolog
X  uses in its charts.
X
X-O: Display available planets and other celestial objects.
X
X  Similar to the -A option below, the -O option will list all the
X  planets and other celestial objects used by the program, and their
X  numbers as recognized by the -R restrictions (mentioned later). This
X  list will also show the zodiac signs that planets rule, fall in, are
X  exalted in, and debilitated in. (Note that when -O is encountered, it
X  immediately executes and terminates the program, so any modifying
X  switches must be before it.)
X
X-O0: Like -O but ignore object restrictions.
X
X  The -O switch above simply displays a list of all the objects, cusps,
X  uranians, and stars, along with their index numbers. This list can be
X  affected by the -R restrictions, and the -C, -u, and -U switches must
X  be included in order for all of Astrolog's objects to get listed. In
X  order to make it easier to simply display a list of all 78 objects
X  Astrolog recognizes, the -O0 option is just like -O by itself (and is
X  equivalent to "-C -u -U -O") except that it will ignore all
X  restrictions and always list every object. Stars are printed in the
X  list along with their azimuth, altitude, and brightness values.
X
X-A: Display available aspects, their angles, and present orbs.
X
X  The -A command switch gives a list of all 18 supported aspects,
X  their abbreviations as used in the aspect grids, their angles, and
X  their orbs. It will list the number of each aspect in addition to all
X  the other info already there (e.g. conjunct = 1, opposition = 2, etc.)
X  so one can easily figure out what exact number to pass to the -A
X  option when changing the number of aspects used (see below). Finally,
X  it will display a brief verbal description of what each aspect glyph
X  look like. This is in case one doesn't know what aspects the weird
X  symbols in the -g -X graphic displays are referring to.
X
X-I0 Display meanings of signs, houses, planets, and aspects.
X
X  This will display the general meanings of each sign, each house, each
X  planet, and each aspect, on the screen. This shows more or less the
X  database the program uses to base its interpretations on (see -I
X  switch charts later).
X
X----
X
XSwitches which determine the type of chart to display:
X
X-v: Display list of object positions (chosen by default).
X
X  This is just a formal specification for the standard chart listing of
X  the planetary positions. One will get this chart by default if they
X  don't specify any other chart types, and they will get it along with
X  everything else in the -e option (see below). Although it isn't
X  necessary, it must be included if one wants this type of chart to be
X  displayed along with some of the other chart types described below.
X
X-v0: Like -v but express velocities as absolute degree speed.
X
X  This switch is just like -v except that it modifies the planet
X  velocities slightly. (See later for a description of these velocity
X  fields.) The -v switch normally divides the actual velocity values by
X  how fast each planet moves with respect to the Sun, meaning that all
X  planets will have an average *relative* velocity value of 1.000, and
X  in all cases, a velocity of 2.000 means the planet is moving twice as
X  fast as normal, and one of 0.010 means the planet is about to turn
X  retrograde. The -v0 switch will change these velocity values to be
X  expressed as an *absolute* quantity in degrees per day that the object
X  appears to have moved through the zodiac. This will be similar to
X  that in -v, except outer planets will generally always have lower
X  values, e.g. although a velocity of 0.010 degrees/day for fast moving
X  Mercury means it's about to turn retrograde, the same velocity value
X  is normal for slow moving Pluto.
X
X-w [<rows>]: Display chart in a graphic house wheel format.
X
X  Display of the chart in a nice wheel format is supported using the
X  '-w' switch. (If one of the houses gets too 'full' of planets, the
X  planet will be put at the beginning of the next house.) The same
X  chart header information as is at the top of the standard -v chart is
X  printed in the middle of the wheel.
X
X  In addition to the normal chart information in the middle of the
X  wheel, this display includes the day of the week that the date falls
X  on. This may seem minor, but it is a way to calculate the day of the
X  week for any date. If you forgot what day of the week you were born
X  on, display your chart with the -w switch, and ignore the chart and
X  just check the day of the week in the header information. Similarly,
X  one could use this to make a calendar for any particular month by
X  casting a -w chart for the 1st of the month in question, and building
X  the calendar from that starting point.
X
X  Note that this switch takes an optional parameter to specify the size
X  in text rows of each house printed. By default this is four, but one
X  may increase (realize this will make the chart require more than 24
X  lines to print) or decrease (don't know why you would want to, but
X  you can) this value to their preference. The parameter may range from
X  1 to 10, and with this you can nicely generate a text wheel chart
X  with all 79 objects in it, without overflowing all the houses.
X
X-w0 [..]: Like -w but reverse order of objects in houses 4..9.
X
X  In the -w text wheel option, the objects in each house are printed
X  from top to bottom in order from earliest in the house to latest. This
X  looks good except for in houses 5..8 where this would appear backwards
X  (e.g. a planet having just entered the 6th house from the 5th would be
X  displayed right under the Descendant.) Therefore the objects from
X  houses 4 through 9 are reversed and printed in order from bottom to
X  top, making a more flowing looking wheel chart. If however, one always
X  wants each house to be filled from its top to bottom regardless of
X  which house, replace the -w with the -w0 switch
X
X-g: Display aspect and midpoint grid among planets.
X
X  Aspects and midpoint display are supported: Invoke as astrolog -g and
X  a rectangular grid showing the midpoint locations for each planet,
X  and showing if any aspects are present and how accurate they are, is
X  displayed. The planets are labeled down the main diagonal of the
X  grid, with the aspects to the lower left and the midpoints in the
X  upper right. This is of course often used along with the -A*
X  switches. Both the aspect orbs and midpoints are displayed to the
X  nearest minute, and on the main diagonal (or edges if a relationship
X  aspect grid) is displayed the sign and degree of the planet in
X  question in addition to the planet name itself.
X
X-g0: Like -g but flag aspect configurations (e.g. Yod's) too.
X
X  Search through the aspect grid for major aspect configurations,
X  including Grand Trines, T-Squares, Grand Crosses, Yod's, Cradles, and
X  Stelliums, with the -g0 option. (In a Stellium, three objects must all
X  be conjunct with each other.) This option will produce the same aspect
X  grid that -g displays, but afterwards will go through the grid and
X  list any of these aspect configurations and what objects are forming
X  them. (Of course, to see any Yod's, one has to -A 6 or more so that
X  Inconjuncts will be included in the aspect grid.)
X
X-g0: For comparison charts, show midpoints instead of aspects.
X
X  For relationship aspect grids, the -g0 switch will display a midpoint
X  grid instead of an aspect grid between the planets in the two charts
X  e.g. "-r0 chart1 chart2 -g0". (See later for descriptions of the
X  relationship charts.)
X
X-ga: Like -g but indicate applying instead of difference orbs.
X
X  Ability to determine whether an aspect is applying or separating (is
X  about to happen or just happened) is included in the -g option.
X  Normally the aspect orbs are flagged as being '+' or '-' based on
X  whether they are greater or less than the exact amount (e.g. a 91
X  degree Square has a +1 degree orb while a 89 degree one a -1 orb.) If
X  one, however, invokes the -g option as -ga instead, an orb printed as
X  'a' will indicate an applying aspect while an orb with 's' a
X  separating one. (To estimate applying vs. separating, the program
X  examines the planetary positions and their relative velocities at the
X  time in question.)
X
X-m: Display all object midpoints in sorted zodiac order.
X
X  True midpoint charts are supported in addition to the midpoints that
X  can be seen in the -g aspect grid. Use the -m switch and get a list
X  of all midpoints printed out sorted in zodiac order. So if you want
X  to see, say, if any important midpoint is close to your Sun, this is
X  a much easier chart to use than scrutinizing the midpoint/aspect grid.
X
X-m0: Like -m but list aspects ordered by influence instead.
X
X  Aspects too may be displayed in a nice ordered list, instead of only
X  in the -g aspect grid. Invoke the above switch as -m0 instead of just
X  -m and get a list of every aspect from the aspect grid printed out
X  one per line. The order in which they are printed is based on the
X  total "power" in the aspect, i.e. the influence of the two planets in
X  question, the aspect in question, and the orb. The same info and data
X  from the -j influence charts (see below) are used here, so changing
X  any default influences there will affect this ordering. The two
X  planets are printed, the aspect they make, their orb, and then the
X  power of the aspect used in ordering. Any power number more than 10
X  is a very major aspect. An exact Sun Moon conjunction can exceed 25.
X  So, if you want to know, say, if that exact Mars Jupiter conjunction
X  is more powerful than that wide Sun Moon sextile, try a -m0 chart and
X  find out at least what Astrolog's opinion is.
X
X-Z: Display planet locations with respect to the local horizon.
X
X  The text display switch -Z prints out where each object is on the
X  local horizon in terms of altitude and azimuth. For each object, the
X  following is displayed: Its altitude on the local horizon from +90
X  degrees (straight up) to -90 degrees (straight down), and its azimuth
X  from 0..360 degrees, where 0 = due east, 90 = north, 180 = west, 270 =
X  south. To make visualizing the azimuth easier, an "azimuth vector"
X  with a N/S component and a W/E component is displayed, e.g. (1.00s
X  0.33w) means that the object is mainly south, with its true angle
X  being formed by an vector component west that's 1/3 the strength of
X  the south component, i.e. the object is about 18 degrees west of
X  south. This along with the altitude should make it easy to physically
X  point to where any planet is at any moment, making it easy to locate
X  planets in the night sky. This feature can also be used to determine
X  the times that a planet rises and sets. Also displayed are altitude
X  and azimuth differences between each object and the Sun and Moon,
X  first showing the number of degrees that the Sun/Moon is "ahead" (or
X  farther east in the zodiac) of the object in question, and then the
X  number of degrees that the Sun/Moon is above the object in question.
X  This feature can be used to roughly predict eclipses! Both the Sun and
X  Moon span about 0.5 degrees in the sky, therefore if both the azimuth
X  and altitude differences are < 0.5 (or 1.0 if the difference is
X  between the Sun and Moon themselves) then the object in question is
X  probably being occulted somewhat by the Sun/Moon. Note that there are
X  three types of planetary position displays: Right ascension and
X  declination showing the object's position with respect to the stars,
X  longitude and latitude showing where on the Earth the object is
X  straight up (as in the astro-graph zenith locations), and finally
X  azimuth and altitude showing the positions of the object relative to
X  the local horizon.
X
X-Z0: For graphics charts, like -Z but have a polar center.
X
X  See section on the graphics charts for description of this option.
X  This switch will be available only if the graphics are compiled in.
X
X-S: Display x,y,z coordinate positions of planets in space.
X
X  Solar system space based charts are available with the -S switch,
X  which give the astronomical positions of each planet in terms of x, y,
X  and z coordinates. Although not directly useful astrologically, it
X  does give one a good view of how the planets actually were positioned
X  at the time in question. For example, normal astrology doesn't make
X  the distinction between the four different "forms" of say, a Mercury
X  Venus Conjunction, i.e. they can either be Conjunct on the near side
X  of the Sun, Conjunct on the far side of the Sun, or one can be on one
X  side and the other on the other side. When the chart is actually
X  displayed, for each body the following information is printed: The
X  relative angle of the planet with respect to the central body, i.e.
X  its zodiac position converted to the appropriate number from 0..360.
X  This is followed by the x, y, and z coordinate positions of the
X  object, in astronomical units from the central body. The x-axis
X  increases in the direction of 0 degrees Aries (tropical zodiac), the
X  y-axis increases in the direction of 0 degrees Cancer, and the z-axis
X  is with respect to the Earth's orbit (meaning that the Sun and Earth
X  always have a z-axis value of 0.0). Finally the overall length from
X  the central body in AU is printed, which is just the diagonal as
X  indicated by the x, y, z vectors. (The Earth and Sun are of course
X  always about 1.0 AU from each other.) The Moon circles the Earth and
X  isn't a part of the solar system proper; therefore, it is never in
X  these charts. The -e everything option will include this chart in its
X  listing of all the chart displays.
X
X-j: Display astrological influences of each object in chart.
X
X  Another chart type is available - interpretation of influences. This
X  is the beginnings of the general interpretation ability of the program,
X  although all it does now is calculate the relative "power" of each
X  planet's placement, giving a general idea of the prominent areas of a
X  chart. When such a chart is printed, each planet is given a point
X  value, larger numbers indicating more strength. Each planet's strength
X  is divided between two fields: the positioning in and of itself, and
X  the power of the aspects it makes with the other planets. In addition
X  to each field, the total of these two areas is printed, as well as the
X  relative percentage of the planet in question with respect to all the
X  planets combined. Each planet gets a ranking for its positioning,
X  aspects, and total power as well, with the strongest getting #1, the
X  next strongest #2, etc. The -e option will include this chart along
X  with all the others as well in it's listing of all the chart displays.
X
X  To determine the strength of the positioning of a planet, various
X  things are taken into account: 1) The power of a planet in and of
X  itself, e.g. the Sun and Moon are more powerful then the other
X  planets. 2) The house placement of a planet, e.g. a planet in the 1st
X  house is more powerful than one in the 2nd. 3) Whether a planet is in
X  the sign it rules or is exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in Sag results in
X  more power to Jupiter. 4) Whether a planet is in the house
X  corresponding to the sign it rules or is exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in
X  the 9th house. 5) Planets get more power if the signs they rule are
X  occupied, e.g. a bunch of stuff in Aquarius gives more power to
X  Uranus. 6) Planets get more power if the houses they rule are
X  occupied, e.g. a bunch of stuff in the 11th house gives power to
X  Uranus. 7) Finally, planets get power according to what houses the
X  cusps of which fall in the signs they rule, i.e. the ruler of the
X  Ascendant (and to less extent the Midheaven, and so on) gets lots of
X  influence. Determining the strength of a planet's aspects is much
X  easier, and is basically composed of the sum of the strength of each
X  aspect the planet makes. Taken into account are: 1) The influence of
X  the planet being aspected to, e.g. Sun conjunct Jupiter gives more
X  influence to Jupiter than Mercury conjunct Jupiter would. The
X  planet's placement as described above plays a role, too, e.g. Venus
X  opposition Mars in Aries gives more influence to Venus that it would
X  be if Mars were in Taurus. 2) The influence of the aspect itself,
X  e.g. Oppositions are more powerful then Sextiles. 3) Finally the orb
X  of the aspect, i.e. exact aspects are more powerful than wide ones.
X  (The influence of the orb varies linearly from max power at exact to
X  zero power at the limit of the orb - sorry Maggie M. and Mark K. - no
X  complex aspect wave functions, at least for this version :)
X
X  Special thanks goes to Mark K. who initially presented this idea of
X  interpreting overall influences to me. I basically just took his
X  ideas, polished them a bit, and put it into the code. Interestingly,
X  while programming this feature, I had a dream about him, in which he
X  elaborated upon some of the ideas and even gave me suggestions for
X  some of the planets' default power values (astral visitation?) And,
X  while on the subject, I've had a couple of other Astrolog dreams; I
X  had one neat one while working on the -h feature (described later)
X  about a far distant future version of Astrolog that could actually
X  teleport one to the places which they cast charts for :)
X
X-j0: Like -j but include influences of each sign as well.
X
X  The -j planet influences in a chart feature can be expanded to
X  include signs as well. Invoke it as -j0 instead of just -j, and in
X  addition to getting the influence of each planet in a chart, one will
X  get the influence of each sign in the chart as well. To determine
X  sign influence, we use the planet powers already determined; a sign
X  gets influence if: (1) There is a planet in it, (2) there is a planet
X  in the house it corresponds to, and (3) if any planet that rules or
X  co-rules it is in the chart. For example, with my 11th house Venus in
X  Sagittarius, for me: (1) Sagittarius gets more power because Venus is
X  in it, (2) Aquarius gets more power because Venus is in the 11th, and
X  (3) Libra and Taurus get power because Venus itself rules these
X  signs. The exact power given is based on the total influence of Venus
X  already determined. Any sign that has over about 175 points or 20% of
X  the total is a really powerful and fundamental part of the psyche. We
X  also sum up the influences of all the signs, displaying the influence
X  of each element as well, which is perhaps a more accurate version of
X  the element table in the -v chart.
X
X-L [<step>]: Display astro-graph locations of planetary angles.
X
X  The '-L' option will take the standard chart information and generate
X  the astro-graph positions of the planets. In other words, this does
X  the exact same thing that Jim Lewis' Astro*Carto*Graphy maps do. It
X  will display the longitude of where on the Earth at the time in
X  question each object was on the midheaven and on the nadir, and the
X  latitude of where the planets actually appeared at zenith. Also, for
X  latitude increments of 5 degrees, the longitude of where the objects
X  appeared on the ascendant and descendant is displayed. For text
X  screens, one can pass an optional parameter to this -L (or -L0) option
X  to change the default latitude step rate at which the Ascendant and
X  Descendant lines are computed. Again, this value is by default 5
X  degrees, although one can may increase or decrease it to any integer
X  (subject to the restriction that the number 160 is divisible by it.)
X
X-L0 [..]: Like -L but display list of latitude crossings too.
X
X  Determination of latitude crossing points is included in the
X  astro-graph routines! The -L0 option will do the same thing as the -L
X  option, except that after displaying the longitude and latitude
X  locations of the Asc/Desc/MC/IC lines, it will then search among the
X  lines and display (in order from farthest North to farthest South) the
X  latitude of any points where lines cross each other. This includes the
X  curvy Asc/Desc lines crossing the straight MC/IC lines as well as
X  cases where different Asc/Desc lines cross themselves. And unlike Jim
X  Lewis' Astro*Carto*Graphy, Astrolog will also display the longitude of
X  the crossing (useful for Asc/Desc crossings) in addition to the
X  latitude (as well allowing more planetary bodies to be included in the
X  scan, and going farther North and South than Jim Lewis' printouts go.)
X  Note however, that there is presently a small (very rare) minor
X  omission glitch in the code, where if a crossing is within a couple of
X  degrees of 180 deg W/E, it may not be displayed.
X
X-d: Print all aspects and changes occurring in a day.
X
X  The '-d' option will take the standard chart information, and for the
X  day in question, display the exact times of all aspects that occur.
X  This is just like the aspects-per-day as displayed in Jim Maynard's
X  Celestial Guide books. (Displayed in local time as defined by the
X  default zone, with accuracy to within a couple minutes.) This will
X  tell any time two planets make aspects with each other, a planet
X  changes its sign, or a planet goes retrograde or direct. Both the -d
X  (and -T listed later) options will display the signs that any planets
X  aspecting each other are in, in addition to the aspect itself (e.g.
X  instead of just "Jupiter Tri Uranus", we have "Jupiter (Vir) Tri (Cap)
X  Uranus". If a particular object is going retrograde, then its sign
X  will be displayed in brackets instead of parentheses, and if a
X  particular object is about to or has just gone retrograde or direct,
X  then its sign will be in <>'s.
X
X-dm: Like -d but print all aspects for the entire month.
X
X  The -d option can search the entire month for aspects between planets
X  if one so desires. Specifying it as -dm instead of just -d will go
X  through the entire month instead of just the current day. (Combining
X  this one with -R allows searching for important aspects, sign
X  changes, etc.)
X
X-dp <month> <year>: Print aspects within progressed chart.
X
X  Another progression feature allows determining aspect times of
X  progressed planets among themselves. The -dp <month> <year> switch
X  will, like the -d option, display times of aspects and sign changes,
X  for the time around the chart in question, except that they will be
X  progressed throughout the month specified. Progressed planets move
X  very slowly ("year for a day") so therefore there will usually be, if
X  any, only a couple of aspects in a given month. Instead, one might
X  want to scan the whole year; to do this, specify '0' for the month.
X  Also, since they move so slow, the accuracy is cut down, do the dates
X  given are probably only accurate to the nearest day, in spite of the
X  times given to the minute. Note that Astrolog can scan for aspects
X  of: transiting planets among themselves (-d switch), transiting
X  planets to natal planets (-T switch), progressed planets to natal
X  planets (-Tp), and progressed planets among themselves (-dp). Only
X  thing Astrolog can't do is do progressed planets to transiting
X  planets, although that may change in the next version :)
X
X-E: Display planetary ephemeris for given month.
X
X  The -E option will generate a quick ephemeris of the planet positions
X  for the month indicated in the given chart, as taken from the
X  standard interface. This is useful if you just want to see an
X  overview of what's happening some month in the sky. It is displayed
X  daily for midnight, in the default time zone. Any dots after a planet
X  location in the list indicate the planet was retrograde at the time
X  that day. For example, to see the ephemeris for someone's birth
X  month, one can do the convenient "-i chartfile -E", or to see the
X  ephemeris for this month, do "-n -E" (see -i and -n options later).
X
X-Ey: Display planetary ephemeris for entire year.
X
X  To display an ephemeris for all twelve months in an entire year,
X  invoke the -E switch as -Ey. For example, to get an ephemeris for
X  all of last year, one can do "-qy 1992 -Ey" (see -qy and -qm options
X  below).
X
X-e: Print all options for chart (i.e. -v-w-g0-m-Z-S-j0-L0-d-E).
X
X  There are ten main different formats of chart display available: The
X  standard listing of planet positions, which you get without any
X  switches or with the -v option; the aspect/midpoint grid you get with
X  -g, the house wheel you get with -w, and the charts generated with
X  the -m, -Z, -S, -j, -L, -d, and -E options. The -e "everything"
X  option will display the chart in all ten of these formats for about
X  900 lines of text! Note that one can even include the -T transit
X  option below and include yet another chart format in the list,
X  however transits require a time parameter to do transits for so it
X  isn't really a single chart display and hence isn't included in -e by
X  default.
X
X-T <month> <year>: Compute all transits to natal planets in month.
X
X  The '-T <month> <year>' option will scan the entire month specified,
X  and print out any transits that happen, in that month, to the planet
X  positions as listed in the current chart, as taken from the standard
X  interface. There will be quite a few, even though fast moving objects
X  like the Moon aren't looked at by default, so you might want to use
X  this with the -R option to limit this to just certain planets. (The
X  times are displayed in the local time zone, and are generally
X  accurate to within a half hour or so; Try doing it for your birth
X  month and your own chart - All planets should conjunct their natal
X  positions at about the time of your birth.) To determine transits to
X  natal house cusps other than the Asc and MC, i.e. when does a planet
X  change house in your natal chart, include the -C switch described
X  later. See the -RT option, as well as the "smart cusps" default,
X  described later, for options which directly affect this feature.
X
X-Tp <month> <year>: Compute progressions in month for chart.
X
X  Determining dates of transits of progressed planets to natal planets
X  can be done with the -Tp <month> <year> option. This is just like the
X  -T option, except that the exact aspects of progressed planets
X  (rather than transiting planets) to the planets in the chart are
X  displayed. Progressions occur much less often than transits, and
X  there will only be a few, if any, in a given month, so one might to
X  invoke this as -Tpy, as described below.
X
X-T[p]y: <year>: Compute transits/progressions for entire year.
X
X  To display transits for an entire year, invoke the -T switch as -Ty
X  (-Tpy for progressions), which only takes one parameter, the year.
X  For example, "-i chartfile -Ty 1993".
X
X-Tn[y]: Compute transits to natal planets for current time now.
X
X  This feature is a quick shorthand way to generate transits for the
X  current month. For example, instead of "astrolog -i chartfile -T 3
X  1993", one can do "astrolog -i chartfile -Tn". To do transits for the
X  entire current year, invoke it as "-Tny".
X
X-I: Print interpretation of selected charts.
X
X  The -I display an interpretation option is a powerful, expansive
X  feature to generate interpretations of many of Astrolog's charts.
X  Simply include the -I switch to get an interpretation of any
X  particular type of chart that the program would display otherwise.
X  If Astrolog doesn't support interpretations for it, the normal chart
X  will be shown instead.
X
X  For example, A brief interpretation of the meaning of the positioning
X  of each planet in its sign and house is supported when the -I switch
X  is invoked with -v (or by itself since -v is the default). If one
X  does this, then instead of the standard -v listing of planet
X  positions, the positions will be listed with a brief interpretation
X  of what they mean. I have to say that this is a pretty limited
X  version of interpretation, being nothing more than a combining of
X  phrases representing the planet, sign, and house in question;
X  nevertheless, people who don't know how to interpret charts might
X  find this to be of use (or at least amusing. :)
X
X  Another common interpretation one would want is the ability to give a
X  brief interpretation of each aspect in the aspect grid. When the -I
X  switch is combined with -g, the standard -g aspect grid will be
X  replaced with a list of each aspect occurring and a brief listing of
X  what it means. Again, this is mainly just a lookup of the general
X  meanings of each planet and the aspect in question, but still might
X  be found of interest by some. (Note: only the first 11 aspects, out
X  to the Bi-Quintile, can be considered.)
X
X  Five more interpretations just as useful can be done: "-r0 person1
X  person2 -g -I" is a legal combination, and will display meanings of
X  aspects between planets in two charts in a relationship aspect grid.
X  "-i person -m0 -I" is legal, and will display the meanings of aspects
X  in a chart; this is like -g -I, but the aspect meanings are printed
X  in sorted order based on how powerful Astrolog thinks each aspect is,
X  so this is probably preferred. "-r0 person1 person2 -m0 -I" is legal,
X  and will display the meanings of aspects in a relationship aspect
X  list, like -r0 -g -I, but in the improved sorted order. "-d -I" is
X  legal, and will display the meanings of aspects among transiting
X  planets occurring during a day, as well as of sign and direction
X  changes. "-T -I" is legal, and will display the meanings of aspects
X  from transiting planets to natal ones.
X
X----
X
XSwitches which affect how the chart parameters are obtained:
X
X-n: Compute chart for this exact moment using current time.
X
X  For those with systems who can handle time calls (If your system
X  pukes on trying to compile them, simply comment out the #define TIME
X  line at the beginning), the program supports displaying the chart for
X  the time at the current moment! In other words, invoke as astrolog -n
X  and see where the planets are right now. (This is fun - the house
X  cusps change 1 minute about every 4 seconds!) You will need to change
X  the #defines for the default longitude and latitude in astrolog.h, or
X  else specify where you are explicitly by using the -l switch to
X  change the default location. To figure out the time zone, the program
X  uses the default value in the astrolog.dat file or as defined in the
X  DEFAULT_ZONE constant set at compile time.
X
X-n[d,m,y]: Compute chart for start of current day, month, year.
X
X  These switches are like the -n generate chart for current moment now
X  feature, except that they will respectively generate charts for the
X  midnight on the current day, midnight on the first of the current
X  month, and midnight on the first day of the current year. 
X
X-a <month> <date> <year> <time> <zone> <long> <lat>:
XCompute chart automatically given specified data.
X
X  Normally one generates a chart by entering the seven data coordinates
X  manually. A fast typist familiar with the program might prefer to give
X  all the data at once, which can be done with this option. Simply list
X  the seven parameters above, in the exact format as they would be given
X  to the program were the user being prompted for them.
X
X-z: Assume Daylight time (change default zone appropriately).
X
X  Normally the -z option takes an argument which will then become the
X  default time zone. If one, however, invokes it by itself, it will
X  subtract one hour from whatever the default time zone presently is.
X  This is useful since it is equivalent to adjusting any times printed
X  to Daylight time, i.e. it will add one hour to any times displayed.
X  (When entering the birth time for charts, one is supposed to subtract
X  one hour if Daylight time was in effect; note that subtracting one
X  hour from the time zone will do the same thing.) For example, over
X  here on the West Coast, I have my default time zone compiled to be
X  "8"; now that Daylight time is in effect here, I can do -z 7 or just
X  -z to decrease the default time zone when I make a -T transit list,
X  which will in effect add one hour to the local times displayed, or in
X  effect "Spring ahead" the clock for me. (For a better way of adjusting
X  Astrolog for Daylight time without having to specify -z all the time,
X  recompile the program, or add one hour to the times in your head, use
X  the "defaults" file described later to edit the time zone.) Remember
X  that the -z (and -l) switches must be before any other switches they
X  modify (such as -n) in order for the new default to take effect.
X
X-z <zone>: Change the default time zone (for -d-q-T-E options).
X
X  The -z <value> option can be used to change the default time zone to
X  the value in question. For example, you can force the -E ephemeris and
X  -T transits to be displayed at midnight GMT time instead of the local
X  time with -z 0; or, for the East coast where by default the time zone
X  is "5", you can do -z 4 during DST to properly display transits,
X  aspects in day, and other lists in the local DST zone.
X
X-l <long> <lat>: Change the default longitude & latitude.
X
X  Like the -z option, the -l option can be used to change the default
X  compile time world coordinates used in certain options, such as the
X  -n cast chart for right now switch.
X
X-q <month> <date> <year> <time>: Compute chart with defaults.
X
X  The -q <month> <date> <year> <time> option takes the four parameters
X  and casts a chart for the time in question. The time zone and
X  location are taken from the default compiled values. This is just yet
X  another useful shorthand way to quickly make a chart. Note that the
X  -a option which takes all seven chart parameters can be duplicated
X  with -q along with the -z <zone> and -l <long> <lat> options.
X
X-qd <month> <date> <year>: Compute chart for noon on date.
X
X  The -q <month> <day> <year> option can be used to cast a quick chart
X  for 12 noon on a particular date, using the default longitude and
X  latitude, and time zone. One example where this is useful is with the
X  -d option, e.g. to see the times of exact aspects on a particular
X  date, like your next birthday, your finals, etc, without having to
X  specify unnecessary data. Note that this is just like the -q switch
X  except that -q requires a specific time on the day in question as well. 
X
X-qm <month> <year>: Compute chart for first of month.
X-qy <year>: Compute chart for first day of year.
X
X  A quick chart cast for midnight on the first of a month can be
X  generated with the two parameter -qm <month> <year> switch. A chart
X  cast for midnight on the first of January of a year can be generated
X  with the one parameter -qy <year> switch. Both of these use the
X  default time zone and location. These switches are most useful for
X  charts that don't require all the standard information. For example,
X  to get an ephemeris for December, 2000, do "astrolog -qm 12 2000" and
X  avoid having to enter in a day, hour, or location that wouldn't have
X  any effect. These options are in similar to the -qd <month> <day>
X  <year> switch above that will do a chart for noon on the given date,
X  and the -q <month> <day> <year> <time> switch that takes a time as well.
X
X-i <file>: Compute chart based on info in file.
X
X  See the -o option below.
X
X-o <file> [..]: Write parameters of current chart to file.
X
X  The program supports directing chart information to, and reading
X  output from, data files. The '-o' option will dump all the birth data
X  (the date and stuff, not the planet positions) to the specified file.
X  The '-i' option will cast the chart based on the info in the file.
X  (This allows you to put your birth data into a specific file, and cast
X  your chart whenever you want to after that without having to reenter
X  your birth data all the time.)
X
X  Another file output feature, the ability to concatenate "comment
X  lines" at the end of a data file, is included with both the -o and
X  -o0 options. (Some people have complained that the info in the
X  Astrolog chart files are too cryptic.) After scanning the filename,
X  the -o[0] option will then write any parameter that follows it at the
X  end of the file, until a parameter beginning with a '-' (the next
X  switch) is reached. For example: -o 'file' "Walter D. Pullen" Seattle
X  will add my name and my birth city in two separate lines at the end
X  of 'file'. (In Unix, quotes can be used to allow spaces within one
X  parameter.)
X
X-o0 <file> [..]: Like -o but output planet/house positions.
X
X  Ability to write the actual sign and house positions of a chart to
X  a file (instead of just the time and place) has been implemented via
X  the -o0 <file> option. This option can be used interchangeably with
X  the old -o output to file switch. The information written includes the
X  zodiac position of the 20 main objects, their retrograde status and
X  declination, as well as the positions of the (first six) house cusps.
X  This file information can easily be passed into another program, and
X  can be read back into Astrolog with the -i option. The -i option will
X  automatically determine which type the file is, and will either use
X  the given positions, or else calculate them as needed (note that some
X  switches, such as the -c house system selection, will have no effect
X  for this new file type.) Check an example of one of these files to see
X  the precise format (a zodiac position is recorded as three numbers:
X  degree in sign, sign as 1..12, and floating point minute within
X  degree.) When the files are read back in, they will be flagged as
X  "having no space or time" like the composite charts in the chart
X  header displays.
X
X  This file format can allow one to do things such as transits to
X  composite charts (send the composite chart to file with -o0 option and
X  then use that file as the first parameter to the -T option) composites
X  between two composite charts (use -rc between two composite charts
X  sent to a file) and even, if one is willing to do a small amount of
X  editing, to do transits to midpoints or the 0 degrees Aries point.
X  Note that one can easily edit the positions in the -o0 position file
X  to be whatever they like, so one could replace some unimportant object
X  (like the vertex) with 0 degrees Aries or an important midpoint value.
X  Note that trying to still use the -o time and space output with an
X  output chart that doesn't have space/time will confuse the program; it
X  will either say it can't make the file or else will output the
X  time/space of the most recent parameter file it read in.
X
X----
X
XSwitches which affect what information is used in a chart.
X
X-R [<obj1> [<obj2> ..]: Restrict specific bodies from displays.
X
X  The ability to restrict the transit (-T) and daily aspect (-d) scans
X  to just certain bodies has been implemented with the -R switch. Using
X  -R by itself will prevent the asteroids, Chiron, the Part of Fortune
X  and the Vertex from being in any of the lists. One may also give a
X  list of one or more numbers representing planets to be ignored (e.g. 1
X  = Sun, 2 = Moon, 3 = Mercury, etc) so that a complete custom setup can
X  be obtained (e.g. -R 1 2 3 4 5 will cause all of the inner planets to
X  be ignored). More than one -R switch can be combined (e.g. -R -R 16
X  will cause the asteroids, etc, and the North Node to be ignored; the
X  first -R gets rid of the asteroids, etc, and the second one deletes
X  the North Node.) Also, specifying the same particular body more than
X  once will cause it to be included again, or in other words, -R
X  <objectnum> complements the status of whether it is to be ignored or
X  not (e.g. -R -R 15 will cause all of the asteroids, etc, excluding
X  Vesta, to be ignored; the first -R makes causes the asteroids to be
X  ignored, and specifying Vesta in the second -R makes it reappear.)
X
X-R0 [<obj1> ..]: Like -R but restrict everything first.
X
X  The -R0 option will cause ALL of the bodies to be ignored, which is
X  useful if you are looking for just the transits/aspects of a few
X  planets (e.g. -R0 6 7 will cause everything but Jupiter and Saturn to
X  be ignored.) Combining all these methods can cause whatever you are
X  looking for in transits and aspects to be quickly found without having
X  to wade through lots of stuff you aren't interested in.
X
X-R[C,u,U]: Restrict all minor cusps, all uranians, or stars.
X
X  These three switches are similar to the -R0 option in that they
X  initially restrict objects, i.e. all the minor cusps, Uranians, and
X  stars, (described below) respectively from appearing. For example, if
X  you want to include only the star Sirius in an X window chart without
X  having to also include all the other stars (or having to enter a very
X  long restriction list), do: "astrolog -U -RU 48 -X", which will
X  include the stars, and then restrict them all except Sirius, before
X  making the chart.
X
X-RT[0,C,u,U] [..]: Restrict transiting planets in -T lists.
X
X  Transiting planets may be restricted from charts independently of
X  those planets being transited to. In -T charts, the -R option only
X  affects the natal planets. To restrict transiting planets, one must
X  use the -RT option. The -RT option is exactly like -R, and any
X  subswitches of -R can be used with -RT as long as the 'T' immediately
X  follows the 'R'. For example, -RT by itself restricts transiting
X  asteroids from appearing in -T charts, -RT0 restricts all transiting
X  bodies, -RTu restricts the Uranians, and so on. This is a really
X  useful feature, and allows one to pretty much be able to generate
X  exactly and only those transits one is interested in. For example, if
X  you want to see if anything is transiting your natal Jupiter or natal
X  Saturn this month, do: "astrolog -i yourchart -T 3 1993 -R0 6 7". If
X  you want to see if Chiron is transiting anything this year (excluding
X  asteroids), do: "astrolog -i yourchart -Ty 1993 -RT0 11 -R". If you
X  are only interested in transits of outer planets to your Sun or Moon,
X  do: "astrolog -i yourchart -T 3 1993 -RT0 6 7 8 9 10 -R0 1 2", and so
X  on. By default, only the transiting Moon is restricted. To get it
X  back, merely unrestrict it with "-RT 2". These default transit
X  restrictions are in the astrolog.dat defaults file described later,
X  and are right after the standard restriction table, both of which may
X  be modified however you please.
X
X-C: Include non-angular house cusps in charts.
X
X  This option must be indicated to include the four minor house cusps
X  (i.e. 11th, 12th, 2nd, 3rd) in the various chart options, such as the
X  -g aspect grids, -T transit searches, the X wheel chart, etc. This
X  option of course won't have any effect on certain charts where only
X  physical bodies are shown (e.g. -Z, -S, -L) or where all house cusps
X  are already indicated in the chart (e.g. -v, -w).
X
X-u: Include transneptunian/uranian bodies in charts.
X
X  Display the locations of the "Uranian" planets with the -u switch.
X  Transneptunian or Uranian planets are an interesting subset of
X  astrology which includes various objects alleged to be beyond Pluto.
X  (Do: astrolog -u -O to list the eight Uranian bodies.) Anyway,
X  Astrolog will display the zodiac positions of these planets as well if
X  one includes this option, and will print their positions after the
X  main planets, or include them in the other chart types. (Note: the
X  Uranians don't have any formal glyphs that I'm aware of, so therefore
X  they are displayed in the X charts as three letter abbreviations of
X  their name.)
X
X-U: Include locations of fixed background stars in charts.
X
X  Astrolog has the ability to display the positions of 47 of the
X  brightest and most important stars in the sky. To include these stars
X  in a chart, use the -U "universe" option. The 43 brightest stars,
X  i.e. all those with apparent magnitude values < 2.0 are included, in
X  addition to four dimmer "stars" which are considered significant,
X  i.e.: Polaris the North star, the Pleiades star cluster (home of our
X  extraterrestrial cousins), Zeta Reticuli (home of the Grey aliens),
X  and the Andromeda (M31) Galaxy (closest galaxy to our own Milky Way,
X  and home to various extraterrestrial hierarchies.) One bright star
X  is called "Orion", which is formally Alnilam, the middle star of
X  Orion's belt. Since stars are fixed in the sky, they will never
X  change position in the -s sidereal zodiac, although they will slowly
X  precess forward in the normal tropical zodiac. The -R restriction
X  option can be used to determine which stars are actually included,
X  although the -U option needs to be included to get any stars at all.
X  (In X windows, the stars are denoted by three letter abbreviations
X  (as are the uranians and minor house cusps), and are colored
X  according to their brightness: yellow for stars brighter than (less
X  than) magnitude 0.0, gold for dimmer ones from 0.0 to 1.0, orange for
X  those from 1.0 to 2.0, and finally the dimmest special stars with a
X  magnitude greater than 2.0 are red.)
X
X-U[z,l,n,b]: Order by azimuth, altitude, name, or brightness.
X
X  In the -v standard chart, -Z horizon chart, and in the -O object list,
X  where all the stars are printed sequentially, it can sometimes be
X  confusing to locate the star you want among 42 others. The -U option
X  can be modified to sort the stars in various ways. If one uses -Ub
X  instead of just -U, the stars will be listed in order from brightest
X  to dimmest. Doing -Un instead of -U will alphabetize the stars by
X  name. -Ul will sort them by their altitude from highest in the sky to
X  lowest, while -Uz will sort them by their zodiac position. Note that
X  any star ordering will have no visible effect in X windows, and one
X  must still use the default ordering when passing numbers to the -R
X  option to restrict various stars.
