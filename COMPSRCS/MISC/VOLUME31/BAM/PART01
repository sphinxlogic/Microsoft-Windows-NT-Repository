Posting-number: Volume 31, Issue 57

Environment: Lex, Yacc, SunOS 4.x with XView or BSD Unix with Athena Widget
Supersedes: bam: Volume 27, Issue 68-69

Overview
********

(For those who already know bam, the main changes are: added
support for athena, highly, improved elisp interface, new
and improved menus)

This is BAM (Born Again Menus) a menu system for GNU
Emacs.  It provides a GUI front-end to GNU Emacs.  In it's
current state, it is not a full fledge GUI, but it is easilly
customizable and extensible.  Note however that this package
does not provide direct mouse support in the Emacs window (i.e.
no scrollbar, no cut-and-paste, no pop-up menu, ...).

It is most useful to ease the transition from other
text-editors to GNU Emacs, since basic commands are mouse
selectable.  First-timers won't be overwhelmed by GNU Emacs
apparent complexity and system administrator will spend less
time repeating all the time "Press `C-h i m emacs RET' and
RTFM" (Dream on... :-)

Note that it is still used, despite the availability of
Lucid Emacs because, among other things, it is currently the
only menu system (to the authors knowledge) for emacs that
has pushpin so you can keep your menus open (only available
with the Xview version).

Also, if you stay with the standard Emacs (GNU Emacs 18.58)
you have the hability to have the base menu as part of the
Emacs window (only available with Athena).

None of the above require any changes to Emacs' sources.

Enjoy.
