X---------------------------------
XAreas: A pattern to search for, case insensitive.
XExtendedArea: A Subject line pattern case sensitive, auto-includes Areas.
X	These patterns group into the bulk of the first summary in the listing.
X	Area patterns which are not in the Subject line, group into the body of
X	the second Summary in the listing.
XNeverSee: A pattern you *never* want to allow case *sensitive*
XOtherDisregard: A pattern which is not in the ExtendedArea that will cause the
X	article to be removed from the second Summary in the listing.
XDisregard: A special three field pattern which will cause articles to only be
X	summarized in the second Summary of the listing if 'WhoPat' is detected
X	in an article, the summary line presented is "SummaryPat' '".
X	This Summary is followed by Contact_info.
XSpooledNewsDir: Top Level directory of the articles.
XPostedGroups: A list of all news groups to be searched.
X---------------------------------
XTo insert a space into a pattern, use ^[ or <ESC>
XThe single quote character is handled, all other sh special characters may
X	not be. In particular, the asterisk is not handled for Area
X	or ExtendedArea.  Try using \\Char. There are up to three levels of
X	shell to be escaped so you may need six or more backslashs depending
X	on your version of sh.

XThis work is wholely owned by James Chorn.
XPermission is given to use and copy the tools described and included
Xherein with the following proviso:
XProviso: You will not litigate against James Chorn for misuse, destruction
X	of property informational or otherwise, and you give James Chorn
X	credit for producing these tools by always including this copyright
X	notice prominently in all copies and distributions.
XNo Warrantee is implied or Expressed and this software is provided 'as is'.
XJames Chorn will not be held accountable for any problem associated with the
Xuse of this software.
X
XThis work was done in support of a support group which is locally organized
Xby under-employed high tech workers here in Portland, OR.
X
XAdministrative Note:
X	The intent of the use of these tools is to provide people
X	which don't have access to the internet a way to receive
X	job information.  Please limit using the E-mail feature to
X	people or groups which don't have access to the Internet
X	news services who will distribute the reports generated to
X	people seeking employment. Ask your system administrator.
X	This tool is not meant as a news reader replacement utility.
X	Every effort was made to make these tools passive in nature,
X	namely the use of rm is limited to temporary files.
X
XInternet job article report and maintenance tool.
X	Use of this tool requires an Internet net news feed.
X
XInstallation:
X	./install [/installdir]
X
XFeatures:
X	Provides a way to collect and summarize Internet job related articles.
X	Is customizable to capture job information for a local area(s).
X	Report style job listings that produce well organized article lists.
X	Flexible configuration, reconfiguration and setup.
X	Flexible and easy filtering of unwanted articles.
X	Easy summation of redundant information.
X	Reports can be printed or Emailed automatically via 'at' or 'cron'.
X	Customizably Final Comment feature allowing other admin info sharing.
X	80 Column ASCII Report style suitable for laser printing.
X	Optional saving of past listings by simple creation of a directory.
X	Portable.
X
XNon-features:
X	It ain't fast ;-) Typical run times have been observed at
X		between 10 and 20 minutes depending on the number
X		of articles needed to be processed (some maybe longer).
X	Does not provide a news article feed. You must be receiving
X		net news in order to use this tool.
X	Does not provide a 'no' maintenance solution to article classification.
X	Does not provide an easy way to remove articles using multiple
X		word patterns which span lines. eg "I am\n seeking"
X	Does not currently provide a way to handle summarizing lines that
X		have no key's (See Disregard section).
X
XOperational comments:
X	I've been using this tool to send posts via email to the High Tech
X	Resources Group in Portland, OR (a local job hunting support group).
X	The person receiving the email simply prints it out and
X	brings it to the group meetings each week. Some editing has been
X	done on the reports during trial runs but this is next to nothing
X	compared with the time I was spending doing these same functions
X	manually. The editing time is virtually non-existent with this
X	release so it's time to share. I should also note that most of the
X	editing usually concerns bogus postings which get captured
X	in the last part of the report. Removing these postings was a matter
X	of saving paper and reading time. I currently monitor the reports
X	by running two passes. The first pass sends me 90% of the report
X	that will be sent the next day. I look it over and if needed add
X	filtering information to the setup file which generates the report
X	that goes to the HTRG. I see the report sunday night and early monday
X	morning the reports are sent out. So far, the tools works pretty well
X	and doesn't miss many articles. Typically, the articles that are
X	dropped, have terse location information, but if your desperate,
X	just put some very general Area in like OR as you will get every
X	job article with the word 'or' in it. Another for instance, in the
X	setup.newyork file, notice that NY is not part of Area. That's
X	because 'any' matches 'ny'. So it's an ExtendedArea, but I'm
X	getting ahead of myself. You will need to check on the postings
X	and adjust the filters which means a 2 minute scan of a posting
X	and maybe using maintjobs to add a filter on some of the articles
X	that you don't want to see. Just remember that the more Areas
X	you have to search for, the longer it will take.
X
X	To save previous listings simply make the directory LastSaved
X	in the listing directory and your cron job will do it automatically.
X	See the joblists script for details.
X
X	The setup files contain character sequences '^' '[' which is normal.
X
X	This tool was built in a 4.3BSD Unix environment and may
X	not function in other environments without some modifications.
X	Namely, these scripts will probably require modification
X	for SysV to handle grep case insensitivity (pre V.4) and probably
X	others. I would appreciate feedback on these.  See listjobs
X	shell script.
X
XThis directory includes:
X	listjobs [setupfile]	- A shell script to collect job info.
X	maintjobs setupfile	- A shell script to maintain setup files.
X	joblists		- A cron script for auto run of listjobs.
X	setup.default		- The default setup file.
X	setup.example		- A second example of a setup file.
X	setup.newyork		- A functional NY/NJ setup file.
X	Comments		- Initial Final Comment file.
X	Help			- Initial Help file, customizable to site.
X	install	[/installdir]	- An install script, default /usr/local/jobs.
X	Readme			- This file.
X
XRequired Unix(tm) commands:
X	/bin/date	/bin/ed sh	test	chmod	awk
X	mv		rm	echo	cat	touch	sort
X	cmp		tr	sed	grep	egrep	uniq
X	Non-standard commands:
X	fmt		head	tail	wc
X
XAssumptions:
X	Comments in all setup and final comment files consist of an
X	occurrence of '#' at the beginning of a line and go until
X	the end of that line.
X
X	All scripts assume to be located in /usr/local/jobs. You
X	must explicitly modify a variable in each script to install
X	them in another place.
X
X	All scripts assume that the news is collected in a /usr/spool/news
X	subdirectory. You must explicitly modify a variable in each
X	script to have them look in another place for the top level
X	news directory.  The scripts are flexible enough to handle
X	most subdirectory variations but you may need to use more
X	than one setup file.
X
XAbstractions and other comments on the comments:
X	Most of the concept is very straight forward, however, the way
X	it is presented could be improved. I'm open to suggestions on
X	constructive modifications of the comments in the scripts and
X	setup files.
X
XWhat's the What and how it works:
X	There are eight major shell variables that need to come from
X	somewhere. These are:
X		SpooledNewsDir
X		PostedGroups
X		Area
X		ExtendedArea
X		NeverTrust
X		OtherDisregard
X		Disregard
X		Ext
X
X	The maintjobs tool maintains these variables in a interactive session.
X	The listjobs tool uses the setup script to bring in these variables
X	which cause it to modify builtin defaults.
X	The joblists tool is described below.
X
X	Overview: The joblists script is invoked by cron at some hour. joblists
X		  invokes listjobs script which produces one or several reports.
X		  joblists then emails or prints the reports out and exit's.
X		  joblists also compresses and saves old reports as needed.
X		  Messages and tracting information is captured in the files
X		  'messages' and 'Sent' in the jobs directory.
X
X		  listjobs when invoked brings in it's setup file variables
X		  and applies these variables to all articles found in the
X		  news directories. All of this work is done in /tmp and
X		  is removed on error or completion. A report is built and
X		  then copied into the 'jobs' directory /usr/local/jobs.
X		  A file called 'Date' in the jobs directory is updated with
X		  the prefix of the report name generated. The file 'Comments'
X		  which lives in the jobs directory will be concatenated to
X		  the report. If this file does not exist the default Final
X		  Comment will be used. If a Comment file has an extension
X		  (eg Comments.default), this file will be used instead.
X
X		  maintjobs is used to maintain the variables and test them
X		  so that special characters that won't work in the scripts
X		  are detected before using them. This is so the listjobs
X		  script doesn't blow up needlessly and not produce a report
X		  when invoked by joblists by cron. maintjobs makes a copy
X		  of the lines in the setup file modified and always leaves
X		  it in the setup file so after numerous uses you will probably
X		  want to hand edit the setup file to remove all of the copies.
X		  The copies will never hurt operation of listjobs. maintjobs
X		  will also in some cases correct bad setup files. This was
X		  mainly done for script maintenance and ease of upgrade.
X
X	Report Format:
X		Summary of Local Area posts.
X		All Local Area posts.
X		Summary of Disregards (See definition below).
X		Summary of Other Local area posts.
X		All Other Local Area posts.
X		Final Comment Information.
X
X
X	Variable Definitions:
X
X	SpooledNewsDir	-is the top most directory that contains targeted
X			 job articles. This is *not* where the articles are
X			 kept. This is were the directories of the articles
X			 are kept.
X	PostedGroups	-is a list of the directories which contain job
X			 articles. 
X			 eg. misc.jobs.offered is simply 'offered'
X	Area		-is a list of words which describe your focus area.
X			 For example "Portland Oregon" will capture all
X			 articles which contain the word Portland OR the
X			 word Oregon, case insensitive.
X	ExtendedArea	-is a list superset of case sensitive words which
X			 might appear in subject lines captured from looking
X			 for the 'Area' words. This helps classify articles,
X			 especially those using proper net-etiquette.
X	NeverTrust	-is a list of words which identify articles that 
X			 are bogus or inappropriate for the report. Any
X			 article which contains a word in this list will
X			 *NOT* appear in the report, so use this sparingly.
X			 An email address or unique word from the subject
X			 line is best used here.
X	OtherDisregard	-is a list of words that get filtered out of the
X			 'other' section of the report. It's similar to
X			 NeverTrust, removes articles from the report.
X			 It's main use is for posters that are consistent
X			 with their articles. For example, some local recruiters
X			 post for jobs and *always* identify the city the
X			 job is located. They also post for jobs in other
X			 parts of the world. This variable allows you to
X			 filter out these other-parts-of-the-world jobs
X			 and rely on the poster's subject line. Occasionally
X			 you will need to modify this variable.
X	Disregard	-is a three piece variable which allows you to
X			 remove redundant information from the report. You
X			 may have someone that provides you with the
X			 information from another source, like presentations...
X			 Anyway, this evolved from our group having a person
X			 recruiting in the group as well as posting news
X			 articles. We wanted the news articles summarized
X			 and we wanted to spread his phone number around
X			 when he got active. It works like this:
X			 firm summary contact
X				 where firm is a word that will always
X					identify this persons articles.
X				 where summary is a word that will always
X					select a position summary line
X					(eg. Subject, Position, Description...)
X					This will capture all lines with this
X					key, however it does not have the
X					ability to handle titles which appear
X					with in a banner eg ***\n title\n ---
X				 where contact is a single word used for contact
X					information. See a setup file for
X					more uses, it's better described there.
X	Ext		-is a single word which identifies the file name
X			 extension used for the report to be generated.
X			 Multiple reports dictate multiple setup files although
X			 you will probably find that now more than two or three
X			 are needed for your area.
X
XThe default setup file variables are set as follows:
X
X	SpooledNewsDir="/usr/spool/news/misc/jobs"
X	PostedGroups="contract/* offered/* offered/entry/*"
X	Area="Portland Hillsboro Beaverton Aloha Oregon"
X	ExtendedArea="${Area} OR"
X	NeverTrust=none
X	OtherDisregard="none"
X	Disregard=none
X	Ext=""
X
XFor more convoluted information read the comments in the setup files and
Xwhen you get frustrated go to the source which is fairly well commented.
