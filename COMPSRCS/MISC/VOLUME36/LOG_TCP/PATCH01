Environment: UNIX
Patch-To: log_tcp: Volume 36, Issue 4-6

A bug in the SunOS 4.x implementation of the getsockopt() system call
can cause occasional kernal panics (BAD TRAP, Data fault). This happens
only when the protection against source-routing attacks is enabled. The
workaround is to disable this protection by default.

  The most notable differences with respect to the previous release are:
  
!     - Additional protection against attacks from hosts that pretend to
      have someone elses network address. For example, the address of a
      trusted host within your own network.

      - Still more documentation. The README file now provides tutorial
      sections with introductions to client, server, inetd and syslogd.
  
! With the exception of source routed connections, the default mode of
! operation should be backwards compatible with earlier versions.
