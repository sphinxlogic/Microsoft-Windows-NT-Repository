XThu Mar 11 14:54:52 1993  Keith Moore  (moore@thud)
X
X	* updated README file.  Removed all references to "config.h" --
X	  it no longer contains anything useful.  updated man page.
X	  PATCHLEVEL is now 5.
X
XThu May 21 01:30:35 1992  Keith Moore  (moore@wilma)
X
X	* compiled and tested decnet gw code on ultrix.  Quickly tried
X	  to fix bogus error codes on vms and generally failed.
X
X	* README: corrected/updated to reflect more recent changes
X
X	* LICENSE: is now GPLv2
X
X	* lpr.man: known bug list updated.
X
X	* patchlevel.h: updated minor version (patchlevel) to 4, because
X	  I had released container files with version 1.2 and 1.3.  New
X	  container files will be version 1.4.
X
XThu Dec 12 01:03:55 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at wilma)
X
X	* lpr.c (append_string_to_buffer, read_file_into_buffer):
X	  made them return a pointer to the buffer, in case realloc()
X	  (in enlarge_buffer()) had to move the buffer somewhere else.
X	
X	* lpr.c (control): reassign job->cfile to the value returned
X	  from append_string_to_buffer()
X
X	* lpr.c (send_print_file): respect return value from
X	  read_file_into_buffer()
X
X	  (lpr now accepts large files from stdin again)
X
XWed Dec  4 00:42:58 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at wilma)
X
X	* unix-tcp.c, vms-decnet.c, vms-ucx-tcp.c: fix typo in error
X	  msg.
X
X	* lpr.c (lprm): Initialize remove_all flag to zero.
X	  Fix the case where no args are supplied.
X
X	* lpr.c (get_lpd_server): add check in case fscanf() fails.
X	  (could happen if file is empty)  Cast return value to
X	  (char *) to placate fussy DEC compiler.
X
XThu Sep 12 23:54:29 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at wilma)
X
X	* lpr.c (get_lpd_server): new function
X
X	* lpr and friends now look for a file named /etc/LPD_SERVER to
X	  get the default printer server.  Or you can still specify
X	  -S printer-server on the command-line.
X
XFri Sep  6 12:22:09 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at wilma)
X
X	* [various tcp modules] (get_priv_tcp_socket):
X	  if all attempts to bind to a privileged port fail, close socket
X	  and return EOF.
X
XThu Jul 25 00:34:06 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X
X        file lpr.c:
X
X	* add lpq and lprm functions: if argv[0] ends
X	  in "lpq" or "lprm", behave like those commands.  Also
X	  add -showqueue and -remove options for use on VMS.
X
X	  (real_option):
X	* -f now means "print a FORTRAN output file"
X	* -r now means "remove file after spooling" - it was being
X	  construed as "print a FORTRAN output file" because the
X	  lpd protocol command to do this is 'r'.
X	* added -S option to specify printer server.
X
X	  (guess_file_type)
X	* Don't print a message when we realize it's a PostScript
X	  file, because there's no special command-line option for
X	  these.
X
X	  (dump_buf)
X	* mask each byte with 0xff before printing in octal.
X	* Also format output a little nicer.
X
X	file lpr.man:
X
X	* change text regarding -f and -r options;
X	  remove a diagnostic message that is no longer used
X	  (still need to document lprm, lpq, and
X	  -remove, -showqueue options)
X
X	files unix-tcp.c,vms-win-tcp.c,vms-ucx-tcp.c:
X
X	  (gethostbynameoraddr) 
X        * added new function.
X	  if hostname argument begins with a digit, it is assumed to be
X	  an IP address, and gethostbynameoraddr() will simply fill in the
X	  correct fields in the hostent structure without doing an address
X	  lookup.  Otherwise it returns the result of gethostbyname()
X
X	* in open_lpd(), call gethostbynameoraddr() to get IP address
X
X
XThu May  9 19:26:30 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* lpr.c: make a more informative error message when remote
X	  server refuses to accept a print job.
X
X	* vms-ucx-tcp.c, vms-win-tcp.c, unix-tcp.c (get_priv_tcp_socket):
X	  don't exit, just give warning if EACCES error occurs trying to 
X          bind to privileged port -- some lpd's don't require this anyway.
X
XFri Apr 12 16:57:13 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* README: added some additional instructions for compiling
X	  on VMS.
X
X	* Makefile: fixed rule for port-lpr.vms that was always
X	  appending the new archive onto an existing port-lpr.vms
X	  file.
X
XTue Apr  9 21:16:31 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X        * released as version 1.1
X
X	* lpr.man: picked up some nits.
X
XTue Apr  9 20:37:40 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* Makefile (clean): do "rm -f" instead of "rm"
X
X	* dnet-lpd-gw.c (accept_decnet_connection):
X	  added support for DECnet-Ultrix.  Fixed typo that was setting
X	  DECnet_remoteNode to the name of the remote user.
X
X	* README: add notes about DECnet-Ultrix support for gateway.
X
X	* BLURB: new file - capsule description of package.
X
XSat Mar 30 02:04:45 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* lpr.man, README, MANIFEST - updated
X
X	* descrip.mms: makefile for vms - created
X
X	* Makefile: updated to reflect new changes, and also to
X	  create a simple shar file for VMS
X
X	* dnet-lpd-gw.c - new program - gateway lpr over DECnet to
X	  a TCP-based lpr daemon.
X
X	* vms-decnet.c - new module - send lpr protocol over DECnet
X	  instead of TCP.
X
X	* vms-*.c - translate_logical_name(), get_decnet_node_name()
X	  new functions.  Use translate_logical_name() instead of getenv()
X	  to prevent spoofing of important logical names.
X
X	* vms-*.c, unix-tcp.c - add support for MAKE_EMAIL_ADDRESS macro to
X	  override default way of sending mail to whomever submitted the job.
X
X	* TO DO:
X	  add ultrix support for dnet-lpd-gw.c
X	  add authentication to dnet-lpd-gw.c
X	  The email address hacks don't work -- even if the client tells
X	  the server that the user's email address is terre.dnet.utk.edu,
X	  the server still sends mail to simply "user@terre" on job 
X	  completion.  Fix this somehow.
X
XFri Mar 29 14:54:51 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* unix-tcp.c, vms-ucx-tcp.c, vms-win-tcp.c (open_lpd):
X	  changed to accept an argument to open_lpd specifying
X	  what host to use as a printer server.
X
X	* lpr.c: changed called to open_lpd to pass host name of
X	  printer server as an argument, rather than implicitly
X	  through the variable lpd_server.
X
X	* makefile.vms: new makefile for VMS make, or some reasonable
X	  facsimile thereof
X
X	* config.h: We don't really need this anymore to specify which
X	  kind of tcp/decnet we are using, but we do need it to specify
X	  things like how to generate the user's email address back to
X	  a VMS machine...definitely a site-specific option.
X
X	* extracted network- and system-specific code into separate
X	  modules: unix-tcp.c, vms-ucx-tcp.c, and vms-decnet.c
X
X	* lpr.c (main) Was redeclaring the printer environment
X	  variable, thus any -P printer option was not working.
X
X	* lpr.c (option) Fixed bug in option parsing.  I was using
X	  strchr (opt, "P#CJTi1234w") to see if the opt character
X	  was in that set of characters.  The arguments should have been
X	  reversed -- now they are.  Also, "opt" should have been "opt[1]"
X	  Also added 'q' to that set, so -q printer will work.  (This is
X	  for VMS, which lower-cases all command-line arguments unless you
X	  put them in quotes.)
X
X	* TO DO:
X	  On vms, expand wildcard filenames (yuk!)
X	  Build alternate argument parser for VMS.
X	  Make sure we print out any error messages returned from server.
X
X
XThu Mar 28 16:30:09 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* if a host has multiple IP addresses, attempt to connect to
X	  each of them before giving up.  If debug is set, print out
X	  each IP address as we try it.
X
X	* converted to "Classic" (non-ANSI) C (Yuk!).  GNU cc doesn't let
X	  us pass a struct in_addr to inet_ntoa() because of differences
X	  between argument passing conventions between gcc and the system-
X	  supplied cc (with which the inet_ntoa() routine was compiled).
X	  (At least this is true on a SPARC running SunOS 4.1.1)
X
X	* added code to let lpr run on VMS with UCX TCP.
X
XTue Mar 26 21:53:52 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* lpr.c (sysdep): call endpwent() after calling getpwuid() just
X	  to make sure the file descriptor for /etc/passwd is closed.
X	  (This is just paranoia-for-security - we don't exec anything
X	  anyway, so there's no way for some program to inherit that file
X	  descriptor.)
X
X	* lpr.c (real_option): add newline after version info when -debug
X	  is set
X
X	* README: add note about compiling, and that this works on an
X	  IBM RS/6000 running AIX.
X
XThu Mar 21 19:50:34 1991  Keith Moore  (moore at chili)
X
X	* packaged this up and sent it out as version 1.0
X
X	* if "printer" is not defined in /etc/services, just assume that
X	  we want to use port 515.
X
X	* wrote a man page and README.
X
X	* added a note referencing the GNU General Public License.

X		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
X		       Version 2, June 1991
X
X Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
X                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
X Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
X of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
X
X			    Preamble
X
X  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
Xfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
XLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
Xsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
XGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software
XFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
Xusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
Xthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
Xyour programs, too.
X
X  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
Xprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
Xhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
Xthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
Xif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
Xin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
X
X  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
Xanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
XThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
Xdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
X
X  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
Xgratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
Xyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
Xsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
Xrights.
X
X  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
X(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
Xdistribute and/or modify the software.
X
X  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
Xthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
Xsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
Xwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
Xthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
Xauthors' reputations.
X
X  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
Xpatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
Xprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
Xprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
Xpatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
X
X  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
Xmodification follow.
X
X		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
X   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
X
X  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
Xa notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
Xunder the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
Xrefers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
Xmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
Xthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
Xeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
Xlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
Xthe term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
X
XActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
Xcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
Xrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
Xis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
XProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).
XWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.
X
X  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
Xsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
Xconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
Xcopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
Xnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
Xand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
Xalong with the Program.
X
XYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
Xyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
X
X  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
Xof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
Xdistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
Xabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
X
X    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
X    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
X
X    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
X    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
X    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
X    parties under the terms of this License.
X
X    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
X    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
X    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
X    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
X    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
X    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
X    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
X    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
X    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
X    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
X
XThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
Xidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
Xand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
Xthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
Xsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
Xdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
Xon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
Xthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
Xentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
X
XThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
Xyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
Xexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
Xcollective works based on the Program.
X
XIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
Xwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
Xa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
Xthe scope of this License.
X
X  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
Xunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
XSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
X
X    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
X    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
X    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
X
X    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
X    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
X    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
X    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
X    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
X    customarily used for software interchange; or,
X
X    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
X    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
X    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
X    received the program in object code or executable form with such
X    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
X
XThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
Xmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
Xcode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
Xassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
Xcontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
Xspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include
Xanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
Xform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
Xoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
Xitself accompanies the executable.
X
XIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
Xaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
Xaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as
Xdistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
Xcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.
X
X  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
Xexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
Xotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
Xvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
XHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
Xthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
Xparties remain in full compliance.
X
X  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
Xsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
Xdistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
Xprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
Xmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
XProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
Xall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
Xthe Program or works based on it.
X
X  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
XProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
Xoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
Xthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
Xrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
XYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
Xthis License.
X
X  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
Xinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
Xconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
Xotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
Xexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
Xdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
XLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
Xmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
Xlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
Xall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
Xthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
Xrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
X
XIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
Xany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
Xapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
Xcircumstances.
X
XIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
Xpatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
Xsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
Xintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is
Ximplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
Xgenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
Xthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that
Xsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
Xto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
Ximpose that choice.
X
XThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
Xbe a consequence of the rest of this License.
X
X  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
Xcertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
Xoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License
Xmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
Xthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
Xcountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
Xthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.
X
X  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
Xof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
Xbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
Xaddress new problems or concerns.
X
XEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
Xspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
Xlater version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
Xeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free
XSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
Xthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
XFoundation.
X
X  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
Xprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
Xto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
XSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
Xmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
Xof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
Xof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
X
X			    NO WARRANTY
X
X  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
XFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
XOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
XPROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
XOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
XMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
XTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
XPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
XREPAIR OR CORRECTION.
X
X  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
XWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
XREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
XINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
XOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
XTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
XYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
XPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
XPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
X
X		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
X
X	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
X
X  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
Xpossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
