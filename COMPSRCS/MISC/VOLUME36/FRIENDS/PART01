XFriends lists which of your friends are online.  I wrote it because I got tired
Xof looking through a big ol' finger or who list.

XTo compile, just type "make friends"!  Nothing to it.

XQuestions and comments are always welcome!  Give me a yell if you like, hate,
Xor improve "friends".

X12/3/92
XAdded Sequent extension, ut_find_host.  No more strings printed when someone
Xis online.  Works like a who -hall but only shows your friends.  Possible up-
Xgrades for future releases may include sorted output and suppression of all but
Xone occurance of each entry.
X
X01/04/93
XFixed an "off-by-one" error.
