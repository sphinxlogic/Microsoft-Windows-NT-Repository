[The latest patch for mailagent version 3.0 is #1.]

System: mailagent version 3.0
Patch #: 1
Priority: CRITICAL
Subject: Configure did not restore computed paths correctly
Date: Mon Nov 29 17:45:04 MET 1993
From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

Description:
	Configure did not restore computed paths correctly. I generated
	the script using the development version of metaconfig, not
	the production version, i.e. I used the wrong units... Sigh!

Repeat-By:
	Run Configure and ask for portability. Shortly after, the error
	message

		./Configure: -d: not found
	
	should appear. Alas!

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -p -N -d DIR", where DIR is your mailagent source
	directory.  Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch -p -N <thisarticle".
	If you don't have the patch program, apply the following by hand,
	or get patch (version 2.0, latest patchlevel).

	After patching:
		Configure -ders
		make depend
		make
		make install
		make install.man

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel.h file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

	If you are missing previous patches (hah!) they can be obtained from me:

		Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

	If you send a mail message of the following form it will greatly speed
	processing:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailpatch PATH mailagent 3.0 LIST
			   ^ note the c

	where PATH is a return path FROM ME TO YOU either in Internet notation,
	or in bang notation from some well-known host, and LIST is the number
	of one or more patches you need, separated by spaces, commas, and/or
	hyphens.  Saying 35- says everything from 35 to the end.

	To get some more detailed instructions, send me the following mail:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailhelp PATH
