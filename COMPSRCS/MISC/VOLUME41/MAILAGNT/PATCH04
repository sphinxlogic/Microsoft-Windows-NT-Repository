Subject: one spurious single quote still remained after patch3

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

Description:
	A regular expression got corrupted by an appliance of itself. Indeed,
	in maildist, there was a line saying:

		s|Locker:.*\$|\$|;
	
	whose aim was to remove RCS locker's marks (in RCS 4.3 I think)
	when mailing distributions. Unfortunately, when maildist was asked
	to mail the mailagent distribution, it applied this regexp on the
	maildist.SH file and since this regexp is roughly self-matching,
	it got transformed into:

		s|$|;

	This patch changes the regexp to:

		s|Lock[e]r:.*\$|\$|;
		
	so that it cannot apply to itself... Note that since the dist-3.0
	tools also perform this substitution, the comp.sources.misc version
	is corrupted as well...  Graham Stoney <greyham@research.canon.oz.au>
	is to be thanked for reporting this bug, which of course I could
	hardly spot since my master copy is not post-processed by dist-3.0
	before being installed!

	One spurious single quote still remained after patch3 in the
	agent/test/actions file.


Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -p -N -d DIR", where DIR is your mailagent source
	directory.  Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch -p -N <thisarticle".
	If you don't have the patch program, apply the following by hand,
	or get patch (version 2.0, latest patchlevel).

	After patching:
		Configure -ders
		make depend
		make
		make install

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel.h file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

	If you are missing previous patches they can be obtained from me:

		Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

	If you send a mail message of the following form it will greatly speed
	processing:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailpatch PATH mailagent 3.0 LIST
			   ^ note the c

	where PATH is a return path FROM ME TO YOU either in Internet notation,
	or in bang notation from some well-known host, and LIST is the number
	of one or more patches you need, separated by spaces, commas, and/or
	hyphens.  Saying 35- says everything from 35 to the end.

	To get some more detailed instructions, send me the following mail:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailhelp PATH
