X         Network Traffic Metering software now available
X         -----------------------------------------------
X
XNeTraMet, the first implementation of the Internet Accounting
XArchitecture (outlined in RFC 1272, "Internet Accounting Background")
Xis now complete.  
X
XNeTraMet is an accounting meter which runs on a PC under DOS or a
XSunOS Unix system.  It builds up packet and byte counts for traffic
Xflows, which are defined by their end-point addresses.  Addresses can be
Xethernet addresses, protocol addresses (IP, DECnet, EtherTalk or IPX)
Xor 'detail' addresses (IP port numbers, etc), or any combination of
Xthese.  The traffic flows to be observed are specified by a set of
Xrules, which are downloaded to NeTraMet by a 'manager' program. Traffic
Xflow data is collected via SNMP from NeTraMet by a 'collector' program.
X
XNeMaC, a combined manager and collector program, is supplied with
XNeTraMet.  It downloads rules to meters, and collects data from them.
XAlthough a meter may only have one manager, its data can be collected
Xby several collectors, which do not have to be synchronised.  NeMac
Xcan manage and collect data from an arbitrary number of meters.
X
XThe format of NeMaC's collected flow data files is very general; the
Xcontents of data lines in the file is completely specified by the
Xuser.  ASN.1 opaque objects are used to retrieve flow data so as to
Xminimise the overheads in using SNMP for this purpose.
X
XNeTraMet is free software, and can be obtained by anonymous FTP from
Xccu1.auckland.ac.nz. at any time between 0700 and 2000 GMT (traffic
Xcharges to New Zealand - which we pay - are cheaper between 8 pm and
X9 am).
X
XThe NeTraMet distribution files are in the directory iawg/NeTraMet.
XThere are four of them:
X
X   Release.note		This file.
X
X   NeTraMet.man.ps.gz	Users' manual only, in Postscript,
X			   compressed with gzip.
X
X   NeTraMet.tar.gz	Full distibution file, including NeTraMet.man.ps,
X			   source and Make files for SunOS and Irix,
X			   executable files for PC.  Compressed with gzip.
X
X   NeTraMet.zip		Full PC source and Make files.  Archived
X			   with pkzip; use pkunzip -d to unpack.
X	
XNeTraMet provides a valuable tool for analysing network traffic flows,
Xand should prove to be of interest to anyone interested in network monitoring,
Xcapacity planning, performance measurement, etc.  You are invited to
Xtry it on your network!
X
XUser comments and suggestions will be very welcome: please post these to the
XInternet Accounting mailing list, accounting-wg@wugate.wustl.edu.  To
Xjoin the mailing list, send a request to accounting-ml-request@
