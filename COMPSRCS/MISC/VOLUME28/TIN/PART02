.PP
The 'Kill articles' option needs to be set ON in the Options Menu
(selected by 'M' at any level) to activate this command.
.SH "POSTING ARTICLES"
Tin allows posting of articles, follow-up to already posted articles
and replying direct through mail to the author of an article.
.PP
Use the 'w' command to post an article to a newsgroup. After entering
the post subject the default editor (ie. vi) or the editor specified
by the $EDITOR enviroment variable will be started and the article can
be entered. To crosspost articles simply add a comma and the name of
the newsgroup(s) to the end of the Newsgroups: line at the beginning of
the article. After saving and exiting the editor you are asked if you
wish to a)bort posting the article, e)dit the article again or p)ost
the article to the specified newsgroup(s).
.PP
Use the 'W' command to display a history of the articles you have posted.
The date the article was posted, which newsgroups the article was
posted to and the articles subject line are displayed.
.PP
Use the 'f' / 'F' command to post a follow-up article to an already
posted article. The 'F' command will copy the text of the original
article into the editor. The editing procedure is the same as when
posting an article with the 'w' command.
.PP
Use the 'r' / 'R' command to reply direct through mail to the author
of an already posted article. The 'R' command will copy the text of
the original article into the editor. The editing procedure is the
same as when posting an article with the 'w' command. After saving
and exiting the editor you are asked if you wish to a)bort sending
the article, e)dit the article again or s)end the article to the
author.
.SH "MAILING PIPING PRINTING AND SAVING ARTICLES"
The command interface to mail ('m'), pipe ('|'), print ('o') and save
('s') articles is the same for ease of use.
.PP
The initial command will ask you to select which a)rticle, t)hread,
r)egex pattern, t)agged articles you wish to mail, pipe etc.
.PP
Tagged articles must have already been tagged with the 'T' command.
All tagged articles can be untagged by the 'U' untag command.
.PP
If regex pattern matching is selected you are asked to enter a regular
expression (ie. to match all articles subject lines containing 'net News'
you must enter '*net News*'). Any articles that match the
entered expression will be mailed, piped etc.
.PP
To save articles to a mailbox with the name of the current newsgroup
(ie. Alt.sources) enter '=' or '=<mailbox name>' when asked for the
save filename.
.PP
To save articles in <newsgroup name>/<filename> format enter '+<filename>'.
.PP
When saving articles you can specify whether the saved files should be
post processed (ie. unshar shell archive, uudecode multiple parts etc).
A default process type can be set by the 'Process type:' in the 'M'
options menu.
.SH AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS
Tin allows new/unread news articles to be mailed (-M option)/saved
(-S option) in batch mode for later reading. Useful when going on
holiday and you don't want to return and find that expire has removed a
whole load of unread articles. Best to run from crontab everyday while away,
after which you will be mailed a report of which articles were mailed/saved
from which newsgroups and the total number of articles mailed/saved.
Articles are saved in a private news structure under your <savedir> directory
(default is \fI$HOME/News\fP). Be careful of using this option if you read a
lot of groups because you could overflow your filesystem. If you only want to
save a few groups it would be best to backup your full \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP and
create a new one that only contains the newsgroups you want to mail/save.
Saved news can be read later by starting tin with the -R option.
.PP
tin -M iain -f newsrc.mail (mail any unread articles in newgroups specified
in file newsrc.mail)
.PP
tin -S -f newsrc.save (save any unread articles in newgroups specified
in file newsrc.save)
.PP
tin -R (read any unread articles saved by tin -S option)
.SH SIGNATURES
Tin will recognize a signature in either \fI$HOME/.signature\fP or
\fI$HOME/.Sig\fP. If \fI$HOME/.signature\fP exists, then the signature
will be pulled into the editor for Tin mail commands.  A signature in
\fI$HOME/.signature\fP will not be pulled into the editor for posting
commands since the inews program will append the signature itself.
.PP
A signature in \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP will be pulled into the editor for both
posting and mailing commands.
.PP
The following is an example of a \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP file:

.SH "ENVIROMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBTINDIR\fP
Define this variable if you do not want tin's .tin directory in $HOME/.tin.
(ie. if you want all tin's private files in /tmp/.tin you would set
TINDIR to contain /tmp.
.TP
\fBNNTPSERVER\fP
The default NNTP server to remotely read news from. This variable only
needs to be set if the -r command line option is specified and the file
\fI/etc/nntpserver\fP does not exist.
.TP
\fBORGANIZATION\fP
Set the mail header field Organization: to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default. This variable has precedence
over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/organization\fP that may also contain an
organization string.
.TP
\fBREPLYTO\fP
Set the mail header field Reply-To: to the return address specified
by the variable.
This is useful if the machine is not registered in the UUCP mail maps
or if you wish to recieve replies at a different machine.
This variable has precedence over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/replyto\fP
that may also contain a return address.
.TP
\fBADD_ADDRESS\fP
This can contain an address to append to the return address when replying
directly through mail to somebody whose mail address is not directly
recognized by the local host. For example say the return address is
\fIuser@bigvax\fP, but \fIbigvax\fP is not recognized by your host, so
therfore the mail will not reach \fIuser\fP. But the host \fIlittevax\fP
is known to recognize your host and \fIbigvax\fP, so if ADD_ADDRESS is set
(ie. 'setenv ADD_ADDRESS @littevax' for csh or 'set ADD_ADDRESS @littevax'
and 'export ADD_ADDRESS' for sh) the address \fIuser@bigvax@littlevax\fP will
be used and the mail will reach \fIuser@bigvax\fP.
This variable has precedence over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/add_address\fP
that may also contain an address.
.TP
\fBBUG_ADDRESS\fP
If the 'B' command bug report mail address is not correct this variable should be
set to the correct mail address. This variable has precedence over the file
\fI$HOME/.tin/bug_address\fP that may also contain a mail address.
.TP
\fBEDITOR\fP
This variable has precedence over the default editor (ie. vi) that is
used in all editing operations within tin (ie. posting 'w', replying 'rR',
follow-ups 'fF' and bug reports 'B').

Many prompts (ie. 'Mark everything as read? (y/n): y') within tin 
offer a default choice that the cursor is positioned on. By pressing
<CR> the default value is taken.

When tin is run in an xterm window it will resize itself each time the xterm
is resized.

.SH BUGS
There are bugs somewhere among the creeping featurism. Any bugs found
should be reported by the 'B' (bug report) command.
.PP
There is a bug when article killing is switched ON/OFF at article
page level and the 't' command is used to return to group selection
index.
.PP
When articles have been unkilled, all articles will be marked
unread even if they have already been read.
.PP
Killing articles when tin is setuid causes strange behaviour.
.PP
Will not uudecode some of the images in alt.binaries.pictures because
more than one image is in the multi-part file to uudecode. Only the
first image will be uudecoded.
.PP
Does not handle Xref: headers for cross-posted articles.
.PP
More than one page of responses within a thread cause offset problems
at thread level.

.SH NAME
wildmat \- perform shell-style wildcard matching
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "int"
.B "wildmat(text, pattern)"
.B "    char		*text;"
.B "    char		*pattern;"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wildmat
compares the
.I text
against the
.I pattern
and
returns non-zero if the pattern matches the text.
The pattern is interpreted similar to shell filename wildcards, and not
as a full regular expression such as those handled by the
.IR grep (1)
family of programs or the
.IR regex (3)
or
.IR regexp (3)
set of routines.
.PP
The pattern is interpreted according to the following rules:
.TP
.BI \e x
Turns off the special meaning of
.I x
and matches it directly; this is used mostly before a question mark or
asterisk, and is not valid inside square brackets.
.TP
.B ?
Matches any single character.
.TP
.B *
Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
.TP
.BI [ x...y ]
Matches any single character specified by the set
.IR x...y .
A minus sign may be used to indicate a range of characters.
That is,
.I [0\-5abc]
is a shorthand for
.IR [012345abc] .
More than one range may appear inside a character set;
.I [0-9a-zA-Z._]
matches almost all of the legal characters for a host name.
The close bracket,
.IR ] ,
may be used if it is the first character in the set.
The minus sign,
.IR \- ,
may be used if it is either the first or last character in the set.
.TP
.BI [^ x...y ]
This matches any character
.I not
in the set
.IR x...y ,
which is interpreted as described above.
For example,
.I [^]\-]
matches any character other than a close bracket or minus sign.
.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
There is no way to end a range with a close bracket.

X     _T_i_n is a full-screen threaded Netnews reader.  It can read
X     news locally (ie. /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s) or remotely (rtin or tin
X     -r option) via a NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol)
X     server.
X
X     Tin has four newsreading levels: the newsgroup selection
X     page, the group index page, the thread listing page and the
X     article viewer.  Use the 'h' (help) command to view a list
X     of the commands available at a particular level.
X
X     On startup Tin will show a list of the newsgroups found in
X     $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c.  An arrow '->' or highlighted bar will point
X     to the first newsgroup.  Move to a group by using the termi-
X     nal arrow keys (ansi/at386/vt100 only) or 'j' and 'k'. Use
X     PgUp/PgDn (ansi/at386/vt100 only) or Ctrl-U and Ctrl-D to
X     page up/down. Enter a newsgroup by pressing RETURN.
X
X     The TAB key may be used to advance to the next newsgroup
X     with unread articles and enter it.

X               an error occurred and 2 that new/unread news
X               exists. Useful for writing scripts.
X
X     Tin can also dynamically change its options by the 'M' menu
X     command.  Any changes are written to $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/_t_i_n_r_c.
X
IINNDDEEXX FFIILLEESS
X     In order to keep track of threads, Tin maintains an index
X     for each group.  If Tin is made setuid to news, the indexes
X     will be stored in the news spool directory (typically
X     /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s). If Tin is not setuid, it will store index
X     files in the subdirectory $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/._i_n_d_e_x.  Do not make
X     Tin setuid news if news will be obtained via NNTP and not
X     from /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s.
X
X     Entering a group the first time tends to be slow because the
X     index file must be built from scratch.  Subsequent readings
X     of a group will cause Tin to incrementally update the index
X     file, adding or removing entries as new articles come in or
X     as news expires. If reading news remotely indexing will be
X     somewhat slower because the articles must be retrieved via
X     the NNTP.
X
X     A good way to keep Tin index files current is to run tin -u
X     from cron:

X     Tin has three separate levels of operation: Selection Group
X     level, Group level and Article level.
X
X     At the Selection Group level the title displays the number
X     of subscribed groups. The newsgroups are displayed on the
X     left of the screen with the number of unread articles
X     displayed on the same line in the middle of the screen.
X               <Selection Num> <Newsgroup> <Num of unread articles>
X          i.e.,
X               1  alt.sources            10
X               2  comp.sources.misc      3
X               3  news.software.readers  12
X
X     At the Group level the title contains the name of the group,
X     the number of conversation threads and total number of arti-
X     cles i.e., alt.sources (7 23).  If the group has been setup
X     not to thread articles (i.e., alt.sources is in
X     $(_H_O_M_E)/._t_i_n/_u_n_t_h_r_e_a_d) the title will be alt.sources (U 23).
X     There are two possible display formats as shown below:
X               288<Selection Num> <Unread> <Responses> <Subject> <Author>
X          i.e.,

X          or
X               <Selection Num> <Unread> <Responses> <Subject (longer)>
X          i.e.,

X
X     At the Article level the page header has the following for-
X     mat:

X
X     Use the 'w' command to post an article to a newsgroup. After
X     entering the post subject the default editor (ie. vi) or the
X     editor specified by the $EDITOR enviroment variable will be
X     started and the article can be entered. To crosspost arti-
X     cles simply add a comma and the name of the newsgroup(s) to
X     the end of the Newsgroups: line at the beginning of the
X     article. After saving and exiting the editor you are asked
X     if you wish to a)bort posting the article, e)dit the article
X     again or p)ost the article to the specified newsgroup(s).
X
X     Use the 'W' command to display a history of the articles you
X     have posted.  The date the article was posted, which news-
X     groups the article was posted to and the articles subject
X     line are displayed.
X
X     Use the 'f' / 'F' command to post a follow-up article to an
X     already posted article. The 'F' command will copy the text
X     of the original article into the editor. The editing pro-
X     cedure is the same as when posting an article with the 'w'
X     command.
X
X     Use the 'r' / 'R' command to reply direct through mail to
X     the author of an already posted article. The 'R' command
X     will copy the text of the original article into the editor.
X     The editing procedure is the same as when posting an article
X     with the 'w' command. After saving and exiting the editor
X     you are asked if you wish to a)bort sending the article,
X     e)dit the article again or s)end the article to the author.

X     Tin allows new/unread news articles to be mailed (-M
X     option)/saved (-S option) in batch mode for later reading.
X     Useful when going on holiday and you don't want to return
X     and find that expire has removed a whole load of unread
X     articles. Best to run from crontab everyday while away,
X     after which you will be mailed a report of which articles
X     were mailed/saved from which newsgroups and the total number
X     of articles mailed/saved.  Articles are saved in a private
X     news structure under your <savedir> directory (default is
X     $_H_O_M_E/_N_e_w_s). Be careful of using this option if you read a
X     lot of groups because you could overflow your filesystem. If
X     you only want to save a few groups it would be best to
X     backup your full $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c and create a new one that
X     only contains the newsgroups you want to mail/save.  Saved
X     news can be read later by starting tin with the -R option.
X
X     tin -M iain -f newsrc.mail (mail any unread articles in new-
X     groups specified in file newsrc.mail)
X
X     tin -S -f newsrc.save (save any unread articles in newgroups
