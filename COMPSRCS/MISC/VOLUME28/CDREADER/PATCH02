Archive-name: cdreader/patch02
Environment: SGI
Patch-To: cdreader: Volume 28, Issue 82

Enclosed is a short patch which upgrades my cdreader program from version 1.5
to verson 1.5.1, fixing a bug in the "shuffle" mode, and improving the
random-ness of the shuffle mode play list order.  The bug was that cdreader
always stopped after playing the last track on the disc, but in shuffle mode,
the last track on the disc was rarely the last track on the play list.  Thank
you to Brian Love for the bug report.

The most recent version of the source, as well as a pre-compiled executable is
available for anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9), directory "/tmp",
file "cdreader-1.5.1.tar.Z".  Remember to use "binary" mode when fetching it.
