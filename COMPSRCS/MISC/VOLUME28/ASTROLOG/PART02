XThis file contains a complete list of all the features available in
XAstrolog version 2.10, and documentation on how to use each option.
XThe file is divided into four parts:
X
X1) A summary list of all the main features which are accessed via
Xcommand line parameter switches, along with a list of single keypress
Xcommands that can be given in an X window (assuming you have X
Xwindows) to change the display in various ways.
X
X2) The list of command switches and keypresses is repeated, but after
Xeach option is listed a more lengthy description of the details of
Xthis feature.
X
X3) Additional things such as some important compile time options, and
Xdescriptions of some things that can appear in the Astrolog text
Xdisplays, are described.
X
X4) Finally, there is a description of the different X window chart
Xdisplays and how they are organized, and the X windows features in
Xgeneral. (Looking for a quick impressive display to prove that this
Xwas worth compiling? In unix try: astrolog -Xn -XG -Xw 350. :)

X**********************************
XDESCRIPTION OF EACH COMMAND SWITCH
X**********************************
X
XAstrolog command switches (version 2.10) (Feb 1992):
X
X-H: Display this help message.
X
X  This option displays a list exactly like the one given above on the
X  screen.
X
X-O: Display available planets and other celestial objects.
X
X  Similar to the -A option below, the -O option will list all the
X  planets and other celestial objects used by the program, and their
X  numbers as recognized by the -R restrictions below. This list will
X  also show the zodiac signs that planets rule, fall in, are exalted in,
X  and debilitated in.
X
X-R [<obj1> [<obj2> ..]: Restrict specific bodies from displays.
X
X  The ability to restrict the transit (-T) and daily aspect (-d) scans
X  to just certain bodies has been implemented with the -R switch. Using
X  -R by itself will prevent the asteroids, Chiron, the Part of Fortune
X  and the Vertex from being in any of the lists. One may also give a
X  list of one or more numbers representing planets to be ignored (e.g. 1
X  = Sun, 2 = Moon, 3 = Mercury, etc) so that a complete custom setup can
X  be obtained (e.g. -R 1 2 3 4 5 will cause all of the inner planets to
X  be ignored). More than one -R switch can be combined (e.g. -R -R 16
X  will cause the asteroids, etc, and the North Node to be ignored; the
X  first -R gets rid of the asteroids, etc, and the second one deletes
X  the North Node.) Also, specifying the same particular body more than
X  once will cause it to be included again, or in other words, -R
X  <objectnum> complements the status of whether it is to be ignored or
X  not (e.g. -R -R 15 will cause all of the asteroids, etc, excluding
X  Vesta, to be ignored; the first -R makes causes the asteroids to be
X  ignored, and specifying Vesta in the second -R makes it reappear.)
X
X-R0 [<obj1> ..]: Like -R but restrict everything first.
X
X  The -R0 option will cause ALL of the bodies to be ignored, which is
X  useful if you are looking for just the transits/aspects of a few
X  planets (e.g. -R0 6 7 will cause everything but Juptier and Saturn to
X  be ignored.) Combining all these methods can cause whatever you are
X  looking for in transits and aspects to be quickly found without having
X  to wade through lots of stuff you aren't interested in.
X
X-A [<0-18>]: Display available aspects or limit their number.
X
X  The '-A' command switch gives a list of all 18 supported aspects,
X  their abbreviations as used in the aspect grids, their angles, and
X  their orbs. It will list the number of each aspect in addition to all
X  the other info already there (e.g. conjunct = 1, opposition = 2, etc.)
X  so one can easily figure out what exact number to pass to the -A
X  option when changing the number of aspects used (see below). Finally,
X  it will display a brief verbal description of what each aspect glyph
X  look like. This is in case one doesn't know what aspects the weird
X  symbols in the -g -X window displays are referring to.
X
X  For those who don't like all these aspects, specifying -A <number>
X  will limit the number of aspects (e.g. -A 5 will make charts with only
X  the five major aspects listed in them).
X
X-Ao <orb1> [<orb2> ..]: Specify max orbs for each aspect.
X
X  Change the default orbs of the various aspects with the -Ao <orb1>
X  <orb2>... <orbn> switch. Do you not like the 7 degree orbs for
X  conjunctions that are in there by default? One can change the first n
X  aspect orbs (i.e. as many orb values that one puts after the -Ao)
X  anywhere from just the conjunction to all 18 aspects. Non-integer
X  values are allowed of course. Use negative orb values to completely
X  eliminate an aspect from ever appearing. For example: astrolog -A 6
X  -Ao 5 5 -1 10 narrows the orbs for Conjunction and Opposition,
X  completely eliminates the Square, widens the orb for Trines, and
X  leaves the Sextiles and Inconjuncts in the default values. Note that
X  for very wide orbs more than one aspect may apply for a particular
X  angle, in which case the more fundamental aspect is chosen. Also for
X  wide aspects the decimal value of the orb may be lost in the -g text
X  grid (due to too many characters) and their might be some slight
X  overlap in the X window -g cells.
X
X-AO [..]: Like -Ao but suspend objects' max orb restrictions.
X
X  Note that Astrolog imposes restrictions on the max orb that any
X  particular aspect can have to certain particular objects, namely the
X  node, fortune, and vertex, which can't and shouldn't have aspects to
X  them in excess of 2 degrees. One can suspend these restrictions by
X  replacing the -Ao <orbs> option above, invoking it as -AO <orbs>
X  instead. For a fun (and perhaps useful) display, try: astrolog -A 1
X  -AO 180 -g [-X], and see everything conjunct everything else.
X
X
XSwitches which affect how a chart is computed:
X
X-s: Compute siderial instead of the normal tropical chart.
X
X  With this option, the chart will be just like the normal charts as
X  most commonly used in astrology, except that all the zodiac positions
X  will be shifted (to be about 24 degrees earlier). This is because the
X  option casts siderial charts which are based on the positions of the
X  fixed stars (i.e. Aries starts at the constellation Aries) rather than
X  the seasons (i.e. Aries starts at the Spring or Vernal Equinox.) Due
X  to the "precession of the equinoxes" the the position of the Sun at
X  the Equinoxes has been gradually happening at an earlier point in the
X  siderial zodiac each year (taking about 2100 years change signs.)
X
X-h: Compute heliocentric instead of geocentric positions.
X
X  Again, normal astrology charts are based on the positions of the
X  planets relative to the Earth. However, this option allows seeing of
X  the zodiac positions with respect to the Sun's point of view. (The Sun
X  in the original listing will be replaced with the Earth's position as
X  seen from the Sun.) Note that this feature won't affect the Moon,
X  which will still be displayed as seen from the Earth since it's not a
X  formal planet.
X
X-c <value>: Select a different default system of houses.
X(0 = Placidus, 1 = Koch, 2 = Equal, 3 = Campanus, 4 = Meridian,
X5 = Regiomontanus, 6 = Porphry, 7 = Morinus, 8 = Topocentric, 9 = None.)
X
X  Ten different house systems are supported: Invoke as astrolog -c
X  <number> to change the system from the default of Placidus. (System 9
X  refers to no houses at all, or in other words where the Ascendant will
X  always be 0 degrees Aries, the Nadir 0 degrees Cancer, etc, which is
X  useful for the extended chart animations as described later where
X  having houses at all can tend to get in the way, and one can even
X  observe the precession of the equinoxes with this system if used in
X  conjunction with the -s siderial chart option.)
X
X-u: Replace Mercury..Pluto with transneptunian/uranian bodies.
X
X  Display the locations of the "Uranian" planets with the -u switch.
X  Transneptunian or Uranian planets are an interesting subset of
X  astrology which includes various objects alleged to be beyond Pluto
X  (or something like that, I'm just the programmer). Anyway, Astrolog
X  can display the zodiac positions of these bodies as well, and will do
X  this by taking the eight Uranian bodies and literally replacing
X  Mercury..Pluto with them. (Do: astrolog -u -O to list them.) This
X  replacement will allow the Uranians to be included in Astrolog's
X  various options, although of course this means that they can't
X  interact with Mercury..Pluto in any way. (Note, I didn't bother to
X  change the X glyphs or sign rulerships since I don't know what they
X  are for the Uranians.)
X
X-x <1-360>: Cast harmonic chart based on specified factor.
X
X  Harmonic charts (i.e. where all the planet positions are multiplied by a
X  factor and the chart recast) are supported via the '-x' option. (e.g.
X  -x 3 will make all trines conjunct in the chart displayed.)
X
X-1 [<objnum>]: Cast chart with specified object on ascendant.
X
X  The -1 <obj> option can be used to change the houses to force a
X  particular object to be on the ascendant. This is useful in casting
X  Solar charts or for when the time of birth is not exactly known. For
X  example -1 2 will case a normal chart, but the house cusps will be
X  rotated so that the moon is on the ascendant.
X
X-f: Display houses as sign positions (flip them).
X
X  The -f option can be used to "flip" the signs and houses, i.e. display
X  the house as a sign position and vice versa. For example having the
X  Sun at 26 degrees Scorpio, 2/3 way though the 10th house, will cause
X  the resulting Sun under the -f option to be at 20 degrees Capricorn,
X  26/30th the way through the 8th house. This can be used to determine
X  how far a planet is through a particular house, as well as for Domal
X  chart analysis that Mark Kenski has informed me about. Domal analysis
X  is based on the fact that for synastry comparisons, for example, a
X  planet in Gemini and one in the 3rd house can be considered related in
X  a way similar to a conjunction.
X
X-3: Display objects in their zodiac decan positions.
X
X  Decan displays are supported in Astrolog, and one can display a decan
X  influenced chart with the -3 switch. The decan theory is that each
X  sign in the zodiac can be divided into three parts: The first 10
X  degrees (i.e. the first decan) is mainly influenced by the sign in
X  question, the second 10 degrees (second decan) although still
X  influenced by the sign in question is also somewhat influenced by the
X  next sign of the same element, while the last decan is influenced by
X  the third sign of the same element. The -3 switch applied to a chart
X  will move each object into the sign of its decan. For example, if the
X  Sun is at 29 degrees Aquarius and the Moon at 5 degrees Virgo, in the
X  resulting chart, the Sun will go to Libra (26 degrees) and the Moon
X  will remain in Virgo (although be at 15 degrees now since it was
X  previously in the middle of the first decan of Virgo.)
X
X-p <month> <day> <year>: Cast progressed chart based for date.
X
X  A secondary progression chart for a particular date can be cast using the
X  '-p <month> <date> <year>' command switch. (Note, I'm not sure if the house
X  cusps are progressed correctly, but they're reasonably close to what is
X  properly expected.)
X
X-pn: Cast progressed chart based on current date now.
X
X  The -pn switch is like the -p <month> <date> <year> switch except that
X  (like the -n switch) it assumes the current moment now to cast the
X  progressed chart to. This is just another shorthand convenience to see
X  what ones progressed chart is like presently; just do: astrolog -i
X  file -pn.
X
X-+ <days>: Cast chart for specified days in the future.
X
X  The -+ <#ofdays> option will cast a normal chart, but one for #ofdays in
X  the future (or past if a negative value is given). One use for this is in
X  combination with the -n and -d options. For instance, I often invoke the
X  program as "astrolog -n -d" to see the exact times of today's aspects.
X  However, just before midnight I might want to see what's going to happen
X  in the following day, so I would do "astrolog -n -d -+ 1" to see the exact
X  times for tomorrow's aspects.
X
X
XSwitches which affect how a chart is displayed:
X
X-w: Display chart on screen in a graphic house wheel format.
X
X  Display of the chart in a nice wheel format is supported using the '-w'
X  switch. (Special error case: If one of the houses gets too 'full' of
X  planets, the planet will be put at the beginning of the next house.)
X
X-w0: Like -w but show objects in houses 4..9 in reverse order.
X
X  In the -w text wheel option, the objects in each house are printed
X  from top to bottom in order from earliest in the house to latest. This
X  looks good except for in houses 5..8 where this appears backwards
X  (i.e. a planet having just entered the 6th house from the 5th is
X  displayed right under the Descendant.) Replace -w with the -w0 switch
X  and the objects from houses 4 through 9 will be reversed and printed
X  in order from bottom to top, making a more flowing looking chart.
X
X-g: Display midpoint & aspect grid instead of positions.
X
X  Aspects and midpoint display are supported: Invoke as astrolog -g and
X  a 20x20 grid showing the midpoint locations for each planet, and
X  showing if any aspects are present and how accurate they are, is
X  displayed. The planets are labelled down the diagonal of the grid,
X  with the aspects to the lower left and the midpoints in the upper
X  right. This is often used along with the -A* switches.
X
X  Note that there is a way in the aspect grids to determine whether an
X  aspect is slightly short of exact or slight long of exact. If the
X  difference is displayed as "3.5" it means the aspect is 3.5 degrees
X  long of exact; if it's displayed as "3,5", the aspect is 3.5 degrees
X  short. (i.e. with a comma instead of a period; Yeah, I know that's a
X  hack, but it's useful in determining whether the exact aspect just
X  happened or is about to happen. (Note that conjuncts are always '.',
X  and oppositions always ','.)
X
X-g0: Like -g but flag aspect configurations (e.g. Yod's) too.
X
X  Search through the aspect grid for major aspect configurations,
X  including Grand Trines, T-Squares, Grand Crosses, Yod's, and Cradles
X  with the -g0 option. This option will produce the same aspect grid
X  that -g displays, but afterwards will go through the grid and list any
X  of these aspect configurations and what objects are forming them. Of
X  course, to see any Yod's, one has to -A 6 or more so that Inconjuncts
X  will be included in the aspect grid.
X
X-Z: Display planet locations with respect to the local horizon.
X
X  The text display switch -Z prints out where each object is on the
X  local horizon in terms of altitude and azimuth. For each object, the
X  following is displayed: Its altitude on the local horizon from +90
X  degrees (straight up) to -90 degrees (straight down), and its azimuth
X  from 0..360 degrees, where 0 = due east, 90 = north, 180 = west, 270 =
X  south. To make visualizing the azimuth easier, an "azimuth vector"
X  with a N/S component and a W/E component is displayed, e.g. (1.00s
X  0.33w) means that the object is mainly south, with its true angle
X  being formed by an vector component west that's 1/3 the strength of
X  the south component, i.e. the object is about 18 degrees west of
X  south. This along with the altitude should make it easy to physically
X  point to where any planet is at any moment, making it easy to locate
X  planets in the night sky. This feature can also be used to determine
X  the times that a planet rises and sets. Also displayed are altitude
X  and azimuth differences between each object and the Sun and Moon,
X  first showing the number of degrees that the Sun/Moon is "ahead" (or
X  farther east in the zodiac) of the object in question, and then the
X  number of degrees that the Sun/Moon is above the object in question.
X  This feature can be used to roughly predict eclipses! Both the Sun and
X  Moon span about 0.5 degrees in the sky, therefore if both the azimuth
X  and altitude differences are < 0.5 (or 1.0 if the difference is
X  between the Sun and Moon themselves) then the object in question is
X  probably being occulted somewhat by the Sun/Moon. Note that there are
X  three types of planetary position displays: Right ascension and
X  declination showing the object's position with respect to the stars,
X  longitude and latitude showing where on the Earth the object is
X  straight up (as in the astro-graph zenith locations), and finally
X  azimuth and altitude showing the positions of the object relative to
X  the local horizon.
X
X-L: Display astro-graph locations of planet angles on Earth.
X
X  The '-L' option will take the standard chart information and generate
X  the astrograph positions of the planets. In other words, this does the
X  exact same thing that Jim Lewis' Astro*Carto*Graphy maps do. It will
X  display the longitude of where on the Earth at the time in question
X  each object was on the midheaven and on the nadir, and the latitude of
X  where the planets actually appeared at zenith. Also, for latitude
X  increments of 5 degrees, the longitude of where the objects appeared
X  on the ascendant and descendant is displayed.
X
X-L0: Like -L but display list of latitude crossings too.
X
X  Determination of latitude crossing points has been added to the
X  astro-graph routines! The new -L0 option will do the same thing as the
X  -L option, except that after displaying the longitude and latitude
X  locations of the Asc/Desc/MC/IC lines, it will then search among the
X  lines and display (in order from farthest North to farthest South) the
X  latitude of any points where lines cross each other. This includes the
X  curvy Asc/Desc lines crossing the straight MC/IC lines as well as
X  cases where different Asc/Desc lines cross themselves. And unlike Jim
X  Lewis' astro*carto*graphy, Astrolog will also display the longitude of
X  the crossing (useful for Asc/Desc crossings) in addition to the
X  latitude (as well allowing more planetary bodies to be included in the
X  scan, and going farther North and South than Jim Lewis' printouts go.)
X  Note however, that there is presently a small (very rare) minor
X  omission glitch in the code, where if a crossing is within a couple of
X  degrees of 180 deg W/E, it may not be displayed.
X
X-d: Print all aspects and changes occurring in a day.
X
X  The '-d' option will take the standard chart information, and for the
X  day in question, display the exact times of all aspects that occur.
X  This is just like the aspects-per-day as displayed in Jim Maynard's
X  Celestial Guide books. (Displayed in local time as defined by the
X  specified zone, with accuracy of within a couple minutes.) This will
X  tell the times all planets make aspects with each other, or change
X  their sign; retrogradation during the day will be indicated, but the
X  exact time of it won't be listed. Both the -d (and -T listed later)
X  options will display the signs that any planets aspecting each other
X  are in, in addition to the aspect itself (e.g. instead of just
X  "Jupiter Tri Uranus", we have "Jupiter (Vir) Tri (Cap) Uranus". If a
X  particular object is going retrograde, then its sign will be displayed
X  in brackets instead of parentheses, and if a particular object is
X  about to or has just gone retrograde or direct, then its sign will be
X  in <>'s.
X
X-d0: Like -d but print all aspects for the entire month.
X
X  The -d option can now search the entire month for aspects between
X  planets if one so desires. Specifying it as -d0 instead of just -d
X  will go through the entire month instead of just the current day.
X  (Combining this one with -R allows searching for important aspects,
X  sign changes, etc.)
X
X-dp <month> <year>: Print aspects within progressed chart.
X
X  Another progression feature allows determining aspect times of
X  progressed planets among themselves. The -i <file> -dp <month> <year>
X  switch will, like the -d option, display times of aspects and sign
X  changes, except that they will be for the chart in file, progressed
X  throughout the month specified. Progressed planets move very slowly
X  ("year for a day") so therefore there will usually be, if any, only a
X  couple of aspects in a given month; again, one might want to
X  substitute '0' for the month to scan the whole year. Also, since they
X  move so slow, the accuracy is cut down, do the dates given are
X  probably only accurate to the nearest day, in spite of the times given
X  to the minute. Note that Astrolog can scan for aspects of: transiting
X  planets among themselves (-d switch), transiting planets to natal
X  planets (-T switch), progressed planets to natal planets (-Tp), and
X  progressed planets among themselves (-dp). Only thing Astrolog can't
X  do is do progressed planets to transiting planets, although that may
X  change in the next version :)
X
X-e: Print all options for chart (i.e. normal & -w0-g0-Z-L0-d). There
X
X  are five main different formats of chart display available: The
X  standard listing of planet positions, which you get without any
X  switches; the aspect/midpoint grid you get with '-g', the house wheel
X  you get with '-w', and so on. The -e "everything" option will display
X  the chart in all five of these formats for about 650 lines of text!
X
X
XSwitches which affect how the chart parameters are obtained:
X
X-n: Compute chart for this exact moment using current time.
X
X  For those with unix systems who can handle the time calls (If your
X  system pukes on trying to compile that, simply comment out the #define
X  TIME line at the beginning), the program supports displaying the chart
X  for the time at the current moment! In other words, invoke as astrolog
X  -n and see where the planets are right now. (This is fun - the house
X  cusps change 1' about every 4 seconds!) You will need to change the
X  #defines for the default longitude and latitude in astrolog.h, or else
X  specify where you are explicitly by using the -l switch to change the
X  default location. (To figure out the time zone, the program uses the
X  default value as in the DEFAULT_ZONE constant set at compile time.)
X
X-a <month> <date> <year> <time> <zone> <long> <lat>:
XCompute chart automatically given specified data.
X
X  Normally one generates a chart by entering the seven data coordinates
X  manually. A fast typist familiar with the program might prefer to give
X  all the data at once, which can be done with this option. Simply list
X  the seven parameters above, in the exact format as they would be given
X  to the program were the user being prompted for them.
X
X-z <zone>: Change the default time zone (for -d-q-T-E options).
X
X  The -z <value> option can be used to change the default time zone to
X  the value in question. For example, you can force the -E ephemeris and
X  -T transits to be displayed at midnight GMT time instead of the local
X  time with -z 0; or, for the East coast where by default the time zone
X  is "5", you can do -z 4 during DST to properly display transits,
X  aspects in day, and other lists in the local DST zone.
X
X-l <long> <lat>: Change the default longitude & latitude.
X
X  Like the -z option, the -l option can be used to change the default
X  compile time global coordinates used in certain options, such as the
X  -n cast chart for right now switch.
X
X-q <month> <date> <year>: Compute chart for noon on date.
X
X  The -q <month> <day> <year> option can be used to cast a quick chart
X  for 12 noon on a particular date, using the default longitude and
X  latitude. The DEFAULT_ZONE compile time constant is used for the time
X  zone. Again, one example where this is useful is with the -d option,
X  e.g. to see the times of exact aspects on a particular date, like your
X  next birthday, your finals, etc.
X
X-q0 <month> <date> <year> <time>: Like -q but include time too.
X
X  The -q0 <month> <date> <year> <time> option takes the four parameters
X  and casts a chart for the time in question. The time zone and location
X  are taken from the default compiled values. This is just yet another
X  useful shorthand way to quickly make a chart. Note that this is just
X  like the -q <month> <date> <year> option except that -q always casts
X  it for noon in the default zone. Also note that the -a option which
X  takes all seven chart parameters can be duplicated with -q0 along with
X  the -z <zone> and -l <long> <lat> options.
X
X-i <file>: Compute chart based on info in file.
X
X  See the -o option below.
X
X-o <file> [..]: Write parameters of current chart to file.
X
X  The program supports directing chart information to, and reading
X  output from, data files. The '-o' option will dump all the birth data
X  (the date and stuff, not the planet positions) to the specified file.
X  The '-i' option will cast the chart based on the info in the file.
X  (This allows you to put your birth data into a specific file, and cast
X  your chart whenever you want to after that without having to reenter
X  your birth data all the time.)
X
X  Another file output feature, the ability to concatenate "comment
X  lines" at the end of a data file, been been added to both the -o and
X  -o0 options. (Some people have complained that the info in the
X  Astrolog chart files are too cryptic.) After scanning the filename,
X  the -o[0] option will then write any parameter that follows it at the
X  end of the file, until a parameter beginning with a '-' (the next
X  switch) is reached. For example: -o 'file' "Walter D. Pullen" Seattle
X  will add my name and my birth city in two separate lines at the end of
X  'file'. (In unix, quotes can be used to allow spaces within one
X  parameter.)
X
X-o0 <file> [..]: Like -o but output planet/house positions.
X
X  Ability to write the actual sign and house positions of a chart to
X  a file (instead of just the time and place) has been implemented via
X  the -o0 <file> option. This option can be used interchangeably with
X  the old -o output to file switch. The information written includes the
X  zodiac position of the 20 main objects, their retrograde status and
X  declination, as well as the positions of the (first six) house cusps.
X  This file information can easily be passed into another program, and
X  can be read back into Astrolog with the -i option. The -i option will
X  automatically determine which type the file is, and will either use
X  the given positions, or else calculate them as needed (note that some
X  switches, such as the -c house system selection, will have no effect
X  for this new file type.) Check an example of one of these files to see
X  the precise format (a zodiac position is recorded as three numbers:
X  degree in sign, sign as 1..12, and floating point minute within
X  degree.) When the files are read back in, they will be flagged as
X  "having no space or time" like the composite charts in the chart
X  header displays.
X
X  This file format can allow one to do things such as transits to
X  composite charts (send the composite chart to file with -o0 option and
X  then use that file as the first parameter to the -T option) composites
X  between two composite charts (use -rc between two composite charts
X  sent to a file) and even, if one is willing to do a small amount of
X  editing, to do transits to midpoints or the 0 degrees Aries point.
X  Note that one can easily edit the positions in the -o0 position file
X  to be whatever they like, so one could replace some unimportant object
X  (like the vertex) with 0 degrees Aries or an important midpoint value.
X  Note that trying to still use the -o time and space output with an
X  output chart that doesn't have space/time will confuse the program; it
X  will either say it can't make the file or else will output the
X  time/space of the most recent parameter file it read in.
X
X
XOther features or major modes:
X
X-r <file1> <file2>: Compute a relationship chart.
X
X  Computing the relationship between two charts is supported. Invoke the
X  program as 'astrolog -r <file_of_person1> <file_of_person2>' and the
X  program will give you the relationship between the two charts.
X  Normally, and with the -w switch, the program will display person2's
X  planets in person1's houses (synastry). With the -g switch, a full
X  grid listing the aspects between all the planets of the two charts
X  (with person1's planets on the vertical axis and person2's on the
X  horizontal) is displayed (minus the vertex, because the screen is too
X  narrow to include it unfortunately.) Note that transits can be
X  computed with this by comparing your chart with the positions of the
X  planets at the current moment (-n switch). To make this easier, you
X  may specify the filename "now" for any file and the computer will use
X  the current planet positions instead of looking for a like named file.
X  (e.g. 'astrolog -r me now' will compute transits for file 'me'.)
X
X-rc <file1> <file2>: Compute a composite chart.
X
X  The '-r' option can be used to generate composite relationship charts.
X  Simply invoke it as '-rc <person1> <person2>' instead of just -r and a
X  composite chart (i.e. composed of the midpoints of the planets, etc.
X  of the two charts in question) will be generated.
X
X-t <file>: Compute current house transits for particular chart.
X
X  The command switch '-t <file>' can be used as a shortcut way to
X  compute the current transits for the chart in <file>. (Saves you from
X  having to mention the 'now' in the '-r' option.)
X
X-T <file> <month> <year>: Compute all transits in month for chart.
X
X  The '-T <file> <month> <year>' option will scan the entire month
X  specified, and print out any transits that happen, in that month, to
X  the planets as listed in the specified <file>. There will be quite a
X  few, even though fast moving objects like the moon aren't looked at,
X  so you might want to use this with the -R option to limit this to just
X  certain planets. (The times are displayed in the local time zone, and
X  are generally accurate to within a half hour or so; Try doing it for
X  your birth month and your own chart - All planets should conjunct
X  their natal positions at about the time of your birth.) Putting a zero
X  in place of the month will cause the entire year to be scanned, which
X  prevents one from having to search each month in turn if they are
X  looking for something in particular. Note that the -T option includes
X  ALL of one's natal house cusps in the transit scans (instead of just
X  the Asc and MC). The 11th, 12th, 2nd, and 3rd cusps are included (and
X  oppositions to these and the Asc/MC can be used to to determine
X  aspects to the other six cusps.)
X
X-T0 <..>: Like -T but include transits of the Moon as well.
X
X  Normally the -T option always ignores the moon and does not include
X  the transiting moon in the lists because it moves so fast and would
X  cause an enormous amount of info. Still, if you are looking for lunar
X  transits, specifying the option as -T0 instead of just -T will include
X  the moon.
X
X-Tp <file> <month> <year>: Compute all progressions in month for chart.
X
X  Determining dates of transits of progressed planets to natal planets
X  can be done with the -Tp <file> <month> <year> option. This is just
X  like the -T option, except that the exact aspects of progressed
X  planets (rather than transiting planets) to the planets in 'file' are
X  displayed. Again, one can substitute '0' for the month to scan the
X  entire year (which might be desirable since progressions occur much
X  less often than transits, and there will only be a few, if any, in a
X  given month.)
X
X-E <month> <year>: Display ephemeris for given month.
X
X  The '-E <month> <year>' option will generate a quick ephemeris for the
X  ten main bodies for the month in question, useful if you just want to
X  see what's happening this month in the sky. It generally is used by
X  itself and not with any other options. (Displayed daily for midnight,
X  default time.) Any dots after a planet location in the list indicate
X  the planet was retrograde at the time. The -E <month> <year> ephemeris
X  option can also be used to display the ephemeris for the entire year
X  instead of just for one month. Like the -T option, putting a '0' for
X  the month will give the entire year's ephemeris.
X
X-E0 <..>: Like -E but include Chiron and the asteroids as well.
X
X  The -E option can also display the Asteroids, Chiron, and the Node in
X  the ephemeris listing if one invokes it as -E0 instead of just -E.
X  Note however that this will make each line more than 80 columns, so
X  this is mainly just for printing purposes.
X
X
XSwitches to access X window options:
X
X-X: Create a wheel or astro-graph bitmap of chart.
X
X  This is the general switch, which means display a chart in an X window
X  instead of on the screen in some form. For example, the command
X  'astrolog -i mychart -X' will open a new window and display the chart
X  in question in it. (Of course, all the other switches, e.g. -R, -c,
X  -1, etc, can be used to change what info is actually displayed.) If
X  you use the -L astro-graph switch in addition to this, the appropriate
X  astro*carto*graphy map will come up in a window instead of the earlier
X  boring list of longitudes. (e.g. astrolog -i me -X -L) The -Z and -g
X  switches will produce their own chart types as well, although, of
X  course, only one type of chart can be in a window at any given time.
X
X-Xb: Create X bitmap instead of putting graphics in window.
X
X  This switch will cause a standard X11 bitmap file to be produced
X  instead of putting the graphics in an actual window. This is useful if
X  you want to convert the graphics to different formats, e.g. so they
X  can be displayed on PC's, etc. Note that -Xb (or any other -X<letter>
X  switch) automatically assumes the -X switch above, so 'astrolog -i
X  file -Xb' is sufficient (and you don't also have to include the -X).
X
X-XB: Display X chart on root instead of in a separate window.
X
X  This switch will cause the chart graphics to be displayed directly on
X  the root window. This action occurs very quickly since the program
X  does not have to write a separate bitmap file and call xsetroot -bitmap
X  on it (although one could easily do this if they want to). For example,
X  one could put the line 'astrolog -n -XB' in their .xsession file
X  and whenever they log in, their background will be set to a chart of
X  the current state of the planets!
X
X-Xm: For color monitors, display charts in black and white.
X
X  For color X systems, the -Xm switch will create all windows in
X  monochrome B/W mode.
X
X-Xr: Create window or bitmap in reversed colors (B on W).
X
X  Normally the charts comes up white on a black background. To get the
X  chart or bitmap displayed in reverse video (black on white), use this
X  -Xr switch.
X
X-Xw <hor> [<ver>]: Change the size of the chart window.
X
X  The default window size is 600x600. This can be changed with the -Xw
X  switch. -Xw with one argument n will make an n by n window; -Xw with
X  two arguments x and y will make an x by y window with the chart
X  centered in the middle. Note that this switch will not affect
X  astro-graph or aspect grid windows; to change the size of these use
X  -Xs below.
X
X-Xs <percentage>: Change the size of characters by n%.
X
X  Note that the size of the planet and sign glyphs don't change when you
X  change the size of the window. This can cause problems for very small
X  windows where the glyphs overlap the rest of the chart and for very
X  large windows where there is lots of excess space. The -Xs switch can
X  be used to change the size of all glyphs. The valid values that can be
X  passed to it are 100, 200, and 300, where 200 is the default. Note
X  that this switch is used to change the size of the astro-graph (and
X  aspect grid) windows (because the world map is considered to be one
X  giant glyph by the program.)
X
X-XW: Simply create the bitmap of the world.
X
X  Believe it or not, I painstakingly entered the data for the world map
X  used by the program by hand using an Atlas during a long week. If you
X  just want to see the map of the world by itself without any
X  astro-graph lines on it, use the -XW switch.
X
X  Familiar with ley lines? They are energy lines crossing the Earth.
X  I was experimenting earlier with the master ley line grids on the
X  Earth (in the pattern of an overlapped 20 sided Icosahedron and 12
X  sided Dodecahedron) and I figured Astrolog with its world map would
X  be an interesting program to explore this with. The -XW world map
X  display option is always still, and can never be animated. If however
X  one tries to animate it, either by the -Xn switch or pressing 'N' in
X  the window, a new display showing the ley lines will be shown.
X  Actually this is mainly a hack, but I figured I would leave it in
X  there for amusement and inspiration. Hackers note: there is an
X  interesting "bug" that can arise with the -XW as well as the -XG (and
X  -XP, described below) switches: These displays can be brought up
X  without having to specify an actual chart. Now suppose one presses
X  'C', 'W', etc. to bring up a chart - what will be displayed? The
X  answer will be whatever default values were already there, and if
X  you're curious, I set to be the time of the New Moon on 1-4-1992 at
X  11:11pm GMT at Greenwich England. (i.e. one week before the 11:11)
X
X-XP: Create the bitmap of the world, but as a polar projection.
X
X  The -XP option will generate a polar view of the Earth as a globe.
X  This is like the -XG globe option except that the view is from the top
X  (or bottom) and therefore doesn't rotate. By default, the view is
X  looking down on the north pole with 0 deg W/E toward the bottom of the
X  screen. To see a (fixed) view of the south pole hemisphere, go into
X  animation mode. Again, like with all the other X window display
X  options, one can enter this display with a keystroke: press 'P' in any
X  Astrolog window and it will revert to this display.
X
X-XG [<degrees>]: Display the bitmap of the world as a globe.
X
X  Once we have the data for the map of the world, there are
X  several neat things we can do with it; for instance, with a little
X  trigonometry and clipping, we can bring up a view of a globe, which
X  is what the -XG switch does. An optional argument will specify a
X  rotation value in degrees to display different parts of the globe.
X  (The globe seems to look best for a -Xw window size of around 350.)
X
X-Xn: Start up chart or globe display in animation mode.
X
X  The -Xn [<value>] option can be used to start up an X window in
X  animation mode. It a window, one would have to explicitly press 'N' or
X  a shift+number key to start the window animation. Without a parameter
X  after -Xn, the option will start it up in continuous update to "now"
X  mode (which is like pressing 'N' in that any chart will be erased with
X  the current chart now.) The switch can accept parameters from 1..9,
X  corresponding to the animation rates obtained by pressing shift 1..9
X  in the window, i.e. update whatever chart is passed to it seconds,
X  minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc. later each time.
X
X-Xo <file>: Write output bitmap to specified file.
X
X  This option is used in conjunction with the -Xb option, to specify the
X  name of the file to write the bitmap to.
X
X
XAstrolog window keypress options (version 2.10):
X
XPress 'H' to display this list of key options.
X
X  The most important key, of course. Pressing this will display a help
X  list of all the key presses available in the text screen from which
X  the window was invoked from.
X
XPress 'p' to toggle pause status on or off.
X
X  Press this to pause all updates to the window. This is mainly used to
X  freeze any animation (see below) but also has an effect even on
X  'still' windows. Key presses will still be accepted in pause mode but
X  their effects won't be apparent until one presses 'p' again to
X  continue. This can be used to temporarily freeze a chart in animation
X  so that it can be looked at without interruption.
X
XPress 'x' to toggle fg/bg colors in window.
X
X  Pressing this will invert the colors in the window, or in other
X  words will do the same thing as the -Xr switch on the command line.
X
XPress 'm' to toggle color/monochrome display in window.
X
X  For color displays, pressing this key will toggle in and out of
X  monochrome mode.
X
XPress 'T' to toggle header info on current chart in window.
X
X  Normally, there is no actual text printed in the windows. However,
X  one can bring up header information listing the date, time, and
X  location of the chart in question. Pressing the 'T' key will toggle
X  the display of the header text at the bottom of the chart on and off.
X
XPress 'R' to toggle restriction status of minor objects.
X
X  Press the 'R' (restrict) key in an Astrolog X window and the screen
X  will be redrawn with the restriction status of these asteroids and
X  other minors toggled.
X
XPress 'S' to resize wheel chart display to a square.
X
X  One can manually resize the Astrolog windows using a window manager
X  (except when a world map or aspect grid is displayed, in which case
X  resizing will have no effect). Pressing the 'S' key will resize any
X  (non-world map) window to be a square. This is useful, after resizing
X  charts to approximately the size you want, to make them precise
X  squares.
X
XPress '<' and '>' to decrease/increase the scale size of the glyphs/world map.
X
X  This two keys will respectively decrease and increase the size of the
X  sign and planet glyphs (as well as resize the astro-graph and aspect
X  grid charts) through the three scale factors available. After resizing
X  the window, you will probably want to use these keys if the glyphs are
X  then too big or small for the new chart.
X
XPress 'N' to toggle animation status on or off.
X
X  Animation! This key will toggle in and out of a mode where the chart
X  is continually updated in the window. Entering the animation mode
X  will cause the chart being currently displayed to be replaced by the
X  chart for the exact moment at the time you are running the program.
X  Every second or two, the chart will be updated to reflect the new
X  current state of the planets and houses. For large window sizes, one
X  can actually see very minor changes in the chart every few seconds.
X  With the text 'T' mode in effect, the chart is basically an advanced
X  version of xclock, and makes a good window to be left running on
X  your display. If you are in the -XG globe display mode, pressing
X  the 'N' key will cause the globe to rotate for an impressive display!
X
XPress '!'-'(' to begin updating current chart by adding times.
X!: seconds, @: minutes, #: hours, $: days, : months,
X^: years, &: years*10, *: years*100, (: years*1000.
X
X  These nine keys (i.e. shift plus the number keys from 1..9) enter
X  into a different form of chart animation. Pressing them will cause the
X  current chart being displayed (i.e. it will not revert to the current
X  planet positions) to continually have a delta time added to it and be
X  recast and shown. Pressing '!' will have one second added to the chart
X  for every update (slow action unless you have a very fast system - the
X  animation will be even slower than for the 'N' key). Pressing '@' will
X  have one minute added to the chart each time, which makes for a nice
X  display (note that you will definitely want to be in the text 'T' mode
X  for these animations so you can see what times in the future these
X  charts are being cast for. Pressing '#" will have one hour added each
X  time (note that now the house cusps are starting to move quickly, so
X  you may want to switch to a different system of houses (such as the
X  Equal to keep the Midheaven from flopping back and forth) and/or use
X  -1 to put an object like the sun on the Ascendant.) Pressing '$' will
X  have one day added each time (now you will probably want to start
X  using -R to remove fast moving objects like the moon), and pressing
X  '%' will have one month added for each update of the window. The
X  final keys, shift 6..9 cause years, decades, centuries, and millenia
X  to be added each time, and tend to only be used to look for long range
X  actions (when will Neptune next enter Pisces, etc.) To exit these
X  animation modes, press the 'N' key.
X
XPress 'r' to reverse direction of time-lapse or animation.
X
X  Press this to reverse the direction of any animation taking
X  place. For the '!'..'(' animation keys above, this will cause
X  negative times to be added to the chart, e.g. pressing '#'
X  then 'r' on a chart cast for noon will cause the next chart to
X  be displayed for 11am, then 10am, etc. For the Globe animation,
X  this will cause the rotation to reverse direction.
X
XPress '1'-'9' to set rate of animation to 'n' degrees, etc.
X
X  The nine number keys are used to set the relative "rate" of
X  animation to "n" whatevers. For example, normally the "@" key means
X  add one minute to the chart for each update, but press "5" and now
X  we are adding 5 minutes each time. For the Globe animation,
X  by default the Earth rotates one degree each time; however, the
X  number keys can speed this up to nine degrees for each update.
X
XPress 'C','L','A','Z','W','G','P' to switch chart mode types.
X
X  There are basically sevan main modes in which a window can be in:
X  There are the four main charts (wheel, astro-graph, aspect grids, and
X  local sky) as well as the three world displays (the simple map by
X  itself, the globe view, and the polar projection). These seven keys
X  can be used to switch between these seven modes in the middle of
X  program execution. For example, you can bring up your own chart in a
X  window, then press 'L' to see the astro-graph chart for the same birth
X  data. Then you can press 'W' to just see the world map by itself, and
X  'G' to see the globe view, after which you can press 'C' to return to
X  your original wheel chart.
X
XPress 'q' to terminate the window and program.
X
X  Pressing this key will terminate the window (and the Astrolog
X  program itself.)
