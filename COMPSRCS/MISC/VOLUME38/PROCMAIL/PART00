Posting-number: Volume 38, Issue 19
Archive-name: procmail/part00
Environment: sendmail, smail, MMDF, mailsurr, UNIX, POSIX
Supersedes: procmail: Volume 35, Issue 21-32,124,125

Most important changes since v2.81 (for a more complete list see the HISTORY
file in the distribution):

To the installation in general:
- Transmogrified the installation scripts to tiptoe gracefully through the
  minefield of portability problems that seem to come up now and then :-)
- Improved the locking tests that autoconf makes
- Extended the FAQ file (due to popular demand :-)

To procmail:
- Worked my way around the !@#$%^&*() POSIX setgid() semantics
- When used as the local delivery agent (instead of /bin/mail) it can now
  pick up an extra meta-argument that can be queried in the rcfile
- It can be used as a direct filter in sendmail.cf rules now
- Provided for customised LOGFILE abstracts
- Allowed an alternate syntax for condition lines in a recipe, to avoid having
  to count them
- Delivery to multiple directories is possible now (hardlinked files)
- Support for the o+x-new-mail-flag (see UMASK in procmailrc(5))
- Support for >4GB files (using off_t, can't imagine why I never did before)

To the mailinglist package:
- Numerous general refinements
- Updated and extended the Manual file (reading recommended)
- Added digest support to the mailinglists
- Standalone archive servers are now easily created

 ----------------------
The procmail mail processing program. (v2.90 1993/07/01)

Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming mail
into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to one or more
mailing lists or for prioritising your mail), preprocess your mail, start
any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate different chimes on your
workstation for different types of mail) or selectively forward certain
incoming mail automatically to someone.

The accompanying formail program enables you to generate autoreplies, split up
digests/mailboxes into the original messages, do some very simple
header-munging/extraction, or force mail into mail-format (with leading From
line).

Also included is a comprehensive mailinglist/archive management system.

Feature summary for procmail:
	+ It's less filling (i.e. small)
	+ Very easy to install (rated PG6 :-)
	+ Simple to maintain and configure because
	  all you need is actually only ONE executable (procmail)
	  and ONE configuration file (.procmailrc)
	+ Is event driven (i.e. gets invoked automagically when mail arrives)
	+ Does not use *any* temporary files
	+ Uses standard egrep regular expressions
	+ It poses a very low impact on your system's resources
	+ Allows for very-easy-to-use yes-no decisions on where the mail
	  should go (can take the size of the mail into consideration)
	+ Filters, delivers and forwards mail *reliably*
	+ Provides a reliable hook (you might even say anchor :-) for any
	  programs or shell scripts you may wish to start upon mail arrival
	+ Performs heroically under even the worst conditions
	  (file system full, out of swap space, process table full,
	  file table full, missing support files, unavailable executables,
	  denied permissions) and tries to deliver the mail somehow anyway
	+ Absolutely undeliverable mail (after trying every trick in the book)
	  will bounce back to the sender (or not, your choice)
	+ Is one of the few mailers to perform reliable mailbox locking across
	  NFS as well (DON'T use NFS mounted mailboxes WITHOUT installing
	  procmail; you may lose valuable mail one day)
	+ Supports four mailfolder standards: single file folders (standard
	  and nonstandard VNIX format), directory folders that contain one file
	  per message, or the similar MH directory folders (numbered files)
	+ Variable assignment and substitution is an extremely complete subset
	  of the standard /bin/sh syntax
	+ Provides a mail log file, which logs all mail arrival, shows
	  in summary whence it came, what it was about, where it went (what
	  folder) and how long (in bytes) it was
	+ Uses this log file to display a wide range of diagnostic and error
	  messages (if something went wrong)
	+ Does not impose *any* limits on line lengths, mail length (as long
	  as memory permits), or the use of any character (any 8-bit character,
	  including '\0' is allowed) in the mail
	+ It has man pages (boy, does *it* have man pages)
	+ Procmail can be used as a local delivery agent with comsat/biff
	  support (*fully* downwards compatible with /bin/mail); in which case
	  it can heal your system mailbox, if something messes up the
	  permissions
	+ Allows you to painlessly shift the system mailboxes into the
	  user's home directories
	+ It runs on virtually all (old and future) operating systems which
	  names start with a 'U' or end in an 'X' :-) (i.e. extremely portable
	  code; POSIX, ANSI C and K&R conforming)
	+ Is clock skew immune (e.g. in the case of NFS mounted mailboxes)
	+ Works with (among others?) sendmail, smail, MMDF and mailsurr

Feature summary for formail:
	+ Can generate auto-reply headers
	+ Can convert mail into standard mailbox format (so that you can
	  process it with standard mail programs)
	+ Can split up mailboxes into the individual messages
	+ Can split up digests into the individual messages
	+ Can split up saved articles into the individual articles
	+ Can do simple header munging/extraction

Feature summary for lockfile:
	+ Provides NFS-secure lockfiles to shell script programmers
	+ Gives normal users the ability to lock their system mailbox,
	  regardless of the permissions on the mail-spool directory

Summary of what the mailinglist scripts in here provide:
	+ The overseeable management of an arbitrary number of mailinglists
	+ Convenient and simple creation of new mailinglists
	+ Convenient and simple removal of existing mailinglists
	+ Fully automated subscription/unsubscription/help-request processing
	  (no operator intervention needed)
	+ Enough intelligence to overcome the ignorance of some subscribers
	  (will direct subscribe and unsubscribe requests away from the
	  regular list and automatically onto the -request address)
	+ No hardwired format for (un)subscribe requests (i.e. new subscribers
	  need not be educated, unsubscribing users do not need to remember
	  any particular syntax)
	+ *Intelligent* autoremoval of addresses from the list that cause
	  too many bounces
	+ Submissions can be limited to people on the accept list (which could
	  be the current list of subscribers)
	+ The fully automated subscription mechanism allows for a reject list
	  of unwanted subscribers
	+ Auto-digest-generation (configurable per list)
	+ Joint management of several mailinglists possible (through hardlinked
	  rcfiles)
	+ Customisation per mailinglist or mailinglist group possible (simply
	  remove or create the desired hardlinks)
	+ A listmaintainer can be assigned per list;  miscellaneous requests
	  that couldn't be handled by the list automatically are then
	  forwarded to his mail address (instead of being accumulated in
	  a file)
	+ Allows for remote maintenance of any mailinglist by a
	  listmaintainer
	+ Integrated archiving service
	+ Integrated diagnostic aid to give hints to the maintainer about
	  possible problems
	+ You can set up a mailinglist to function as a standalone mail
	  archive server
