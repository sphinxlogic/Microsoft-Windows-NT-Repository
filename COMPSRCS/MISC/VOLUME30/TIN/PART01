XThis patch enables the TIN newsreader index files to be fetched from a
XNNTP server. The patch adds the following to the NNTP server nntpd:
X
X  o  XINDEX command to retrieve tin group index file from server.
X     Syntax:  XINDEX alt.sources
X
X  o  XUSER command to log tin clients username to nntp logfile.
X     Syntax:  XUSER Iain Lea
X
X  o  LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS command to retrieve list of newsgroups
X     that first time user will be automatically subscribed to.
X     Our users are auto subscribed to 120 groups from the 450
X     that we take. Groups are written 1 group per line in the
X     file /usr/lib/news/subscriptions.
X     Syntax: LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS
X
X  o  HELP command changed to list XINDEX & XUSER as extensions.
X
X  o  Added comments /* */ around '#endif /* text */' to stop some
X     compilers producing warnings about text after '#endif text'.
X
XFor compile & install instructions read the file INSTALL.NNTP

X.SH "INDEX FILES"
XIn order to keep track of threads, Tin maintains an index for each newsgroup.
XThere are a number of methods in which index files can be created and updated.
X.PP
XThe simplest method is that each user creates/updates there own index files
Xthat are stored in $HOME/.tin/.index. This has the advantage that any user
Xcan compile and install tin, but the disadvantage is that each user is going
Xto be creating duplicate files and using precious disk space. A good way to 
Xkeep index files updated is to start tin with the -U option that will update
Xindex files in the background while you are reading news in the foreground.
XYou can also update index files via the system batcher cron with the -u
Xoption:

XA slightly better method is to set tin setuid news and have all index files
Xcreated and updated in the news spool directory (ie. /usr/spool/news/.index).
XThis has the advantage that there will only be one copy of the index files
Xon each machine on your network, but the disadvantage is that you will have
Xtin running setuid news and killing articles will change the central index
Xfile for a group for all users (Needs fixing!).
X.PP
XA better method is to install the tind index file updating daemon and have
Xit create and update index files for all groups in your active file at
Xregular intervals in the news spool directory (ie. /usr/spool/news/.index).
XThis has the advantage that there will only be one copy of the index files on
Xeach machine on your network and tin must not be setuid news, but the
Xdisadvantage is that you will have to have news permissions to install tind
Xand root permissions to install an entry in the cron batcher system to have
Xtind regularly update index files.
X.PP
XThe best method is to install the tind index file updating daemon on your
XNNTP server and have it create and update index files for all groups in your
Xactive file at regular intervals in the news spool directory (ie. /usr/spool/news/.index).
XThis has the advantage that there will only be one copy of the index files on
Xthe NNTP server for the whole of your network and tin clients must not be
Xsetuid news, but the disadvantage is that you will have to install my NNTP
Xserver patches to allow tin to retreive index file from your NNTP server and 
Xand you must install an entry in the cron batcher system to have tind 
Xregularly update index files (Note that this is the method we use on our
Xnetwork of 40-50 machines and have not had any problems).
X.PP
XEntering a group the first time tends to be slow because the index file must
Xbe built from scratch unless the tind update daemon is being used. Subsequent
Xreadings of a group will cause incremental updating of the index file.
X.PP
XIf reading news remotely and locally updating index files operation will be
Xsomewhat slower because the articles must be retrieved from the NNTP server.
X.SH "NEWS ADMINISTRATION"
XMaintaining Netnews on large networks of machines can be a pretty time 
Xconsuming job as I recently discovered when I was given the job of
Xmaintaining our news system and news users.
X.PP
XTin is a News User Agent and so most of the users were always asking
Xquestions or doing things that could be frowned upon by there departments.
XTo relieve news admins (and especially me) of this features have been added
Xto Tin to make life easier.
X.PP
XIf my NNTP XUSER patch has been applied to your NNTP server you will be
Xable to log the username and machine to your NNTP logfile for usage
Xstatistics.
X.PP
XA user starting tin for the first time can be automatically subscribed to a
Xlist of newsgroups that are deemed appropiate by the news administrator. At
Xour site the subscriptions file has 125 groups (our active file conatains
Xover 400 groups with many only being marginally interesting to most people).
XThe subscriptions file should be created in your news lib directory (ie.
X/usr/lib/news/subscriptions) and should have file permissions set to 0644.
XIf reading news via NNTP my NNTP LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS patch will have to have 
Xbeen applied to your NNTP server.

Xdescription, edit the kill file or save the kill description.
X.PP
XOn starting tin the users killfile \fI$HOME/.tin/kill\fP is read and
Xon entering a newsgroup any kill descriptions are applied. Articles
Xthat match a kill description are marked killed and are not displayed.
X.SH "POSTING ARTICLES"
XTin allows posting of articles, follow-up to already posted articles
Xand replying direct through mail to the author of an article.
X.PP
XUse the 'w' command to post an article to a newsgroup. After entering
Xthe post subject the default editor (ie. vi) or the editor specified
Xby the $VISUAL environment variable will be started and the article can
Xbe entered. To crosspost articles simply add a comma and the name of
Xthe newsgroup(s) to the end of the Newsgroups: line at the beginning of
Xthe article. After saving and exiting the editor you are asked if you
Xwish to a)bort posting the article, e)dit the article again or p)ost
Xthe article to the specified newsgroup(s).
X.PP
XUse the 'W' command to display a history of the articles you have posted.
XThe date the article was posted, which newsgroups the article was
Xposted to and the articles subject line are displayed.
X.PP
XUse the 'f' / 'F' command to post a follow-up article to an already
Xposted article. The 'F' command will copy the text of the original
Xarticle into the editor. The editing procedure is the same as when
Xposting an article with the 'w' command.
X.PP
XUse the 'r' / 'R' command to reply direct through mail to the author
Xof an already posted article. The 'R' command will copy the text of
Xthe original article into the editor. The editing procedure is the
Xsame as when posting an article with the 'w' command. After saving
Xand exiting the editor you are asked if you wish to a)bort sending
Xthe article, e)dit the article again or s)end the article to the
Xauthor.
X.SH "MAILING PIPING PRINTING REPOSTING AND SAVING ARTICLES"
XThe command interface to mail ('m'), pipe ('|'), print ('o'),
Xcrosspost ('x') and save ('s') articles is the same for ease of use.
X.PP
XThe initial command will ask you to select which a)rticle, t)hread,
Xh)ot (auto selected) r)egex pattern, t)agged articles you wish to
Xmail, pipe etc.
X.PP
XTagged articles must have already been tagged with the 'T' command.
XAll tagged articles can be untagged by the 'U' untag command.
X.PP
XIf regex pattern matching is selected you are asked to enter a regular
Xexpression (ie. to match all articles subject lines containing 'net News'
Xyou must enter '*net News*'). Any articles that match the
Xentered expression will be mailed, piped etc.
X.PP
XTo save articles to a mailbox with the name of the current newsgroup
X(ie. Alt.sources) enter '=' or '=<mailbox name>' when asked for the
Xsave filename.
X.PP
XTo save articles in <newsgroup name>/<filename> format enter '+<filename>'.
X.PP
XWhen saving articles you can specify whether the saved files should be
Xpost processed (ie. unshar shell archive, uudecode multiple parts etc).
XA default process type can be set by the 'Process type:' in the 'M'
Xoptions menu.
X.SH AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS
XTin allows new/unread news articles to be mailed (-M option)/saved
X(-S option) in batch mode for later reading. Useful when going on
Xholiday and you don't want to return and find that expire has removed a
Xwhole load of unread articles. Best to run from crontab everyday while away,
Xafter which you will be mailed a report of which articles were mailed/saved
Xfrom which newsgroups and the total number of articles mailed/saved.
XArticles are saved in a private news structure under your <savedir> directory
X(default is \fI$HOME/News\fP). Be careful of using this option if you read a
Xlot of groups because you could overflow your filesystem. If you only want to
Xsave a few groups it would be best to backup your full \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP and
Xcreate a new one that only contains the newsgroups you want to mail/save.
XSaved news can be read later by starting tin with the -R option.
X.PP
Xtin -M iain -f newsrc.mail (mail any unread articles in newgroups specified
Xin file newsrc.mail)
X.PP
Xtin -S -f newsrc.save (save any unread articles in newgroups specified
Xin file newsrc.save)
X.PP
Xtin -R (read any unread articles saved by tin -S option)
X.SH SIGNATURES
XTin will recognize a signature in either \fI$HOME/.signature\fP or
X\fI$HOME/.Sig\fP. If \fI$HOME/.signature\fP exists, then the signature
Xwill be pulled into the editor for Tin mail commands.  A signature in
X\fI$HOME/.signature\fP will not be pulled into the editor for posting
Xcommands since the inews program will append the signature itself.
X.PP
XA signature in \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP will be pulled into the editor for both
Xposting and mailing commands.
X.PP
XThe following is an example of a \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP file:
X.RS

X.SH "ENVIROMENT VARIABLES"
X.TP
X\fBTINDIR\fP
XDefine this variable if you do not want tin's .tin directory in $HOME/.tin.
X(ie. if you want all tin's private files in /tmp/.tin you would set
XTINDIR to contain /tmp.
X.TP
X\fBNNTPSERVER\fP
XThe default NNTP server to remotely read news from. This variable only
Xneeds to be set if the -r command line option is specified and the file
X\fI/etc/nntpserver\fP does not exist.
X.TP
X\fBDISTRIBUTION\fP
XSet the article header field Distribution: to the contents of the
Xvariable instead of the system default.
X.TP
X\fBORGANIZATION\fP
XSet the article header field Organization: to the contents of the
Xvariable instead of the system default. This variable has precedence
Xover the file \fI$HOME/.tin/organization\fP that may also contain an
Xorganization string. If reading news on an Apollo DomainOS machine
Xthe environment variable NEWSORG has to be used instead of ORGANIZATION.
X.TP
X\fBREPLYTO\fP
XSet the article header field Reply-To: to the return address specified
Xby the variable.
XThis is useful if the machine is not registered in the UUCP mail maps
Xor if you wish to recieve replies at a different machine.
XThis variable has precedence over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/replyto\fP
Xthat may also contain a return address.
X.TP
X\fBADD_ADDRESS\fP
XThis can contain an address to append to the return address when replying
Xdirectly through mail to somebody whose mail address is not directly
Xrecognized by the local host. For example say the return address is
X\fIuser@bigvax\fP, but \fIbigvax\fP is not recognized by your host, so
Xtherfore the mail will not reach \fIuser\fP. But the host \fIlittevax\fP
Xis known to recognize your host and \fIbigvax\fP, so if ADD_ADDRESS is set
X(ie. 'setenv ADD_ADDRESS @littevax' for csh or 'set ADD_ADDRESS @littevax'
Xand 'export ADD_ADDRESS' for sh) the address \fIuser@bigvax@littlevax\fP will
Xbe used and the mail will reach \fIuser@bigvax\fP.
XThis variable has precedence over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/add_address\fP
Xthat may also contain an address.
X.TP
X\fBBUG_ADDRESS\fP
XIf the 'B' command bug report mail address is not correct this variable should be
Xset to the correct mail address. This variable has precedence over the file
X\fI$HOME/.tin/bug_address\fP that may also contain a mail address.
X.TP
X\fBMAILER\fP
XThis variable has precedence over the default mailer that is used in all
Xmailing operations within tin (ie. replying 'rR', and bug reports 'B').
X.TP
X\fBVISUAL\fP
XThis variable has precedence over the default editor (ie. vi) that is
Xused in all editing operations within tin (ie. posting 'w', replying 'rR',
Xfollow-ups 'fF' and bug reports 'B').
