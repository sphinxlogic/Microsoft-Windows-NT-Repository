XThis file describes the new features, changes, and bug fixes in
Xversion 2.20 of Astrolog (over the previous version, 2.10, posted 3.5
Xmonths ago). Although this new version is a stand alone program, this
XUpdate file requires knowledge of the features of version 2.10 in
Xorder to make sense. If you aren't familiar with version 2.10, get and
Xread the version 2.10 Helpfile which describes all its features from
Xthe alt.astrology ftp site at hilbert.maths.utas.edu.au, or from any
Xcomp.sources.misc archive.
X
XJust some of the new things contained in Astrolog 2.20 are: Fixed star
Xpositions, spatial astronomical charts of the solar system, and a
Xcouple of other things non-astrologer astronomers would like. Also
Xadded are new kinds of and more support for relationship charts, and
Xthe nascent beginnings of an interpretation feature, along with other
Xthings non-astronomer astrologers would like. Ability to scan a data
Xfile for program defaults has been added, allowing changes to be made
Xto the program without recompiling, along with a bunch of funky
Xadditions to the X graphics features.
X
X----
X
XImportant: A few changes have been made to the program, i.e. not just
Xnew features but some things that were true for version 2.10 are no
Xlonger valid. A list of these changes follows:
X
X1) First of all, every object (planets, minor house cusps, uranians,
X   and stars) has its own "number", displayable in the -O list. No more
X   ugly hacks of overwriting some planets with the uranian positions in
X   the -u option. There is virtually no difference between a planet and a
X   house cusp. The default is still the first 20 objects to keep the
X   charts looking the same as before, although one can have a chart with
X   all 78 objects (one for each tarot card ;) if they like. For example,
X   the -u uranian switch will now display the uranian locations after
X   everything else in the standard chart display. You get what you ask
X   for, and what you don't want must be explicitly -R restricted.
X
X2) As a result of the above, the minor house cusps (11th, 12th, 2nd,
X   3rd) are no longer included in the -T transit list by default. If you
X   want them, you must explicitly specify you want them (with the -C cusp
X   option described later). Also, the relationship chart aspect grid now
X   includes the vertex (before it only included the first 19 objects) and
X   as a result the display will unfortunately exceed 80 columns, unless
X   you explicitly restrict one of them with the -R option.
X
X3) The program now makes a distinction between synastry charts, and
X   the actual comparison between two charts. Before the -r option would
X   combine the two charts in synastry, unless it was the -g option, in
X   which case the contents of both charts would be compared in an aspect
X   grid. Now -r is only for synastry, and combinations such as "-r chart1
X   chart2 -g" or "-r chart1 chart2 -g -X" will display the aspects within
X   the synastry chart itself. To actually have two charts side by side,
X   use the -r0 option described later, instead of -r.
X
X4) To display the ley lines in the -XW world map window, or to see the
X   southern hemisphere in the -XP polar chart, one had to enter animation
X   mode before, a hack which of course had nothing to do with animation.
X   This "bonus information" is now in a separate feature, accessed with
X   the -Xi switch described later.
X
X5) In an X window, pressing the 'S' key would resize the window to be
X   a square, and the 'C' key would revert the mode back to the standard
X   wheel chart. These two keys presently do other operations described
X   later, and the above functions are now accessed by the 'Q' and 'V'
X   keys respectively.
X
X6) The chart information at the bottom of the window is now included
X   by default, while before it wasn't. To remove it, press the 'T' key in
X   the window or use the -XT switch described later.
X
X7) The -w and -w0 switches both display the same text wheel chart, but
X   in slightly different ways. They have been reversed in function, since
X   the -w0 chart looked better.
X
X8) The "default" chart, i.e. the initial values in the chart
X   parameters that are used if one forces a chart to be used when one is
X   not expected, e.g. combining the -XW and -o switches, has been
X   changed. Before, I had put in the data for the 11:11pm GMT New Moon on
X   1-4-1992, but now I have changed it to the chart for this version of
X   Astrolog itself: 5-31-1992 9pm PDT Seattle, WA.
X
X9) Finally, concerning the source code itself, there are two new
X   files: options.c has been split into the new file charts.c, and
X   graphics.c has been split into the new file xcharts.c.
X
X----
X
XNow, a comprehensive list of the features and extensions added to this
Xversion of Astrolog follows:
X
XA) -S switch: A new chart type is available - solar system space
X   charts, which give the astronomical positions of each planet in terms
X   of x, y, and z coordinates. Although not directly useful
X   astrologically, it does give one a good view of how the planets
X   actually were positioned at the time in question. For example, normal
X   astrology doesn't make the distinction between the four different
X   "forms" of say, a Mercury Venus Conjunction, i.e. they can either be
X   Conjunct on the near side of the Sun, Conjunct on the far side of the
X   Sun, or one can be on one side and the other on the other side. When
X   the chart is actually displayed, for each body the following
X   information is printed: The relative angle of the planet with respect
X   to the central body, i.e. its zodiac position converted to the
X   appropriate number from 0..360. This is followed by the x, y, and z
X   coordinate positions of the object, in astronomical units from the
X   central body. The x-axis increases in the direction of 0 degrees Aries
X   (tropical zodiac), the y-axis increases in the direction of 0 degrees
X   Cancer, and the z-axis is with respect to the Earth's orbit (meaning
X   that the Sun and Earth always have a z-axis value of 0.0). Finally the
X   overall length from the central body in AU is printed, which is just
X   the diagonal as indicated by the x, y, z vectors. (The Earth and Sun
X   are of course always about 1.0 AU from each other.) The Moon circles
X   the Earth and isn't a part of the solar system proper; therefore, it
X   is never in these charts. The -e everything option will include this
X   chart in it's listing of all the chart displays.
X
X   The -S switch can be combined with -X to give an X window chart of the
X   solar system. This will be displayed as an aerial view of the entire
X   solar system, with 0 degrees Aries to the left of the screen, and 0
X   degrees Cancer to the bottom. Note that this chart includes all
X   possible planets, including the Earth (whose glyph is a cross inside a
X   circle). Whatever object is chosen to be the central body is at the
X   center of the screen, with all the others around it. This is a fun
X   chart to animate - watch the planets go around the Sun, and *see* how
X   they turn retrograde with respect to the Earth. In addition to the
X   bodies themselves, twelve spokes are drawn from the center body to the
X   edge of the screen, which delineate the zodiac with respect to it.
X   Note that the scale of the solar system is large; attempting to fit
X   all the planets out to Pluto on the screen at once will cause all the
X   inner planets to be crammed together near the middle of the screen. To
X   deal with this, the scale size as indicated with the -Xs switch and
X   the '<' and '>' keys will affect how much of the solar system is
X   viewed at once (in addition to the glyph sizes). For a scale size of
X   300, the viewport will have a radius of 6 AU (about out to the orbit
X   of Jupiter; useful for viewing the inner planets). For a scale size of
X   200 (default), it will have a radius of 30 AU (enough to include
X   Neptune, and Pluto most of the time). Finally, a scale size of 100
X   will result in a radius of 90 AU, enough to easily include the entire
X   solar system, as well as the orbits of the alleged Uranian bodies
X   beyond Pluto.
X
XB) -I switch: Another new chart type is available - interpretation of
X   influences. This is the beginning of a general interpretation ability
X   for the program, although all it does now is calculate the relative
X   "power" of each planet's placement, giving a general idea of the
X   prominent areas of a chart. When such a chart is printed, each planet
X   is given a point value, larger numbers indicating more strength. Each
X   planet's strength is divided between two fields: the positioning in
X   and of itself, and the power of the aspects it makes with the other
X   planets. In addition to each field, the total of these two areas is
X   printed, as well as the relative percentage of the planet in question
X   with respect to all the planets combined. Each planet gets a ranking
X   for its positioning, aspects, and total power as well, with the
X   strongest getting #1, the next strongest #2, etc. The -e option will
X   include this chart as well in it's listing of all the chart displays.
X
X   To determine the strength of the positioning of a planet, various
X   things are taken into account: 1) The power of a planet in and of
X   itself, e.g. the Sun and Moon are more powerful then the other
X   planets. 2) The house placement of a planet, e.g. a planet in the 1st
X   house is more powerful than one in the 2nd. 3) Whether a planet is in
X   the sign it rules or is exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in Sag results in
X   more power to Jupiter. 4) Whether a planet is in the house
X   corresponding to the sign it rules or is exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in
X   the 9th house. 5) Planets get more power if the signs they rule are
X   occupied, e.g. a bunch of stuff in Aquarius gives more power to
X   Uranus. 6) Planets get more power if the houses they rule are
X   occupied, e.g. a bunch of stuff in the 11th house gives power to
X   Uranus. 7) Finally, planets get power according to what houses the
X   cusps of which fall in the signs they rule, i.e. the ruler of the
X   Ascendant (and to less extent the Midheaven, and so on) gets lots of
X   influence. Determining the strength of a planet's aspects is much
X   easier, and is basically composed of the sum of the strength of each
X   aspect the planet makes. Taken into account are: 1) The inherent
X   influence of the planet being aspected to, e.g. Sun conjunct Jupiter
X   gives more influence to Jupiter than Mercury conjunct Jupiter would.
X   2) The influence of the aspect itself, e.g. Oppositions are more
X   powerful then Sextiles. 3) Finally the orb of the aspect, i.e. exact
X   aspects are more powerful than wide ones. (The influence of the orb
X   varies linearly from max power at exact to zero power at the limit of
X   the orb - sorry Maggie M. and Mark K. - no complex aspect wave
X   functions, at least for this version :)
X
X   Special thanks goes to Mark K. who initially presented this idea of
X   interpreting overall influences to me. I basically just took his
X   ideas, polished them a bit, and put it into the code. Interestingly,
X   while programming this feature, I had a dream about him, in which he
X   elaborated upon some of the ideas and even gave me suggestions for
X   some of the planets' default power values (astral visitation?) And,
X   while on the subject, I've had a couple of other Astrolog dreams; I
X   had one neat one while working on the -h extension (described later)
X   about a far distant future version of Astrolog that could actually
X   teleport one to the places which they cast charts for :)
X
XC) -v switch: This isn't really a new feature, but rather a formal
X   specification for the standard chart listing of the planetary
X   positions. Before, one would get this chart by default if they didn't
X   specify any other chart types, and they would get it along with
X   everything else in the -e option, but there was never any formal
X   switch for it. In other words, before there was no way to, for
X   example, display the standard chart, followed by an aspect grid, since
X   there was no switch to choose the standard chart. Now, one can specify
X   "-v -g" and get the above mentioned combination.
X
XD) -v addition: The standard chart listing of the planetary positions
X   has been expanded to include an extra field for the "velocity" of each
X   planet. This velocity value approximates how fast the planet is moving
X   through the zodiac with respect to the Earth (or whatever the central
X   body is set to) in degrees per day. This value of course, goes
X   negative when a planet goes retrograde. This is useful not only to get
X   a feel for how fast each planet moves through the zodiac, but to
X   determine when a planet is about to go retrograde or direct - the
X   value approaches zero when the planet changes direction.
X
XE) -v0 switch: This switch is just like -v except that it modifies the
X   planet velocities slightly. Normally, it isn't a trivial task to
X   determine precisely when a planet is going to change direction. This
X   is because, for example, although a velocity of 0.010 degrees/day for
X   fast moving Mercury means it's about to turn retrograde, the same
X   velocity value is normal for slow moving Pluto. The -v0 switch divides
X   the normal velocity values by how fast each planet moves with respect
X   to the Sun, meaning that all planets will now have an average
X   *relative* velocity value of 1.000, and in all cases, a velocity of
X   2.000 means the planet is moving twice as fast as normal, and one of
X   0.010 means the planet is about to turn retrograde.
X
XF) -d addition: The -d aspect search routine has been expanded to
X   calculate and display the times when a planet changes direction.
X   Before, in such a listing, it would be shown whenever a planet changed
X   direction during a day, but the exact time of the station wouldn't be
X   printed for it.
X
XG) -U switch: Astrolog 2.20 has the ability to display the positions
X   of 46 of the brightest and most important stars in the sky. To include
X   these stars in a chart, use the -U "universe" option. The 43 brightest
X   stars, i.e. all those with apparent magnitude values < 2.0 are
X   included, in addition to three dimmer stars which are considered
X   significant, i.e.: Polaris the North star, the Pleiades star cluster
X   (home of our extraterrestrial cousins), and Zeta Reticuli (home of the
X   Grey aliens.) One bright star is called "Orion", which is formally
X   Alnilam, the middle star of Orion's belt. Since stars are fixed in
X   the sky, they will never change position in the -s siderial zodiac,
X   although they will slowly precess forward in the normal tropical
X   zodiac. The -R restriction option can be used to determine which stars
X   are actually included, although the -U option needs to be included to
X   get any stars at all. In X windows, the stars are denoted by three
X   letter abbreviations (as are the uranians and minor house cusps), and
X   are colored according to their brightness: yellow for stars brighter
X   than (less than) magnitude 0.0, gold for dimmer ones from 0.0 to 1.0,
X   orange for those from 1.0 to 2.0, and finally the dimmest special
X   stars with a magnitude greater than 2.0 are red.
X
X   In the -v standard chart, -Z horizon chart, and in the -O object list,
X   where all the stars are printed sequentially, it can sometimes be
X   confusing to locate the star you want among 42 others. The -U option
X   can be modified to sort the stars in various ways. If one uses -Ub
X   instead of just -U, the stars will be listed in order from brightest
X   to dimmest. Doing -Un instead of -U will alphabetize the stars by
X   name. -Ul will sort them by their altitude from highest in the sky to
X   lowest, while -Uz will sort them by their zodiac position. Note that
X   any star ordering will have no visible effect in X windows, and one
X   must still use the default ordering when passing numbers to the -R
X   option to restrict various stars.
X
XH) -C switch: This new option must be indicated to include the four
X   minor house cusps (i.e. 11th, 12th, 2nd, 3rd) in the various chart
X   options, such as the -g aspect grids, -T transit searches, the X wheel
X   chart, etc. This option of course won't have any effect on certain
X   charts where only physical bodies are shown (e.g. -Z, -S, -L) or where
X   all house cusps are already indicated in the chart (e.g. -v, -w).
X
XI) -O0 switch: The old -O switch simply displays a list of all the
X   objects, cusps, uranians, and stars, along with their index numbers.
X   This list can be affected by the -R restrictions, and the -C, -u, and
X   -U switches must be included in order for all of Astrolog's objects to
X   get listed. In order to make it easier to simply display a list of all
X   78 objects Astrolog recognizes, the new -O0 option is just like -O
X   (and is equivalent to "-C -u -U -O") except that it will ignore all
X   restrictions and always list every object. Stars are printed in the
X   list along with their azimuth, altitude, and brightness values.
X   (Remember that when -O is encountered, it immediately executes and
X   terminates the program, so any modifying switches must be before it.)
X
XJ) -RC, -Ru, -RU switches: These three switches are similar to the -R0
X   option in that they initially restrict objects, i.e. all the minor
X   cusps, Uranians, and stars, respectively from appearing. For example,
X   if you want to include only the star Sirius in an X window chart
X   without having to also include all the other stars (or having to enter
X   a very long restriction list), do: "astrolog -U -RU 48 -X", which will
X   include the stars, and then restrict them all except Sirius, before
X   making the chart.
X
XK) -h <arg> expansion: The -h switch which allowed heliocentric charts
X   to be computed has been expanded to allow charts to be cast with any
X   planet as the center. The option takes a parameter to indicate which
X   object to center the chart on, e.g. do -h 5 to cast a Mars centered
X   chart. (Moon centered charts are not allowed.) As before, -h by itself
X   means to do a heliocentric chart.
X
XL) -rm <file1> <file2> switch: Time-space midpoint relationship charts
X   are now supported. Doing "-rm chart1 chart2" will calculate the time
X   and location exactly half way between the times and locations as
X   indicated in the two files. Unlike all other types of relationship
X   charts, this one actually exists in space and time, and therefore can
X   be treated like a single chart and can be output with the -o option.
X
XM) -r0 <file1> <file2> switch: A distinction has now been made between
X   synastry relationship charts and the actual comparison between two
X   separate charts. The -r0 option must be used to generate these
X   comparison charts, e.g. the aspect grid between the planets of two
X   charts (and the new X chart described later). The -r0 option will act
X   like the -r synastry option in certain displays that can't compare two
X   charts; for example, "-r chart1 chart2 -g" and "-r0 chart1 chart2 -g"
X   are different, because one generates the aspect grid within a synastry
X   chart, and the other an aspect grid between all the planets in the two
X   charts, but "-r chart1 chart2 -v" and "-r0 chart1 chart2 -v" will do
X   the same thing. (Note: the "-t file" current transit option is
X   basically a shorthand way of doing "-r0 file now".)
X
XN) -G switch: This switch generates a special type of locational
X   analysis chart, called a geodetic chart, in which the house cusps are
X   computed from a different source, i.e. as a function of only the
X   longitude and latitude. This basically gives every spot on the planet
X   a different unique set of house cusps, and can be used to analyze the
X   characteristics of different areas, and their influence on you if you
X   insert your own planets in the houses. This type of chart was
X   described in the January 1992 issue of Dell Horoscope magazine, from
X   which I learned how to generate these charts. Basically, the Midheaven
X   is approximately the longitude value converted from degrees into the
X   appropriate zodiac sign; for example 0 degrees E goes to 0 degrees
X   Aries, 30 degrees E goes to 0 degrees Taurus, etc.
X
XO) -L <arg> addition: For text screens, one can pass an optional
X   parameter to the -L or -L0 astro-graph option to give the latitude
X   step rate at which the Ascendant and Descendant lines are computed.
X   This value is by default 5 degrees, although one can may increase or
X   decrease it to any integer (subject to the restriction that the number
X   160 is divisible by it.)
X
XP) -g0 addition: A new planetary configuration has been added to this
X   option. In addition to flagging the Grand Trines, T-Squares, and so
X   on, any chart Stellium's are located. In a Stellium, three objects
X   must all be conjunct with each other.
X
XQ) -ga switch: Ability to determine whether an aspect is applying or
X   separating (is about to happen or just happened) has been added to the
X   -g option. Normally the aspect orbs are flagged as being + or - based
X   on whether they are greater or less than the proper amount (e.g. a 91
X   degree Square has a +1 degree orb while a 89 degree one a -1 orb.) If
X   one, however, invokes the -g option as -ga instead, a negative orb
X   will indicate an applying aspect while a positive orb a separating
X   one. (To estimate applying vs. separating, the program examines the
X   planetary positions and their velocities at the time in question.)
X
XR) -g0 expansion: For relationship aspect grids, the -g0 option will
X   display a midpoint grid instead of an aspect grid between the planets
X   in the two charts e.g. "-r0 chart1 chart2 -g0". Before, the -g0 switch
X   with comparison charts wouldn't behave any different from just -g.
X
XS) -s0 switch: For astronomers out there, the new -s0 option will
X   print all planetary positions in the right ascension hours/minutes
X   format instead of the sign/degrees/minutes astrologers are accustomed
X   to. This will affect how the objects are listed in the -v display, and
X   how the star azimuths are displayed in the -O list. For example, 0
X   degrees Aries is represented as 0 hr, 0 min; 0 Cancer goes to 6 hr, 0
X   min, and so on through the 24 hour clock.
X
XT) -p0 <arg> switch: User definable progression rates can be specified
X   with this new option. When using the -p progression option, Astrolog
X   assumes you want the standard "year for a day" rate of secondary
X   progressions. By passing different values to the -p0 switch, one can
X   change the default "365.25 days for a day" to any value they want for
X   some less often used method of progression. For example, one can do
X   "-p0 7 -pn" to do a week for a day, "-p0 -365.25 -pn" to get negative
X   year for day progressions, and so on. (Note that "-p0 1" would be the
X   same as if no progression were done at all.)
X
XU) -z expansion: Normally the -z option takes an argument which will
X   then become the default time zone. If one, however, invokes it by
X   itself, it will subtract one hour from whatever the default time zone
X   presently is. This is useful since it is equivalent to adjusting any
X   times printed to Daylight time, i.e. it will add one hour to any times
X   displayed. (When entering the birth time for charts, one is supposed
X   to subtract one hour if Daylight time was in effect; note that
X   subtracting one hour from the time zone will do the same thing.) For
X   example, over here on the West Coast, I have my default time zone
X   compiled to be "8"; now that Daylight time is in effect here, I can do
X   -z 7 or just -z to decrease the default time zone when I make a -T
X   transit list, which will in effect add one hour to the local times
X   displayed, or in effect "Spring ahead" the clock for me. (For a better
X   way of adjusting Astrolog for Daylight time without having to specify
X   -z all the time, recompile the program, or add one hour to the times
X   in your head, use the "defaults" file described later to change the
X   time zone.) Remember that the -z (and -l) switches must be before any
X   other switches they modify (such as -n) in order for the new default
X   to take effect.
X
XV) -- <arg> switch: This new "dash minus" option is just like the old
X   "dash plus" (-+) option that's already in place, except it subtracts
X   instead of adds the specified number of days from any chart cast. This
X   is only for convenience, in that "-- 1" is the same as "-+ -1".
X
XW) -w expansion: Chart header information has been added to the -w
X   text wheel chart option. Before, the space in the middle of the chart
X   was left blank, but now displayed in it is the same header info as is
X   at the top of the standard -v chart.
X
XX) There are now wider orbs allowed for the Sun and Moon in the aspect
X   grids. Normally, only the aspect in question determines the allowed
X   orb, but the Sun and Moon will now each add 1 degree to whatever the
X   orb would have been. (This excludes minor objects such as the North
X   Node, Part of Fortune, Vertex, and all the stars, for which the orbs
X   are not allowed to ever exceed two degrees.)
X
XY) When specifying command switches, the leading dashes are optional,
X   and aren't necessary any more. For example, the command "astrolog -i
X   chartfile -R -u -U -Z -Xs 300 -Xi -XB" can be abbreviated as "astrolog
X   i chartfile R u U Z Xs 300 Xi XB". (This is subject to a couple of
X   minor limitations, in that one can't have the -1 or -3 option follow a
X   -R restriction list of numbers, for obvious reasons.)
X

XAstrolog 2.20 includes the ability to search an input file for various
Xdefault parameters to use in the program. This allows one to easily
Xchange major defaults without having to recompile the program, which
Xis useful if, say, one receives a compiled executable from a friend
Xwho had a different configuration. The program looks for the file
X"astrolog.dat" in the current directory, and if not there, looks for
Xit in the default directory. Parameters in this file will override any
Xdefaults compiled into the program, although the highest priority is
Xstill given to the command line options. Note one doesn't *have* to
Xhave this file in order to run the program - if not found Astrolog
Xwill still run as before. Presently, the parameters one can change in
Xthis file are: default time zone (as indicated with -z option),
Xdefault longitude and latitude (as in -l option), number of aspects
X(-A option), default house system to use (values as in -c option).
XThen come default restriction values (as with -R option) for the first
X20 objects (0 = active, 1 = restricted). Next are the orbs (as with
X-Ao option) for the 18 aspects. Finally, comes a long list of the
Xinfluence values used by the -I option, i.e. the power values of each
Xof the first 20 planet objects, of the 12 houses, and of the 18
Xaspects. The only major thing that one *can't* change in the file is
Xthe default directory path in which the program looks in for input
Xfiles if not in the current directory, since Astrolog needs the
Xdefault directory in order to be able to locate the file in the first
Xplace! The "astrolog.dat" file included with this version of the
Xprogram has some "comment lines" describing what is contained in each
Xline. One can chance or delete comments as long as they make sure that
Xan equals sign ('=') immediately proceeds any value or list of values,
Xsince the program uses this character to determine where comments end.

X
XAdditional new features and extensions follow below; however, these
Xonly affect the graphics portions of the program, and therefore only
Xcome into play if the X11 compile time option is set.
X
XA) True relationship wheel charts can now be displayed in a window,
X   i.e. where the planets of both charts are displayed in separate rings
X   of the same wheel. Use the -r0 option to display this comparison type.
X   For example, for the command "astrolog -r0 person1 person2 -X", the
X   following is displayed: The signs and houses as in person1's chart are
X   drawn in the outermost part of the wheel. Inside this is a ring of
X   person2's planets as displayed in person1's houses, and inside of this
X   are person1's own planets. Finally at the very middle is an aspect
X   grid, which shows those aspects that are occurring between the objects
X   in the two charts. Basically this is just the standard wheel chart for
X   person1, except that person2's planets are in an outer ring of objects
X   and the aspect grid shows the aspects of the relationship. Putting
X   such a chart in animation mode only affects person2's planets, so this
X   is a great way to analyze transits: Doing "astrolog -t yourchartfile
X   -X" will show all your current transits, and allow you to easily
X   animate the transiting planets through your natal signs and houses.
X
XB) More color: For color X terminals, the -XG globe display and -XW
X   world map display are now done with the continents in different
X   colors! This makes them look much better than before. Each of the
X   seven continents is in a different color of the rainbow, and the
X   colors are chosen to correspond to the appropriate chakra (etheric
X   energy vortex along the human spine) that goes with each land mass.
X   They are: Africa - red - Root chakra, Australia - orange - Navel
X   chakra, South America - yellow - Solar plexus chakra, North America -
X   green - Heart chakra, Europe - blue - Throat chakra, Asia - indigo -
X   Third Eye chakra, Antarctica - violet - Crown chakra. Major lakes are,
X   of course, colored navy blue.
X
XC) Mouse buttons: Pressing the mouse buttons in the X windows will now
X   do various functions. The left mouse button acts as a pen that allows
X   one to actually draw on the chart: press it and drag the pointer to
X   draw a line on the window - good for aiding in analysis or in
X   presentations. (Any scribbles one makes will disappear the next time
X   the chart window is updated, therefore drawing will have little effect
X   when in animation mode.) The middle mouse button will only work when
X   the world map is shown, i.e. in the -L astrograph or -XW world map
X   displays: press it and get the approximate longitude and latitude of
X   the place on the map where the pointer is. For the three scale sizes
X   of 100, 200, and 300 percent, the accuracy is to the nearest degree,
X   30', and 20', respectively. So, if you want to cast a chart for
X   southern Madagascar, Africa, but don't know the coordinates, click the
X   middle button on the map for a good approximation! Finally, the right
X   button acts just like the 'q' key, and will terminate the window.
X
XD) '[', ']' keys: Not only can the globe display be rotated, but the
X   poles can be now tilted down at various angles! (This basically makes
X   the -XP polar globe view option obsolete; it's still in there only for
X   backwards compatibility.) Press the '[' and ']' keys when the globe is
X   being displayed to respectively "pull down" and "push back up" the
X   angle of the polar axis from which the globe is viewed.  Combining
X   this with the globe rotation allows one to move any point of the globe
X   to the center of the screen.
X
XE) 'l' key: Press the 'l' key in a window to inhibit the labeling of
X   all planets in the various charts. Instead of drawing the little point
X   and then the glyph near it, just the point is displayed. This mode is
X   mainly useful for the -Z horizon and -S space charts (and has little
X   use for anything else) when in cramped quarters or to get a more
X   realistic view of how the sky actually looks.
X
XF) -XT switch: In addition to the 'T' key which will toggle off or on
X   whether the chart parameters are displayed at the bottom of the
X   window, the new -XT option will do the same thing, giving control of
X   the feature when a formal window isn't actually opened, e.g. when
X   displaying to the root.
X
XG) 'O', 'o' keys: Have you ever animated your natal or some other
X   chart to some far distant future or past time, only then to wish you
X   could somehow easily get back to the original chart? You can now, by
X   pressing the 'O' key in a window, which will recall to the screen
X   previously "saved" chart parameters (which are by default set to
X   whatever you started the window with.) Press the 'o' key to change
X   this default stored chart to be the chart that is presently in the
X   window.
X
XH) 'B' key: Press the 'B' key in an X window to dump whatever is
X   currently being displayed to the background root window. This is
X   basically the corresponding keypress to the old -XB option.
X
XI) 'C', 'u', 'U' keys: Pressing the 'C', 'u', and 'U' keys in the
X   window will toggle the restriction status of the four minor house
X   cusps, the uranian planets, and the fixed stars, respectively. These
X   keys compliment the old 'R' key option already in place, and are the
X   counterparts to the -C, -u, -U, and -RC, -Ru, -RU options.
X
XJ) 's', 'h' keys: Press the 's' key in the window to toggle whether or
X   not the siderial vs. tropical zodiac is used. Press the 'h' key to
X   toggle to a heliocentric based chart or back again to a geocentric
X   one. These of course correspond the the -s and -h options.
X
XK) 'v' key: Press this key to dump back to the text screen the list of
X   where all the planets currently being displayed in the window are.
X   This display is the same as produced with the -v switch, and is useful
X   if one wants text to indicate where everything in the chart is.
X
XL) -Xi switch, 'i' key: Certain people have asked that some of the X
X   charts be modified in various minor ways, i.e. in either adding or
X   removing certain information. Rather than add a new hard to remember
X   minor option for each change, I have added one major new switch which
X   covers all the charts. The new -Xi switch will invoke this
X   "induce/inhibit information" option, and pressing the 'i' key in a
X   window will accomplish the same thing by toggling the mode's status.
X   By default, all the charts are as before, but when this bonus option
X   is set, it affects each X window chart in a different way, as follows:
X
X o For the standard -v and relationship -r0 -v wheel charts, it will
X   inhibit the display of the aspect grid in the center - useful for
X   speed or when doing large time lapse animations when it would get in
X   the way.
X
X o For the -g aspect grid, it will flip the aspects and midpoints across
X   the center diagonal, i.e. the midpoints will be below it and the
X   aspects above it, instead of the other way around. For the -r0 -g
X   relationship aspect grid, the entire grid will be replaced with one
X   showing all midpoints between all the objects in the two charts.
X
X o For the -Z horizon chart and -S space chart, it will, for the major
X   planets, increase the size of the "points" showing where each object
X   actually is, making a brighter "spot", for easier viewing; combine
X   this in the horizon chart with the 'l' key label inhibitor and get a
X   very realistic view of the night sky, with planets brighter and all.
X
X o For the -L astro-graph chart, this will eliminate the display of the
X   Ascendant, Descendant, and Nadir lines, leaving just the vertical
X   Midheaven lines and zenith points, for a remarkable increase in speed
X   and much less clutter when including many objects.
X
X o For the -XW world map display, this will show the Earth's ley line
X   locations; and for the -XP polar globe view, it will show the southern
X   hemisphere instead of the northern.
X
X o For the -XG globe display, it will display the zenith locations of all
X   planets (and stars if -U in effect) on the globe, i.e. where on the
X   Earth each object could be viewed by looking straight up. This on the
X   globe display is almost identical to the astro-graph chart without its
X   various lines, except of course that the projection of the world map
X   is different. It's also similar to the -Z horizon display, except that
X   it's free from the distortion of projecting the celestial sphere upon
X   a plane, so it has use to star gazers. However, animation mode here
X   will still only affect what part of the Earth is viewable, and won't
X   update the chart from which the zenith locations were obtained.
X
X----
X
XHere is a list of bug fixes over version 2.10:
X
X1) There was a major glitch in the uranian overwrite routine which
X   would not only display the uranian positions a degree or two off from
X   where they should be, but would also garble the positions of all the
X   other objects, too! Since the uranians are now displayed separately,
X   this is no longer a problem.
X
X2) The display of midpoints was always 0.5 degree ahead of where they
X   should be. For example, the midpoint of planets at 0Gem and 0Can would
X   have been 15Gem30 instead of 15Gem0. Believe it or not, this bug has
X   been in Astrolog since version 1.1, and I'm glad to say that it's
X   *not* in version 2.2!
X
X3) If one switched X window modes from a wheel chart to the
X   relationship aspect grid, extra junk would be displayed in some cells.
X   The aspect grid routine has been fixed now to make sure that those
X   cells that don't have aspects in them stay blank.
X
X4) Attempting to display a chart with no time or space (i.e. a chart
X   generated with the -o0 option) in an X window would dump core if the
X   chart information was also to be printed at the bottom of the window.
X   Now, these charts are no longer a problem, and as with the standard
X   listing, these charts are flagged as existing outside the space time
X   continuum.
X
X5) The -Z local horizon chart when displayed in an X window would fail
X   to recognize the -R restrictions before, and they properly do now.
X
X6) Certain VMS X window systems didn't like the procedure I named
X   "box" in the graphics portion (was already defined). This has been
X   renamed to eliminate the problem.
X
X7) When downloading the Astrolog source code, certain systems didn't
X   correctly transfer lines that began with a decimal point (e.g. the
X   numbers in the planetary data area). These have been prefixed with 0's
X   to fix the problem.
X
X8) Even when compiling for non X window systems, the previous version
X   would still compile in the graphics draw tables and world map data.
X   Although this wouldn't affect the running any, it would needlessly
X   make the executable larger. Now, trust that the only data compiled
X   into the program will be what the user wants as expressed in the
X   compile time options.
X
X9) The X window response time was very slow if the world map was ever
X   displayed in the lowest scale size, due to continuous error processing
X   since the vertical axis of these maps were smaller than the
X   established minimum window size. The minimum window size allowed has
X   been adjusted to accomodate all scale sizes. Also, on a related note,
X   Astrolog windows behave better when one resizes them: instead of
X   immediately resizing the window to within bounds if one makes the
X   window too big or small, it now won't allow windows to be stretched
X   beyond the established limits.
X
X0) Finally a warning for PC users: You will probably want to change
X   the value of DIVISIONS in astrolog.h from its current value of 24 to a
X   lower value like 6 or so. Leaving it as is invoked complaints of
X   extreme slowness and occasional multiple hits in the -d aspect search
X   routine, where the same aspect would get listed more than once. Also
X   for PC users, I eliminated the problem of the 16 bit PC ints not
X   having enough precision to compare with the 32 bit Unix ints, in that
X   everything is done using longs now.
