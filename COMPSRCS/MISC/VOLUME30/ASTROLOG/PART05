XThis file contains a complete list of all the features available in
XAstrolog version 2.25, and documentation on how to use each option.
XThe file is divided into four parts:
X
X1) A summary list of all the main features which are accessed via
Xcommand line parameter switches, along with a list of single keypress
Xcommands that can be given in an X window (assuming you have X
Xwindows) to change the display in various ways.
X
X2) The list of command switches and keypresses is repeated, but after
Xeach option is listed a more lengthy description of the details of
Xthis feature.
X
X3) Additional things such as some important compile time options, the
Xdefault parameter file, and descriptions of the things that appear in
Xthe Astrolog text displays, are described.
X
X4) Finally, there is a description of the different X window chart
Xdisplays and how they are organized, and the X windows features in
Xgeneral. (Looking for a quick impressive display to prove that this
Xwas worth compiling? In unix try: astrolog -Xn -XG -Xw 400. :)

X**********************************
XDESCRIPTION OF EACH COMMAND SWITCH
X**********************************
X
XNote: When specifying command switches, the leading dashes are
Xoptional, and aren't necessary. For example, the command "astrolog -i
Xchartfile -R -u -U -Z -Xs 300 -Xi -XB" can be abbreviated as "astrolog
Xi chartfile R u U Z Xs 300 Xi XB". (This is subject to a couple of
Xminor limitations, in that one can't have the -1 or -3 option follow a
X-R restriction list of numbers, for obvious reasons.)
X
X----
X
XAstrolog command switches (version 2.25) (June 1992):
X
X-H: Display this help message.
X
X  This option displays a list exactly like the one given above on the
X  screen.
X
X-O: Display available planets and other celestial objects.
X
X  Similar to the -A option below, the -O option will list all the
X  planets and other celestial objects used by the program, and their
X  numbers as recognized by the -R restrictions mentioned below. This
X  list will also show the zodiac signs that planets rule, fall in, are
X  exalted in, and debilitated in. (Remember that when -O is encountered,
X  it immediately executes and terminates the program, so any modifying
X  switches must be before it.)
X
X-O0: Line -O but ignore any restrictions.
X
X  The -O switch above simply displays a list of all the objects, cusps,
X  uranians, and stars, along with their index numbers. This list can be
X  affected by the -R restrictions, and the -C, -u, and -U switches must
X  be included in order for all of Astrolog's objects to get listed. In
X  order to make it easier to simply display a list of all 78 objects
X  Astrolog recognizes, the new -O0 option is just like -O (and is
X  equivalent to "-C -u -U -O") except that it will ignore all
X  restrictions and always list every object. Stars are printed in the
X  list along with their azimuth, altitude, and brightness values.
X
X-R [<obj1> [<obj2> ..]: Restrict specific bodies from displays.
X
X  The ability to restrict the transit (-T) and daily aspect (-d) scans
X  to just certain bodies has been implemented with the -R switch. Using
X  -R by itself will prevent the asteroids, Chiron, the Part of Fortune
X  and the Vertex from being in any of the lists. One may also give a
X  list of one or more numbers representing planets to be ignored (e.g. 1
X  = Sun, 2 = Moon, 3 = Mercury, etc) so that a complete custom setup can
X  be obtained (e.g. -R 1 2 3 4 5 will cause all of the inner planets to
X  be ignored). More than one -R switch can be combined (e.g. -R -R 16
X  will cause the asteroids, etc, and the North Node to be ignored; the
X  first -R gets rid of the asteroids, etc, and the second one deletes
X  the North Node.) Also, specifying the same particular body more than
X  once will cause it to be included again, or in other words, -R
X  <objectnum> complements the status of whether it is to be ignored or
X  not (e.g. -R -R 15 will cause all of the asteroids, etc, excluding
X  Vesta, to be ignored; the first -R makes causes the asteroids to be
X  ignored, and specifying Vesta in the second -R makes it reappear.)
X
X-R0 [<obj1> ..]: Like -R but restrict everything first.
X
X  The -R0 option will cause ALL of the bodies to be ignored, which is
X  useful if you are looking for just the transits/aspects of a few
X  planets (e.g. -R0 6 7 will cause everything but Juptier and Saturn to
X  be ignored.) Combining all these methods can cause whatever you are
X  looking for in transits and aspects to be quickly found without having
X  to wade through lots of stuff you aren't interested in.
X
X-R[C,u,U]: Restrict all minor cusps, all uranians, or stars.
X
X  These three switches are similar to the -R0 option in that they
X  initially restrict objects, i.e. all the minor cusps, Uranians, and
X  stars, (described below) respectively from appearing. For example, if
X  you want to include only the star Sirius in an X window chart without
X  having to also include all the other stars (or having to enter a very
X  long restriction list), do: "astrolog -U -RU 48 -X", which will
X  include the stars, and then restrict them all except Sirius, before
X  making the chart.
X
X-C: Include non-angular house cusps in charts.
X
X  This option must be indicated to include the four minor house cusps
X  (i.e. 11th, 12th, 2nd, 3rd) in the various chart options, such as the
X  -g aspect grids, -T transit searches, the X wheel chart, etc. This
X  option of course won't have any effect on certain charts where only
X  physical bodies are shown (e.g. -Z, -S, -L) or where all house cusps
X  are already indicated in the chart (e.g. -v, -w).
X
X-u: Include transneptunian/uranian bodies in charts.
X
X  Display the locations of the "Uranian" planets with the -u switch.
X  Transneptunian or Uranian planets are an interesting subset of
X  astrology which includes various objects alleged to be beyond Pluto.
X  (Do: astrolog -u -O to list the eight Uranian bodies.) Anyway,
X  Astrolog will display the zodiac positions of these planets as well if
X  one includes this option, and will print their positions after the
X  main planets, or include them in the other chart types. (Note: the
X  Uranians don't have any formal glyphs that I'm aware of, so therefore
X  they are displayed in the X charts as three letter abbreviations of
X  their name.)
X
X-U: Include locations of fixed background stars in charts.
X
X  Astrolog has the ability to display the positions of 46 of the
X  brightest and most important stars in the sky. To include these stars
X  in a chart, use the -U "universe" option. The 43 brightest stars, i.e.
X  all those with apparent magnitude values < 2.0 are included, in
X  addition to three dimmer stars which are considered significant, i.e.:
X  Polaris the North star, the Pleiades star cluster (home of our
X  extraterrestrial cousins), and Zeta Reticuli (home of the Grey
X  aliens.) One bright star is called "Orion", which is formally Alnilam,
X  the middle star of Orion's belt. Since stars are fixed in the sky,
X  they will never change position in the -s siderial zodiac, although
X  they will slowly precess forward in the normal tropical zodiac. The -R
X  restriction option can be used to determine which stars are actually
X  included, although the -U option needs to be included to get any stars
X  at all. In X windows, the stars are denoted by three letter
X  abbreviations (as are the uranians and minor house cusps), and are
X  colored according to their brightness: yellow for stars brighter than
X  (less than) magnitude 0.0, gold for dimmer ones from 0.0 to 1.0,
X  orange for those from 1.0 to 2.0, and finally the dimmest special
X  stars with a magnitude greater than 2.0 are red.
X
X-U[z,l,n,b]: Order by azimuth, altitude, name, or brightness.
X
X  In the -v standard chart, -Z horizon chart, and in the -O object list,
X  where all the stars are printed sequentially, it can sometimes be
X  confusing to locate the star you want among 42 others. The -U option
X  can be modified to sort the stars in various ways. If one uses -Ub
X  instead of just -U, the stars will be listed in order from brightest
X  to dimmest. Doing -Un instead of -U will alphabetize the stars by
X  name. -Ul will sort them by their altitude from highest in the sky to
X  lowest, while -Uz will sort them by their zodiac position. Note that
X  any star ordering will have no visible effect in X windows, and one
X  must still use the default ordering when passing numbers to the -R
X  option to restrict various stars.
X
X-A [<0-18>]: Display available aspects or limit their number.
X
X  The '-A' command switch gives a list of all 18 supported aspects,
X  their abbreviations as used in the aspect grids, their angles, and
X  their orbs. It will list the number of each aspect in addition to all
X  the other info already there (e.g. conjunct = 1, opposition = 2, etc.)
X  so one can easily figure out what exact number to pass to the -A
X  option when changing the number of aspects used (see below). Finally,
X  it will display a brief verbal description of what each aspect glyph
X  look like. This is in case one doesn't know what aspects the weird
X  symbols in the -g -X window displays are referring to.
X
X  For those who don't like all these aspects, specifying -A <number>
X  will limit the number of aspects (e.g. -A 5 will make charts with only
X  the five major aspects listed in them).
X
X-Ao <orb1> [<orb2> ..]: Specify max orbs for each aspect.
X
X  Change the default orbs of the various aspects with the -Ao <orb1>
X  <orb2>... <orbn> switch. Do you not like the 7 degree orbs for
X  conjunctions that are in there by default? One can change the first n
X  aspect orbs (i.e. as many orb values that one puts after the -Ao)
X  anywhere from just the conjunction to all 18 aspects. Non-integer
X  values are allowed of course. Use negative orb values to completely
X  eliminate an aspect from ever appearing. For example: astrolog -A 6
X  -Ao 5 5 -1 10 narrows the orbs for Conjunction and Opposition,
X  completely eliminates the Square, widens the orb for Trines, and
X  leaves the Sextiles and Inconjuncts in the default values. Note that
X  for very wide orbs more than one aspect may apply for a particular
X  angle, in which case the more fundamental aspect is chosen. Also for
X  wide aspects the decimal value of the orb may be lost in the -g text
X  grid (due to too many characters) and their might be some slight
X  overlap in the X window -g cells.
X
X-AO [..]: Like -Ao but suspend objects' max orb restrictions.
X
X  Note that Astrolog imposes restrictions on the max orb that any
X  particular aspect can have to certain particular objects, namely the
X  node, fortune, and vertex, which can't and shouldn't have aspects to
X  them in excess of 2 degrees. One can suspend these restrictions by
X  replacing the -Ao <orbs> option above, invoking it as -AO <orbs>
X  instead. For a fun (and perhaps useful) display, try: astrolog -A 1
X  -AO 180 -g [-X], and see everything conjunct everything else.
X
X
XSwitches which affect how a chart is computed:
X
X-c <value>: Select a different default system of houses.
X(0 = Placidus, 1 = Koch, 2 = Equal, 3 = Campanus, 4 = Meridian,
X5 = Regiomontanus, 6 = Porphry, 7 = Morinus, 8 = Topocentric, 9 = None.)
X
X  Ten different house systems are supported: Invoke as astrolog -c
X  <number> to change the system from the default of Placidus. (System 9
X  refers to no houses at all, or in other words where the Ascendant will
X  always be 0 degrees Aries, the Nadir 0 degrees Cancer, etc, which is
X  useful for the extended chart animations as described later where
X  having houses at all can tend to get in the way, and one can even
X  observe the precession of the equinoxes with this system if used in
X  conjunction with the -s siderial chart option.)
X
X-s: Compute siderial instead of the normal tropical chart.
X
X  With this option, the chart will be just like the normal charts as
X  most commonly used in astrology, except that all the zodiac positions
X  will be shifted (to be about 24 degrees earlier). This is because the
X  option casts siderial charts which are based on the positions of the
X  fixed stars (i.e. Aries starts at the constellation Aries) rather than
X  the seasons (i.e. Aries starts at the Spring or Vernal Equinox.) Due
X  to the "precession of the equinoxes" the the position of the Sun at
X  the Equinoxes has been gradually happening at an earlier point in the
X  siderial zodiac each year (taking about 2100 years change signs.)
X
X-s0: Display locations as right ascension instead of degrees.
X
X  For astronomers out there, this -s0 option will print all planetary
X  positions in the right ascension hours/minutes format instead of the
X  sign/degrees/minutes astrologers are accustomed to. This will affect
X  how the objects are listed in the -v display, and how the star
X  azimuths are displayed in the -O list. For example, 0 degrees Aries is
X  represented as 0 hr, 0 min; 0 Cancer goes to 6 hr, 0 min, and so on
X  through the 24 hour clock.
X
X-h [<objnum>]: Compute positions centered on specified object.
X
X  Normal astrology charts are based on the positions of the planets
X  relative to the Earth. However, this option allows seeing of the
X  zodiac positions with respect to the Sun's (or any other planet's)
X  point of view. The -h option when invoked by itself will display a
X  heliocentric chart: the Sun in the original listing will be replaced
X  with the Earth's position as seen from the Sun in the heliocentric
X  chart, with the other planets' positions modified accordingly. For
X  bodies other than the Sun, the option takes a parameter to indicate
X  which planet to center the chart on, e.g. do -h 5 to cast a Mars
X  centered chart. (Moon centered charts aren't allowed; in fact, note
X  that the -h option won't ever affect the Moon, which will always be
X  displayed as seen from the Earth, no matter what the center body is
X  set to, since it's not a formal planet.
X
X-p <month> <day> <year>: Cast progressed chart based for date.
X
X  A secondary progression chart for a particular date can be cast using the
X  '-p <month> <date> <year>' command switch. (Note, I'm not sure if the house
X  cusps are progressed correctly, but they're reasonably close to what is
X  properly expected.)
X
X-pn: Cast progressed chart based on current date now.
X
X  The -pn switch is like the -p <month> <date> <year> switch except that
X  (like the -n switch) it assumes the current moment now to cast the
X  progressed chart to. This is just another shorthand convenience to see
X  what ones progressed chart is like presently; just do: astrolog -i
X  file -pn.
X
X-p0 <days>: Set no. of days to progress / day (default 365.25).
X
X  User definable progression rates can be specified with this option.
X  When using the -p progression option, Astrolog assumes you want the
X  standard "year for a day" rate of secondary progressions. By passing
X  different values to the -p0 switch, one can change the default "365.25
X  days for a day" to any value they want for some less often used method
X  of progression. For example, one can do "-p0 7 -pn" to do a week for a
X  day, "-p0 -365.25 -pn" to get negative year for day progressions, and
X  so on. (Note that "-p0 1" would be the same as if no progression were
X  done at all.)
X
X-x <1-360>: Cast harmonic chart based on specified factor.
X
X  Harmonic charts (i.e. where all the planet positions are multiplied by a
X  factor and the chart recast) are supported via the '-x' option. (e.g.
X  -x 3 will make all trines conjunct in the chart displayed.)
X
X-1 [<objnum>]: Cast chart with specified object on ascendant.
X
X  The -1 <obj> option can be used to change the houses to force a
X  particular object to be on the ascendant. This is useful in casting
X  Solar charts or for when the time of birth is not exactly known. For
X  example -1 2 will case a normal chart, but the house cusps will be
X  rotated so that the moon is on the ascendant.
X
X-3: Display objects in their zodiac decan positions.
X
X  Decan displays are supported in Astrolog, and one can display a decan
X  influenced chart with the -3 switch. The decan theory is that each
X  sign in the zodiac can be divided into three parts: The first 10
X  degrees (i.e. the first decan) is mainly influenced by the sign in
X  question, the second 10 degrees (second decan) although still
X  influenced by the sign in question is also somewhat influenced by the
X  next sign of the same element, while the last decan is influenced by
X  the third sign of the same element. The -3 switch applied to a chart
X  will move each object into the sign of its decan. For example, if the
X  Sun is at 29 degrees Aquarius and the Moon at 5 degrees Virgo, in the
X  resulting chart, the Sun will go to Libra (26 degrees) and the Moon
X  will remain in Virgo (although be at 15 degrees now since it was
X  previously in the middle of the first decan of Virgo.)
X
X-f: Display houses as sign positions (flip them).
X
X  The -f option can be used to "flip" the signs and houses, i.e. display
X  the house as a sign position and vice versa. For example having the
X  Sun at 26 degrees Scorpio, 2/3 way though the 10th house, will cause
X  the resulting Sun under the -f option to be at 20 degrees Capricorn,
X  26/30th the way through the 8th house. This can be used to determine
X  how far a planet is through a particular house, as well as for Domal
X  chart analysis that Mark Kenski has informed me about. Domal analysis
X  is based on the fact that for synastry comparisons, for example, a
X  planet in Gemini and one in the 3rd house can be considered related in
X  a way similar to a conjunction.
X
X-G: Display houses based on geographic location only.
X
X  This switch generates a special type of locational analysis chart,
X  called a geodetic chart, in which the house cusps are computed from a
X  different source, i.e. as a function of only the longitude and
X  latitude. This basically gives every spot on the planet a different
X  unique set of house cusps, and can be used to analyze the
X  characteristics of different areas, and their influence on you if you
X  insert your own planets in the houses. This type of chart was
X  described in the January 1992 issue of Dell Horoscope magazine, from
X  which I learned how to generate these charts. Basically, the Midheaven
X  is approximately the longitude value converted from degrees into the
X  appropriate zodiac sign; for example 0 degrees E goes to 0 degrees
X  Aries, 30 degrees E goes to 0 degrees Taurus, etc.
X
X-+ <days>: Cast chart for specified no. of days in the future.
X
X  The -+ <#ofdays> option will cast a normal chart, but one for #ofdays in
X  the future (or past if a negative value is given). One use for this is in
X  combination with the -n and -d options. For instance, I often invoke the
X  program as "astrolog -n -d" to see the exact times of today's aspects.
X  However, just before midnight I might want to see what's going to happen
X  in the following day, so I would do "astrolog -n -d -+ 1" to see the exact
X  times for tomorrow's aspects.
X
X-- <days>: Cast chart for specified no. of days in the past.
X
X  This new "dash minus" option is just like the "dash plus" (-+) option
X  described above, except it subtracts instead of adds the specified
X  number of days from any chart cast. This is only for convenience, in
X  that "-- 1" is the same as "-+ -1".
X
X----
X
XSwitches which determine in what format the chart is displayed:
X
X-v: Display list of object positions (chosen by default).
X
X  This is just a formal specification for the standard chart listing of
X  the planetary positions. One will get this chart by default if they
X  don't specify any other chart types, and they will get it along with
X  everything else in the -e option. Although it isn't necessary, it must
X  be included if one wants this type of chart to be displayed along with
X  some of the other chart types described below.
X
X-v0: Like -v but express velocities relative to average speed.
X
X  This switch is just like -v except that it modifies the planet
X  velocities slightly. (See later for a description of these velocity
X  fields.) Normally, it isn't a trivial task to determine precisely when
X  a planet is going to change direction. This is because, for example,
X  although a velocity of 0.010 degrees/day for fast moving Mercury means
X  it's about to turn retrograde, the same velocity value is normal for
X  slow moving Pluto. The -v0 switch divides the normal velocity values
X  by how fast each planet moves with respect to the Sun, meaning that
X  all planets will now have an average *relative* velocity value of
X  1.000, and in all cases, a velocity of 2.000 means the planet is
X  moving twice as fast as normal, and one of 0.010 means the planet is
X  about to turn retrograde.
X
X-w: Display chart on screen in a graphic house wheel format.
X
X  Display of the chart in a nice wheel format is supported using the
X  '-w' switch. (Special error case: If one of the houses gets too 'full'
X  of planets, the planet will be put at the beginning of the next
X  house.) The same chart header information as is at the top of the
X  standard -v chart is printed in the middle of the wheel.
X
X-w0: Like -w but show objects in houses 4..9 in reverse order.
X
X  In the -w text wheel option, the objects in each house are printed
X  from top to bottom in order from earliest in the house to latest. This
X  looks good except for in houses 5..8 where this would appear backwards
X  (e.g. a planet having just entered the 6th house from the 5th would be
X  displayed right under the Descendant.) Therefore the objects from
X  houses 4 through 9 are reversed and printed in order from bottom to
X  top, making a more flowing looking wheel chart. If however, one always
X  wants each house to be filled from its top to bottom regardless of
X  which house, replace the -w with the -w0 switch
X
X-g: Display midpoint & aspect grid instead of positions.
X
X  Aspects and midpoint display are supported: Invoke as astrolog -g and
X  a 20x20 grid showing the midpoint locations for each planet, and
X  showing if any aspects are present and how accurate they are, is
X  displayed. The planets are labeled down the diagonal of the grid, with
X  the aspects to the lower left and the midpoints in the upper right.
X  This is of course often used along with the -A* switches.
X
X  Note that there is a way in the aspect grids to determine whether an
X  aspect is slightly short of exact or slight long of exact. If the
X  difference is displayed as "3.5" it means the aspect is 3.5 degrees
X  long of exact; if it's displayed as "3,5", the aspect is 3.5 degrees
X  short. (i.e. with a comma instead of a period; Yeah, I know that's a
X  hack, but it's useful in determining whether the exact aspect just
X  happened or is about to happen. (Note that conjuncts are always '.',
X  and oppositions always ','.)
X
X  Wider orbs are allowed for the Sun and Moon in the aspect grids.
X  Normally, only the aspect in question determines the allowed orb, but
X  the Sun and Moon will each add 1 degree to whatever the orb would have
X  been. (This excludes minor objects such as the North Node, Part of
X  Fortune, Vertex, and all the stars, for which the orbs are not allowed
X  to ever exceed two degrees.)
X
X-g0: Like -g but flag aspect configurations (e.g. Yod's) too.
X
X  Search through the aspect grid for major aspect configurations,
X  including Grand Trines, T-Squares, Grand Crosses, Yod's, Cradles, and
X  Stelliums, with the -g0 option. (In a Stellium, three objects must all
X  be conjunct with each other.) This option will produce the same aspect
X  grid that -g displays, but afterwards will go through the grid and
X  list any of these aspect configurations and what objects are forming
X  them. (Of course, to see any Yod's, one has to -A 6 or more so that
X  Inconjuncts will be included in the aspect grid.)
X
X-g0: For comparison charts, show midpoints instead of aspects.
X
X  For relationship aspect grids, the -g0 option will display a midpoint
X  grid instead of an aspect grid between the planets in the two charts
X  e.g. "-r0 chart1 chart2 -g0". (See later for descriptions of the
X  relationship charts.)
X
X-ga: Like -g but indicate applying instead of difference orbs.
X
X  Ability to determine whether an aspect is applying or separating (is
X  about to happen or just happened) is included in the -g option.
X  Normally the aspect orbs are flagged as being '+' or '-' ('.' or ','
X  in the text displays) based on whether they are greater or less than
X  the exact amount (e.g. a 91 degree Square has a +1 degree orb while a
X  89 degree one a -1 orb.) If one, however, invokes the -g option as -ga
X  instead, a negative orb will indicate an applying aspect while a
X  positive orb a separating one. (To estimate applying vs. separating,
X  the program examines the planetary positions and their relative
X  velocities at the time in question.)
X
X-Z: Display planet locations with respect to the local horizon.
X
X  The text display switch -Z prints out where each object is on the
X  local horizon in terms of altitude and azimuth. For each object, the
X  following is displayed: Its altitude on the local horizon from +90
X  degrees (straight up) to -90 degrees (straight down), and its azimuth
X  from 0..360 degrees, where 0 = due east, 90 = north, 180 = west, 270 =
X  south. To make visualizing the azimuth easier, an "azimuth vector"
X  with a N/S component and a W/E component is displayed, e.g. (1.00s
X  0.33w) means that the object is mainly south, with its true angle
X  being formed by an vector component west that's 1/3 the strength of
X  the south component, i.e. the object is about 18 degrees west of
X  south. This along with the altitude should make it easy to physically
X  point to where any planet is at any moment, making it easy to locate
X  planets in the night sky. This feature can also be used to determine
X  the times that a planet rises and sets. Also displayed are altitude
X  and azimuth differences between each object and the Sun and Moon,
X  first showing the number of degrees that the Sun/Moon is "ahead" (or
X  farther east in the zodiac) of the object in question, and then the
X  number of degrees that the Sun/Moon is above the object in question.
X  This feature can be used to roughly predict eclipses! Both the Sun and
X  Moon span about 0.5 degrees in the sky, therefore if both the azimuth
X  and altitude differences are < 0.5 (or 1.0 if the difference is
X  between the Sun and Moon themselves) then the object in question is
X  probably being occulted somewhat by the Sun/Moon. Note that there are
X  three types of planetary position displays: Right ascension and
X  declination showing the object's position with respect to the stars,
X  longitude and latitude showing where on the Earth the object is
X  straight up (as in the astro-graph zenith locations), and finally
X  azimuth and altitude showing the positions of the object relative to
X  the local horizon.
X
X-S: Display x,y,z coordinate positions of planets.
X
X  Solar system space based charts are available with the -S switch,
X  which give the astronomical positions of each planet in terms of x, y,
X  and z coordinates. Although not directly useful astrologically, it
X  does give one a good view of how the planets actually were positioned
X  at the time in question. For example, normal astrology doesn't make
X  the distinction between the four different "forms" of say, a Mercury
X  Venus Conjunction, i.e. they can either be Conjunct on the near side
X  of the Sun, Conjunct on the far side of the Sun, or one can be on one
X  side and the other on the other side. When the chart is actually
X  displayed, for each body the following information is printed: The
X  relative angle of the planet with respect to the central body, i.e.
X  its zodiac position converted to the appropriate number from 0..360.
X  This is followed by the x, y, and z coordinate positions of the
X  object, in astronomical units from the central body. The x-axis
X  increases in the direction of 0 degrees Aries (tropical zodiac), the
X  y-axis increases in the direction of 0 degrees Cancer, and the z-axis
X  is with respect to the Earth's orbit (meaning that the Sun and Earth
X  always have a z-axis value of 0.0). Finally the overall length from
X  the central body in AU is printed, which is just the diagonal as
X  indicated by the x, y, z vectors. (The Earth and Sun are of course
X  always about 1.0 AU from each other.) The Moon circles the Earth and
X  isn't a part of the solar system proper; therefore, it is never in
X  these charts. The -e everything option will include this chart in its
X  listing of all the chart displays.
X
X-I: Display interpretation of planetary influences.
X
X  Another chart type is available - interpretation of influences. This
X  is the beginning of a general interpretation ability for the program,
X  although all it does now is calculate the relative "power" of each
X  planet's placement, giving a general idea of the prominent areas of a
X  chart. When such a chart is printed, each planet is given a point
X  value, larger numbers indicating more strength. Each planet's strength
X  is divided between two fields: the positioning in and of itself, and
X  the power of the aspects it makes with the other planets. In addition
X  to each field, the total of these two areas is printed, as well as the
X  relative percentage of the planet in question with respect to all the
X  planets combined. Each planet gets a ranking for its positioning,
X  aspects, and total power as well, with the strongest getting #1, the
X  next strongest #2, etc. The -e option will include this chart along
X  with all the others as well in it's listing of all the chart displays.
X
X  To determine the strength of the positioning of a planet, various
X  things are taken into account: 1) The power of a planet in and of
X  itself, e.g. the Sun and Moon are more powerful then the other
X  planets. 2) The house placement of a planet, e.g. a planet in the 1st
X  house is more powerful than one in the 2nd. 3) Whether a planet is in
X  the sign it rules or is exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in Sag results in
X  more power to Jupiter. 4) Whether a planet is in the house
X  corresponding to the sign it rules or is exalted in, e.g. Jupiter in
X  the 9th house. 5) Planets get more power if the signs they rule are
X  occupied, e.g. a bunch of stuff in Aquarius gives more power to
X  Uranus. 6) Planets get more power if the houses they rule are
X  occupied, e.g. a bunch of stuff in the 11th house gives power to
X  Uranus. 7) Finally, planets get power according to what houses the
X  cusps of which fall in the signs they rule, i.e. the ruler of the
X  Ascendant (and to less extent the Midheaven, and so on) gets lots of
X  influence. Determining the strength of a planet's aspects is much
X  easier, and is basically composed of the sum of the strength of each
X  aspect the planet makes. Taken into account are: 1) The inherent
X  influence of the planet being aspected to, e.g. Sun conjunct Jupiter
X  gives more influence to Jupiter than Mercury conjunct Jupiter would.
X  2) The influence of the aspect itself, e.g. Oppositions are more
X  powerful then Sextiles. 3) Finally the orb of the aspect, i.e. exact
X  aspects are more powerful than wide ones. (The influence of the orb
X  varies linearly from max power at exact to zero power at the limit of
X  the orb - sorry Maggie M. and Mark K. - no complex aspect wave
X  functions, at least for this version :)
X
X  Special thanks goes to Mark K. who initially presented this idea of
X  interpreting overall influences to me. I basically just took his
X  ideas, polished them a bit, and put it into the code. Interestingly,
X  while programming this feature, I had a dream about him, in which he
X  elaborated upon some of the ideas and even gave me suggestions for
X  some of the planets' default power values (astral visitation?) And,
X  while on the subject, I've had a couple of other Astrolog dreams; I
X  had one neat one while working on the -h extension (described earlier)
X  about a far distant future version of Astrolog that could actually
X  teleport one to the places which they cast charts for :)
X
X-L [<step>]: Display astro-graph locations of planetary angles.
X
X  The '-L' option will take the standard chart information and generate
X  the astro-graph positions of the planets. In other words, this does
X  the exact same thing that Jim Lewis' Astro*Carto*Graphy maps do. It
X  will display the longitude of where on the Earth at the time in
X  question each object was on the midheaven and on the nadir, and the
X  latitude of where the planets actually appeared at zenith. Also, for
X  latitude increments of 5 degrees, the longitude of where the objects
X  appeared on the ascendant and descendant is displayed. For text
X  screens, one can pass an optional parameter to this -L (or -L0) option
X  to change the default latitude step rate at which the Ascendant and
X  Descendant lines are computed. Again, this value is by default 5
X  degrees, although one can may increase or decrease it to any integer
X  (subject to the restriction that the number 160 is divisible by it.)
X
X-L0: Like -L but display list of latitude crossings too.
X
X  Determination of latitude crossing points is included in the
X  astro-graph routines! The -L0 option will do the same thing as the -L
X  option, except that after displaying the longitude and latitude
X  locations of the Asc/Desc/MC/IC lines, it will then search among the
X  lines and display (in order from farthest North to farthest South) the
X  latitude of any points where lines cross each other. This includes the
X  curvey Asc/Desc lines crossing the straight MC/IC lines as well as
X  cases where different Asc/Desc lines cross themselves. And unlike Jim
X  Lewis' astro*carto*graphy, Astrolog will also display the longitude of
X  the crossing (useful for Asc/Desc crossings) in addition to the
X  latitude (as well allowing more planetary bodies to be included in the
X  scan, and going farther North and South than Jim Lewis' printouts go.)
X  Note however, that there is presently a small (very rare) minor
X  omission glitch in the code, where if a crossing is within a couple of
X  degrees of 180 deg W/E, it may not be displayed.
X
X-d: Print all aspects and changes occurring in a day.
X
X  The '-d' option will take the standard chart information, and for the
X  day in question, display the exact times of all aspects that occur.
X  This is just like the aspects-per-day as displayed in Jim Maynard's
X  Celestial Guide books. (Displayed in local time as defined by the
X  default zone, with accuracy to within a couple minutes.) This will
X  tell any time two planets make aspects with each other, a planet
X  changes its sign, or a planet goes retrograde or direct. Both the -d
X  (and -T listed later) options will display the signs that any planets
X  aspecting each other are in, in addition to the aspect itself (e.g.
X  instead of just "Jupiter Tri Uranus", we have "Jupiter (Vir) Tri (Cap)
X  Uranus". If a particular object is going retrograde, then its sign
X  will be displayed in brackets instead of parentheses, and if a
X  particular object is about to or has just gone retrograde or direct,
X  then its sign will be in <>'s.
X
X-d0: Like -d but print all aspects for the entire month.
X
X  The -d option can now search the entire month for aspects between
X  planets if one so desires. Specifying it as -d0 instead of just -d
X  will go through the entire month instead of just the current day.
X  (Combining this one with -R allows searching for important aspects,
X  sign changes, etc.)
X
X-dp <month> <year>: Print aspects within progressed chart.
X
X  Another progression feature allows determining aspect times of
X  progressed planets among themselves. The -i <file> -dp <month> <year>
X  switch will, like the -d option, display times of aspects and sign
X  changes, except that they will be for the chart in file, progressed
X  throughout the month specified. Progressed planets move very slowly
X  ("year for a day") so therefore there will usually be, if any, only a
X  couple of aspects in a given month; again, one might want to
X  substitute '0' for the month to scan the whole year. Also, since they
X  move so slow, the accuracy is cut down, do the dates given are
X  probably only accurate to the nearest day, in spite of the times given
X  to the minute. Note that Astrolog can scan for aspects of: transiting
X  planets among themselves (-d switch), transiting planets to natal
X  planets (-T switch), progressed planets to natal planets (-Tp), and
X  progressed planets among themselves (-dp). Only thing Astrolog can't
X  do is do progressed planets to transiting planets, although that may
X  change in the next version :)
X
X-e: Print all options for chart (i.e. normal & -w0-g0-Z-L0-d). There
X
X  are five main different formats of chart display available: The
X  standard listing of planet positions, which you get without any
X  switches; the aspect/midpoint grid you get with '-g', the house wheel
X  you get with '-w', and so on. The -e "everything" option will display
X  the chart in all five of these formats for about 650 lines of text!
X
X----
X
XSwitches which affect how the chart parameters are obtained:
X
X-n: Compute chart for this exact moment using current time.
X
X  For those with unix systems who can handle the time calls (If your
X  system pukes on trying to compile that, simply comment out the #define
X  TIME line at the beginning), the program supports displaying the chart
X  for the time at the current moment! In other words, invoke as astrolog
X  -n and see where the planets are right now. (This is fun - the house
X  cusps change 1' about every 4 seconds!) You will need to change the
X  #defines for the default longitude and latitude in astrolog.h, or else
X  specify where you are explicitly by using the -l switch to change the
X  default location. (To figure out the time zone, the program uses the
X  default value as in the DEFAULT_ZONE constant set at compile time.)
X
X-a <month> <date> <year> <time> <zone> <long> <lat>:
XCompute chart automatically given specified data.
X
X  Normally one generates a chart by entering the seven data coordinates
X  manually. A fast typist familiar with the program might prefer to give
X  all the data at once, which can be done with this option. Simply list
X  the seven parameters above, in the exact format as they would be given
X  to the program were the user being prompted for them.
X
X-z <zone>: Change the default time zone (for -d-q-T-E options).
X
X  The -z <value> option can be used to change the default time zone to
X  the value in question. For example, you can force the -E ephemeris and
X  -T transits to be displayed at midnight GMT time instead of the local
X  time with -z 0; or, for the East coast where by default the time zone
X  is "5", you can do -z 4 during DST to properly display transits,
X  aspects in day, and other lists in the local DST zone.
X
X-z: Assume Daylight time (change default zone appropriately).
X
X  Normally the -z option takes an argument which will then become the
X  default time zone. If one, however, invokes it by itself, it will
X  subtract one hour from whatever the default time zone presently is.
X  This is useful since it is equivalent to adjusting any times printed
X  to Daylight time, i.e. it will add one hour to any times displayed.
X  (When entering the birth time for charts, one is supposed to subtract
X  one hour if Daylight time was in effect; note that subtracting one
X  hour from the time zone will do the same thing.) For example, over
X  here on the West Coast, I have my default time zone compiled to be
X  "8"; now that Daylight time is in effect here, I can do -z 7 or just
X  -z to decrease the default time zone when I make a -T transit list,
X  which will in effect add one hour to the local times displayed, or in
X  effect "Spring ahead" the clock for me. (For a better way of adjusting
X  Astrolog for Daylight time without having to specify -z all the time,
X  recompile the program, or add one hour to the times in your head, use
X  the "defaults" file described later to edit the time zone.) Remember
X  that the -z (and -l) switches must be before any other switches they
X  modify (such as -n) in order for the new default to take effect.
X
X-l <long> <lat>: Change the default longitude & latitude.
X
X  Like the -z option, the -l option can be used to change the default
X  compile time global coordinates used in certain options, such as the
X  -n cast chart for right now switch.
X
X-q <month> <date> <year>: Compute chart for noon on date.
X
X  The -q <month> <day> <year> option can be used to cast a quick chart
X  for 12 noon on a particular date, using the default longitude and
X  latitude. The DEFAULT_ZONE compile time constant is used for the time
X  zone. Again, one example where this is useful is with the -d option,
X  e.g. to see the times of exact aspects on a particular date, like your
X  next birthday, your finals, etc.
X
X-q0 <month> <date> <year> <time>: Like -q but include time too.
X
X  The -q0 <month> <date> <year> <time> option takes the four parameters
X  and casts a chart for the time in question. The time zone and location
X  are taken from the default compiled values. This is just yet another
X  useful shorthand way to quickly make a chart. Note that this is just
X  like the -q <month> <date> <year> option except that -q always casts
X  it for noon in the default zone. Also note that the -a option which
X  takes all seven chart parameters can be duplicated with -q0 along with
X  the -z <zone> and -l <long> <lat> options.
X
X-i <file>: Compute chart based on info in file.
X
X  See the -o option below.
X
X-o <file> [..]: Write parameters of current chart to file.
X
X  The program supports directing chart information to, and reading
X  output from, data files. The '-o' option will dump all the birth data
X  (the date and stuff, not the planet positions) to the specified file.
X  The '-i' option will cast the chart based on the info in the file.
X  (This allows you to put your birth data into a specific file, and cast
X  your chart whenever you want to after that without having to reenter
X  your birth data all the time.)
X
X  Another file output feature, the ability to concatenate "comment
X  lines" at the end of a data file, been been added to both the -o and
X  -o0 options. (Some people have complained that the info in the
X  Astrolog chart files are too cryptic.) After scanning the filename,
X  the -o[0] option will then write any parameter that follows it at the
X  end of the file, until a parameter beginning with a '-' (the next
X  switch) is reached. For example: -o 'file' "Walter D. Pullen" Seattle
X  will add my name and my birth city in two separate lines at the end of
X  'file'. (In unix, quotes can be used to allow spaces within one
X  parameter.)
X
X-o0 <file> [..]: Like -o but output planet/house positions.
X
X  Ability to write the actual sign and house positions of a chart to
X  a file (instead of just the time and place) has been implemented via
X  the -o0 <file> option. This option can be used interchangeably with
X  the old -o output to file switch. The information written includes the
X  zodiac position of the 20 main objects, their retrograde status and
X  declination, as well as the positions of the (first six) house cusps.
X  This file information can easily be passed into another program, and
X  can be read back into Astrolog with the -i option. The -i option will
X  automatically determine which type the file is, and will either use
X  the given positions, or else calculate them as needed (note that some
X  switches, such as the -c house system selection, will have no effect
X  for this new file type.) Check an example of one of these files to see
X  the precise format (a zodiac position is recorded as three numbers:
X  degree in sign, sign as 1..12, and floating point minute within
X  degree.) When the files are read back in, they will be flagged as
X  "having no space or time" like the composite charts in the chart
X  header displays.
X
X  This file format can allow one to do things such as transits to
X  composite charts (send the composite chart to file with -o0 option and
X  then use that file as the first parameter to the -T option) composites
X  between two composite charts (use -rc between two composite charts
X  sent to a file) and even, if one is willing to do a small amount of
X  editing, to do transits to midpoints or the 0 degrees Aries point.
X  Note that one can easily edit the positions in the -o0 position file
X  to be whatever they like, so one could replace some unimportant object
X  (like the vertex) with 0 degrees Aries or an important midpoint value.
X  Note that trying to still use the -o time and space output with an
X  output chart that doesn't have space/time will confuse the program; it
X  will either say it can't make the file or else will output the
X  time/space of the most recent parameter file it read in.
X
X----
X
XOther features or major modes:
X
X-r <file1> <file2>: Compute a relationship chart.
X
X  Computing the relationship between two charts is supported. Invoke the
X  program as 'astrolog -r <file_of_person1> <file_of_person2>' and the
X  program will give you the relationship between the two charts. In
X  other words, the program will use the positions of person2's planets
X  and person1's houses. Use this with the -w option to get a wheel chart
X  and you can do synastry. Note that transits can be computed with this
X  by comparing your chart with the positions of the planets at the
X  current moment (as in -n switch). To make this easier, you may specify
X  the filename "now" for any file and the computer will use the current
X  planet positions instead of looking for a like named file. (e.g.
X  'astrolog -r me now' will compute transits for file 'me'.)
X
X-rc <file1> <file2>: Compute a composite chart.
X
X  The '-r' option can be used to generate composite relationship charts.
X  Simply invoke it as '-rc <person1> <person2>' instead of just -r and a
X  composite chart (i.e. composed of the midpoints of the planets, etc.
X  of the two charts in question) will be generated.
X
X-rm <file1> <file2>: Compute a time space midpoint chart.
X
X  Time-space midpoint relationship charts are supported: Doing "-rm
X  chart1 chart2" will calculate the time and location exactly half way
X  between the times and locations as indicated in the two files. Unlike
X  all other types of relationship charts, this one actually exists in
X  space and time, and therefore can be treated like a single chart and
X  can be output to a file with the -o option.
X
X-r0 <file1> <file2>: Keep the charts separate in comparison.
X
X  There is of course a distinction between synastry relationship charts
X  and the actual comparison between two separate charts. The -r0 option
X  is used to generate actual comparison charts. For example, combining
X  -r0 with the -g switch will cause a full grid chart of the aspects
X  between all the planets of the two charts (with person1's planets on
X  the vertical axis and person2's on the horizontal) to be displayed.
X  (Unfortunately, if all 20 of the default objects are left unrestricted
X  here, the grid will exceed 80 columns.) The -r0 option can also be
X  used with the -X switch to generate true relationship wheel charts,
X  (described later). The -r0 option will act like the -r synastry option
X  in certain displays that can't compare two charts; for example, '-r0
X  -v' will act the same as just '-r -v'. (Note: the "-t file" current
X  transit option is basically a shorthand way of doing "-r0 file now".)
X
X-t <file>: Compute current house transits for particular chart.
X
X  The command switch '-t <file>' can be used as a shortcut way to
X  compute the current transits for the chart in <file>. (Saves you from
X  having to mention the 'now' in the '-r0' option.)
X
X-T <file> <month> <year>: Compute all transits in month for chart.
X
X  The '-T <file> <month> <year>' option will scan the entire month
X  specified, and print out any transits that happen, in that month, to
X  the planets as listed in the specified <file>. There will be quite a
X  few, even though fast moving objects like the moon aren't looked at,
X  so you might want to use this with the -R option to limit this to just
X  certain planets. (The times are displayed in the local time zone, and
X  are generally accurate to within a half hour or so; Try doing it for
X  your birth month and your own chart - All planets should conjunct
X  their natal positions at about the time of your birth.) Putting a zero
X  in place of the month will cause the entire year to be scanned, which
X  prevents one from having to search each month in turn if they are
X  looking for something in particular. Note that the -T option includes
X  ALL of one's natal house cusps in the transit scans (instead of just
X  the Asc and MC). The 11th, 12th, 2nd, and 3rd cusps are included (and
X  oppositions to these and the Asc/MC can be used to to determine
X  aspects to the other six cusps.)
X
X-T0 <..>: Like -T but include transits of the Moon as well.
X
X  Normally the -T option always ignores the moon and does not include
X  the transiting moon in the lists because it moves so fast and would
X  cause an enormous amount of info. Still, if you are looking for lunar
X  transits, specifying the option as -T0 instead of just -T will include
X  the moon.
X
X-Tp <file> <month> <year>: Compute all progressions in month for chart.
X
X  Determining dates of transits of progressed planets to natal planets
X  can be done with the -Tp <file> <month> <year> option. This is just
X  like the -T option, except that the exact aspects of progressed
X  planets (rather than transiting planets) to the planets in 'file' are
X  displayed. Again, one can substitute '0' for the month to scan the
X  entire year (which might be desirable since progressions occur much
X  less often than transits, and there will only be a few, if any, in a
X  given month.)
X
X-E <month> <year>: Display ephemeris for given month.
X
X  The '-E <month> <year>' option will generate a quick ephemeris for the
X  ten main bodies for the month in question, useful if you just want to
X  see what's happening this month in the sky. It generally is used by
X  itself and not with any other options. (Displayed daily for midnight,
X  default time.) Any dots after a planet location in the list indicate
X  the planet was retrograde at the time. The -E <month> <year> ephemeris
X  option can also be used to display the ephemeris for the entire year
X  instead of just for one month. Like the -T option, putting a '0' for
X  the month will give the entire year's ephemeris.
X
X-E0 <..>: Like -E but include Chiron and the asteroids as well.
X
X  The -E option can also display the Asteroids, Chiron, and the Node in
X  the ephemeris listing if one invokes it as -E0 instead of just -E.
X  Note however that this will make each line more than 80 columns, so
X  this is mainly just for printing purposes.
