This is the fifth official patch to ncftp 1.5.  This patch fixes 
one damn bug introduced in the 1.5.4 patch.

As usual, you'll need the sources with all the previous patches applied
for this to work.
 
There are supposed to be tabs in this patch. Make sure your newsreader isn't
converting them to spaces; if you have problems you may want to check to see
if your 'patch' program can handle munged tabs (like patch -l, perhaps).
 
I'll put up the whole 1.5.5 distribution up for ftp as:
  cse.unl.edu:/pub/mgleason/ncftp155.tar.z
Don't call during business hours -- you won't be able to download it.
