Patch-To: ncftp: Volume 39, Issue 53-57

This is the first official patch to ncftp 1.5, posted last week.  This
patch fixes some bugs and adds a little portability.

I will put up the fully-patched version up for ftp sometime after Sept. 5.

/* v1.5.1 - August 29, 1993
 *  Bugs fixed in termcap code, mput, and pwd.  No longer adding blank
 *  lines to readline's history.  Netrc site abbreviations were matched
 *  by strncmp() when it should have been strstr().  Bug fixed in
 *  open's site "menu."  Revised tips a little to encourage .ncftprc instead
 *  of .netrc.  TRY_ABOR documented in the README.  Added stuff to the
 *  DYNIX entry.  Hacks added for SCO322.  Shortened bargraph prog meter
 *  by one char.  Better compat with getline.  Man page fixed by DWS again :)
