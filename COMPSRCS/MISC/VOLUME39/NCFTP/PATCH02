This is the second official patch to ncftp 1.5. 

This patch fixes another termcap problem where boldface, etc, were not getting
turned off correctly, and fixes a bug in the .netrc parsing code.

NcFTP 1.5.0 was posted last week to comp.sources.misc; you'll need that
code with patch 1 applied for this patch to work.

        gcc (set CC=gcc in the Makefile), or acc (set CC=acc).
        The regular 'cc' is not an ANSI compiler.  You could also run
        something like 'ansi2knr' on the sources and hope it works.
+ 	  You will probably need to link both the curses and termcap
+ 	  libraries if you use -DCURSES (see below).
  
      Hewlett-Packard HP-UX:  If you have 7.0, you'll need to find
        a copy of <ftp.h> from somewhere (8.0 has it though). Then

  *   -DCURSES:  Uses curses library to display boldface, underline, etc.
      By default ncftp uses hard-coded ANSI escapes (^[[1m etc.) to
      save the 100k or so the curses library adds.  You will also need
!     to edit the LIBS line in the Makefile to add -lcurses.
  
  *   -DSYSLOG:  Define this to have ncftp log connections and transfers
      to the syslog.
