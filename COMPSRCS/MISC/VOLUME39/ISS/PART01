Internet Security Scanner (ISS) is one of the first multi-level security
scanners available to the public.  It was designed to be flexible and easily
portable to many unix platforms and do its job in a reasonable amount of
time.  It provides information to the administrator that will fix obvious
security misconfigurations. 

ISS does a multi-level scan of security, not just searching for one
weakness in the system.  To provide this to the public or at least to the
security conscious crowd may cause people to think that it is too dangerous
for the public, but many of the (cr/h)ackers are already aware of these
security holes and know how to exploit them. 

These security holes are not deep in some OS routines, but standard
misconfigurations that many domains on Internet tend to show.  Many of these
holes are warned about in CERT and CIAC advisories.  This is the first
release of ISS and there is still much room for improvement. 

ISS will quickly scan the domain. It does not try to connect to every
address, but rather scans through doing a name lookup for each address.  And
if that address has a name, it will then do a more thorough lookup of
information on that host. With the -q option, it will try to connect to hosts
even without names.  

To sum it up, ISS will scan a domain grabbing essential information for
administrators to easily sort through and give them a chance to secure the
open machines on their network.

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I ISS
XInternet Security Scanner (
X.I ISS
X) is one of the first multi-level security
Xscanners available to the public.  It was designed to be flexible and easily
Xportable to many unix platforms and do its job in a reasonable amount of
Xtime.  It provides information to the administrator that will fix obvious
Xsecurity misconfigurations. 
X.PP
X.I ISS
Xdoes a multi-level scan of security, not just searching for one
Xweakness in the system.  To provide this to the public or at least to the
Xsecurity conscious crowd may cause people to think that it is too dangerous
Xfor the public, but many of the (cr/h)ackers are already aware of these
Xsecurity holes and know how to exploit them. 
X.PP
XThese security holes are not deep in some OS routines, but standard
Xmisconfigurations that many domains on Internet tend to show.  Many of these
Xholes are warned about in CERT and CIAC advisories.  This is the first
Xrelease of 
X.I ISS 
Xand there is still much room for improvement. 
X.PP
X.I ISS
Xis a project that I started as I became interested in security.  As I
Xheard about (cr/h)ackers breaking into NASA and universities around the
Xworld, I wanted to find out the deep secrets of security and how these people
Xwere able to gain access to expensive machines that I would think were
Xsecure.  I searched Internet for relative information, such as Phrack and
XCERT advisories. 
X.PP
XMost information was vague and did not explain how intruders were able to
Xgain access to most systems.  At most the information told administrators to
Xmake password security tighter and to apply the vendor's security patches. 
XThey lacked real information on how an intruder would look at a site to try
Xto gain access.  Having talked with security experts and reading CERT
Xadvisories, I started trying to look for various security holes within my
Xdomain.
X.PP
XTo my surprise, I noticed that many of machines were adequately secured,
Xbut within a domain there remained enough machines with obvious holes that
Xanyone wanted into any machine could attack the weak 'trusted' machine and
Xfrom there could gain access to the rest of the domain. From this project, I
Xhave not learned any new deep secret to cracking systems, but with the right
Xtools that most domains on Internet are insecure.  These holes will not be a
Xsurprise to any advanced intruder, but with this tool administrators will be
Xable to quickly search for obvious holes and prepare to fix them.

X.SH OPTIONS
X.TP
X.B \-d
XIgnores Checking Default Logins such as sync.
X.TP
X.B \-m
XIgnores checking for mail port.
X.TP
X.B \-s
Xxx number of seconds max to wait.
X.TP
X.B \-r
XIgnores Checking for RPC calls.
X.TP
X.B \-y
XTry to get pw via Ypx.
X.TP
X.B \-v
XIgnores finding Mail Aliases for decode, guest, bbs, lp.
X.TP
X.B \-p
XScans one Host for all open TCP ports (disables all other options).
X.TP
X.B \-q
XTurns off Quick Scan so it finds hosts even with no name.
X.TP
X.B \-e
XOnly logs directories that can be mounted by everyone.
X.TP
X.B \-f
XIgnores Checking FTP port for logging in as anonymous.
X.PP
X#1 and #2 are the 1st and 2nd octect of the domain address.
X#3 and #4 are the low and high range of the 3rd octet of the addresses to
Xof machines to scan. (ie. 128 128 1 255 will scan all hosts
Xfrom 128.128.1.0 to 128.128.255.255) The fourth octet automatically
Xscans from 1 to 255.
X.PP
X.I ISS
Xwill scan a domain sequentially looking for connections.  When it finds
Xa host it will try to connect to various ports.  For starters, it tries the
Xtelnet port. When it connects to the telnet port, it logs any information
Xthat the host displays.  
X.PP
XWith the -d option, 
X.I ISS
Xignores trying default accounts.  By default,
X.I ISS
Xwill then try to log in as 'sync' which is a common account name for
XSunOS and other Unixes.  It in itself is not a big hole other than giving
Xmore information about type of OS, version number of OS, and  displaying the
XMOTD.   But 'sync' with no password can become a security hole as someone
Xwith a regular account on that host can divert the 'sync' privileges and
Xultimately become root.  The 'sync' account should be passworded or disabled.
X.PP
XWith the -m option, 
X.I ISS
Xignores the mail port. By default, 
X.I ISS
Xtries the
Xmail port. Connecting to this provides information regarding the hostname,
Xtype of OS it is, and even the version number of sendmail. 
X.PP
XWith the -v option, 
X.I ISS
Xwont check for mail aliases. By default, it will
Xcheck for various users and aliases.  The obvious aliases to search for is
Xdecode and uudecode.  With these aliases, you are able to send mail to
Xdecode@hostname with a file that has been uuencoded to overwrite a systems
Xfile, such as .rhosts.  Some of the users it looks for is 'bbs','guest','lp',
Xand the well known debug and wiz backdoors within sendmail.  'bbs','guest',
Xand 'lp' are known to have weak passwords or no passwords at all.
X.PP
XWith the -f option, 
X.I ISS
Xwont check the FTP port. By default, it will
Xconnect to the ftp port and check to see if a person can log into anonymous. 
XMany systems such as Macs let anyone log in and look around other users'
Xprivate information.  If it succeeds logging in as anonymous, it will then
Xattempt to create a directory.  If it does that successfully, the main
Xdirectory of the FTP site is writeable and open to attack.  Many anonymous
Xftp sites have security holes.  Such weaknesses is being able to write to the
Xmain directory of the ftp directory, thus an intruder could write a .rhost
Xfile and log in as ftp.  Plus, the anonymous ftp site may contain the actual
Xhost's password file and not just a dummy password file. 
X.PP
XWith the -r option, 
X.I ISS
Xignores checking for rpc. By default, 
X.I ISS
Xwill look
Xfor holes that most systems are more prone to have open.  It uses rpc
Xinformation to find security weaknesses.  It will do a 'rpcinfo -p hostname'.
XWith this information gained, it finds which hosts are running NIS, rexd,
Xbootparam, whose on the host, selection_svc, and NFS. 
X.PP
XIf a system shows YPServ, it is likely that it has not been patched yet and
Xwith the proper domainname, ypserv will provide the password file to any
Xremote host asking for it.  To fix this, apply the proper ypserv patch from
Xyour vendor.  
X.I ISS
Xwill attempt to guess the domainname and that will provide
Xinformation as to which machine is the NIS server is.   The domainname should
Xbe changed if it can easily be guessed so that it will slow people from
Xgrabbing the password file.  Another attempt to fix this problem is
Xto make sure that if the password file does get out, none of the
Xpasswords can easily be cracked.  Crack (by Alec Muffett alecm@sun.com) does
Xa fine job of finding weak passwords. Also shadowing the password file will
Xhelp correct this weakness.
X.PP
XWith the -y option and a program called Ypx (by Rob Nautu
Xrob@wzv.win.tue.nl), 
X.I ISS
Xwill try to grab the password file from ypserv.
X.PP
XIf a system shows Select_svr, selection_svr is running on the machine and
Xthere are known holes that let anyone remotely grab the password file.
XSelection_svr should be disabled.
X.PP
XWhen Rexd is running on a remote system, anyone with a small C program can
Xemulate the 'on' command spoofing any user on the remote machine, thus
Xgaining access to the password file and adding .rhosts files. Rexd should be
Xdisabled.
X.PP
XIf a machine is running Bootparam, it is likely a server to diskless
Xclients.  One problem with bootparam is that if it is running and someone
Xcan guess which machines the client and servers are, they are able to get
Xthe domainname from bootparam, which goes back to the YPServ problem.   
X.PP
XThe -e option will only log exports that everyone can mount.  To
Xusually find out which machines are its clients, by default, log all the
Xexportable directories.  'showmount -e hostname' shows the exports on a
Xremote host.  If the exported directories look like:
X.RS
X.nf
X
X	/usr 		   (everyone)
X	/export/placebo    placebo
X	/export/spiff      spiff
X.fi
X.RE
X.PP
XAnyone can mount /usr and possible replace files and do other damage.
XPlacebo and spiff appear to be clients to this server.
X.PP
X.I ISS
Xalso does a 'rusers -l hostname' searching for users on the system.
XThat provides how busy is the machine and possible login entries to try.
X.PP
X.I ISS
Xwith option -p will support scanning all the ports on a certain host,
Xthus looking for possible access entries, such as gophers, muds, and other
Xapplications ran by local users.  This has not been implemented yet.
X.PP
X.I ISS
Xwill quickly scan the domain. It does not try to connect to every
Xaddress, but rather scans through doing a name lookup for each address.  And
Xif that address has a name, it will then do a more thorough lookup of
Xinformation on that host. With the -q option, it will try to connect to hosts
Xeven without names.  
X.PP
XTo sum it up, 
X.I ISS
Xwill scan a domain grabbing essential information for
Xadministrators to easily sort through and give him a chance to secure the
Xopen machines on his network.

X
X
X  Internet Security Scanner (ISS) is one of the first multi-level security
Xscanners available to the public.  It was designed to be flexible and easily
Xportable to many unix platforms and do its job in a reasonable amount of
Xtime.  It provides information to the administrator that will fix obvious
Xsecurity misconfigurations. 
X
X  ISS does a multi-level scan of security, not just searching for one
Xweakness in the system.  To provide this to the public or at least to the
Xsecurity conscious crowd may cause people to think that it is too dangerous
Xfor the public, but many of the (cr/h)ackers are already aware of these
Xsecurity holes and know how to exploit them. 
X
X  These security holes are not deep in some OS routines, but standard
Xmisconfigurations that many domains on Internet tend to show.  Many of these
Xholes are warned about in CERT and CIAC advisories.  This is the first
Xrelease of ISS and there is still much room for improvement. 
X
X  ISS is a project that I started as I became interested in security.  As I
Xheard about (cr/h)ackers breaking into NASA and universities around the
Xworld, I wanted to find out the deep secrets of security and how these people
Xwere able to gain access to expensive machines that I would think were
Xsecure.  I searched Internet for relative information, such as Phrack and
XCERT advisories. 
X
X  Most information was vague and did not explain how intruders were able to
Xgain access to most systems.  At most the information told administrators to
Xmake password security tighter and to apply the vendor's security patches. 
XThey lacked real information on how an intruder would look at a site to try
Xto gain access.  Having talked with security experts and reading CERT
Xadvisories, I started trying to look for various security holes within my
Xdomain.
X
X  To my surprise, I noticed that many of machines were adequately secured,
Xbut within a domain there remained enough machines with obvious holes that
Xanyone wanted into any machine could attack the weak 'trusted' machine and
Xfrom there could gain access to the rest of the domain. From this project, I
Xhave not learned any new deep secret to cracking systems, but with the right
Xtools that most domains on Internet are insecure.  These holes will not be a
Xsurprise to any advanced intruder, but with this tool administrators will be
Xable to quickly search for obvious holes and prepare to fix them.
X
X  ISS will scan a domain sequentially looking for connections.  When it finds
Xa host it will try to connect to various ports.  For starters, it tries the
Xtelnet port. When it connects to the telnet port, it logs any information
Xthat the host displays.  
X
X	With the -d option, ISS ignores trying default accounts.  By default,
XISS will then try to log in as 'sync' which is a common account name for
XSunOS and other Unixes.  It in itself is not a big hole other than giving
Xmore information about type of OS, version number of OS, and  displaying the
XMOTD.   But 'sync' with no password can become a security hole as someone
Xwith a regular account on that host can divert the 'sync' privileges and
Xultimately become root.  The 'sync' account should be passworded or disabled.
X
X  With the -m option, ISS ignores the mail port. By default, ISS tries the
Xmail port. Connecting to this provides information regarding the hostname,
Xtype of OS it is, and even the version number of sendmail. 
X
X  With the -v option, ISS wont check for mail aliases. By default, it will
Xcheck for various users and aliases.  The obvious aliases to search for is
Xdecode and uudecode.  With these aliases, you are able to send mail to
Xdecode@hostname with a file that has been uuencoded to overwrite a systems
Xfile, such as .rhosts.  Some of the users it looks for is 'bbs','guest','lp',
Xand the well known debug and wiz backdoors within sendmail.  'bbs','guest',
Xand 'lp' are known to have weak passwords or no passwords at all.
X
X  With the -f option, ISS wont check the FTP port. By default, it will
Xconnect to the ftp port and check to see if a person can log into anonymous. 
XMany systems such as Macs let anyone log in and look around other users'
Xprivate information.  If it succeeds logging in as anonymous, it will then
Xattempt to create a directory.  If it does that successfully, the main
Xdirectory of the FTP site is writeable and open to attack.  Many anonymous
Xftp sites have security holes.  Such weaknesses is being able to write to the
Xmain directory of the ftp directory, thus an intruder could write a .rhost
Xfile and log in as ftp.  Plus, the anonymous ftp site may contain the actual
Xhost's password file and not just a dummy password file. 
X
X  With the -r option, ISS ignores checking for rpc. By default, ISS will look
Xfor holes that most systems are more prone to have open.  It uses rpc
Xinformation to find security weaknesses.  It will do a 'rpcinfo -p hostname'.
X With this information gained, it finds which hosts are running NIS, rexd,
Xbootparam, whose on the host, selection_svc, and NFS. 
X
X  If a system shows YPServ, it is likely that it has not been patched yet and
Xwith the proper domainname, ypserv will provide the password file to any
Xremote host asking for it.  To fix this, apply the proper ypserv patch from
Xyour vendor.  ISS will attempt to guess the domainname and that will provide
Xinformation as to which machine is the NIS server is.   The domainname should
Xbe changed if it can easily be guessed so that it will slow people from
Xgrabbing the password file.  Another attempt to fix this problem is
Xto make sure that if the password file does get out, none of the
Xpasswords can easily be cracked.  Crack (by Alec Muffett alecm@sun.com) does
Xa fine job of finding weak passwords. Also shadowing the password file will
Xhelp correct this weakness.
X
X  With the -y option and a program called Ypx (by Rob Nautu
Xrob@wzv.win.tue.nl), ISS will try to grab the password file from ypserv.
X
X  If a system shows Select_svr, selection_svr is running on the machine and
Xthere are known holes that let anyone remotely grab the password file.
XSelection_svr should be disabled.
X
X  When Rexd is running on a remote system, anyone with a small C program can
Xemulate the 'on' command spoofing any user on the remote machine, thus
Xgaining access to the password file and adding .rhosts files. Rexd should be
Xdisabled.
X
X  If a machine is running Bootparam, it is likely a server to diskless
Xclients.  One problem with bootparam is that if it is running and someone
Xcan guess which machines the client and servers are, they are able to get
Xthe domainname from bootparam, which goes back to the YPServ problem.   
X
X  The -e option will only log exports that everyone can mount.  To
Xusually find out which machines are its clients, by default, log all the
Xexportable directories.  'showmount -e hostname' shows the exports on a
Xremote host.  If the exported directories look like:
X
X	/usr 		   (everyone)
X	/export/placebo    placebo
X	/export/spiff      spiff
X
X  Anyone can mount /usr and possible replace files and do other damage.
XPlacebo and spiff appear to be clients to this server.
X
X  ISS also does a 'rusers -l hostname' searching for users on the system.
XThat provides how busy is the machine and possible login entries to try.
X
X  ISS with option -p will support scanning all the ports on a certain host,
Xthus looking for possible access entries, such as gophers, muds, and other
Xapplications ran by local users.  This has not been implemented yet.
X
X  ISS will quickly scan the domain. It does not try to connect to every
Xaddress, but rather scans through doing a name lookup for each address.  And
Xif that address has a name, it will then do a more thorough lookup of
Xinformation on that host. With the -q option, it will try to connect to hosts
Xeven without names.  
X
X To sum it up, ISS will scan a domain grabbing essential information for
Xadministrators to easily sort through and give him a chance to secure the
Xopen machines on his network.
