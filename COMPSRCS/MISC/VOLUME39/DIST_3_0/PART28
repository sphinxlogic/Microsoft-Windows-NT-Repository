XHere are some known bugs that I plan to fix soon.
X
X+ Patname ought to ask for a log message for the symbolic number.
X
X+ A unit name is always wanted by Configure. Hence in a unit d_waitpid, if
Xyou write:
X
X	@if WAITPID || d_waitpid
X	.....
X	@end
X
Xthen the <....> part of the code will always be loaded even if no shell
Xscript references d_waitpid or C code references WAITPID.
X
X+ When a patch is issued and is split in more than one file, the temporary
Xfiles left in the bugs/ subdirectory will not be cleaned-up properly the
Xnext time a patch is issued.
