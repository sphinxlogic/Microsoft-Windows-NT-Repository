This menu is accessed by pressing '^K' at the group and page levels. It
allows the user to kill an article that matches the current Subject:
line, From: line or a string entered by the user. The user entered string
can be applied to the Subject: or From: lines of an article. The kill
description can be limited to the current newsgroup or it can apply to all newsgroups.
Once entered the user can abort the command and not save the kill
description, edit the kill file or save the kill description.
.PP
On starting tin the users killfile \fI$HOME/.tin/kill\fP is read and
on entering a newsgroup any kill descriptions are applied. Articles
that match a kill description are marked killed and are not displayed.
.PP
The 'Kill articles' option needs to be set ON in the Options Menu
(selected by 'M' at any level) to activate this command.
.SH "POSTING ARTICLES"
Tin allows posting of articles, follow-up to already posted articles
and replying direct through mail to the author of an article.
.PP
Use the 'w' command to post an article to a newsgroup. After entering
the post subject the default editor (ie. vi) or the editor specified
by the $VISUAL environment variable will be started and the article can
be entered. To crosspost articles simply add a comma and the name of
the newsgroup(s) to the end of the Newsgroups: line at the beginning of
the article. After saving and exiting the editor you are asked if you
wish to a)bort posting the article, e)dit the article again or p)ost
the article to the specified newsgroup(s).
.PP
Use the 'W' command to display a history of the articles you have posted.
The date the article was posted, which newsgroups the article was
posted to and the articles subject line are displayed.
.PP
Use the 'f' / 'F' command to post a follow-up article to an already
posted article. The 'F' command will copy the text of the original
article into the editor. The editing procedure is the same as when
posting an article with the 'w' command.
.PP
Use the 'r' / 'R' command to reply direct through mail to the author
of an already posted article. The 'R' command will copy the text of
the original article into the editor. The editing procedure is the
same as when posting an article with the 'w' command. After saving
and exiting the editor you are asked if you wish to a)bort sending
the article, e)dit the article again or s)end the article to the
author.
.SH "MAILING PIPING PRINTING AND SAVING ARTICLES"
The command interface to mail ('m'), pipe ('|'), print ('o') and save
('s') articles is the same for ease of use.
.PP
The initial command will ask you to select which a)rticle, t)hread,
r)egex pattern, t)agged articles you wish to mail, pipe etc.
.PP
Tagged articles must have already been tagged with the 'T' command.
All tagged articles can be untagged by the 'U' untag command.
.PP
If regex pattern matching is selected you are asked to enter a regular
expression (ie. to match all articles subject lines containing 'net News'
you must enter '*net News*'). Any articles that match the
entered expression will be mailed, piped etc.
.PP
To save articles to a mailbox with the name of the current newsgroup
(ie. Alt.sources) enter '=' or '=<mailbox name>' when asked for the
save filename.
.PP
To save articles in <newsgroup name>/<filename> format enter '+<filename>'.
.PP
When saving articles you can specify whether the saved files should be
post processed (ie. unshar shell archive, uudecode multiple parts etc).
A default process type can be set by the 'Process type:' in the 'M'
options menu.
.SH AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS
Tin allows new/unread news articles to be mailed (-M option)/saved
(-S option) in batch mode for later reading. Useful when going on
holiday and you don't want to return and find that expire has removed a
whole load of unread articles. Best to run from crontab everyday while away,
after which you will be mailed a report of which articles were mailed/saved
from which newsgroups and the total number of articles mailed/saved.
Articles are saved in a private news structure under your <savedir> directory
(default is \fI$HOME/News\fP). Be careful of using this option if you read a
lot of groups because you could overflow your filesystem. If you only want to
save a few groups it would be best to backup your full \fI$HOME/.newsrc\fP and
create a new one that only contains the newsgroups you want to mail/save.
Saved news can be read later by starting tin with the -R option.
.PP
tin -M iain -f newsrc.mail (mail any unread articles in newgroups specified
in file newsrc.mail)
.PP
tin -S -f newsrc.save (save any unread articles in newgroups specified
in file newsrc.save)
.PP
tin -R (read any unread articles saved by tin -S option)
.SH SIGNATURES
Tin will recognize a signature in either \fI$HOME/.signature\fP or
\fI$HOME/.Sig\fP. If \fI$HOME/.signature\fP exists, then the signature
will be pulled into the editor for Tin mail commands.  A signature in
\fI$HOME/.signature\fP will not be pulled into the editor for posting
commands since the inews program will append the signature itself.
.PP
A signature in \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP will be pulled into the editor for both
posting and mailing commands.
.PP
The following is an example of a \fI$HOME/.Sig\fP file:
.RS
.nf

.RE
.SH "ENVIROMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBTINDIR\fP
Define this variable if you do not want tin's .tin directory in $HOME/.tin.
(ie. if you want all tin's private files in /tmp/.tin you would set
TINDIR to contain /tmp.
.TP
\fBNNTPSERVER\fP
The default NNTP server to remotely read news from. This variable only
needs to be set if the -r command line option is specified and the file
\fI/etc/nntpserver\fP does not exist.
.TP
\fBORGANIZATION\fP
Set the mail header field Organization: to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default. This variable has precedence
over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/organization\fP that may also contain an
organization string.
.TP
\fBREPLYTO\fP
Set the mail header field Reply-To: to the return address specified
by the variable.
This is useful if the machine is not registered in the UUCP mail maps
or if you wish to recieve replies at a different machine.
This variable has precedence over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/replyto\fP
that may also contain a return address.
.TP
\fBADD_ADDRESS\fP
This can contain an address to append to the return address when replying
directly through mail to somebody whose mail address is not directly
recognized by the local host. For example say the return address is
\fIuser@bigvax\fP, but \fIbigvax\fP is not recognized by your host, so
therfore the mail will not reach \fIuser\fP. But the host \fIlittevax\fP
is known to recognize your host and \fIbigvax\fP, so if ADD_ADDRESS is set
(ie. 'setenv ADD_ADDRESS @littevax' for csh or 'set ADD_ADDRESS @littevax'
and 'export ADD_ADDRESS' for sh) the address \fIuser@bigvax@littlevax\fP will
be used and the mail will reach \fIuser@bigvax\fP.
This variable has precedence over the file \fI$HOME/.tin/add_address\fP
that may also contain an address.
.TP
\fBBUG_ADDRESS\fP
If the 'B' command bug report mail address is not correct this variable should be
set to the correct mail address. This variable has precedence over the file
\fI$HOME/.tin/bug_address\fP that may also contain a mail address.
.TP
\fBVISUAL\fP
This variable has precedence over the default editor (ie. vi) that is
used in all editing operations within tin (ie. posting 'w', replying 'rR',
follow-ups 'fF' and bug reports 'B').
.SH TIPS AND TRICKS
The following newsgroups provide useful information concerning news software:
.in +.5i
.ti -\w'\(em'u
\(emnews.software.readers (info. about news user agents tin,rn,nn,vn etc.)
.ti -\w'\(em'u
\(emnews.software.nntp (info. about NNTP)
.ti -\w'\(em'u
\(emnews.software.b (info. about news transport agents Bnews & Cnews)
.PP
Many prompts (ie. 'Mark everything as read? (y/n): y') within tin 
offer a default choice that the cursor is positioned on. By pressing
<CR> the default value is taken.
.PP
When tin is run in an xterm window it will resize itself each time the xterm
is resized.
.PP
Tin will reread the active file at set intervals to show any new news.

.SH BUGS
There are bugs somewhere among the creeping featurism. Any bugs found
should be reported by the 'B' (bug report) command.
.PP
There is a bug when article killing is switched ON/OFF at article
page level and the 't' command is used to return to group selection
index.
.PP
When articles have been unkilled, all articles will be marked
unread even if they have already been read.
.PP
Killing articles when tin is setuid causes strange behaviour.
.PP
Will not uudecode some of the images in alt.binaries.pictures because
more than one image is in the multi-part file to uudecode. Only the
first image will be uudecoded.
.PP
Does not yet handle Xref: headers for cross-posted articles.

.SH NAME
wildmat \- perform shell-style wildcard matching
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "int"
.B "wildmat(text, pattern)"
.B "    char		*text;"
.B "    char		*pattern;"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wildmat
compares the
.I text
against the
.I pattern
and
returns non-zero if the pattern matches the text.
The pattern is interpreted similar to shell filename wildcards, and not
as a full regular expression such as those handled by the
.IR grep (1)
family of programs or the
.IR regex (3)
or
.IR regexp (3)
set of routines.
.PP
The pattern is interpreted according to the following rules:
.TP
.BI \e x
Turns off the special meaning of
.I x
and matches it directly; this is used mostly before a question mark or
asterisk, and is not valid inside square brackets.
.TP
.B ?
Matches any single character.
.TP
.B *
Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
.TP
.BI [ x...y ]
Matches any single character specified by the set
.IR x...y .
A minus sign may be used to indicate a range of characters.
That is,
.I [0\-5abc]
is a shorthand for
.IR [012345abc] .
More than one range may appear inside a character set;
.I [0-9a-zA-Z._]
matches almost all of the legal characters for a host name.
The close bracket,
.IR ] ,
may be used if it is the first character in the set.
The minus sign,
.IR \- ,
may be used if it is either the first or last character in the set.
.TP
.BI [^ x...y ]
This matches any character
.I not
in the set
.IR x...y ,
which is interpreted as described above.
For example,
.I [^]\-]
matches any character other than a close bracket or minus sign.
.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
There is no way to end a range with a close bracket.

X     _T_i_n is a full-screen threaded Netnews reader.  It can read news
X     locally (ie. /_u_s_r/_s_p_o_o_l/_n_e_w_s) or remotely (rtin or tin -r option)
X     via a NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) server.
X
X     Tin has four newsreading levels: the newsgroup selection page, the
X     group index page, the thread listing page and the article viewer.
X     Use the 'h' (help) command to view a list of the commands available
X     at a particular level.
X
X     On startup Tin will show a list of the newsgroups found in
X     $_H_O_M_E/._n_e_w_s_r_c.  An arrow '->' or highlighted bar will point to the
X     first newsgroup.  Move to a group by using the terminal arrow keys
X     (ansi/at386/vt100 only) or 'j' and 'k'. Use PgUp/PgDn
X     (ansi/at386/vt100 only) or Ctrl-U and Ctrl-D to page up/down. Enter
X     a newsgroup by pressing RETURN.
X
X     The TAB key may be used to advance to the next newsgroup with
X     unread articles and enter it.

X
X     Tin can also dynamically change its options by the 'M' menu
X     command.  Any changes are written to $_H_O_M_E/._t_i_n/_t_i_n_r_c.

IINNDDEEXX FFIILLEESS
X     In order to keep track of threads, Tin maintains an index for each
X     newsgroup.  There are a number of methods in which index files can
X     be created and updated.
X
X     The simplest method is that each user creates/updates there own
X     index files that are stored in $HOME/.tin/.index. This has the
X     advantage that any user can compile and install tin, but the
X     disadvantage is that each user is going to be creating duplicate
X     files and using precious disk space. A good way to keep index files
X     updated is to start tin with the -U option that will update index
X     files in the background while you are reading news in the
X     foreground.  You can also update index files via the system batcher
X     cron with the -u option:
X          30 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/tin -u
X
X     A slightly better method is to set tin setuid news and have all
X     index files created and updated in the news spool directory (ie.
X     /usr/spool/news/.index).  This has the advantage that there will
X     only be one copy of the index files on each machine on your
X     network, but the disadvantage is that you will have tin running
X     setuid news and killing articles will change the central index file

X
X     for a group for all users (Needs fixing!).
X
X     A better method is to install the tind index file updating daemon
X     and have it create and update index files for all groups in your
X     active file at regular intervals in the news spool directory (ie.
X     /usr/spool/news/.index).  This has the advantage that there will
X     only be one copy of the index files on each machine on your network
X     and tin must not be setuid news, but the disadvantage is that you
X     will have to have news permissions to install tind and root
X     permissions to install an entry in the cron batcher system to have
X     tind regularly update index files.
X
X     The best method is to install the tind index file updating daemon
X     on your NNTP server and have it create and update index files for
X     all groups in your active file at regular intervals in the news
X     spool directory (ie. /usr/spool/news/.index).  This has the
X     advantage that there will only be one copy of the index files on
X     the NNTP server for the whole of your network and tin clients must
X     not be setuid news, but the disadvantage is that you will have to
X     install my NNTP server patches to allow tin to retreive index file
X     from your NNTP server and and you must install an entry in the cron
X     batcher system to have tind regularly update index files (Note that
X     this is the method we use on our network of 40-50 machines and have
X     not had any problems).
X
X     Entering a group the first time tends to be slow because the index
X     file must be built from scratch unless the tind update daemon is
X     being used. Subsequent readings of a group will cause incremental
X     updating of the index file.
X
X     If reading news remotely and locally updating index files operation
X     will be somewhat slower because the articles must be retrieved from
X     the NNTP server.

X     Maintaining Netnews on large networks of machines can be a pretty
X     time consuming job as I recently discovered when I was given the
X     job of maintaining our news system and news users.
X
X     Tin is a News User Agent and so most of the users were always
X     asking questions or doing things that could be frowned upon by
X     there departments.  To releive news admins (and especially me) of
X     this features have been added to Tin to make life easier.
X
X     If my NNTP XUSER patch has been applied to your NNTP server you
X     will be able to log the username and machine to your NNTP logfile
X     for usage statistics.
X
X     A user starting tin for the first time can be automatically
X     subscribed to a list of newsgroups that are deemed appropiate by
X     the news administrator. At our site the subscriptions file has 125
X     groups (our active file conatains over 400 groups with many only

X     Tin has four separate levels of operation: Selection Group level,
X     Group level, Thread level and Article level.
X
X     At the Selection Group level the title displays the number of
X     subscribed groups. The newsgroups are displayed on the left of the
X     screen with the number of unread articles displayed on the same
X     line in the middle of the screen.
X               <Selection Num> <Newsgroup> <Num of unread articles>
X          i.e.,
X               1  alt.sources            10
X               2  comp.sources.misc      3
X               3  news.software.readers  12
X
X     At the Group level the title contains the name of the group, the
X     number of conversation threads and total number of articles i.e.,
X     alt.sources (7 23).  If the group has been setup not to thread
X     articles (i.e., alt.sources is in $(_H_O_M_E)/._t_i_n/_u_n_t_h_r_e_a_d) the title
X     will be alt.sources (U 23).  There are two possible display formats
X     as shown below:
X               <Selection Num> <Unread> <Responses> <Subject> <Author>
X          i.e.,
X               1   +   3   Bnews sources?      iain@estevax.uucp

X               2       1   This question has a longer subject line
X
X     At the Article level the page header has the following format:
