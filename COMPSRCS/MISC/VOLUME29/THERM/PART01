Environment: UNIX, MS-DOS

Here are some simple (yet powerful) routines for displaying numerical
data in a graphical way.  I use these routines when I need to give a
status report to a user showing how much, how far, or how long.
They've managed to worm their way into DES routines, compress(1) --
anywhere there's a need to give a status feedback to the user.

These routines work under unix (well, sort of), but they aren't
really fancy-looking, since most unix curses implementations
don't pay attention to graphics characters.  They work very well
(and look nicest) under MS-DOS.

Comments, suggesions, and (shudder) bug fixes are welcome!

X.SH NAME
Xtherm \- ASCII graphic display of data
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.DS
X.sp
XWINDOW *thermstart(title, comment, ypos, xpos)
X.br
Xchar *title; /* window title */
X.br
Xchar *comment; /* window text */
X.br
Xint ypos; /* starting vertical position of window, EOF if centered */
X.br
Xint xpos; /* starting horiz position of window, EOF if centered */
X.br
X
Xthermometer(w1, percent)
X.br
XWINDOW *w1; /* returned from thermstart() */
X.br
Xint percent; /* percent (0-100) of scale */
X.br
X
Xthermend(w1)
X.br
XWINDOW *w1; /* returned from thermstart() */
X.br
X.DE
X.SH DESCRIPTION
XThese routines give the programmer a simple way to display
Xnumerical information graphically.  Any number of therm windows
Xmay be active at one time.
X.PP
XThe therm window is opened by calling
X.I thermstart(),
Xwhich returns a WINDOW pointer which is used in subsequent references.
XTo display data, call
X.I thermometer()
Xwith the appropriate parameters.
XTo end a therm window display, call
X.I thermend().
X.SH EXAMPLE
XThe following is a trivial code fragment illustrating the use of the therm
Xroutines:
X.PP
X.DS
XWINDOW *tw1, *tw2, *thermstart();
X.br
X.I ...
X.br
Xsprintf(message, "Copying file %s to %s", argv[1], argv[2]);
X.br
X/* center therm windows horizontally */
X.br
Xtw1 = thermstart("File 1 Status", message, 2, EOF);
X.br
Xtw2 = thermstart("File 2 Status", message, 10, EOF);
X.br
X.I ...
X.br
Xwhile(.../* copying */...)
X.br
X{
X.br
X.I ...
X.br
X   thermometer(tw1, (int) (100.0 * ((float) read / (float) total)));
X.br
X.I ...
X   thermometer(tw2, (int) (100.0 * ((float) written / (float) total)));
X.br
X.I ...
X.br
X}
X.br
X.I ...
X.br
Xthermend(tw2); /* drop window */
X.br
Xthermend(tw1); /* drop window */
X.br
X.I ...
