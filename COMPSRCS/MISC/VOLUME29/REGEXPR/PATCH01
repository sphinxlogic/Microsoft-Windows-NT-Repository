Subject:  v29i059:  regexpr - regexp library compatible with gnu regex, Patch01
Message-ID: <1992Apr5.033615.503@sparky.imd.sterling.com>
X-Md4-Signature: 4b2f1174fa2132b191b350dbd7121527
Date: Sun, 5 Apr 1992 03:36:15 GMT
Approved: kent@sparky.imd.sterling.com

Submitted-by: ylo@ngs.fi (Tatu Ylonen)
Posting-number: Volume 29, Issue 59
Archive-name: regexpr/patch01
Environment: UNIX, MSDOS
Patch-To: regexpr: Volume 27, Issue 23

This patch contains the following changes to the regexpr module.

  - Matching agains registers (the \1 construct) did not work properly
    (the fastmap was computed incorrectly).
  - Assert bounds in re_search_2 were too loose, and have been changed
    to reflect the actual behaviour.
  - The copyright notice has been clarified, but no significant
    changes have been made.

The only real bug reported so far has been the problem with matching
against registers, and it is now fixed.

The patch is a context diff inside a shar.
