X# Your C++ compiler goes here.
XCC = g++
X
X#
X# Add -DSIGINTERRUPT if you both have it and NEED it to ensure that signals
X# interrupt slow system calls.  This is primarily for 4.3 BSD-based systems.
X# Otherwise, your system most certaily does the right thing already.
X#
X# Add -DOLDDELETE if your compiler can't handle the 'delete []' form
X# of the delete operator for deleting arrays of objects allocated
X# via new.  If you don't know whether you compiler can handle it or
X# not, just don't define it and see what happens.  If your compiler
X# doesn't choke, it'll do the right thing.
X#
X# You must indicate where the GDBM header file 'gdbm.h' is to be found
X# using a flag of the form: -I/usr/local/include.
X#
X# If you have the BSD 4.3 signal mechanism, in particular, sigblock(2) and
X# sigsetmask(2), add -DBSDSIGNALS.  Else if you have POSIX signals, in
X# particular sigprocmask(2), add -DPOSIXSIGNALS.  Otherwise I'll use
X# the usually ANSI C signal mechanism when I need to block SIGTSTP and
X# SIGWINCH.  This can lead to some lost signals in very rare
X# circumstances, but what can you do with a braindead signal mechanism.
X#
X# The default locking is done using the POSIX "lockf".  If you don't
X# have "lockf" but have the BSD "flock", add -DFLOCK.
X#
X# If you're running on ESIX, add -DESIX
X#
XCFLAGS = -I/home/xtelab/lijewski/include -DBSDSIGNALS -DSIGINTERRUPT -g
X
X#
X# Those flags needed to compile in the type of terminal
X# control you have.  Use -DTERMIOS if you have <termios.h>, the POSIX
X# terminal control.  Use -DTERMIO if you have <termio.h>, the SYSV
X# terminal control.  Otherwise, the default assumes you have <sgtty.h>,
X# the BSD terminal control.
X#
X# If you choose to use -DTERMIOS and have problems, try -DTERMIO.  On
X# at least two systems I've tried, the vendor hasn't had all the
X# include files set up correctly to include <unistd.h> together with 
X# <osfcn.h>, among others.
X#
X# On RS/6000s, AIX/370 and recent Suns, -DTERMIO works well.
X#
XTERMFLAGS = -DTERMIO
X
X#
X# You must indicate where the GDBM library 'libgdbm.a' is to be found
X# using a flag of the form: -L/usr/local/lib.
X#
X# On ESIX you might also need -lgen and -lbsd
X#
XLDFLAGS = -L/home/xtelab/lijewski/lib

X# The needed libraries.  You need Termcap(3) and GDBM
X#

X# Directory is which the databases, AREA file (this is the file, with
X# one area per line, listing the valid problem areas), SEQUENCE file
X# (this is the file used to keep the unique problem #), and
X# MAILLIST.* files (which contains the names of interested parties)
X# will be stored.

XHOMEBASE = /home/xtelab/lijewski/src/c++/problem

XProblem - A "problem" database manager
X
XProblem is a database manager for bug reports and such, meant to be
Xused in a UNIX environment.  It is written in C++; uses the GNU
XDatabase Management Library (GDBM) for low-level database operations;
Xand the termcap(3) library for screen comtrol.  An X Windows interface
Xis being developed.  The basic idea is to provide a central front-end
Xfor managing the various databases of bugs and miscreant behaviour
Xthat a large UNIX site might be interested in tracking, and
Xfacilitating the sharing of this information amongst all interested
Xparties.
X
XOn startup, a list of problem areas is displayed:
X
XThe 4 Areas:
X
X  1 apf
X  2 aix370
X  3 aixws
X  4 dbx
X
XThis is called the area window.  Upon entering a number corresponding
Xto the area of interest, the following screen is displayed:
X
XCommands
X
X  l  -- log new problem
X  a  -- append to a problem
X  c  -- close a problem
X  e  -- examine a problem
X  v  -- view problem summaries
X  s  -- subscribe to this problem area
X  u  -- unsubscribe from this problem area
X  k  -- keyword search over problem headers
X  K  -- keyword search over problem headers and data
X  M  -- modify keyword field
X  d  -- delete a problem from the database
X  r  -- reorganize the database
X  R  -- reopen a closed problem
X  q  -- quit
X
XHere you are expected to type a single letter symbolizing the
Xcommand of interest.
X
X  l  -- log new problem
X
XChoosing `l', you'll immediately see a screen of the form:
X
XArea      networking
XLogger    mjlx
XReporter
XLogged    Mon Jun 29 08:56:27 1992
XUpdated   Mon Jun 29 08:56:27 1992
XKeywords
XSummary
XStatus    open
XSite
XSeverity
XProblem #
X
XThis is known as the problem header.  Here, Reporter is the user name
Xor real name of the person who reported the problem;  this needn't be
Xthe same as Logger.  Severity, which runs from 4 (the lowest) to 1
X(the highest) is meant to be some indication of the severity of the
Xproblem.  The remaining fields have their obvious meaning.
X
XIn the above, "problem" has filled in the fields that it can and will
Xprompt for the others.  It will fill in the Problem # field, if and
Xwhen the problem is really logged, with a positive number unique
Xacross all problem areas.  There is no limit to the amount of text
Xthat can be stored in each field.  After filling out this header,
X"problem" will invoke the editor in the user's EDITOR environment
Xvariable (or "vi" if not defined), from which the user is expected to
Xenter the text of the problem.  When you exit from your editor, you'll
Xbe prompted as to whether or not you really want to log the problem.
XTyping `y' logs the problem while typing `n' takes you back to the
Xcommand window.
X
X  a  -- append to a problem
X
XHere you'll be prompted for the problem # of an existing problem.  If
Xa problem of that number actually exists, you'll immediately be
Xbrought up into your editor to enter the text of your append.  When you
Xexit from your editor, you'll be prompted as to whether or not you
Xreally wish to make this append.
X
X  c  -- close a problem
X
XHere you'll be prompted for the problem # of an existing problem.  If
Xa problem of that number actually exists, you'll immediately be
Xbrought up into your editor to enter the text of your close.  Closing
Xa problem changes the Status field of the problem entry from "open" to
X"closed"; it is not removed from the database.  It is meant to be an
Xindication that the problem has been solved.  Only the original logger
Xof the problem, or the "problem" administrator can close a problem.
X
X  e  -- examine a problem
X
XYou will be prompted for the problem # of an existing problem.  If
Xthat problem exists you'll be placed into the pager "less" with a copy
Xof the complete problem header and data of that problem.  This way you
Xcan then page through the problem and do any thing else you might do
Xfrom a pager such as saving a copy of the problem or only a portion of
Xit to another file.
X
X  v  -- view problem summaries
X
XTyping `v' a list consisting of selected parts of each problem header
Xis displayed on the screen, one per line:
X
X77 open 1 Jun 28 16:37:09 1992 calloc prototyped wrong
X73 open 2 Jun 26 06:16:03 1992 Fortran code gets seg fault
X18 closed May 30 12:51:34 1992 <stdarg.h> is broken
X53 open 3 May  6 13:45:23 1992 optimization slows down c!
X16 open 3 Apr 26 09:54:49 1992 why don't we have a Pascal compiler?
X
XThis is called a view window.  The fields displayed are: Problem #,
XStatus, Severity, if Status is "open", Updated and Summary.  The lines
Xare sorted: "open" before "closed"; severity order 1 to 4; and then in
Xmost recently updated to least recently updated order.  It the text of
Xa line is longer than the screen width the line is truncated and a `!'
Xis place in the final position in the line.  The cursor is initially
Xplaced in the first column of the first line.  The problem list can be
Xperused using the screen and cursor motion commands of vi and emacs.
X
XThe line the cursor is on is called the current line.  If the current
Xline is longer than the screen width it will be shifted left so that
Xthe final screenwidth characters are visible.  In this way, by moving
Xthe cursor on and off of a line, it is possible to read the complete
Xline, provided that the length of the line is not more than twice the
Xwidth of your screen.  Most of the commands in the command window are
Xaccessible from here and apply to the problem in the current line.
XFor example, typing `a' will append to the problem in the current
Xline.
X
XTyping `H' or `?' from any of the three main windows in "problem" will
Xdisplay a screen of help commands called the help screen.  The help
Xscreen from within the view window is:
X
X CURSOR MOVEMENT COMMANDS:
X
X    ?  H               Display this help.
X    q                  quit.
X    j  n  ^N  SPC  CR  Forward  one line.
X    DOWN_ARROW_KEY             "        .
X    k  p  ^P  ^Y       Backward one line.
X    UP_ARROW_KEY               "        .
X    ^F  ^V             Forward  one window.
X    b  ^B  ESC-V       Backward one window.
X    ^D                 Forward  one half-window.
X    ^U                 Backward one half-window.
X    <                  Go to first line of listing.
X    >                  Go to last line of listing.
X
X COMMANDS WHICH OPERATE ON THE CURRENT PROBLEM:
X
X    a                  Append to current problem.
X    c                  Close current problem.
X    d                  Delete current problem.
X    e m v              Examine, View, or "more" current problem.
X    m                  Modify keyword field.
X    r                  Reorganize the database.
X    R                  Reopen a closed problem.
X    s                  Save problem listing to a file - prompts for filename.
X
X MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS:
X
X    !                  starts up a shell.
X    ! cmd              executes a shell command - prompts for command.
X    !!                 reexecutes previous shell command.
X    ^L                 Repaint screen.
X    CR                 Signifies end-of-response when in a prompt.
X    V                  Print out version string.
X
X  s  -- subscribe to this problem area
X
XYou will be added to a list of interested parties for this area.  Each
Xtime a change is made to the database for this area, every person on
Xthe mailing list receives mail indicating the change that was made.
XIn this way, it is easy to keep track of problems without having to
Xregular read all the problems to see if anything new has happened.
X
X  u  -- unsubscribe from this problem area
X
XYou will be removed from the interested parties mailing list for this
Xarea.
X
X  k  -- keyword search over problem headers
X
XYou will be prompted for a regular expression which will then be used
Xto search over the problem headers.  If there are any matches, the
Xsummary lines of each of the problems which matched will be displayed
Xin a view window.  For example, if you wished to peruse only open
Xproblems, you could search for "open" whereupon you would be put in a
Xview window consisting of only the open problems in this area.
X
X  K  -- keyword search over problem headers and data
X
XThis is similar the the `k' command except that the regular expression
Xsearch is over the complete problem header and data for each problem.
X
X  M  -- modify keyword field
X
XThis command is useful if you want to modify the keyword field.
X
X  d  -- delete a problem from the database
X
XThis command allows the database administrator to delete problems from
Xthe database for this area.  The problem data is irretrievably removed
Xfrom the database.
X
X  r  -- reorganize the database
X
XThis is an administrative command which can be used after many appends and
Xdeletions have been made in the database to shrink it down and make
Xaccessing it more efficient.  It corresponds directly to the GDBM
Xreorganize command.
X
X  R  -- reopen a closed problem
X
XA closed problem can be reopened with this command.
X
X  q  -- quit
X
XThis quits from the command window and returns you to the area window.

X.SH NAME
Xproblem \- a problem database manager
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B "problem [-v] [-d] [area1 area2 ...]"
X.br
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Problem
Xis a database manager for problems and bug reports.  It is inspired
Xfrom PROBLEM, the problem database manager under IBM VM/CMS that was
Xwritten by Andy 
XHanushevsky at Cornell University.  It is intended to provide a
Xcommon interface to a collection of databases describing problems and/or
Xbugs which a UNIX site might be interested in tracking, and to
Xfacilitate the sharing of this information amongst all interested
Xparties.
X
X.SH COMMANDS
XIn the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
XESC stands for the ESCAPE key; for example ESC-v means the
Xtwo character sequence "ESCAPE", then "v".  TAB stands for the tab
Xkey. UP_ARROW stands for the up arrow key and DOWN_ARROW stands for
Xthe down arrow key, if your keyboard supports arrow keys.
X
XTyping
X.I problem,
Xa list of problem areas, called the area window, is displayed.  This
Xlist is set up by the
X.I problem
Xadministrator at your site.  It consists of the areas into which
Xproblems and bug reports can be logged. A sample area window:
X.nf
X
X  1 apf        - for AIX Parallel Fortran problems under AIX/370
X  2 aix370     - general AIX/370 problems
X  3 aixws      - any workstation related problem
X  4 dbx        - any dbx-related problem
X  5 AFS or NFS - any AFS or NFS related problem
X
X.fi
XThe areas are numbered from 1
Xto N, where N is the total number of areas defined at your site.  If N
Xis less than ten, you simply need to press the key corresponding to
Xthat number to
Xindicate your interest in that area.  Otherwise, you must type in the
Xnumber followed by a carriage return.  If there are more areas than
Xlines on your screen,
X.I problem
Xwill display as many as will fit on the screen by forcing the areas to
Xfit in a series of twenty-five character wide columns.  If they still
Xdon't all fit on the screen, typing `H' or `?' will scroll through all
Xthe areas.
X
XOnce you've selected an area, a list of available commands, called
Xthe command window, is displayed:
X.nf
X
X  l  -- log new problem
X  a  -- append to a problem
X  c  -- close a problem
X  e  -- examine a problem
X  v  -- view problem summaries
X  s  -- subscribe to this problem area
X  u  -- unsubscribe from this problem area
X  k  -- keyword search over problem headers
X  K  -- keyword search over problem headers and data
X  m  -- modify keyword field
X  d  -- delete a problem from the database
X  r  -- reorganize the database
X  R  -- reopen a closed problem
X  q  -- quit
X
X.fi
X
XHere you are expected to type a single letter symbolizing the
Xcommand of interest.  Typing `H' or `?' will scroll through the list
Xof available commands.
X
X.IP  "l  -- log new problem"
X
XTyping `l', you'll immediately see a screen of the form:

X
X.fi
XThis is known as the problem header.  Here,
X.I Reporter
Xis intended to represent the user name
Xor real name of the person who reported the problem, which needn't be
Xthe same as
X.I Logger.
XOf course you can fill in any of the fields as you see fit.  
X.I Severity
X, which runs from 4 (the lowest) to 1
X(the highest) is meant to be some indication of the severity of the
Xproblem.  The remaining fields have their more or less obvious meaning.
X
XIn the above problem header,
X.I problem
Xhas filled in the fields that it can and will
Xprompt for the others.  It will fill in the
X.I "Problem #"
Xfield, if and
Xwhen the problem is really logged, with a positive number unique
Xacross all problem areas.  There is no limit to the amount of text
Xthat can be stored in each field.
XAfter filling out this header,
X.I problem
Xwill invoke the editor in your EDITOR environment
Xvariable (or "vi" if not defined), from which you are expected to
Xenter the text of the problem.  When you exit from your editor, you'll
Xbe prompted as to whether or not you really want to log the problem.
XTyping `y' logs the problem and returns you to the command window,
Xwhile typing `n' simply takes you back to the command window.
X
X.IP  "a  -- append to a problem
X
XHere you'll be prompted for the problem # of an existing problem.  If
Xa problem of that number actually exists, you'll immediately be
Xbrought up into your editor to enter the text of your append.  When you
Xexit from your editor, you'll be prompted as to whether or not you
Xreally wish to make this append.  The
X.I Updated
Xfield of the problem header will be updated to reflect the time of
Xthe append.
X
X.IP  "c  -- close a problem"
X
XHere you'll be prompted for the problem # of an existing problem.  If
Xa problem of that number actually exists, you'll immediately be
Xbrought up into your editor to enter the text of your close.  Closing
Xa problem changes the
X.I Status
Xfield of the problem entry from "open" to
X"closed"; it is not removed from the database.  It is meant to be an
Xindication that the problem has been solved.  Only the original logger
Xof the problem, or the
X.I problem
Xadministrator can close a problem.
XThe
X.I Updated
Xfield of the problem header will be updated to reflect the time of
Xthe close.
X
X.IP  "e  -- examine a problem"
X
XYou will be prompted for the problem # of an existing problem.  If
Xthat problem exists you'll be placed into the pager "less" with a copy
Xof the complete problem header and data of that problem.  This way you
Xcan then page through the problem and do any thing else you might do
Xfrom a pager such as saving a copy of the problem or only a portion of
Xit to another file.
X
X.IP  "v  -- view problem summaries"
X
XHere a list consisting of selected parts of each problem header
Xis displayed on the screen, one per line, called the view window.
XThe fields displayed are:
X.I Problem #,
X.I Status,
X.I Severity (if the problem is open),
X.I Updated,
Xand
X.I Summary.
XThe lines are sorted: "open" before "closed"; severity 1 to severity
X4; and then in most
Xrecently updated to least recently updated order.  It the text of a
Xline is longer than the screen width the line is truncated and a `!'
Xis place in the final position in the line.  The cursor is initially
Xplaced in the first column of the first line.
X
XThe line the cursor is on is called the current line.  
XThe cursor can be positioned using the cursor motion and scrolling
Xcommands of vi and emacs.  If the current
Xline is longer than the screen width it will be shifted left so that
Xthe final screenwidth characters are visible.  In this way, by moving
Xthe cursor on and off of a line, it is possible to read the complete
Xline, provided that the length of the line is not more than twice the
Xwidth of your screen.  Most of the commands in the command window are
Xaccessible from within the view window and apply to the problem in the
Xcurrent line. 
XFor example, typing `a' will append to the problem in the current
Xline.
X
XTyping `H' or `?' will scroll through a list of all the valid
Xkeypresses from within the view window:
X
X.nf
X CURSOR MOVEMENT COMMANDS:
X
X    ?  H               Display this help.
X    q                  quit.
X    j  n  ^N  SPC  CR  Forward  one line.
X    DOWN_ARROW_KEY             "        .
X    k  p  ^P  ^Y       Backward one line.
X    UP_ARROW_KEY               "        .
X    ^F  ^V             Forward  one window.
X    b  ^B  ESC-V       Backward one window.
X    ^D                 Forward  one half-window.
X    ^U                 Backward one half-window.
X    <                  Go to first line of listing.
X    >                  Go to last line of listing.
X
X COMMANDS WHICH OPERATE ON THE CURRENT PROBLEM:
X
X    a                  Append to current problem.
X    c                  Close current problem.
X    d                  Delete current problem.
X    e m v              Examine, View, or "more" current problem.
X    M                  Modify keyword field.
X    r                  Reorganize the database.
X    R                  Reopen a closed problem.
X    S                  Save problem listing to a file
X
X MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS:
X
X    !                  starts up a shell.
X    ! cmd              executes a shell command
X    !!                 reexecutes previous shell command.
X    ^L                 Repaint screen.
X    CR                 End-of-response when in a prompt.
X    V                  Print out version string.
X.fi
X
X.IP  "s  -- subscribe to this problem area"
X
XYou will be added to a list of interested parties for this area.  Each
Xtime a change is made to the database for this area, every person on
Xthe mailing list receives mail indicating the change that was made.
XIn this way, it is easy to keep track of problems without having to
Xregularly read all the areas to see if anything new has happened.
X
X.IP  "u  -- unsubscribe from this problem area"
X
XYou will be removed from the interested parties mailing list for this
Xarea.
X
X.IP  "k  -- keyword search over problem headers"
X
XYou will be prompted for a regular expression which will then be used
Xto search over the problem headers.  If there are any matches, the
Xsummary lines of each of the problems which matched will be displayed
Xin a view window.  For example, if you wished to peruse only open
Xproblems, you could search for "open" whereupon you would be put in a
Xview window consisting of only the open problems in the area.
X
X.IP  "K  -- keyword search over problem headers and data"
X
XThis is similar the the `k' command except that the regular expression
Xsearch is over the complete problem header and data for each problem.
X
X.IP  "M  -- modify keyword field"
X
XThis command is useful if you want to modify the keyword field.  At
Xthe authors site, being an IBM stronghold, we place the number of each APAR
X(Authorized Problem Analysis Report) which supposedly fixes a problem,
Xin the keyword field.  This cannot be done when the problem is logged
Xsince the APAR number(s) aren't known at that time.
X
X.IP  "d  -- delete a problem from the database"
X
XThis command allows the database administrator to delete problems from
Xthe database for this area.  The problem data is irretrievably removed
Xfrom the database.
X
X.IP  "r  -- reorganize the database"
X
XThis is an administrative command which can be used after many appends and
Xdeletions have been made in the database to shrink it down and make
Xaccessing it more efficient.  It directly corresponds to the GDBM
Xreorganize command.
X
X.IP  "R  -- reopen a closed problem"
X
XA closed problem can be reopened with this command.  The
X.I Status
Xfield is changed from "closed" back to "open".
X
X.IP  "q  -- quit"
X
XThis quits from the command window and returns you to the area window.
X
X.SH OPTIONS
XCommand line options are described below.
X.PP
X.IP "-d dirname"
XInstructs
X.I problem
Xto use the next argument as the name of the directory in which all the
Xproblem databases and mailing list files are stored.  The author uses
Xit primarily as a debugging tool.  However, it allows different groups
Xat a single site to set up their own databases, instead of forcing
Xa single person to centrally administer all the problem areas
Xat the site.
X.IP "-v       "
XPrints out the version string and exits.
X
X.I Problem
Xcan also be invoked with one or more problem areas as arguments.  It
Xwill then immediately startup in the command window for that area.
XTyping `q' will then move on to the next problem area, or the area
Xwindow if no more areas have been specified.  If any of the arguments
Xare not valid problem areas, you will also be placed in the area
Xwindow when
X.I problem
Xtries to process that area.
X
X.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
X.IP COLUMNS
XThis value, if nonzero, overrides the number of columns as read
Xfrom termcap(3).  Hence by setting
X.B COLUMNS
Xit is easy to use a
Xdifferent number of columns than termcap(3) expects for a given
Xterminal type.
X.IP "EDITOR  "
XThe name of the editor (used by the `e' and `f' commands).
X.IP "HOME   "
XThe user's home directory.
X.IP "LINES   "
XThis value, if nonzero, overrides the number of lines as read
Xfrom termcap(3).  Hence by setting
X.B LINES
Xit is easy to use a
Xdifferent number of lines than termcap(3) expects for a given
Xterminal type.
X.IP "SHELL   "
XThe shell used to execute the `!' command, as well as to expand filenames.
X.IP "TERM   "
XThe type of terminal on which
X.I problem
Xis being run.

XSYNOPSIS
X     problem [-v] [-d] [area1 area2 ...]
X
XDESCRIPTION
X     Problem is a database manager for problems and bug  reports.
X     It  is  inspired  from PROBLEM, the problem database manager
X     under IBM VM/CMS that was written  by  Andy  Hanushevsky  at
X     Cornell  University.   It  is  intended  to provide a common
X     interface to a collection of databases  describing  problems
X     and/or  bugs which a UNIX site might be interested in track-
X     ing, and to  facilitate  the  sharing  of  this  information
X     amongst all interested parties.
X
X
XCOMMANDS
X     In the following  descriptions,  ^X  means  control-X.   ESC
X     stands  for  the ESCAPE key; for example ESC-v means the two
X     character sequence "ESCAPE", then "v".  TAB stands  for  the
X     tab key. UP_ARROW stands for the up arrow key and DOWN_ARROW
X     stands for the down arrow key,  if  your  keyboard  supports
X     arrow keys.
X
X     Typing problem, a list of problem  areas,  called  the  area
X     window,  is  displayed.   This list is set up by the problem
X     administrator at your site.  It consists of the  areas  into
X     which  problems and bug reports can be logged. A sample area
X     window:
X
X       1 apf        - for AIX Parallel Fortran problems under AIX/370
X       2 aix370     - general AIX/370 problems
X       3 aixws      - any workstation related problem
X       4 dbx        - any dbx-related problem
X       5 AFS or NFS - any AFS or NFS related problem
X
X     The areas are numbered from 1 to N, where  N  is  the  total
X     number  of  areas  defined  at your site.  If N is less than
X     ten, you simply need to press the key corresponding to  that
X     number  to  indicate your interest in that area.  Otherwise,
X     you must type in the number followed by a  carriage  return.
X     If  there  are more areas than lines on your screen, problem
X     will display as many as will fit on the  screen  by  forcing
X     the  areas  to fit in a series of twenty-five character wide
X     columns.  If they still don't all fit on the screen,  typing
X     `H' or `?' will scroll through all the areas.
X
X     Once you've selected an area, a list of available  commands,
X     called the command window, is displayed:
X
X       l  -- log new problem
X       a  -- append to a problem
X       c  -- close a problem
X       e  -- examine a problem
X       v  -- view problem summaries
X       s  -- subscribe to this problem area
X       u  -- unsubscribe from this problem area
X       k  -- keyword search over problem headers
X       K  -- keyword search over problem headers and data
X       M  -- modify keyword field
X       d  -- delete a problem from the database
X       r  -- reorganize the database
X       R  -- reopen a closed problem
X       q  -- quit
X
X
X     Here you are expected to type a  single  letter  symbolizing
X     the  command  of  interest.   Typing  `H' or `?' will scroll
X     through the list of available commands.
X
X
X     l  -- log new problem
X
X          Typing `l', you'll immediately  see  a  screen  of  the
X          form:

X
X          This is known as the problem header.  Here, Reporter is
X          intended to represent the user name or real name of the
X          person who reported the problem, which needn't  be  the
X          same  as  Logger.  Of course you can fill in any of the
X          fields as you see fit. Severity ,  which  runs  from  4
X          (the  lowest)  to  1  (the highest) is meant to be some
X          indication of the severity of the problem.  The remain-
X          ing fields have their more or less obvious meaning.
X
X          In the above problem header, problem has filled in  the
X          fields  that it can and will prompt for the others.  It
X          will fill in the Problem # field, if and when the prob-
X          lem  is  really  logged,  with a positive number unique
X          across all problem areas.  There is  no  limit  to  the
X          amount of text that can be stored in each field.  After
X          filling out this header, problem will invoke the editor
X          in  your  EDITOR  environment  variable (or "vi" if not
X          defined), from which you are expected to enter the text
X          of the problem.  When you exit from your editor, you'll
X          be prompted as to whether or not you really want to log
X          the  problem.   Typing `y' logs the problem and returns
X          you to the command  window,  while  typing  `n'  simply
X          takes you back to the command window.
X
X
X     a  -- append to a problem
X
X          Here you'll be prompted for the problem # of an  exist-
X          ing  problem.   If  a  problem  of that number actually
X          exists, you'll immediately be brought up into your edi-
X          tor  to  enter  the text of your append.  When you exit
X          from your editor, you'll be prompted as to  whether  or
X          not  you  really wish to make this append.  The Updated
X          field of the problem header will be updated to  reflect
X          the time of the append.
X
X
X     c  -- close a problem
X
X          Here you'll be prompted for the problem # of an  exist-
X          ing  problem.   If  a  problem  of that number actually
X          exists, you'll immediately be brought up into your edi-
X          tor to enter the text of your close.  Closing a problem
X          changes the Status field  of  the  problem  entry  from
X          "open"  to  "closed";  it is not removed from the data-
X          base.  It is meant to be an indication that the problem
X          has been solved.  Only the original logger of the prob-
X          lem, or the problem administrator can close a  problem.
X          The Updated field of the problem header will be updated
X          to reflect the time of the close.
X
X
X     e  -- examine a problem
X
X          You will be prompted for the problem # of  an  existing
X          problem.   If that problem exists you'll be placed into
X          the pager "less" with a copy of  the  complete  problem
X          header and data of that problem.  This way you can then
X          page through the problem and  do  any  thing  else  you
X          might  do  from  a  pager  such as saving a copy of the
X          problem or only a portion of it to another file.
X
X
X     v  -- view problem summaries
X
X          Here a list consisting of selected parts of each  prob-
X          lem  header  is  displayed on the screen, one per line,
X          called the view  window.   The  fields  displayed  are:
X          Problem  #,  Status, Severity (if the problem is open),
X          Updated, and Summary.  The  lines  are  sorted:  "open"
X          before  "closed"; severity 1 to severity 4; and then in
X          most recently updated to least recently updated  order.
X          It  the  text of a line is longer than the screen width
X          the line is truncated and a `!' is place in  the  final
X          position  in  the line.  The cursor is initially placed
X          in the first column of the first line.
X
X          The line the cursor is on is called the  current  line.
X          The  cursor  can  be positioned using the cursor motion
X          and scrolling commands of vi and emacs.  If the current
X          line is longer than the screen width it will be shifted
X          left so that the final screenwidth characters are visi-
X          ble.  In this way, by moving the cursor on and off of a
X          line, it is possible to read the  complete  line,  pro-
X          vided  that  the  length  of  the line is not more than
X          twice the width of your screen.  Most of  the  commands
X          in  the  command  window are accessible from within the
X          view window and apply to the  problem  in  the  current
X          line.  For example, typing `a' will append to the prob-
X          lem in the current line.

X
X     s  -- subscribe to this problem area
X
X          You will be added to a list of interested  parties  for
X          this  area.  Each time a change is made to the database
X          for  this  area,  every  person  on  the  mailing  list
X          receives  mail indicating the change that was made.  In
X          this way, it is easy to keep track of problems  without
X          having  to  regularly read all the areas to see if any-
X          thing new has happened.
X
X
X     u  -- unsubscribe from this problem area
X
X          You will be removed from the interested parties mailing
X          list for this area.
X
X
X     k  -- keyword search over problem headers
X
X          You will be prompted for  a  regular  expression  which
X          will  then  be used to search over the problem headers.
X          If there are any matches, the summary lines of each  of
X          the  problems which matched will be displayed in a view
X          window.  For example, if you wished to peruse only open
X          problems,  you  could  search  for "open" whereupon you
X          would be put in a view window consisting  of  only  the
X          open problems in the area.
X
X
X     K  -- keyword search over problem headers and data
X
X          This is similar the the `k'  command  except  that  the
X          regular  expression search is over the complete problem
X          header and data for each problem.
X
X
X     M  -- modify keyword field
X
X          This command is useful if you want to modify  the  key-
X          word  field.  At the authors site, being an IBM strong-
X          hold, we place the  number  of  each  APAR  (Authorized
X          Problem  Analysis  Report)  which  supposedly  fixes  a
X          problem, in the keyword field.   This  cannot  be  done
X          when  the  problem  is  logged since the APAR number(s)
X          aren't known at that time.
X
X
X     d  -- delete a problem from the database
X
X          This  command  allows  the  database  administrator  to
X          delete  problems  from the database for this area.  The
X          problem data is irretrievably removed  from  the  data-
X          base.
X
X
X     r  -- reorganize the database
X
X          This is an administrative command  which  can  be  used
X          after  many appends and deletions have been made in the
X          database to shrink it down and make accessing  it  more
X          efficient.   It  directly corresponds to the GDBM reor-
X          ganize command.
X
X
X     R  -- reopen a closed problem
X
X          A closed problem can be  reopened  with  this  command.
X          The  Status  field  is  changed  from  "closed" back to
X          "open".
X
X
X     q  -- quit
X
X          This quits from the command window and returns  you  to
X          the area window.
X
X
XOPTIONS
X     Command line options are described below.
X
X     -d dirname
X          Instructs problem to use the next argument as the  name
X          of the directory in which all the problem databases and
X          mailing list files are stored.  The author uses it pri-
X          marily  as  a  debugging tool.  However, it allows dif-
X          ferent groups at a single site  to  set  up  their  own
X          databases,  instead  of forcing a single person to cen-
X          trally administer all the problem areas at the site.
X
X     -v   Prints out the version string and exits.
X
X          Problem can also be invoked with one  or  more  problem
X          areas  as  arguments.  It will then immediately startup
X          in the command window for that area.  Typing  `q'  will
X          then move on to the next problem area, or the area win-
X          dow if no more areas have been specified.   If  any  of
X          the  arguments  are  not  valid problem areas, you will
X          also be placed in the area window when problem tries to
X          process that area.

XENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
X     COLUMNS
X          This value, if nonzero, overrides the number of columns
X          as  read  from termcap(3).  Hence by setting COLUMNS it
X          is easy to use  a  different  number  of  columns  than
X          termcap(3) expects for a given terminal type.
X
X     EDITOR
X          The name of the editor (used by the `e'  and  `f'  com-
X          mands).
X
X     HOME The user's home directory.
X
X     LINES
X          This value, if nonzero, overrides the number  of  lines
X          as  read from termcap(3).  Hence by setting LINES it is
X          easy to use a different number of lines than termcap(3)
X          expects for a given terminal type.
X
X     SHELL
X          The shell used to execute the `!' command, as  well  as
X          to expand filenames.
X
X     TERM The type of terminal on which problem is being run.
