Submitted-by: Chip Rosenthal <chip@chinacat.unicom.com>
Posting-number: Volume 33, Issue 29
Archive-name: prtscrn2/patch01
Environment: SCO
Patch-To: prtscrn2: Volume 30, Issue 76

`Prtscrn' grabs the contents of an SCO Unix or Xenix console screen
and sends them to stdout -- for saving to a file, printing, etc.

This patch is of interest primarly to SCO Xenix 2.3.3 users.  This
patch does not add new functionality or bug fixes.  It merely addresses
a porting issue and cleans up the documentation a bit.  Please see
the README file for additional details.

! UNIX and XENIX systems.
  
! To dump the contents of /dev/tty01 to a file, you'd run:
  
  	prtscrn -1 >filename
  
! To dump the contents of the current screen, simply run:
  
  	prtscrn >filename
  
  An earlier version of the `prtscrn' program was published in
  comp.sources.misc volume 22.  This version has many improvements.

        display adapters, but I haven't tested it.
+ 
+ 
+ NOTE TO SCO XENIX USERS:
+ 
+     This utility uses a operation called CONS_GETINFO to obtain required
+     information on the console.  As far as I know, no releases of SCO
+     Xenix/286 support this function.  This operation is fully supported
+     under Xenix/386 2.3.4, and is not supported at all under Xenix/386
+     2.3.2 and earlier.  It is supported under *some* releases of 2.3.3.
+ 
+     There were several different releases of SCO Xenix which called
+     themselves 2.3.3.  The later ones include the required console
+     driver updates.  If you are running 2.3.3 by way of update UFN
+     (SLS xnx296) then this utility will work.  If you are running
+     2.3.3 by way of update UFJ (included with older versions of VP/ix)
+     then this utility will *not* run.  I do not know offhand whether
+     2.3.3 by way of update UFM (SLS xnx155B) has the new console driver
+     or not.
+ 
+     If you are stuck with a version of Xenix which will not support
+     this utility, there is an earlier version of `prtscrn' in the
+     comp.sources.misc archives (volume 22, issue 27) you may use.
+     That older release isn't as good as this one, but it is functional.

   * prtscrn - SCO UNIX/XENIX console screen dump utility.
   *
!  * This works by attaching to the display adapter memory and extracting
!  * the out the characters and dumping them to stdout.  In order to
!  * do this we need to make the selected screen active so that it's
!  * contents are loaded into display memory.  What gets tricky is that
!  * we need to figure out what screen is on the adapter when we begin
!  * so we can put that screen back when we are done.
   *
!  * One way to find out what screen is active is to open up the
!  * display adapter (e.g. "/dev/vga") and do a CONS_GETINFO ioctl()
!  * upon it.  However, we first need to know what kind of display
!  * adapter is being used.  If we are dumping a specific screen
!  * (i.e. a screen number was given on the command line) then we
!  * will open up that tty, and do a CONS_CURRENT ioctl() upon it
!  * to get the adapter type.  If we are dumping the current screen
!  * (i.e.  no screen number given on the command line) then we
!  * will do the CONS_CURRENT ioctl() upon "/dev/tty".  Note that
!  * a side effect of this is that we should be able to make a dump
!  * of a screen from any terminal on the system (permissions
!  * willing), and further this should work on a system with multiple
!  * display adapters.
   *
-  * Security is enforced by permissions on the console tty.  That is,
-  * if you try to dump screen 2, then you need to have read/write
-  * permissions to /dev/tty02.  This utility assumes that the user
-  * has read permissions on the adapter device, e.g. /dev/vga.  The
-  * default is to grant world read/write for these devices.  I'm not
-  * sure that is wise, but we assume that's the way things are.
-  *
   * Edit at tabstops=4.
