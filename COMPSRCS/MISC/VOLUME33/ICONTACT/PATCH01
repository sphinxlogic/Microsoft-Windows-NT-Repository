This patch takes icontact from version 1.3 to version 1.3.1.  It fixes a
problem with a missing semicolon at the end of a block.  Perl version 4.035
does not require semicolons at the end of blocks, but earlier versions do.
I was using 4.035 to develop icontact and so I didn't catch the missing
semicolon, but several other people using earlier versions of perl caught
it and sent me mail about it.  Thanks.

To apply this patch, save this article in a file, cd to the directory with the
original icontact-1.3 files and execute this command:

        patch < ThisFile
