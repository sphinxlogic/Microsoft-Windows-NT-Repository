icontact-1.3 (25oct92)

This is the fourth release of icontact.

New features include (look at the man page for specifics):
  - the colors of all the different parts of the contact sheets (label
    text, background, border stripes, etc.) are now user configurable.
  - smarter input image filename processing.
  - the rows of contact sheets can now be left justified.
  - a nice value may be specified for the child processes.
  - signal names instead of signal numbers when a signal is caught.
  - icontact does not give up as easily as it used to when a child dies.
  - user specifiable color quantization program.

I would appreciate hearing from you if you find icontact useful or have
suggestions on how to make it better.  I only have access to a
SPARCstation running SunOS 4.1.2, so icontact has only been tested in
this environment.  If icontact fails in your environment, let me know
so I can fix it.

Send all e-mail regarding icontact to cs62a12@wind.ucsd.edu.

Here is the DESCRIPTION section from the man page:

  icontact is a perl script that takes a bunch of image files and creates
  contact sheets.  icontact determines the file format by the file name
  extension of the input files and then uses internal tables to look up
  the commands it needs to convert the images to the ppm format.  Once in
  the ppm format, icontact uses various pbmplus commands to create the
  contact sheets.  icontact is particularly useful if you have lots of
  image files in all sorts of different formats and you want to create an
  index of all of them without converting them all to a common format
  first.

  icontact is highly configurable.  It can probably do anything you would
  ever want this type of program to do - and more.  If you think of
  additional features that would be useful for a program of this type to
  do, tell me and I'll see what I can do.

  Besides perl, icontact requires the pbmplus package by Jef Poskanzer.
  The Independent JPEG Group's package (cjpeg, djpeg) is also necessary
  if you are going to be processing any JPEG files.  It should not be
  difficult to add filters from other packages as long as there is a way
  to go to and from the ppm format with them.

I hope you find icontact useful,
mark

X.SH NAME
Xicontact \- create contact sheets from images of different formats
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X\fBicontact\fP [ \fIswitches\fP ] [ { \fIimage file\fP | \fIparameter
Xfile\fP } ... ]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.PP
X\fIicontact\fP is a \fIperl\fP script that takes a bunch of image files
Xand creates contact sheets.  \fIicontact\fP determines the file format
Xby the file name extension of the input files and then uses internal
Xtables to look up the commands it needs to convert the images to the
Xppm format.  Once in the ppm format, \fIicontact\fP uses various
X\fIpbmplus\fP commands to create the contact sheets.  \fIicontact\fP is
Xparticularly useful if you have lots of image files in all sorts of
Xdifferent formats and you want to create an index of all of them
Xwithout converting them all to a common format first.
X.PP
X\fIicontact\fP is highly configurable.  It can probably do anything you
Xwould ever want this type of program to do \(em and more.  If you think
Xof additional features that would be useful for a program of this type
Xto do, tell me and I'll see what I can do.
X.PP
XBesides \fIperl\fP, \fIicontact\fP requires the \fIpbmplus\fP package
Xby Jef Poskanzer.  The Independent JPEG Group's package (\fIcjpeg\fP,
X\fIdjpeg\fP) is also necessary if you are going to be processing any
XJPEG files.  It should not be difficult to add filters from other
Xpackages as long as there is a way to go to and from the ppm format
Xwith them.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.PP
XSwitches that do not take arguments may be combined into a single
Xswitch: \fB\-abBlv\fP.  Switches that take
Xarguments must be followed by their arguments with space in between:
X\fB\-c\ 10\ \-r\ 5\fP.  The fancy way combine all these switches is:
X\fB\-abBlvc\ 10\ \-r\ 5\fP.  That is, you can combine the switches
Xtogether in any way you like so long as the switches that take an
Xargument are followed by said argument with a space in between.  If you
Xdon't want to get fancy, just specify each switch by itself:
X\fB\-a\ \-b\ \-B\ \-c\ 10\ \-l\ \-r\ 5\ \-v\fP.
X.\"
X.PP
XIn all cases in which a switch does not take an argument,
X\fB\-switch\fP will turn the switch on, and \fB+switch\fP will turn the
Xswitch off.  For example, \fB\-l\fP will turn labels on, and \fB+l\fP
Xwill turn labels off.  This can be useful if you have a particular set
Xof switches set in a configuration file and you want to temporarily
Xdisable a switch to make a sheet without changing the configuration
Xfile.  If a set of switches are combined into a single switch that
Xleads with either a \fB+\fP or a \fB\-\fP, the \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP
Xaffects all the switches in that set of switches.  If a switch that
Xtakes an argument is specified with a leading \fB+\fP, it is assumed
Xthat you meant \fB\-\fP.
X.\"
X.PP
XAn argument of \fB\-\-\fP terminates the options list and signals the
Xbeginning of the file list.
X.\"
X.PP
XSwitches can be specified in two places: the command line and a
Xconfiguration file.  The command line switches are the most potent \(em
Xthey override everything.  The switches in a configuration file are the
Xnext most potent \(em they are only overridden by the command line
Xswitches.  The internal defaults of \fIicontact\fP are overridden by
Xboth the command line and configuration file.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-a\fP
XMake the output sheets fit into the size specified with the \fB\-x\fP
Xand \fB\-y\fP switches.  Setting the \fB\-x\fP and \fB\-y\fP switches
Xto the size of your screen will yield contact sheets which are no
Xlarger than your screen.  The \fB\-r\fP and \fB\-c\fP switches will be
Xignored if the \fB\-a\fP switch is present because the number of rows
Xand columns is figured out dynamically and will probably change from
Xsheet to sheet unless the \fB\-i\fP switch is specified or all the
Xsource images are of the same size to begin with.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-B\fP
XAdd a border to each image in the contact sheet.  The colors of the border
Xstripes may be specified with the \fB\-z\fP switch.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-b\fP
XUse the \fIbasename(1)\fP of the file name instead of the whole path
Xname to the file in labels.  This switch will be ignored if the
X\fB\-l\fP switch is not specified.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-C\fP \fIcolor\fP"
XUse \fIcolor\fP for the background of the contact sheet.  The default
Xvalue is ``black''.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-c\fP \fIn\fP"
XMake the contact sheets with \fIn\fP columns of images.  This switch is
Xignored if the \fB\-a\fP switch is specified.  The default value is 7.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-D\fP \fIformat\fP"
XIf a file without a suffix is processed, assume it is a \fIformat\fP file.
XThe default value is ``.gif''.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-d\fP \fIdir\fP"
XPut the contact sheets in \fIdir\fP when completed.  The default value
Xis ``.''.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-F\fP \fIfile\fP"
X\fIfile\fP will be used with \fIpbmtext\fP as a font for labels.  Each
Ximage's height will be increased by the height of the characters in the
Xfont.  This switch will be ignored if the \fB\-l\fP switch is not
Xspecified.  By default, \fIpbmtext\fP's internal font is used.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-f\fP \fIformat\fP"
XEncode the finished contact sheets as \fIformat\fP files.
XThe default value is ``.ppm.Z''.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-g\fP
XGenerate a parameter file for each contact sheet produced.  This
Xparameter file will be named \fIprefix###.format.suffix\fP, where
X\fIprefix\fP is the contact sheet name, \fI###\fP is the number of the
Xcontact sheet, \fIformat\fP is the file format of the contact sheet,
Xand \fIsuffix\fP is the parameter file suffix specified with the
X\fB\-P\fP switch.  When \fIicontact\fP sees one of these files on the
Xcommand line, it looks in the parameter file for the names and
Xlocations of images inside the sheet specified by removing the
X\fIsuffix\fP from the parameter file name.  These images will be cut
Xout and put in the new output sheets instead of being fully processed
Xagain.  For best results when using parameter files on the command
Xline, select no quantization and a lossless file format both when the
Xsheet is first created and also when its parameter file is used on the
Xcommand line.  This will prevent information loss if this operation is
Xperformed multiple times.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\-help\fP
XThis is a special case which will print out a help message explaining
X\fIicontact\fP's switches.  Any other unrecognized switch will do the
Xsame.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-h\fP \fIn\fP"
XMake each image in the contact sheets a maximum of \fIn\fP pixels
Xhigh.  The aspect ratio of the images will not be changed.  This switch
Xwill be ignored if the \fB\-X\fP switch is also specified.  The default
Xvalue is 100.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-I\fP \fIcolor\fP"
XUse \fIcolor\fP for the area around the images when the \fB\-i\fP switch
Xis used.  This switch will be ignored if the \fB\-i\fP switch is not also
Xspecified.  The default value is ``black''.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-i\fP
XMake all of the images the same size.  The size of the images is
Xdetermined by the dimensions specified with the \fB\-w\fP and \fB\-h\fP
Xswitches.  Use of this switch can create contact sheets with lots of
Xblank space between images.  This switch cannot be used with the
X\fB\-X\fP or \fB\-Y\fP switches.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-K\fP \fIfile\fP"
XUse \fIfile\fP as the configuration file.  The default configuration
Xfile name is ``~/.icrc''.  Putting this switch in the configuration
Xfile will have no effect since once you're in a configuration file,
Xit's too late to switch to another one.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-k\fP
XDon't reference the configuration file.  Putting this switch in the
Xconfiguration file will have no effect since once you're in the
Xconfiguration file, it's too late to back out.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-L\fP
XWhen creating sheets, use left justification on the rows instead of
Xthe default center justification.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-l\fP
XAttach a label containing the image's file name below each image.  This
Xname may be truncated if the label is wider than the image.  The
Xbehavior of this switch can be changed with the \fB\-b\fP, \fB\-F\fP, and
X\fB\-T\fP switches.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-N\fP \fIvalue\fP"
XUse \fIvalue\fP as the nice value for all child processes.  The default
Xvalue is 0.  Only root may specify negative nice values.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-n\fP \fIfile\fP"
XTake the file names from \fIfile\fP and add them to the ones specified
Xon the command line, if any.  The file names in \fIfile\fP must be one
Xper line.  These file names will be processed after the file names
Xspecified on the command line.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-O\fP
XFind the number for the first sheet by looking in the destination
Xdirectory for sheets with the same prefix and format that we are going
Xto create.  Take the highest numbered one, increment, and this is the
Xnew starting number for the new sheets.  If there are no files with the
Xsame prefix and format in the destination directory, the new sheets
Xwill start with 001.  This switch cannot be used with the \fB\-o\fP
Xswitch.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-o\fP \fIn\fP"
XThe output sheet numbering will begin with \fIn\fP and increase from
Xthere.  This switch cannot be used with the \fB\-O\fP switch.  The
Xdefault value is 001.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-P\fP \fIsuffix\fP"
X\fIsuffix\fP will be used as the extension of the contact sheet
Xparameter files if the \fB\-g\fP switch is specified.  See the
X\fB\-g\fP switch description for more details.  The default value is
X``.icp''.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-p\fP \fIprefix\fP"
XName the contact sheets \fIprefix###.format\fP, where \fI###\fP is the
Xnumber of the contact sheet and \fIformat\fP is the format of the
Xcontact sheet.  The default value is ``ic\-''.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-Q\fP \fIquantization program\fP"
XUse \fIquantization program\fP to quantize the contact sheets.  The
X\fIquantization program\fP should accept ppm format files as input and
Xtake one numeric argument specifying the number of colors to be left in
Xthe contact sheets.  It is possible to use a pipeline such as: ``cjpeg
X-Q 100 | djpeg -q''.  The default value is: ``ppmquant -fs''.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-q\fP \fIn\fP"
XQuantize the contact sheets down to \fIn\fP colors.  A value of 0 will
Xturn off quantization.  The default value is 0.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-r\fP \fIn\fP"
XMake the contact sheets with \fIn\fP rows of images.  This switch is
Xignored if the \fB\-a\fP switch is specified.  The default value is 7.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-S\fP
XSort the file names taken from the command line (and, optionally, from
Xthe file specified with the \fB\-n\fP switch) into alphabetical order
Xbefore making the sheet.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-s\fP
XDon't output anything except warnings and fatal errors.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-T\fP \fIcolor\fP"
XUse \fIcolor\fP as the color of the text of the image labels.  The
Xformat of \fIcolor\fP may be any that \fIpgmtoppm\fP understands.  The
Xdefault value is ``white''.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-t\fP \fItempdir\fP"
XUse \fItempdir\fP to hold \fIicontact\fP's intermediate files.
X\fIicontact\fP tries to minimize the amount of temporary space it
Xneeds, but it's disk space requirements can be large depending upon the
Xparticular operation it is performing.  If you have a tiny /tmp
Xdirectory, you'll want to use this switch to aim \fIicontact\fP at a
Xlarger chunk of disk.  The default value is ``/tmp''.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-u\fP
XDelete duplicate entries in the list of image file names.  The first
Xfile with any particular name will make it through, but following files
Xwith the same name will be deleted from the file name list.  The
Xdefault it to allow duplicate file names.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-v\fP
XCause all sorts of possibly interesting output to be printed to the
Xscreen.  The output includes the current parameters of \fIicontact\fP
Xand all the shell commands it is running.  If you're having difficulty
Xgetting \fIicontact\fP to do what you want it to do, try using this
Xswitch to see what \fIicontact\fP is doing behind your back.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-w\fP \fIn\fP"
XMake each image in the contact sheets a maximum of \fIn\fP pixels
Xwide.  The aspect ratio of the images will not be changed.  This switch
Xwill be ignored if the \fB\-Y\fP switch is also specified.  The default
Xvalue is 100.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-X\fP
XThis switch will make all the images the same width.  Their heights
Xwill be whatever they are when the image comes out of \fIpnmscale\fP.
XThe aspect ratios of the images will not be changed.  Wide images will
Xbe short and tall images will be tall.  This switch cannot be used with
Xthe \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-Y\fP switches.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-x\fP \fIn\fP"
XWhen used with the \fB\-a\fP switch, \fIn\fP specifies the width of the
Xoutput sheets in pixels.  This switch will be ignored unless the
X\fB\-a\fP switch is specified.  The default value is 1152.
X.\"
X.IP \fB\(+-Y\fP
XThis switch will make all the images the same height.  Their widths
Xwill be whatever they are when the image comes out of \fIpnmscale\fP.
XWide images will be wide and tall images will be skinny.  The aspect
Xratios of the images will not be changed.  This switch cannot be used
Xwith the \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-X\fP switches.
X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-y\fP \fIn\fP"
XWhen used with the \fB\-a\fP switch, \fIn\fP specifies the height of
Xthe output sheets in pixels.  This switch will be ignored unless the

X.\"
X.IP "\fB\-z\fP \fIcolor [color ...]\fP"
XWhen used with the \fB-B\fP switch, the layers of the borders around
Xthe images will be striped (from the inside out) with the colors
Xspecified after this switch.  Double quotes should be used to group the
Xcolors together with whitespace in between.  The colors can be in any
Xformat that \fIppmmake\fP understands.  The default is ``white black white''.
X.\"
X.SH ENVIRONMENT
X.IP "\fBTMPDIR, TEMPDIR\fP"
XThese environment variables can be used to set the location of
X\fIicontact\fP's temporary directory.  If both \fBTMPDIR\fP and
X\fBTEMPDIR\fP are set, a warning will be printed and the value of

Xfollowing keywords:  \fBencode\fP, \fBdecode\fP, \fBswitches\fP, or
X\fBquantize\fP.  Lines beginning with \fBencode\fP are used to define
Xcommands \fIicontact\fP will use to encode files into a specific
Xformat.  Lines beginning with \fBdecode\fP are used to define commands
X\fIicontact\fP will use to decode files of a specific format.  Lines

X.SH DIAGNOSTICS
XThe diagnostic messages are intended to be self explanatory.  If
X\fIicontact\fP dies and tells you that a pipeline returned an
Xunsuccessful exit code and you can't tell what caused the crash, try
Xrunning the same command with the \fB\-v\fP switch.  You should then be
Xable to see what part of the pipeline was not successful.

X.SH BUGS
X.PP
XIf an image's file name has ``.'''s in it that do not come before a
Xrecognized file format extension, the unrecognized extensions will be
Xignored and \fIicontact\fP will try to decode the image using the
Xremaining extensions.  It may guess wrong, though, and the decode
Xcommand may fail.
X.PP
X\fIicontact\fP allows you to specify stupid output formats like
X``.gif.Z''.
X.PP
XWhen in automatic sheet sizing mode (\fB\-a\fP), if a single processed
Ximage is larger than the dimensions of a sheet, this image will appear
Xin a sheet all by itself, and the sheet will be larger than you
Xspecified with \fB\-x\fP and \fB\-y\fP.
X.PP
X\fIicontact\fP will most likely fail if it is used on filenames that
Xcontain whitespace.
X.PP
XWhen images are cut out of previously made contact sheets by specifying
Xa parameter file on the command line, they are not rescaled.  So, even
Xthough you may have specified \fB\-w 100 \-h 100\fP this time, the
Ximages cut from the previously made contact sheet will be the same size
Xthey were when that sheet was first made.  This shouldn't be a problem for
Xyou if you choose an image size early and stick with it.
