XI'm not around on the Internet as much as I'd like--my address keeps shifting
Xaround.  I know one guy had a problem with this (granted, he flew off all
Xkindsa shit my way about it, but...), so I decided to throw in a file about
Xhow to get ahold of me.
X
XMy name is Richard Jernigan... and I _do_ do support for MetalBase.  Once you
Xreach me anyway... the aforementioned guy seemed to think I should've read his
Xmind and written him.  Reach me, and I'll fix it.  With 4.0+, there've been
Xvery few requests for service... and all those that were have turned out to
Xjust be implementation problems (ie, _my_ code worked.  Nya nya nya).  If
Xyou're just dying to get a hold of me, and everything else fails, write me:

X            Norris TN 37828
X
XOkay, so you don't wanna do that.  Well, you've got a lot of options with
Xregard to getting me on the Internet... if you're looking for me over the
X
Xsummer of '92, I'll be at.....................t-richj@microsoft.com
XNice, eh?  Otherwise, try the default.........virtual!richid@owlnet.rice.edu
XAnd, if that's gone, odds are this is too.....richid@owlnet.rice.edu
XHummm... then you're in trouble.  How about...uunet!mwcbbs!virtual!richid
X
XOne of those should work.  Look for me on rec.games.programmer or sci.
Xvirtual-worlds... when I've got an active net account, I usually post there.
X
XGood luck.  :)

X
XVR and SAMPLE require a curses package to run; MS-DOS users can get a public
Xdomain curses package for VR and SAMPLE via anonymous ftp from
X
X   archive.umich.edu     as   /msdos/screen/pccurses.arc
X   wuarchive.wustl.edu   as   /systems/msdos/umich.edu/screen/pccurses.arc
X
Xif you cannot reach either domain, contact me and I'll forward my copy to you.
XThese people have no idea I'm using their address, so do be kind to the sites
Xand don't call until it's late local time.  The package is rather nice; a bit
Xof a bitch to set up initially, but it's a good implementation of curses. Only
Xthing I've had a problem with is its standout()/standend() commands; they
Xdon't work right for me.  Better luck to you.
X
X [  If you get the package from wolfen, you may need to change <alloc.h>     ]
X [  to <malloc.h> in curses.h... for some god-forsaken reason, they use      ]
X [  the old name for the thing.  The package comes with sources as well as   ]
X [  Xcurses.lib, for every model, but DON'T USE THE PRE-BUILD LIBRARIES!     ]
X [  Recompile 'em first or you'll get a problem with "@F_LDIV is undefined". ]
X [  Nasty.  I don't know -what- compiler they were made with... if you can   ]
X [  find out, lemme know.                                                    ]
X
XIf you're using MS-DOS to access a Unix-style server, ANSI.SYS may not cut
Xit for you.  Try replacing it with VT52.SYS and using term type vt52 on your
Xunix platform; that may help.
