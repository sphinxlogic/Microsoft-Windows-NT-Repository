Submitted-by: hugh@nsmdserv.cnd.hp.com (Hugh F. Mahon)
Posting-number: Volume 35, Issue 123
Archive-name: ee/patch01
Environment: SYSV, SunOS, Curses
Patch-To: ee: Volume 35, Issue 80-84

Some defects were reported by people who built EasyEdit ("ee").  It also 
became clear that other things could be done to make ee easier to build.

Known defects:

	1. ee core dumped on exit or write of file when no file name given 
	   when starting ee
	2. ee core dumped when 'ispell' was chosen in spell menu
	3. ee could core dump during format of a paragraph
	4. ee could read a file twice after an error occurred when 
	   multiple files given on command line

The curses alternative, new_curse.c was modified to remove dependence on 
-DSUN for some platforms.

The Makefile was modified to provide information in an easier to 
understand way.

The following patch fixes the known deficiencies.

To use the patch, unpack it from the shar file, then use the 'patch' 
utility, avaliable from many ftp archive sites (such as wuarchive.wustl.edu) 
if you don't already have it.  It is a valuable tool to have.
