System: mailagent version 2.9
Patch #: 19

Subject: documents translation of '-' into '_' within host name
Subject: make sure host name does not have any '-' in it

Description:
	Undo fix made by previous patch: '-' is NOT allowed in a perl
	variable name, so it is incorrect to allow it in the ~/.mailagent.
	The problem is that some machine name do bear '-' in them. So
	now the filter translates any '-' into '_' and machine specific
	paths must be sepcified with that translation in mind. This
	means if your machine name is 'the-ring', then you must specify
	the PATH for that machine in variable 'p_the_ring'.

	Note that only the filter program was modified by this patch.
	Therefore, there is no need to let 'make' perform the full test
	suite if it already passed at patch #18.

Repeat-By:

	If you machine had a '-' into it, then it did not pass the test
	suite, failing at basic/config for PL < 17 and failing in
	basic/mailagent for PL 18.

	Once this patch has been applied, it should pass all the tests.
	Do NOT forget to update the filter program if you had a private
	setuid copy in your own account.

Fix:	From rn, say "| patch -p -N -d DIR", where DIR is your mailagent source
	directory.  Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch -p -N <thisarticle".
	If you don't have the patch program, apply the following by hand,
	or get patch (version 2.0, latest patchlevel).

	After patching:
		Configure -d
		make depend
		make
		make install
		make install.man

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel.h file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

	If you are missing previous patches they can be obtained from me:

		Raphael Manfredi <ram@eiffel.com>

	If you send a mail message of the following form it will greatly speed
	processing:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailpatch PATH mailagent 2.9 LIST
			   ^ note the c

	where PATH is a return path FROM ME TO YOU either in Internet notation,
	or in bang notation from some well-known host, and LIST is the number
	of one or more patches you need, separated by spaces, commas, and/or
	hyphens.  Saying 35- says everything from 35 to the end.

	To get some more detailed instructions, send me the following mail:

		Subject: Command
		@SH mailhelp PATH
